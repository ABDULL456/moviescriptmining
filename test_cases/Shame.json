{"train": "SHAME \nWritten by \nSteve McQueen & Abi Morgan \nINT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. DAWN. \nBRANDON SULLIVAN [early 30's] lies staring up caught in a disarray of sheets until- \nThe PEEP PEEP PEEP of an alarm clock, from deep within a distant apartment. \nThe MUFFLED PAD of FOOTSTEPS crossing overhead- \nBRANDON listens then gets up, pulls blinds and heads out towards the bathroom- \nThe SOUND of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor. \nThe MURMUR of an answer phone as we hear BRANDON peeing, in a far off bathroom. \n2   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                    2 \nBRANDON stands, looking down, watching until- \nA SUDDEN breeze, the subway train oncoming- \nBRANDON boards. \nThe doors GLIDE SHUT- \nBRANDON just visible through the window of the train, walking towards a distant seat. \n3   INT. TRAIN. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                    3 \nBRANDON   sits, eyes casually tracing over the faces in the crowded   train. A HOMELESS MAN sits, further along the car, haggard   and grey, and sleeping, the seat empty, either side of him.   He looks more like a pile of clothes. \nBRANDON turns back. The reflection of an PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL caught in the glass opposite. \n4   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                                 4 \nBRANDON padding naked along a corridor. He flicks on an answer machine in passing- \nFEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE Hey...It's me?...Pick Up.. Pick Up... \nHe enters the bathroom. \n5   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                               5 \nWe hear BRANDON peeing in the bathroom. \n6   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                               6 \nThe answer machine message drowned by the flushing of the toilet, the shutting of the door and the shower being switched on. \n7   INT. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                         7 \nA HOMELESS MAN head lolling, sat alone at the end of a busy car. \nBRANDON considers, catching the eye of- \nA PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL seated opposite, the whisper of a smile, grazing her lips. \nBRANDON's eyes teasing over- \nThe fall of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's hair- \nThe dip in her collarbone- \nHer nail polish with French manicure- \nBRANDON looks at her. She looks away. \nBRANDON resumes staring. She looks back through the bodies of commuters. We see their eyes looking at each other. Their seduction continues through the collage of colors and bodies. \n8   INT. OFFICE - BOARDROOM. DAY.                                 8 \nBRANDON, sits in a packed meeting room, a pitch just audible, DAVID FISHER, [early/ late 40's] BRANDON's boss, a kind of white noise, and yet- \nDAVID (O.S.) I find you disgusting..I find you inconsolable..I find you invasive.. \nFEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) Brandon? \nBRANDON crosses the hall and enters the toilet. \nFEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) Brandon? \nBRANDON turns on the light, puts down his glass and urinates. \nFEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) (whispers) Brandon Where are you?- Brandon? Brandon? (louder) Brandon... Urghhh! \nBRANDON finishes, flushes toilet, steps off screen \nFEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) This is me Calling you.. (SIGHS) Fuck! \nDEAD TONE \nThe CALLER hangs up \nBRANDON re-appears and closes the bathroom door \n12   INT. BATHROOM. APARTMENT. DAWN.                           12 \nBRANDON in the shower, a sense of movement, his hand, barely visible, moving back and forth. \nThe fall of the shower- \nBRANDON stands, letting the water wash over him. \n13   INT. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                        13 \nBRANDON sits, looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting opposite- \nThe train moves on, after a while stopping at another platform. \nPEOPLE get on, PEOPLE get off. \nBRANDON's eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's legs and up- \nShe opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep between her thighs- \nShe looks up, senses BRANDON watching. She lets her fingers fall in her lap. \nBRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look through the crowd. Suddenly she stands and makes her way to the train door. Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole for stability, revealing a wedding ring. \nBRANDON's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he stands behind her. There is a gentle unison contact. BRANDON's breath, heavy on her neck. Both are frozen to the spot, caught in a mutual moment. \n14   INT. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                        14 \nThe train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL disembarks. BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL. \nBRANDON is several paces behind now, pursues. She turns left into a stairwell. \nIt's almost like fighting a downward river. People are walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL. \nThe tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs. A moment later, BRANDON reaches the summit, to be greeted by a wrought-iron gate. \nHe looks left at one staircase. People ascend. \nHe looks right at another staircase. Other passengers ascend. \nPeople come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand side. He has lost her. A sudden moment of disappointment crosses his face. \nHe descends the staircase, dejected. \n15   INT. OFFICE. DAY.                                            15 \nBRANDON walks into his office and to his desk, stops in his tracks, heart thumping- \nA bare space where BRANDON's computer once was and next to it a replacement computer. A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck to the screen. \n16   INT. CUBICLE. MEN'S TOILETS. OFFICE. DAY.                    16 \nBRANDON walks into a toilet cubicle, shuts and locks the door. He cleans the seat with toilet paper, flushes, stands, and starts to masturbate. \n17   INT. OFFICE - DAVID'S OFFICE. DAY.                           17 \nA TAP on the door- \nBRANDON enters DAVID's office, DAVID is lost in paperwork, looking up from his desk. \nCUTE NEIGHBOR (in greeting) Hey. \nBRANDON (nods) Hey. \nBRANDON juggling cellphone, keys and satchel, heading off to work, watching the sway of her ass. \n24   INT. OFFICE - BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                       24 \nMARIANNE is on the phone in a busy office \n25   INT. HOTEL ROOM. BRANDON'S FANTASY.                        25 \nProfile of MARIANNE's bare back. \n26   INT. OFFICE - BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                       26 \nBRANDON, seemingly in a trance, looking out across the office, eyes fixed on MARIANNE in her glass cubicle, unaware of BRANDON staring. \nSTEVEN's reflection in the window, we see him screw up a piece of paper and throw it at BRANDON. \nBRANDON shakes his head. \nBRANDON You're such a dick \nSTEVEN (O.S.) What are you doing, man? \nBRANDON once again looks up toward MARIANNE. \n27   INT. OFFICE. DAY.                                           27 \nMARIANNE on the phone. \nDAVID now appears in front of BRANDON. From afar, nods to him, and greets a group of CLIENTS. \nDAVID (WHISTLES) Alright, gentlemen, If you'll just please make yourselves at home. \nCLIENT Thank you. \n28   INT. OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY.                         28 \nJust visible, in the conference room- \nBRANDON inside with the CLIENTS and DAVID. A sense of camaraderie. The meeting at an end. DAVID, slapping BRANDON on the back, the sense of celebration. \nDAVID (O.S.) It falls upon me, as your beloved boss, to propose a toast. To Success. \n29   INT. AFTER WORK BAR. NIGHT.                                 29 \nThe thump of music- \nBRANDON, DAVID and OTHERS wedged in a leather booth, several shots and beer down, the table littered with beers. Cheers. Male camaraderie. \nDAVID I hope my wife appreciates it. \nALL chink glasses \nDAVID (CONT'D) Get a new tie, please. \nCOLLEAGUES (snigger) \nDAVID Oh my goodness. (SNIFFS) I love women in suits.

Blue or green? \nThe SUITED WOMAN closes her eyes, the flutter of her lashes oddly fragile, in waiting until- \nDAVID I like games, I like this game. Blue.. (sudden change of tac) Green. Green, it's green. \nThey spring open to reveal brown eyes- \nDAVID hesitates, throws his arms up, resigned. \nDAVID (CONT'D) That's Brown. That's.. I don't know how you change the colour of your eyes like that. How do you do that so quickly? \nELIZABETH (OVER) Wow. Wow. \nDAVID That's amazing. That's a real talent. \nELIZABETH Yeah, detail man.

AFTER WORK BAR. NIGHT.                                 32 \nDAVID struggling to push his arm through the twisted sleeve of his jacket, pursuing ELIZABETH and her friends up the street. \nDAVID Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. Hold on, hold on. No, listen. I just got to talk to you one more time, one more time. Listen.. \nBRANDON comes out of the club, doing up his coat. Looks away at DAVID haranguing the trio. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Your eyes, they're beautiful. You know why I didn't get it right the first time? Because it's, it's like a collage. Let me see your hand, let me see your hand.. \nDAVID smiles, gently coaxing her in the opposite direction- \nBRANDON hails a cab. DAVID continues haranguing ELIZABETH \nDAVID (CONT'D) Look at those eyes, look at those eyes. I know the color of your eyes. \nBRANDON (OVER) David, come on. \nDAVID Come on, we can play that game. That's so much fun when you play that game. \nLOREN Bye. \nA cab pulls up. \nDAVID It's okay. `cos I'm going this way. \nBRANDON opens the cab door and waits with the taxi. DAVID walks towards BRANDON. \nBRANDON Hey man, he's going uptown. \nDAVID concedes throwing his arms up, jacket half on. DAVID paws BRANDON affectionately, straightens BRANDON's jacket, gives him a kiss and stumbles into the cab. \nDAVID (Laughs) Ok. \nBRANDON I'll see you tomorrow \nThe cab pulls away. \n33   EXT. STREET. NEAR AFTER WORK BAR. NIGHT.                     33 \nA car glides close to the kerb- \nBRANDON head down walking- \nELIZABETH Hey.

NIGHT.                                 34 \nThe incessant drone of cars, steady overhead- \nVast concrete supports edging the highway- \nBRANDON presses ELIZABETH flat again the grit of the wall \nCaught in the scissored half light, they move, with glorious abandon- \nBRANDON shakes his head, at a loss. \nBRANDON Shampoo \nSISSY (OVER) Is it for grooming dogs? \nSISSY throws the towel and BRANDON \nSISSY (CONT'D) Good to see you. \nBRANDON throws the towel back at her. \nBRANDON Lock the door next time. \nSISSY Yeah. \nBRANDON turns to leave the room \nBRANDON Don't use all the towels \nSISSY I won't. \nBRANDON closes the door to the bathroom. \n39   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       39 \nWe follow BRANDON as he walks through to the living room to the record player I Feel Love stuck in eternal groove. He gently lifts the needle off the record. He uses the baseball bat to pick up SISSY's scarf. He sniffs it. \nSilence- \nBRANDON stands considers- \n40   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           40 \nLater - \nBRANDON is watching pornography on his laptop, hears SISSY on the telephone. He listens. \nSISSY ..I want you. I don't want anyone else.

MORNING.                         43 \nBRANDON sliding whisked eggs into a pan of sizzling butter- \nSISSY enters and sits on the kitchen counter, wearing a long- sleeved white t-shirt and holding the earring left by the Pretty Woman [prostitute]. Dangling it in front of BRANDON- \nSISSY Morning. Nice earring. Hot date? \nHiding his surprise, BRANDON gets some juice out of the fridge, passes it to SISSY. \nBRANDON Juice? \nBRANDON gives SISSY a carton of juice. Still sitting on the counter, SISSY grabs it with both hands, almost like a child's bottle and starts drinking. \nSISSY Mmm. \nBRANDON, irritated, says abruptly- \nSISSY sprinkles salt on her breakfast. She smile, playful, resumes eating- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (Reacting to food) Mmm. Mmmm! (SHOUTS) So good.! \nThe door slams. SISSY sighs and stares towards the front door, a sadness hanging- \n44   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. MORNING.                              44 \nSISSY stands, toes edging over the platform.   BRANDON pulls her back. \nBRANDON Stop fucking around. \nSISSY stares at BRANDON. Instinctively, BRANDON feels her gaze. He turns and looks. They hold each other's eyes for more than a beat. BRANDON turns away. SISSY begins picking pieces of fluff off BRANDON's shoulder. BRANDON, visually irritated. \nSISSY goes again. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Leave it. \nSISSY You have fluff. \nBRANDON I like it there. \nA quick moment passes. BRANDON picks the fluff off his shoulder and puts it on SISSY's shoulder - to her amusement. \nSISSY (LAUGHS) \nBRANDON How are you for money? \nSISSY I'm good. \nBRANDON Cause if you need some money. \nSISSY Honestly, I even make money now and everything. \nBRANDON Yeah, sure. \nSISSY Huge amounts. \nBRANDON nods at SISSY's hat. \nBRANDON Are you collecting mad hats? \nSissy smiles- \nSISSY (LAUGHS) You should come and hear me. \nBRANDON Yeah. I will. \nSISSY `Yeah I will', like, `yeah I will' like last time? Please come. \nBRANDON takes off her hat. \nBRANDON Where'd you get this, anyway. \nSISSY It's vintage. \nBRANDON Yeah, I can see that. \nSISSY (LAUGHS) \nSISSY takes the hat and puts it on BRANDON. \nSISSY (CONT'D) Wow. \nBRANDON (WHISPERS) Do you like? \nBRANDON adjusts the hat. \nSISSY Yeah. \nSISSY gently bumps his shoulder with hers. \nSISSY (CONT'D) Please come. \nBRANDON Ok. I will. \nSISSY stamps her feet excitedly. \nSISSY Yaay! \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) Are melting away... \nFingers touching the keys once more, masterfully picking up and improvising with the last few bars- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York.. \nSISSY leans back. She is on fire now, singing with every fibre of her heart and soul, like no other rendition heard. \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere It's up to you- \nSISSY holds BRANDON with a voice, a sudden flickering emotion threatening to topple her, somehow in SISSY's hands this song is heartbreaking... \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) New   york New york (quieter now) New   York..New York.. (even quieter) New   york New york (almost to a whisper) New   york New york. \nSISSY strikes one last note, lost deep within herself- \nHUSHED SILENCE- \nDAVID Wow. Wow! Bravo! \nSudden APPLAUSE, CHEERS, OVERWHELMING- \nDAVID turns to BRANDON \nDAVID (CONT'D) (LAUGHS) She's good! She's good! \nBRANDON looks away, eyes filling with tears. \nBRANDON puts down his drink, blotting his coaster with the imprint of the deep red rim of his glass- \nHe's the only one not applauding. \n50   INT. BOOM BOOM ROOM. NIGHT.                                  50 \nSISSY is being congratulated by a HIP MEDIA TYPE and his WIFE. The scene is one of congratulations, SISSY is admired. \nSISSY confident approaches DAVID and BRANDON. She is bold and self-aware. \nDAVID Hi. \nSISSY Hi. \nDAVID I'm David. \nSISSY Sissy. \nDAVI It's a pleasure to meet you. \nSISSY Nice to meet you. \nDAVID (OVER) I think you were fantastic and you look great in the dress, too.

NIGHT.                         51 \nBRANDON wedged in the back of the cab, with DAVID and SISSY as they are lost eating one another's faces. \nLooking uncomfortable, BRANDON frequently takes glimpses in the rear view mirror. \nDAVID and SISSY continue making out. It's almost animal. \n52   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                     52 \nA dimly lit street- \nA cab is pulling up. DAVID opens the door. \nDAVID I've got it, I've got it.

How did that work? \nSISSY Get off me. \nSISSY starts to enter thru the revolving door. DAVID follows \nDAVID Ah come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... \nBRANDON is left alone to pay the driver. \nA lone condom disregarded on the floor. \nWe see his bedside drawer ajar. \nHe walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut. \n59   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             59 \nLater - \nBRANDON lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight on. \nSISSY enters.

Snuggles up to BRANDON \nBRANDON I have to be up and out by seven. \nSISSY inhales through her teeth. \nSISSY (to herself) It's cold. \nUncomfortable SILENCE- \nBRANDON Sissy, get out of my room? \nSISSY doesn't move. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Sissy, get out of my room. \nAll this time, BRANDON has not looked at SISSY, staring up to the blank ceiling. He SCREAMS at the top of his lungs- \nBRANDON (CONT'D) GET THE FUCK OUT! GET OUT! \nSISSY gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and slowly walks around the bed. \nSISSY SLAMS the bedroom door on her exit. \n60   INT. OFFICE.

NIGHT.                              63 \nBRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back to the main road. \nThe glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond. \n64   EXT. NEAR STANDARD HOTEL. NIGHT.                             64 \nAbove, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny still lives. \nBRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans. Above him, engraved in stone is \"1949.\" He looks up toward the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin building. Stark and authoritative. \nA KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away. \nA WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass. \nA MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up. \nA FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy duster. \nAnd then BRANDON sees her- \nA MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up fuck. \nBRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above- \nA CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING- \nBRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back to himself. \n65   EXT. STREET. NEAR RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                         65 \nA distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street- \nMARIANNE waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink, clearly there for some time. Her eyes checking the room, with quiet concern. \nBRANDON stands watching from a distance- \nBRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter until- \n66   INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                                      66 \nBRANDON enters the restaurant. \nBRANDON Hi. \nMARIANNE Hello- \nBRANDON Hello. (LAUGHS) \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Did you find it okay? \nMARIANNE Yes, I'm glad you made it. \nBRANDON Oh, yeah. I'm late. Sorry. \nBRANDON sits down at the table where MARIANNE is already seated. \nMARIANNE You look handsome. \nBRANDON You look amazing. \nA WAITER enters. \nBRANDON Er.. I have a sister. \nMARIANNE I have two. \nBRANDON Oh, yeah? \nMARIANNE Yeah. \nBRANDON Older, younger? \nMARIANNE Older and younger. I'm in the middle. \nBRANDON stares at MARIANNE \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) What? \nBRANDON Just wondering. \nMARIANNE (LAUGHS) are you nervous? \nBRANDON Why would I be nervous? \nMARIANNE smiles, holds his look. \nMARIANNE You look a little nervous. \nBRANDON Do I? No. \nMARIANNE Well, what's a date? \nBRANDON shrugs- \nBRANDON It's no big deal. \nMARIANNE It took me an hour to figure out what to wear. \nBRANDON You chose wisely. \nMARIANNE shrugs, smiles- \nBRANDON laughs- \nThe WAITER returns- \nWAITER I forgot to say the crab comes in the shell. \nBRANDON Great. \nThe WAITER pauses, expectantly. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Oh. Yeah... I haven't even looked at this. \nMARIANNE Erm, I'll have the lamb. \nThe WAITER scrawls it down on a pad, barely looking up. \nWAITER The Lamb. \nBRANDON I'll have the Lamb too. That sounds great. \nMARIANNE (LAUGHS) \nWAITER Erm, No appetizer? \nBRANDON (looking to MARIANNE) You want-? \nMARIANNE shrugs, closes her menu. \nMARIANNE I'm fine. \nBRANDON No. \nWAITER OK, and how would you like the lamb? \nBRANDON Medium. \nWAITER We recommend it pretty pink. \nThe WAITER waits- \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) OK. Well, this is me. \nBRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet- \nBRANDON This is you. \nThey stand heady from the wine and a little awkward. \nMARIANNE Thank you very much Brandon. \nBRANDON Thank you very much MARIANNE. We should do this again. \nSILENCE \nThey loiter on the edge of something more. \nMARIANNE Right. \nSILENCE \nBRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway, with a half wave. \nBRANDON So, is that a yes? \nMARIANNE (O.S.) Maybe, yeah. \n69   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             69 \nThe CLICK of the door- \nBRANDON enters. The sound of the record player, which had finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable. \nPulling off his jacket- \nBRANDON Hello? Sissy? \nSILENCE- \nBRANDON puts the needle back in it's dock. HE hangs up his jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room. He spies all SISSY's crap spilling out across the floor- \nHe sighs. \nHeads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge. \n70   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             70 \nThe lock of the front door rotates. Someone is entering the apartment. \nDarkness- \nSISSY bursts through the door, in a hurry. \nAfter a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of light into the darkness. \nFrom the blackness we see BRANDON framed, masturbating in front of the bathroom sink. \nSISSY, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door handle, transfixed by a naked BRANDON. \nAs BRANDON instinctively turns, SISSY runs from view. \nSISSY slams the door shut. \nBRANDON (O.S.) Oh! Fuck! \nSISSY (SNIGGERS) Fuck! \nBRANDON looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and bewilderment and deep embarrassment. \nSlowly but surely these expressions turn into rage. He hits the wall in frustration. \nSISSY (CONT'D) Fuck! \n71   INT. LIVING ROOM CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                71 \nBRANDON opens the bathroom door, with towel tied around his waist, looking for SISSY. \nBRANDON What? Are you fucking spying on me? \nSISSY (LAUGHS) Lock the fucking door, Brandon. \nSISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued- \nSuddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a woman legs splayed- \nFROM SCREEN Hey, where's Brandon? Are you Brandon's girlfriend? Do you want to play? \nSISSY looks closer, mildly appalled. \nFROM SCREEN (CONT'D) Do you wanna play with my tits? I know Brandon would really like it.. And I know exactly what Brandon likes. \nBRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom. \nSISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment. \n74   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              74 \nLATER- \nThe thump of music- \nBRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder, hands grasping his hair. Then suddenly he enters the whole contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag. \nThen, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone numbers on the back. \nBRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts. \nHe moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the floor. He picks it up, moving on. \n75   INT. KITCHEN. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              75 \nAn open fridge- \nBRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by date mush into the bag. \nCans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an old joint, magazines all get dumped on route. \nBRANDON heads out, picking up more detritus along the way, old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones- \nA pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads down along the corridor. \n76   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                          76 \nBRANDON strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers smelling and cracked from under a chair. He peers up, looks around the room almost bare- \nHis laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers, initially resistant and then something finally compels him to do it- \nHe picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall. Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff. Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the heaving bag of crap out into the corridor. \nThe SLAM of the front door- \n77   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       77 \nBRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up along the street in waiting for collection. \nFurther down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk. \nA SIREN goes past- \nThe DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS. \nBRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door firmly. \n78   INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  78 \nBRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable. \nSuddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately. \nShe responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She surrenders. \nThey pull away, looking at one another. She smiles, laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on. \nBRANDON Come on. \nBRANDON leads MARIANNE away. \n79   EXT. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                                  79 \nBRANDON and MARIANNE stepping out of a cab, BRANDON leading MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping. \nBRANDON I don't want to talk. Try not talking. Try just listening or thinking for a change. \nSISSY Yeah, `cos that's working great for you. You're completely fine. \nBRANDON Well, I've got my own fucking apartment. \nSISSY Oh, whopee-fucking-shit. You have your own apartment, that's amazing. Your job and an apartment, I should be in awe of you. \nBRANDON Well, at least I'm responsible for it. At least I don't depend on people all the time. You know, you're a dependency, you're a parasite. \nSISSY You don't have anybody. You don't have anybody. You have me and your fucking pervert boss. \nBRANDON You slept with that fucking pervert boss. So what does that make you? \nSISSY DOn't talk to me about sex-life Brandon. Not from you. \nBRANDON Whatever. \nBRANDON makes his way to the closet, taking his coat. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) I'm going out. \nSISSY Great. And then you'll just come back and we'll just have this same fucking conversation again. \nBRANDON No, you'll move out. \nSISSY And then I'll never hear from you again? \nBRANDON exits the apartment. \n88   INT.SUBWAY TRAIN. NIGHT                                    88 \nBRANDON's reflection in the window as the train travels. \nWe see that BRANDON has a nasty cut on his cheek. \n89   INT. BAR. NIGHT.                                           89 \nEarlier that night- \nBRANDON sits, drinks alone at the bar- \nAn OLDER GUY paws a GAUNT YOUNG WOMAN plying her with drinks, knocking them back much to his delight. \nBRANDON watches, catching the eye of a girl (CARLY) walking towards the bar, her friends playing pool- \nCARLY Hey- \nBRANDON Hey. \nCARLY smiles, as she leans against the bar, her breasts spilling out of her T-shirt. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) (close to) You want to get out of here? \nCARLY giggles- \nBRANDON (CONT'D) I could take you somewhere. \nCARLY looks over at her MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND just visible across the bar talking to a couple of GUYS. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) What? Are you with someone? Does he go down on you? I do..That's what I like to do.. \nCARLY looks at him, sobering and yet- \nBRANDON's hand discreetly reaches down, up and under the girl's skirt, shocking her a little and yet- \nBRANDON (CONT'D) I like the way it feels. I like the way it's just me and it... I wanna taste you. I like to slip my tongue inside you- \nCARLY leans in closer, her lips blotting the edge of a glass overfilled with beer. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) ...just as you come. \nCARLY hesitates, the moment hangs dangerous between them. BRANDON sucks his fingers. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Want me to make you come? \nBRANDON (CONT'D) I can do that. Want me to do that? \nBRANDON strokes her chin- \nThe SCREECH of horns- \nBRANDON ignores them, he crosses streets, traffic, darting off the sidewalk into the road, when human, dog or stroller gets in his way until- \n92   EXT. STREET. NIGHT.                                         92 \nBRANDON walking past a blur of yellow Neon and glow of shop signs- \nAcross the street, a snaking queue of MEN wait in line outside a club. \nHe keeps walking, eyes scouring- \nTEENAGERS loiter, in oversized clothes, sunk under caps and hoods. \n93   EXT. STREET NEAR CLUB. NIGHT.                               93 \nA lively bar; a couple of HOT GIRLS entering- \nBRANDON considers, goes to enter, barred by BOUNCERS, who point him back along the cue- \nHe stands in line- \nAcross the street, a THICK SET GUY eyes him. He stands smoking outside a heaving bar. BRANDON looks away- \nA GANG OF GIRLS pass, The BOUNCERS let them in with ease. BRANDON reaches for his iPhone, tries to cover his face with his phone to get into the club- \nBOUNCER Woah! Not tonight, buddy. \nBRANDON ties to get in again. The BOUNCER stops him a second time. \nBOUNCER (CONT'D) I said not tonight. \nThe THICK SET GUY over the street, flicks out his cigarette, eyes grazing over BRANDON as he re-enters the heaving bar opposite. \nBRANDON considers, hands sunk deep in his pockets. \nThrough the glass a heaving bar. BRANDON considers, on the edge until- \nHe suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi streaking past. \n94   INT. CLUB. NIGHT.                                            94 \nFluorescent light skimming the thick black darkness like a beam on a lighthouse- \nA heaving dance floor of BUTCH BEARS, SKINNY BOYS, and TWIGS, arms raised, dancing to the pulse of music. \nThe THICK SET GUY, walks away, waiting for BRANDON to follow. \nBRANDON follows. \n95   INT. CLUB. LABYRINTH. NIGHT.                                 95 \nPassing through a low hung door, BRANDON moves along a dark labyrinth of corridors, eyes grazing over- \nDimly lit crevices, MEN caught briefly in light, lost in fellatio and stand up fucking- \nBRANDON keeps walking, drawn towards a dark doorway- \n96   INT. BACKROOM. CLUB. NIGHT.                                  96 \nAn endless darkness, punctured with groans from dark cubicles- \nBRANDON hesitates, foot slipping on the moist floor. \nSuddenly a hand reaches out, drawing him into the dark cubicle- \nThe THICK SET GUY presses BRANDON up against the wall, kissing him, tongue searching his mouth, rubbing along its roof, hungry and urgent. \nBRANDON pulls away, hands gently yet forcefully pushing the THICK SET GUY down on his knees. \nBRANDON looks beyond- \nA THIN BOY down on his knees sucking a cock through a hole between walls. \nBRANDON stands, legs splayed letting the THICK SET GUY take him in his mouth. He is beautiful. \nThe palm of BRANDON's hand pressed against the side of the cubicle. He stands, fucking the THICK SET GUY in the mouth- \nThe PULSE of music heaving, the club rocking, punctured by groans and grunts of rough sex from deep within. \nAn old New York POST. \nGraffiti on all the car windows. \nThey wait. \nSuddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way through the carriage that BRANDON's in, with the CONDUCTOR ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end. \nCONDUCTOR (O.S.) Watch your step between cars. \nPassengers asking, \"What's going on?\" \nBRANDON finally makes his way down with the other passengers to the last carriage. As he steps out, he looks down to his far left and sees a POLICE CAUTION LINE being unraveled, and ENGINEERS and FIREMEN making their way to the far front of the train. \n102   INT. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                          102 \nA LARGE BLACK WOMAN, face bowed, sits talking to a POLICE OFFICER giving a statement- \nCONDUCTOR Watch your step. \nSeveral ENGINEERS stand further down the platform surrounding a TRAUMATISED DRIVER- \nCONDUCTOR Follow, me please. Follow me. \nTwo PLATFORM ATTENDANTS talk to POLICE OFFICERS. \nCONDUCTOR (CONT'D) Watch your step. This way. This way. Quickly \nFEMALE CONDUCTOR This way. Nothing to see. Move on. \nCONDUCTOR (O.S.) (OVER) Right this way, please. \nFEMALE CONDUCTOR Move on. This way. \nBRANDON makes his way past the wrought-iron gate with other passengers, going up the stairwell. \n103   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE SUBWAY. DAWN.                          103 \nBRANDON climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes catching on- \nA WOMAN's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room, discarded. BRANDON picks up his pace. \nThe intermittent WHIR of sirens- \nBRANDON emerging from the subway, already reaching for his cellphone- \nBeyond the glow of an ambulance- \nBRANDON keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly distracted. He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his ear. \nThe PULSE of a distant phone ringing- \nThe answer machine kicks in- \nANSWER MACHINE This is Sissy..leave a message.. Don't if you're an asshole. \nBRANDON flicks it off, slips it back in his pocket. BRANDON picks up his pace. \nHe flicks out his phone again. Tries again- \nANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D) This is Sissy..leave a me- \nBRANDON is running now, heart beating fast now, breath quickening, a seeping panic threatening to unleash- \nBRANDON Shit! \nSUDDENLY he makes a dash for it, weaving through the sidewalk at pace. \n104   INT.

DAWN. \nExiting, BRANDON heads along the faceless corridor, reaching his front door. \n", "test1_input": "He turns right abruptly, pass the coffee area, and then right again. A COLLEAGUE is coming out of a door. He holds it open for BRANDON as he walks in. The door slowly closes, exposing the MEN'S sign for the bathroom. \n48   INT. BOOM BOOM ROOM - COATCHECK. NIGHT.                   48 \nBRANDON and DAVID, not knowing what is to await them, walk towards the doors of the beautiful setting of THE BOOM BOOM ROOM. \nDAVID That elevator music's like a bad acid trip. \nHOSTESS (O.S.) Good evening. \nBRANDON Evening. Er.. Reservation. Sullivan? \nHOSTESS Great. I have you on the list.

NIGHT.                                  49 \nBRANDON and DAVID enter a beautiful bar. A spectacular 180 degree view of Manhattan. The room has the most elegant decor. It is to die for: \nMetropolis meets Blade Runner, a glittering New York skyline to the North of the room, the grey endless black of the Hudson River to the South. \nIt surpasses DAVID's idea of classy. \nThe murmur of conversation- \nThe shake of cocktails mixed- \nDAVID Oh. Oh, I forgot how beautiful this city is. \nBRANDON and DAVID follow the HOSTESS to take a seat at a far table. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Oh, thank you, thank you. \nA stunning leggy COCKTAIL WAITRESS walks up to the table, dressed in silky 1930's cigarette girl costume. \nCOCKTAIL WAITRESS Hi guys. How are you both doing tonight? What can I get you? \nDAVID (OVER) Hi. Your.. Your accent. Are you..? Are you from erm..? \nCOCKTAIL WAITRESS Brazil. \nDAVID (looking around) Rio.

(LAUGHS) \nDAVID and BRANDON look around the room \nDAVID and BRANDON are fortunate to be here. The clink of glasses, the noise of laughter waft through the room. \nAcross the room, a familiar face. \nHer wavering a little at first on seeing BRANDON across the room. Their eyes lock. \nShe smiles, with quiet surprise- \nBRANDON looks away, ignoring SISSY's gaze, not wanting to look at her. SISSY plays on, inwardly crestfallen, her fingers working across the piano keys. \nDAVID leans back, eyes grazing over SISSY, a kind of white noise to SISSY's beautiful music- \nThe seeping first bars of `New York New York' filtering through- \nSISSY (singing) Start spreading the news. I'm leaving today. I want to be a part of it. New York..New York. \nIt's a familiar song but in SISSY's hands, every word punctures like an emotional fireburst- \nSISSY's voice is oddly haunting underscoring the bubble of conversation, \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) I want to wake up in a city that doesn't sleep. And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap. \nSISSY's eyes dart back to BRANDON, seemingly lost in his conversation, but competing now with SISSY and her song- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) My little town blues- \nSuddenly SISSY's fingers drop from the piano, her whole body curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic, slowly but quietly captivating- \nSISSY (CONT'D) They're melting away. I gonna make a brand new start of it. \nEven DAVID's listening now- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) In old New York.... \nSISSY's up moving now, she is completely lost in the song and the room is coming with her- \nBRANDON concedes,looking back at SISSY, now holding the room. \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) If I can make it there- \nA kind of hushed still has descended- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) I'll make it anywhere. It's up to you..New york, New york. New York, New York- \nSISSY comes closer, walking between the tables, flirting and laughing and drawing the audience in until they are in the palm of her hand. \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) I want to wake up in a city, that never sleeps...And find I'm a number one- \nSISSY grazes past BRANDON's table, eyes catching on BRANDON, singing for him now- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) Top of the list, king of the hill- \nBRANDON drinks, not looking at SISSY. She closes her eyes, tears stinging, reeling back into herself- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) A number one... \nSISSY draws out the note, bringing the song momentarily to a silence- \nSISSY's misty eyes open as BRANDON at last looks at her, the moment oddly fragile between them, brutal and yet tender. Even DAVID sensing something until- \nSISSY (CONT'D) (singing) These little town blues- \nSISSY turns, makes her way back to the piano, enjoying it now- \n", "test2_input": "MARIANNE Why are you here? \nBRANDON The food's supposed to be really great here.

I hit my head on the ceiling and I blacked out. \nThey both laugh. Marianne laughs hysterically. BRANDON laughs along. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) I was knocked out for 5-10 minutes. I peed my pants. \nMARIANNE (Reacts Sympathetically) Oh. \nBRANDON If you had a choice to live in the past or future and you could be anything you wanted, what would you be? \nMARIANNE What would you be? \nBRANDON I always wanted to be a musician in the sixties. \nMARIANNE That's cool A musician? \nBRANDON Yeah. \nMARIANNE Sixties is tough though.

They get to a subway entrance. \n", "test3_input": "The CLICK of the door, MARIANNE gone. \nThe HUM of the traffic, audible through an ajar window. \nBRANDON reaches his hand out, catching the breeze, peering down, a man on the edge. \n83   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                           83 \nBRANDON banging the life out of HOTEL LOVER, doggy style, tits pressed up against the glass of the window- \nThe DISTANT SCREECH of horns. \n84   EXT. STREET.

DAY.                           85 \nBRANDON close to climax- \nA cold sweat beading BRANDON's forehead as he comes, face twisted before the slow seep of release. \nBRANDON withdraws, laughs. The HOTEL LOVER laughs as well. \nBRANDON turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful. \nHOTEL LOVER smiles, already pulling on her underwear. BRANDON watches her, pulling on a tiny thong. She looks up, stares at him. \nBRANDON looks away, fighting back the cold flutter of shame. \nBRANDON Can I get you a drink? \nHOTEL LOVER hesitates, smile, shakes her head. \nHOTEL LOVER No. \nBRANDON nods. HOTEL LOVER fingers fastening a cheap nylon bra. \nHOTEL LOVER (CONT'D) Fuck. \nBRANDON Need a hand? \nHOTEL LOVER The hooks odd- \nHOTEL LOVER (CONT'D) (SIGHS) There you go. \n86   INT. BEDROOM.

NIGHT.                         87 \nBRANDON is sitting on the couch, watching a cartoon. SISSY enters the apartment, on her cell phone. BRANDON ignores her \nSISSY (O.S.) (into phone) David?.. Pick up. I take it you're at your pottery class. \nSISSY hangs up. \nSISSY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Have you eaten? \nBRANDON No. \nSISSY (O.S.)

Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes. \nMINNY (CONT'D) These are the rules for working in a white lady's house. Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Rule Number One: Don't you ever let White Lady find you sittin' on her toilet. Sugar nods. \n", "test1_true": "EXT.

Minny gawks at a dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs. \nCELIA Johnny's momma wouldn't let me decorate a thing. If I had my way, this house would have wall to wall white carpet with gold trim and none of this old stuff. Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete with bullet holes. \nMINNY Where you from? Celia lowers her head in shame... \nCELIA Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis. \nMINNY I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live there. Celia changes the subject. \nCELIA Let's go meet Oscar! Celia grabs Minny's hand. Annoyed, Minny pulls it away. \nINT.

I just want to make sure you know this ain't no game we're playing here. Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle of the kitchen and sits. \nMINNY (CONT'D) \n(TO SKEETER) Slide your chair out from under that table and face me. I want to see you square on at all times. Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table and just sits there staring at Minny. \nMINNY (CONT'D) I's got to come up with your questions, too?! \nSKEETER Let's begin...begin with...with where you were born. Aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing. \nMINNY Belzoni, Mississippi on my great- auntie's sofa. Next! \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - HOURS LATER \nMinny talks a mile a minute. Aibileen continues writing. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.)

AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SUNRISE \nThe first signs of morning sun filter into the kitchen. \nMINNY \"Oh, Minny, I'm gone give you a week paid vacation.\" Now, I ain't had no paid vacation in my life.

But, Skeeter, she didn't give me a choice... \nSKEETER What...happened? \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCharlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon. Constantine was to do the floors that morning so they'd be dry in time. Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly. The effects of arthritis are apparent. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived.

PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY \nCharlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins serving lunch. As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to Charlotte. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) Then, she burned the coffee. She had gotten so old, Skeeter. Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling it with food from the cart very slowly. Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman. Her hands tremble. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and I had had it. The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap. \nWOMAN Watch out! With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her hand. \nCHARLOTTE Get a hold of yourself, Constantine! Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted, she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady herself. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And that's when it happened. Constantine wets herself. Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from her. Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room. Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to Constantine's aid. Constantine looks to Charlotte. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD (FLASHBACK) - MOMENTS LATER \nConstantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still wearing her soiled dress. She turns and looks one last time at the Phelan Plantation... \nCHARLOTTE I told her she couldn't work here anymore and to go on home. \nINT.

Charlotte won't look at her. \nSKEETER How could you humiliate her like that?! \nCHARLOTTE I didn't mean to. \nSKEETER Why didn't you help her? \nCHARLOTTE I was upset. I didn't know what else to do. \nSKEETER So you just threw her away? That woman did you the biggest favor of your life. She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance. Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected. \nCHARLOTTE I didn't throw her away, Skeeter. Your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back. But she had already moved to Chicago. Left everything behind. \nSKEETER `Cause she didn't have anything anymore. You broke her heart! \nCHARLOTTE Please don't do this to me, Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you have to remember, they're not like us. They are different. Charlotte gets defensive. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) And you idolized her too much! You always have! \nSKEETER I needed somebody to look up to. Skeeter turns to leave. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I have to go find her. She needs me. \nCHARLOTTE We finally found the address of her daughter in Chicago...so we sent Carlton up there to go get Constantine. Skeeter turns back to her mother. \nSKEETER And? \nCHARLOTTE When he got there...she was dead, Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey. Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's hand. \nSKEETER Why didn't y'all tell me all this? \nCHARLOTTE I knew you'd blame me...when it wasn't my fault. It just happened, and it was so unfortunate. I'm sorry, Eugenia. \nSKEETER When did she die? How long had she been in Chicago? \nCharlotte pulls the white basin closer, hugs it to her side. \nCHARLOTTE Two weeks. Skeeter stands, never turning as she exits. \nEXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER \nSkeeter stands on the back patio crying. She slowly walks off into the yard. \n", "test3_true": "EXT.

I wanted to do something special. I wanted to say \"thank you.\" \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nCelia and Minny dine, and Minny's enjoying it. \nMINNY Greens got just the right amount a hock taste to `em. That's a good pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught you to cook like this? Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Corn bread's happy now. Celia lays down her fork. \nCELIA Are you happy, Minny? \nMINNY Why you ask such a funny question? \nCELIA Are you? \nMINNY A course I's happy. You happy too. Big house, big yard, good husband. \nCELIA You know, if I were you, I'd give it right back to him. I'd hit him over the head with a skillet and tell him to go straight to hell...

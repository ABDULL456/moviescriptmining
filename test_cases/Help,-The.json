{"train": "THE HELP \nWritten by \nTate Taylor \nBased on the novel by \nKathryn Stockett \nSecond Draft, November 9, 2009 \nWILLIAM FAULKNER wrote of Mammy Callie after her death: \n\"...she gave to my family a fidelity without stint or calculation or recompense and gave to my childhood an immeasurable devotion and love\". \nJACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 1963 \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and grips a tattered spiral notebook. Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear. Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses. Aibileen swallows hard. \nAIBILEEN I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont Plantation in Cherokee County. An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen. \nWOMAN (O.C.) Did you know as a girl, growing up, that one day you'd be a maid? \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. I did. \nWOMAN (O.C.) And you knew that because? \nAIBILEEN Momma was a maid. My grandmother was a house slave. \nWOMAN (0.C.) Oh. The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes. \nWOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay. Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap. \nWOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) Now, did you ever dream of being something else? Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet. \nWOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) Well then, what's it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home...being looked after by somebody else? \nAibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water. She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) I done raised seventeen kids in my life. Lookin' after white babies, that's what I do. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING \nMAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying. AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) I know how to get them babies asleep, stop cryin' and go in the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin.' Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into her expansive bosom. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Babies like fat. They like big fat legs too. That I know. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair. \nAIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D) I work from eight to four, six days a week. Ninety-five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy-two dollars ever month. I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing and grocery shopping, but mostly, I take care a baby girl...And law, I worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna be no beauty queen either. Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen kisses her and whispers in her ear. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) You is kind. You is smart. You is important. Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and double-stick tape hold it all together. Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle hair. \nELIZABETH Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour! Did you finish the chicken salad? \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No paprika! Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Does this dress look homemade? \nAIBILEEN I reckon when you finish, it won't. Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day. The birthin' blues had got holt a Miss Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it happen plenty a times...once babies start havin' they own babies. And the young white ladies of Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin' some babies. \nINT. JACKSON JOURNAL NEWSPAPAER - OFFICE - SAME DAY \nA smoking RECEPTIONIST, 50, leads EUGENIA \"SKEETER\" PHELAN, 23, across a smoke-filled news office. Even the light bulbs have yellowed. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) But, not Miss Skeeter... Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her shoulders. She carries a red satchel. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) No babies...No man...And not lookin'. She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her unfamiliar attire. \nINT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nThe receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a mean man. Smoke pours into the room. \nMR. BLACKLY Shut the Goddamn door! He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down. \nMR. BLACKLY (CONT'D) They announced last week cigarettes'll kill you. \nMr. Blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth. \nJOLENE Oh my God! \nHILLY Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. All the girls laugh. \nSKEETER Could have been you, Hilly. \nHILLY And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit. \nSKEETER Aren't we taking non-members? The benefit's gotten so big. \nHILLY Yes, but we're not telling her. Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles. \nSKEETER Thank you, Aibileen. Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point. Elizabeth leans over. \nELIZABETH Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use the bathroom. \nHILLY Ah-hem. I'm fine. Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa. \nMISSUS WALTERS She's upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath, and so do we. Elizabeth turns to Aibileen. \nELIZABETH Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley. Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Just go use mine and Raleigh's. Hilly hiss-whispers. \nHILLY If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too. \nELIZABETH \nSHE DOES NOT! Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops. \nHILLY Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject. \nSKEETER Did y'all see the cover of \"Life\" this week? Jackie's never looked \nMORE REGAL- \nHILLY -Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards. \nELIZABETH I can't ask Raleigh until tax season. But, it would be nice. \nHILLY That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative. \nSKEETER \"The Home\"...the what?! \nHILLY As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet. \nSKEETER Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly. The room grows eerily quiet. \nHILLY You ought not to joke about the colored situation. Hilly leans in toward Skeeter. \nHILLY (CONT'D) I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and throws her cards to the table. \nJOLENE I have to skedaddle! Gotta get over to the station! \n(EXCITEDLY) Daddy's letting me do the weather tonight! \nEXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY \nCelia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers. As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn. \"Tara\" pales in comparison. Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband, sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie. \nJOHNNY Roses look like weeds next to you. Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully. \nCELIA Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me! Johnny begins kissing her neck. \nCELIA (CONT'D) You're home early. Celia pushes him back. \nCELIA (CONT'D) Johnny, I can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back. \nJOHNNY Oh, who cares, honey. We got all we need right here. Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass. \nCELIA Johnny, honestly! \nJOHNNY Doctor's orders. Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy and rolls out from under him. \nCELIA I don't know what's taking us so long. I'm sorry. Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face. \nJOHNNY Hey, we've never done it in the yard. Maybe that's the trick. Celia seductively bites her lower lip. \nCELIA Watch my hair. Johnny's hand slides up her thigh. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY \nBridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye. \nSkeeter enters and looks around curiously at an ARRAY OF WIGS resting atop a dresser. \nSKEETER Momma? Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50, glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats. Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored, `pixie' cut. \nCHARLOTTE Is this a little too young? \nSKEETER It's a little too everything. \nCharlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. Thinning hair detracts from her perfectly made up face. Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) Much better. \nCHARLOTTE Your daddy bought me this dress in \nSKEETER Mom, I want to ask you about \nCONSTANTINE- \nCHARLOTTE -Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl. Charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Come on, you try it on. \nSKEETER What really happened? Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach. \nCHARLOTTE I told you...she went to live with her people in Chicago...Now, Skeeter, your mother is dying, and she wants to see you in this dress. Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress. Skeeter begins taking off her clothes. \nSKEETER How could she just take off without telling me? \nCHARLOTTE I told her not to write you. I didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. Honey, we were just a job to her. With them it's all about money...Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals. \nSKEETER Good for \"Fat Fanny Peatrow.\" She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it. \nCHARLOTTE This looks precious on you! Four years ago my daughter went off to college, and what did she come home with? \nSKEETER CHARLOTTE A diploma. A pretty piece of paper. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Hilly and Elizabeth have such lovely children. \nSKEETER They dropped out of college to become housewives, Mother. \nCHARLOTTE If only you'd show a little gumption, Eugenia... \nSKEETER Well, I did get a job today. \nCHARLOTTE You did? \nSKEETER Writing...for The Jackson Journal. Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind. \nCHARLOTTE Great. You can write my obituary. \"Charlotte Phelan dead. Her daughter still single.\" \nSKEETER Momma, would it really be so terrible if I never met a husband? With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a love seat. They sit. This is serious. \nCHARLOTTE I need to...ask you something, Skeeter. I read the other day about how some girls...get unbalanced, start thinking these...well, unnatural thoughts. Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Are you...do you...find men attractive? Are you having unnatural thoughts about... Charlotte shuts her eyes tight. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Girls or...or women? \nSKEETER Oh my God! \nCHARLOTTE Because, this article says there's a cure, a special root tea. Skeeter jumps up. \nSKEETER Mother, I want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with Jameso. \nCHARLOTTE Eugenia! Skeeter storms out of the room. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) \n(SHOUTING) Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner. Try to look presentable! \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe Phelan dining room is lit solely by candles. The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of casseroles around the table. Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl of broth. Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60. Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 25, sits next to his fianc\u00e9, REBECCA, 21. They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood good looks. \nCARLTON What the hell do you know about cleaning a house, Skeeter? \nSKEETER It's a start, Carlton. \nCARLTON \n(MOCKINGLY) I thought you wanted to write books. \nROBERT Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm proud of you, Sweetheart. Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, the irony of it all. Givin' advice on how to keep up a home when she... Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth. Pascagolua tries to scoop some sort of casserole covered in almonds onto Skeeter's plate. Skeeter stops her. \nMISS STEIN What gave you this idea, Miss Phelan? I'm...curious. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - PANTRY - SAME TIME \nSkeeter sits on a huge sack of flour. A millennium's supply of can goods fills the shelves. \nSKEETER I was...well, I was raised by a colored woman. I've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help. \nMISS STEIN Continue. \nSKEETER I'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house. Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up. \nMISS STEIN I'm listening. \nSKEETER Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked Mammy how she felt about it. There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here. \nMISS STEIN So, a side to this never before heard. \nSKEETER Yes! Charlotte knocks on the pantry door. \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) Skeeter, who are you talking to in there? Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door. \nSKEETER Go! Away! Skeeter slams the door. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) So, yes, their side of the story. Skeeter leans back against the shelves. \nMISS STEIN Who was that? \nSKEETER My mother. She just dropped by to- \nMISS STEIN Look, no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth. That's a hell of a risk in a place like Jackson, Mississippi. I watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news. Oy! They jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail built for four. Skeeter panics. \nSKEETER I already have a maid. Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk. \nMISS STEIN Really? A negro maid has already agreed to talk to you? Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now. \nSKEETER Yes, ma'am... \nMISS STEIN Well...I suppose I could read what you come up with. The book biz could use a little rattling. \nSKEETER You'd do that? \nMISS STEIN I'm saying I'll let you know if it's even worth pursuing. \nSKEETER Oh, thank you, Miss Stein! \nMISS STEIN And for God's sake, you're a twenty- four-year-old educated woman. Go get an apartment. She hangs up. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY \nSkeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the `Miss Myrna' letters. \nOutside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. Jolene's forecast appears to be a bit off. \nSKEETER \"Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too...\" \nAIBILEEN Which one she want a get rid of? Them rings or the husband? Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak. Then let it set in the sun a bit. Skeeter writes this down. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Bout an hour. Let it dry. Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside. Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3, perched on her hip. A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans. Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to sprinkle outside. \nHILLY Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage. The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Oh, mercy! Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the moment. \nSKEETER Aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things? Aibileen turns slowly from the window. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to. Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor. \nAIBILEEN Everthing's fine. \nSKEETER My momma fired Constantine. Thank you for telling me that. \nAIBILEEN I never tolt you that! Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out. \nSKEETER Aibileen, I have an idea...Something I want to write about...But I need your help. Skeeter rises. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid. Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of its handle. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. Show what it's like to work for, say...Elizabeth. Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady herself, then moves toward her chair. \nAIBILEEN You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin' stories on her? \nSKEETER I was thinking we wouldn't tell her. The other maids will have to keep it secret, too. \nMinny crouches down and covers her head. A draft sucks the candle's flame toward the bottom of the door. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall, holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day. Ten white. Eight black. \nEXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SAME TIME \nSkeeter stands in her backyard facing Jackson. Cool winds head toward the dark, swirling horizon. In the distance, lightning strikes. \nEXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME \nCelia leans on the porch railing, gazing helplessly as the relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose. Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone. \nINT/EXT. BATHROOM/BACKYARD (INTERCUT) - THREE MONTHS LATER \nAibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in the garage. The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a small window hugging the ceiling. Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single bulb hanging above. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast... Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade maternity dress. \nELIZABETH Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up, and I'm off to the doctor. Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley gets excited and points to the garage bathroom. \nMAE MOBLEY Aibee bafroom, Momma! Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out. \nMAE MOBLEY (CONT'D) Aibee? Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step. \nELIZABETH No! \nAIBILEEN Be right there, Baby Girl. Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose. \nEXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT AFTERNOON \nAibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids and black males at a bus stop. Yule May is tall, pretty and graceful. Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun. Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them. She and Aibileen catch eyes. Skeeter waves. Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up. \nSKEETER Afternoon, Aibileen. Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) Can I talk to you? A bus pulls up. \nAIBILEEN You got some \"Miss Myrna\" questions for me? \nSKEETER No. Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) Please. Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her. \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. The bus pulls away. \nSKEETER Please let me interview you. I know it's scary, but I really believe this has to be done. We'll be careful. \nAIBILEEN This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter. You not knowing that is what scares me most. I'm sorry. Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the sidewalk. \nEXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT NIGHT \nDark outside, Aibileen approaches another, more integrated bus stop. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) I know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them. Womens, they ain't like men. Women don`t beat you with a stick. Naw, they like to keep they hands clean. Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails. As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse uniforms push in front of her and sit. \nINT. MISSISSIPPI LAW LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING \nSkeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high as if to provide a shield of sorts. Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling at the edges. It's titled: \"Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South\" Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown. She carefully combs and styles her wig for work in the morning. Her real hair is bound tightly in dozens of tightly bound nubs. \nThe rotary wall phone rings. Aibileen hangs the wig on her chair and answers. \nINT. MINNY'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - SAME TIME \nMinny is hysterical. \nMINNY Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it now! Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in town I stole a candelabra! That's why I can't get no job. \nAIBILEEN Everbody know you honest, Minny. \nMINNY Oh, but I got her back...I did something awful, Aibileen. \nAIBILEEN What you did?! \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) God took him fast `cause he didn't want to argue with me. He was just twenty-four years old. The best part of a person's life. \nSKEETER Oh, Aibileen. \nAIBILEEN But he'd like we's doing this. He always said we gone have a writer in the family one day...After my prayers last night, I got some stories down too. Skeeter nods. Aibileen opens her notebook and reads. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) My first white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just turned fourteen years old. Daddy had left us, so I dropped out a school to help momma with the bills. \nINT. MOUNT ZION BABTIST CHURCH - MORNING \nA congregation of three hundred stand singing lively with the large choir. Aibileen stands next to Yule May and is whispering in her ear. Yule suddenly leans back, shocked, shaking her head \"no.\" Minny watches from two pews back. Her curiosity is peaked. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) Alton's momma died a lung disease. I loved that baby, and he loved me. That's when I learned I could make children feel proud of theyselves. \nINT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK \nMiss Stein sits at her desk reading Aibileen's stories. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) Alton used to always be asking me how come I's black... \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nAIBILEEN It just ate him up, so one time I told him it cause I drank too much coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen his face. \nSkeeter laughs as she writes down Aibileen's story. \nSKEETER This is great. You have no idea how much I appreciate this...But I just have to ask. What changed your mind? \nAIBILEEN \n(WITHOUT PAUSE) Miss Hilly Holbrook. \nINT. JUNIOR LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING \nHilly stands at a podium banging a gavel. The pleats of her navy blue sailor's number fan out like an accordion. A room full of JUNIOR LEAGUE MEMBERS sits up and quiets down. Half the girls are pregnant and most all drink TAB and are smoking. Skeeter sits in the back next to Elizabeth. \nHILLY We're running behind on our \"coat drive,\" girls. So hurry up and clean out those closets...But our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots. The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Y'all think we can put a dent in the African Children's hunger this year? More applause. Those who aren't pregnant, stand. Hilly beams. Elizabeth nudges Skeeter out of her chair. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Now for some exciting news...I wanted y'all to be the first to know...My William is seeking election to the State Senate this November! Now, even the pregnant women stand. Elizabeth grabs Skeeter's arm and pulls herself up. \nHILLY (CONT'D) He's runnin' on a platform of health. Protecting our children. Protecting our way of life. So, I, with William, have drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative. This sets off a room of whispers. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter? I gave it to you a month ago. Everyone turns to Skeeter. Elizabeth panics. \nELIZABETH I gave that to you myself! \nSKEETER I, ah...Well, I- \nHILLY Would you please stand, Skeeter? As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads. \nSKEETER I'll have it in there soon. Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel. \nEXT. LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY \nSkeeter turns a corner and sees Hilly leaning on her car. \nSKEETER Hilly? Do you need a ride? Hilly shakes her head with little emotion. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I'm sorry about the newsletter. Hilly nods. A soft smile begins to form. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) With Momma being sick and- Hilly erupts with excitement. \nHILLY He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's definitely coming this time. This Saturday night. \nSKEETER Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice before. Maybe it's a sign. \nHILLY Don't you dare say that! \nSKEETER You know I won't be his type. Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders. \nHILLY It's your time, Skeeter. And damnit, I'm not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him. \nINT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nMinny is again wearing her maid's uniform. She puts two plates of food down on the kitchen table. She sits next to her daughter, SUGAR, 15. Sugar wears a brand-spanking-new maids's uniform. \nMINNY Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like to not feed ya on try-out day. Sugar takes a bite of toast. \nMINNY (CONT'D) I still say you're too young to be waitin' on white peoples...Now, Sugar, I want you to listen to me, and you listen to me good. Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes. \nMINNY (CONT'D) These are the rules for working in a white lady's house. Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Rule Number One: Don't you ever let White Lady find you sittin' on her toilet. Sugar nods. \nMINNY Okay. What time you want me here? \nCELIA After eight, and you have to leave at four. \nMINNY Okay. Now what your husband say you can pay? Celia looks away. \nCELIA Johnny doesn't know I'm bringing in help. \nMINNY And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he comes home and finds a colored woman up in his kitchen? \nCELIA It's not that I'd be fibbing. I just want him to think I can do this on my own...I need some help `til I get the hang of it. I need a maid. \nMINNY A course you do. Last one done got shot in the head. Minny sniffs the air. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Miss Celia, I think you done burned up yo cake. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER \nCelia grabs a rag off the sink and jerks the cake out of the oven. \nCELIA Oww! Dawgonit! She drops the burnt cake on the floor. \nMINNY You can't use no wet towel on a hot pan.

LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING \nAibileen removes Mae Mobley's wet cloth diaper on a changing table. Mae Mobley's behind is covered with inflamed diaper rash. Aibileen shakes her head. Elizabeth enters the room. \nELIZABETH I'm off, Aibileen. Don't forget Raleigh wants pot roast tonight. \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. Aibileen's eyes narrow. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT \nSkeeter works with a typewriter now. Aibileen, more casually dressed than before, waits for Skeeter to finish typing. \nAIBILEEN I reckon I'm ready...to talk about Miss Leefolt now. Skeeter stops typing and looks up. She nods. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Baby girl don't get her diaper changed `til I get there in the morning. That's `bout ten hours she gots to sit in her mess. I be so worried about her on my day off. I always come in an hour early on Mondays. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCharlotte sits at a table sorting through mail as Skeeter enters and grabs an apple \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too. And, law, I pray this child turn out good. It a lonely road if a momma don't think theys child is pretty. Charlotte glances down disapprovingly at the dingy, huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet. Skeeter heads for the door. \nCHARLOTTE Where are you going, Skeeter? Skeeter turns. \nSKEETER Bible study. \nCHARLOTTE On a Saturday night? \nSKEETER Momma, God doesn't care what day of the week it is. Skeeter walks out the back door as Charlotte shakes her head. \nEXT. JOLENE FRENCH'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY \nHilly, Elizabeth and Jolene French stand with Hilly's contractor. He unrolls a set of bathroom plans. Hilly and Elizabeth look to Jolene and nod approvingly. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nSkeeter's typing slows. \nAIBILEEN Miss Leefolt be spending so much time keeping up with the society ladies, she done forgot the child she got now. Just then Minny barges through the kitchen back door. \nMINNY Aibileen! Minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of Skeeter. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Yule May told me what y'all up to. Aibileen nods. Minny's face hardens. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Medgar Evers live five minutes away. They blew up his carport last night. For talking! Minny scowls at Skeeter. \nMINNY (CONT'D) What makes you think colored people need your help? You white. Why you care? \nAIBILEEN We all working for the same thing. \nMINNY \n(TO SKEETER) Maybe you just want to get her in trouble. Skeeter is petrified. Her face reddens. \nSKEETER I want to show her perspective...so people might understand what it's like from your side. \nMINNY Well it's a real Fourth of July picnic. \nMINNY (CONT'D) It's what we dream a doing all weekend long, get back in they house to polish the silver. And we just love not getting minimum wage or Social Security. \nSkeeter delivers the \"Miss Myrna\" columns to the receptionist, who hands her back a paycheck. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN \nCelia and Minny stand at a fried chicken assembly line. \nMINNY What can you cook? Minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash, then drops them in a paper bag. A puff of flour rises out of the bag. \nCELIA I can cook corn pone, boil potatoes, and do grits. Minny bursts out laughing. \nCELIA (CONT'D) We didn't have electric current where I was raised. \nMINNY Well, I reckon if there's anything you ought to know `bout cooking... Minny holds up a can of Crisco. \nMINNY (CONT'D) It's this. The most important invention since they put mayonnaise in a jar. You don't even know the things you can do with this here can. Celia peers into the skillet as Minny spoons out a mound of Crisco. \nCELIA How pretty. Looks like frosting. Minny rolls her eyes and hands Celia the bag of Chicken. \nMINNY Shake that. Celia starts shaking the bag. \nCELIA This is fun! \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - LATER \nMinny sits down at the table with a plate of chicken. Celia sits down next to her. \nCELIA Looks so good! I'm starved. Aggravated, Minny stands. \nMINNY You supposed to eat in the dining room, Miss Celia. That how it works. Minny grabs Celia's plate. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Here, I'll take your plate in the dinin' room for ya. Want tea? \nCELIA I'm fine right here, Minny. Minny sits back down with a sigh. Celia touches her arm. \nCELIA (CONT'D) I'm real grateful you're here. \nMINNY Miss Celia, you got a lot more to be grateful for than me. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway. Minny panics. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Mister Johnny?! \nCELIA Oh, no! Hide! Minny slides down underneath the kitchen table. \nCELIA (CONT'D) Oh...It's just the florist. Johnny must have sent me flowers. Minny pulls herself up off the floor. She's mad. \nMINNY Miss Celia, I ain't playin' around no more! He gone catch me here and shoot me dead right here on this no- wax floor! You gots to tell him. Ain't he wondering how the cooking so good? \nCELIA FOOTE You're right. Maybe we ought to burn the chicken a little. The doorbell rings. Celia runs off to answer. \nMINNY Minny don't burn chicken. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - DAY \nSkeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders. Charlotte, now in an auburn wig, squirts mounds of goo from a pink tube onto Skeeter's hair. \nCHARLOTTE This is bound to work, Sweetie. It even smells expensive. She begins twisting Skeeter's hair into gooey spikes. \nSKEETER I feel the hope in your fingers. Skeeter resembles a papier mach\u00e9 starfish. \nCHARLOTTE How can you not know his last name? \nSKEETER He's William's cousin. That's all I know. \nCHARLOTTE That's just so sweet of Hilly. Charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette, then lifts up a silver machine complete with power cord and rubber hose. \nSKEETER What is that?! \nCHARLOTTE The Shinolator! It cost eleven dollars. I'm a good mother. Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and reads from the Shinolator manual. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) \"The Miracle Straitening Cap\" must remain on the head for two hours.\" \nSKEETER Two hours?! Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine groans to life. Skeeter's cap inflates. \nCHARLOTTE I'll have Pascagoula bring you a magazine. Skeeter snatches her mother's cigarette and takes a drag. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nSkeeter sits under the Shinolator buried in a magazine. Pascagoula enters and sets down a glass of tea. \nSKEETER Thanks, Constantine. Do you think this dress is cute? Skeeter holds the magazine up to Pascagoula. Only now does she realize what she's said and done. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula. Pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns. \nPASCAGOLUA I knew Constantine. She was a mighty fine woman. \nINT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nHILLY Well...You. Are. Welcome. Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into Hilly and hugs her. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) One thing I got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children. Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss. Hilly kisses her son gently. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) And, law, do they love her back. When she starts up on me, I just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me. That kind a love makes me cry. Even when it going to Miss Hilly. Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out. \nINT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY \nYule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their \"good-byes\" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen. \nYULE MAY May I get you something? \nSKEETER No, thanks... \n(HUSHED) Yule May, I wanted to talk to you. Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still cackling out on the street. \nYULE MAY I know what you want to ask, Miss Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny already did. Yule May closes the kitchen door. \nYULE MAY (CONT'D) I'm trying to get my boys off to college. It's worthwhile what y'all doing, but my boys are worth more. \nSKEETER I understand. \nHILLY (O.C.) What do you \"understand,\" Skeeter? Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the swinging door leading into the dining room. \nSKEETER Ah...Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college. \nHILLY Is that true, Yule May? \nYULE MAY Yes, Ma'am. Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow laws in her hand. \nHILLY Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money? \nSKEETER Of course not, Hilly! Hilly approaches Skeeter. \nHILLY Skeeter, I'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter. Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen. \nSKEETER Not at all. I'm just so busy right now with Mom. \nHILLY Skeeter...I'm sorry about your mother. And I know you must be so worried. Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet. \nHILLY (CONT'D) But I'm worried about you. All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff? \nSKEETER My dad had me get that for him. \nHILLY I mean, around your friends is one thing...But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with this...you'd be in serious trouble. Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly. \nSKEETER Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for going through my things. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY \nSkeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette. Keys type out: \"Home Help Sanitation Initiative.\" Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head. She types: Don't risk your children's and family's health! \nINT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nYule May vacuums. She pulls the sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it. Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over. She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold. The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket. \nINT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON \nAs Skeeter bangs away on her typewriter, Charlotte bursts into the room, stuck somewhere between panic and joy. \nCHARLOTTE Skeeter! \nSKEETER What?! \nCHARLOTTE Don't panic, but there's a very tall man named Stuart here for you. \nSKEETER He's a drunken asshole, Mother. You wouldn't like him. Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet. \nCHARLOTTE Skeeter, love and hate are two horns on the same goat. And, you need a goat! \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nSkeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room. Pascagoula serves finger sandwiches. Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red tie. His nose is pink from working in the sun. No one says a word. Finally... \nCHARLOTTE Stuart, would you like a cocktail? Skeeter shoots her mother a \"What the...\" look. \nSTUART No, Ma'am. Little too early. \nSKEETER Ha! Charlotte moves on. \nCHARLOTTE What's your last name, Stuart? \nSTUART Whitworth. \nCHARLOTTE Hmm...Where are you from? \nELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT'D) Mae Mobley! No! Stop! Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window. \nINT. LEEFOLT BACKYARD - SAME TIME \nMae Mobley sits on Aibileen's toilet in the garage. Door wide open, pants around her ankles. \nMAE MOBLEY Me and Aibiee bafroom, Momma. Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her hard on the behind. \nELIZABETH It! Is! Not! Mae Mobley begins to cry. Aibileen watches as Elizabeth hiss- whispers and yanks Mae Mobley hard on the arm. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) This is dirty out here! You'll catch diseases. Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) No! No! No! \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAibileen sits on the couch with Mae Mobley who eats a cookie. Mae Mobley's face is red and damp. \nAIBILEEN I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here. Aibileen kisses her on the cheek. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) You is kind. You is smart. You is important...You want me to tell you one a our secret stories? Mae Mobley nods. The phone rings. Aibileen rises. \nELIZABETH (O.C.) I got it! \nAibileen sits back down and leans into Mae Mobley. \nAIBILEEN One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two. \nMAE MOBLEY Martian? How big? \nAIBILEEN Oh, he about six-two. \nMAE MOBLEY What's his name? \nAIBILEEN Martian Luther King. \nMAE MOBLEY What did he look like? \nAIBILEEN Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head. But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him. \nMAE MOBLEY Why Aibee? Why was they so mean? \nAIBILEEN `Cause he was green. Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room. \nELIZABETH Aibileen! Come on! We have to go help Hilly. Now! Come on! Elizabeth runs outside. Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley. \nEXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nElizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow. A stream of people walk toward them, laughing. They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn. Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top, providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by. The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors still open with LUGGAGE tied to the roof. Two OLD BLACK MEN struggle to remove a toilet under William's supervision. \nAibileen hides her smile. Mae Mobley points. \nMAE MOBLEY Look! Look, Aibee. Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of her. \nHILLY Get out of here! Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Skeeter! She put it in the newsletter. I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house. Not commodes! Hilly faces the toilets again and screams. \nHILLY (CONT'D) She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach. Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Go help those boys GET THOSE \nTOILETS OFF MY LAWN! \nINT. BUS - LATER THAT NIGHT \nAibileen rides in the back of a bus with a YOUNG BLACK MAN. Two white men sit right behind the white driver. The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road. In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block. A few people gather. \nDRIVER Y'all stay put. Let me find out what's going on. As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle and looks ahead. The driver returns. The young black man speaks up. \nYOUNG BLACK MAN What happen up there, Mister? \nDRIVER Colored people off. White people lemme know where y'all are going. I'll get you as close as I can. \nAs the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white passenger taps the driver on the shoulder. \nWHITE PASSENGER What's going on? Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs. \nDRIVER I don't know. Some nigger got shot. Where you headed? The bus door shuts and the driver backs away. \nEXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER \nAibileen and the young man walk along a dark street. The sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air. \nYOUNG BLACK MAN You all right? You close to home? \nHilly and the usual suspects play bridge at Hilly's house. Aibileen pours coffee an earshot away. \nHILLY Please! A nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity. It took'em all of five minutes to figure out where she worked. Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement. \nHILLY (CONT'D) I knew that girl was a thief the day she started. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Minny wipes her nose with her sleeve, Skeeter approaches. \nSKEETER I'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer. \nMINNY She had a lawyer. A white lawyer! But Miss Hilly friends with the judge's wife. Whole thing took two days. Arrested on Tuesday, in the state pen by Wednesday. \nAIBILEEN The church gone send them boys to college. Gone pass the plate `til they graduate... The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a seat at the kitchen table. PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm. \nPEARLY I'm on help with your stories. Another WOMAN walks over. \nBLACK WOMAN I'm on help too. Another woman speaks from the living room. \nBLACK WOMAN 2 We all are. Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads. Skeeter looks around in awe. \nSKEETER Thank you. I don't know what to- \nMINNY \n(STERNLY) They doing this for Yule May. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nSkeeter sits and writes as Pearly begins the interviews. \nPEARLY Been there thirty-eight years and Miss Margaret still makes me put my hair up in a rag. Say she know coloreds don't wash theys hair. But, I love her. She love me too. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCORA, 70. \nCORA I had been workin' for Miss Jolene's mother up `til she died. Then her daughter, Miss Nancy, asked me to come work for her. Miss Nancy a real sweet lady. \nCORA (CONT'D) But her momma left it in the will that I had to work for her daughter, Miss Jolene. Miss Jolene a mean woman. Mean for sport. I tried to get another job, but in everbody mind, the French family and Miss Jolene owned me. \nDISSOLVE TO: CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes. \nCALLIE I used to take a shortcut ever day to work at Doctor Dixon's house. Cut through this farmer's lower forty to get there. One day, that farmer was waitin' on me with a gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I walk on his land again. Doctor Dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres. Told him he `bout to start farmin' too. But he bought it just for me. So I could get to work easy. He did. Skeeter closes her eyes for moment. When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING \nBEFORE HER. Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the vision is gone. Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26. \nGRETCHEN All these colored women have been real nice, haven't they? \nSKEETER Yes. Very nice. \nGRETCHEN Well, they hate you. You know this? Every little thing about you. But you're so dumb, you think you're doing them a favor. Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback. \nSKEETER You don't have to do this. \nGRETCHEN You know the nicest thing a white woman's ever done for me? Gave me the heel of her bread. These women are playing a trick on you. They'll never tell you the truth! \nSKEETER You don't know what they've said. \nGRETCHEN Say it, lady, say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you. Nigger. Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen. \nAIBILEEN That's enough, Gretchen. \nGRETCHEN You just as dumb as she is. \nAIBILEEN Get out a my house! \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely. Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An unwrapped present rests on the coffee table. \nAIBILEEN Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles. About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot. Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter. \nSKEETER Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me. \nAIBILEEN And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home. Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down next to Skeeter. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies. \nAibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads the card aloud. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is touched. The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers. Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her. The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen waves back and smiles. Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Skeeter. She wipes her eye. \nMINNY (CONT'D) I told God I'd never speak of it again. But we got no choice. It's time...Time to tell you both \"the terrible awful\" I did to Miss Hilly. It might be the only thing to protect us. \nINT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - KITCHEN - 6 MONTHS EARLIER \nWe continue with the earlier flashback where Minny arrives at Hilly's with her famed chocolate pie. Hilly leads Minny into the kitchen, Missus Walters follows behind. Hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork. She leans against the counter and takes a big bite. \nHILLY Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthing, thieving nigra, did they? Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Pie's as good as always, Minny. \nMINNY I'm glad you like it. Hilly cuts another piece for herself. \nHILLY If...I take you back, I'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week. Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly. \nMINNY Take me back? Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice. \nHILLY What do you put in here that makes it taste so good? \nMINNY That good vanilla from Mexico... Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile. \nMINNY (CONT'D) And...something else real special. Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie. \nMINNY (CONT'D) No, Missus Walters. That Miss Hilly's special pie. \nHILLY Momma can have a piece. Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Cut her one. \nMINNY \n(IMMEDIATELY) Eat my shit. Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter. \nHILLY What did you say? \nMINNY I said eat my shit! \nHILLY Have you lost your mind?! Minny moves toward Hilly. \nMINNY No. But you're about to, `cause you just did. Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice. \nHILLY Did what? Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing so hard she has to lower herself to the floor. \nMISSUS WALTERS Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I guess. And you didn't just eat one. You ate two slices! Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in. As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nAibileen and Skeeter are speechless. \nAIBILEEN You trying to get yourself killed?! \nMINNY No! I never planned to tell her! I just wanted to see her take a bite and leave so I could be done with her. Forever! She was never supposed to ask me back. Minny eyes narrow. \nMINNY (CONT'D) And, then for less pay! That got me even madder. And, then she went slid that pie at me. Oh lord! That was it! I just lost control, Aibileen...you know how I get, now. \nMINNY (CONT'D) So, before I knew it, it just came on out my mouth...and I had tolt her what was in that pie. Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head. Minny suddenly gets misty. She wipes her eyes. \nMINNY (CONT'D) I've asked God to forgive me. But, more for what happened to poor Missus Walters. Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing home just for laughing. \nAIBILEEN \n(GRAVELY) We can't put that story in the book. \nSKEETER It's too dangerous, Minny. \nMINNY We need insurance! Hilly Holbrook can't never let people know that pie story is about her. \nAIBILEEN Exactly! If people find out \"The Terrible Awful\" was you and Miss Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble there ain't words for! \nMINNY Right! But don't you see? Miss Hilly gone go to her grave convincing people this book ain't about Jackson. Then we safe, insured! Minny gets up and walks toward Aibileen. \nMINNY (CONT'D) You brought me into this, and I'm on finish it! Either put it in or pull my parts out all together. Minny storms out of Aibileen's kitchen. \nINT. HARPER ROW PUBLISHING/PANTRY (INTERCUT) - DAY \nMiss Stein talks to Skeeter on the phone. \nMISS STEIN The last editor's meeting is December 17th. If you want a chance of this getting read, I need it in my hands by then. \nSKEETER But that's in a week, Miss Stein! \nMISS STEIN Otherwise it goes in The Pile. You don't want it in The Pile. \nSKEETER Yes, Ma'am. \nMISS STEIN And you must get a piece in about the domestic who raised you. It'll add something personal to it. Skeeter nods with frustration. \nINT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nJolene finishes up the winners list. \nJOLENE I hope you enjoy your new set of tires, Missus Atwell. Now, on to the baked goods. Jolene flips a page. \nJOLENE (CONT'D) Oh, yum! Yum! The highest bid in baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's chocolate pie. Congratulations, Hilly Holbrook! The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts. Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they don't know. Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes very alert. \nHILLY What? I didn't bid on anything. Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone signed me up for that pie. \nSKEETER \n(TO STUART) Oh, no. Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred. \nCELIA Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't know you're a fan of Minny's pies. Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve. \nCELIA (CONT'D) I've wanted to talk to you all night. Minny told me why you won't be my friend. You think me and Johnny went behind your back. \nHILLY Let me go! Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through the air. Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands. \nSTUART Oh, God. \nCELIA I'm so sorry. \nHILLY \n(GRITTED TEETH) What are you trying to do to me? What are you and that nigra up to? \nJolene announces another round of winners loudly over the microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice. \nCELIA I don't know what you- \nHILLY -You liar! Who did you tell?! Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but Celia is still yelling. \nCELIA Hilly, I got pregnant after you and Johnny broke up! The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's noses wrinkle. \nMISSUS WALTERS Oh, shit. \nHILLY Shut up, Mother. Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm. Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead. \nCELIA Johnny never cheated on you...At least, not with me. Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water. \nHILLY Johnny would never- \nCELIA And I'm sorry I thought you'd be tickled to win that pie. \nHILLY You tell that nigra if she tells anybody, I will make her suffer. Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen. They all immediately look away. Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking her head back and forth. \nJOHNNY Celia, what's wrong, Honey? \nCELIA Uh-oh. Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet. The entire room gasps in horror. \nJOHNNY Oh, shit! Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and runs for the bathroom. He follows. Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby. \nHILLY Get that cleaned up before it starts to smell. \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. \nINT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT \nMinny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink filled with sudsy water, washing dishes. Minny approaches from behind as Sugar holds court with five other young girls. \nSUGAR That big-boobed lady Momma works for was drunker than an Injun on payday. Upchucked in front a everbody! As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of her head. \nMINNY Don't you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth. Clothes on your back! You hear me? Minny storms off. \nSUGAR \n(TO HERSELF) You do it all the time. \nEXT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHilly and William walk to their car. Missus Walters follows closely behind, holding Minny's pie. \nHILLY Just come on home and stay with us tonight, Mother. \nMISSUS WALTERS No thanks, I got a pie to eat. Hilly spins around and sees the pie. \nHILLY You throw that pie away right now! \nMISSUS WALTERS I spent good money on this. Won it just for you... \nHILLY You?! You signed me up? Missus Walters steps up to Hilly. \nCHARLOTTE Have you been crying? You know that ages your skin, Dear. \nSKEETER Mother, I need to talk to you about Constantine. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago. \nSKEETER Well, I have to speak to her. \nCHARLOTTE Now, you look. I was good to Constantine. Oh, she talked back plenty of times, and I put up with it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give me a choice... \nSKEETER What...happened? \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCharlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon. Constantine was to do the floors that morning so they'd be dry in time. Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly. The effects of arthritis are apparent. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived. A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a point about the damp floor... \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY \nCharlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins serving lunch. As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to Charlotte. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) Then, she burned the coffee. She had gotten so old, Skeeter. Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling it with food from the cart very slowly. Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman. Her hands tremble. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and I had had it. The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap. \nWOMAN Watch out! With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her hand. \nCHARLOTTE Get a hold of yourself, Constantine! Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted, she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady herself. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And that's when it happened. Constantine wets herself. Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from her. Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room. Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to Constantine's aid. Constantine looks to Charlotte. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD (FLASHBACK) - MOMENTS LATER \nConstantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still wearing her soiled dress. She turns and looks one last time at the Phelan Plantation... \nCHARLOTTE I told her she couldn't work here anymore and to go on home. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nSkeeter trembles. Charlotte won't look at her. \nSKEETER How could you humiliate her like that?! \nCHARLOTTE I didn't mean to. \nSKEETER Why didn't you help her? \nCHARLOTTE I was upset. I didn't know what else to do. \nSKEETER So you just threw her away? That woman did you the biggest favor of your life. She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance. Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected. \nCHARLOTTE I didn't throw her away, Skeeter. Your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back. But she had already moved to Chicago. Left everything behind. \nSKEETER `Cause she didn't have anything anymore. You broke her heart! \nCHARLOTTE Please don't do this to me, Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you have to remember, they're not like us. They are different. Charlotte gets defensive. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) And you idolized her too much! You always have! \nSKEETER I needed somebody to look up to. Skeeter turns to leave. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I have to go find her. She needs me. \nCHARLOTTE We finally found the address of her daughter in Chicago...so we sent Carlton up there to go get Constantine. Skeeter turns back to her mother. \nSKEETER And? \nCHARLOTTE When he got there...she was dead, Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey. Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's hand. \nSKEETER Why didn't y'all tell me all this? \nCHARLOTTE I knew you'd blame me...when it wasn't my fault. It just happened, and it was so unfortunate. I'm sorry, Eugenia. \nSKEETER When did she die? How long had she been in Chicago? \nCharlotte pulls the white basin closer, hugs it to her side. \nCHARLOTTE Two weeks. Skeeter stands, never turning as she exits. \nEXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER \nSkeeter stands on the back patio crying. She slowly walks off into the yard. \nMALE HOST (CONT'D) Touching and enlightening, it's filled with testimonials from Mississippi's own housekeepers. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME \nMinny watches transfixed as she and Celia eat dessert in front of the television. \nCELIA Look how cute that dress is. \nMALE HOST Takes place in the fictional town of \"Niceville.\" The book is dedicated to C and T. If you're out there C and T, we'd love to have you on the show because Niceville sounds like Jackson, if you ask me. The host starts laughing. Jolene snaps. \nJOLENE FRENCH It's not Jackson! It's a disgrace to the South! A disgrace to good Southern women who've spent their lives taking care of their help. \nLEEFOLT HOME Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing. She snaps to attention, pulls the iron off the burned shirt. \nMALE HOST But did you read that ending? \nJOLENE FRENCH I know I personally treat my help like family, and every one of my friends does the same. \nMALE HOST \n(INTO CAMERA) Bertha, if you're listening, I have a new found respect for what you do. And, believe me, I'll be passin' on dessert at your table! \nFOOTE LIVING ROOM Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty plate, never taking her eyes off the television. \nJOLENE FRENCH Do not buy this book! Ladies of Jackson, do not support slander with your husband's hard earned- Poof! Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream commercial. \nHILLY'S HOME \nHILLY Don't cut her off like that. \nLEEFOLT HOME \nELIZABETH What's that book called, Aibileen? \nAIBILEEN I...I wasn't paying attention. \nINT. BOOKSTORE - LATER THAT DAY \nStacks of \"The Help\" rest on tables in the store. Elizabeth enters, pick up two copies and pulls them close to her body. She races to the register like a teen buying a Playboy. \nTIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY Back at the table of books, we see in rapid succession the books quickly disappearing by the hands of Jacksonians. \nINT - AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny sit at the table. Aibileen's phone rings off the wall, but she won't answer. \nSKEETER I knew nothing about it. Miss Stein's P.R. Department called the station directly. \nAIBILEEN Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book. They so scared. \nMINNY `One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss Hilly in less than a hour. She better read it quick and start the \"this ain't Jackson crusade.\" \nSKEETER Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book. \nMINNY Oh, she gone read it. Especially after that man made such a stink on the tee-vee. She gone read it. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME/HOLBROOK HOME (INTERCUT) - DAY \nElizabeth and Hilly read the book aloud over the phone with each other. They stop and nod with speculation. \nINT. BUS - DAY \nA bus is filled with domestics en route to work. Everyone is either reading the book or having it read to them. \nINT. NURSING HOME - NIGHT \nMissus Walters reads to a group of women in the home. \nINT. PHELAN HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCharlotte lies in bed reading the book next to Robert, who is asleep. As she turns a page, her face reveals a dawning realization. Troubled, she starts to wake Robert but doesn't. Charlotte trembles as she brings the book in close to her chest. She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling. \nEXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - DUSK \nSkeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes. \nSTUART That month felt like a year. I missed you so much. \nSKEETER Me, too. \nSTUART Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going back on the rig. Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket and places it in Skeeter's lap. A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires. Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring. \nSKEETER Stuart...I have to tell you something. \nSTUART How about \"yes?!\" I had this with me down in New Orleans, you know. Skeeter touches Stuart's face. \nSKEETER I'm serious...and...you have to promise not to tell anyone. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) The voters of Hinds County had spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career. One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes William's campaign poster taped to the window. \nINT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHilly reads the book in bed. William is fast asleep. Suddenly, her eyes widen, her breath becomes heavy. She slowly turns a page and freezes. Her face turns white. Hilly balls both fists, looks to the ceiling and screams louder than humanly possible. \nTHE SCREAM CONTINUES OVER: \nINT. SKEETER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nSkeeter lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nAibileen lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. \nINT. MINNY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING \nMinny lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. But, this time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder. Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake. Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny. \nSUGAR Momma, there's a white man at our door! \nMAN (O.C.) Minny Jackson! Are you in there?! Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and grabs a bat from behind the door. \nMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) I can hear you. Open the door. \nINT. MINNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMinny approaches the door. \nMINNY Who there? \nMAN Johnny Foote. Minny Jackson, I want to talk to you. Open up. Minny slowly opens the door. Johnny is all smiles. \nJOHNNY Finally, I meet Minny Jackson... As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings. Johnny turns and stops the bat with his hand. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) What the hell are you doin'?! Minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor, raises her hands in front of her. \nMINNY Please don't hurt me! My babies are in the house. Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor. \nJOHNNY Calm down, girl. I'm not here to get you. \nHe suddenly throws his arms around her and squeezes hard. \nINT. MINNY'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nJohnny and Minny sit at her kitchen table. \nJOHNNY When I finally confronted Celia about you, she told me about the baby. All of them. You saved her life. \nMINNY I don't know about that. \nJOHNNY Well, I know the day you came to our house, she started getting better. And I'm not just talking about the cookin' either. \nMINNY You knew I was there? \nJOHNNY Fried chicken and okra on the first night? Y'all should have at least put corn pone on the table. \nMINNY I couldn't make you eat anymore corn pone, Mister Johnny. \nJOHNNY Next morning, I snuck back up to the house, peeked in the window, and there you were. Given ol' Oscar a wipe down. Minny smiles for the first time. \nMINNY So I ain't losing my job? \nJOHNNY You have a job with us for the rest of your life, if you want it. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nBridge is underway at the Leefolt house with the usual suspects, except Skeeter. LOU ANN TEMPLETON has taken her place. Aibileen nervously pours coffee. \nJOLENE FRENCH I heard that Betty character might be Charlene. \nHILLY It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage. I bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra. Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup. \nLOU ANN TEMPLETON And, Jolene, didn't your momma leave Cora to you in her will? \nJOLENE Well, yes...But that's not odd is it? Happens all the time, right? A sudden realization washes over Jolene. \nLOU ANN TEMPLETON Did anybody ever figured out who C and T are? \nHILLY The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON! Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate. \nHILLY (CONT'D) You spilled some, Aibileen. Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and dabs the spilled coffee. Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Get me a new plate. One you haven't soiled with a dirty cloth. \nCHARLOTTE Why, Hilly...It's been such a long time, Dear. Everything okay, you two? Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance. \nHILLY Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to- \nCHARLOTTE Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill? Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister. \nHILLY Well, I...I didn't have time to get fixed up before- \nCHARLOTTE Darling, no husband wants to come home and see this. Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) And that...that is horrendous. \nHILLY Missus Phelan, I'm here- \nCHARLOTTE You know, Hilly. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too many...SWEETS? Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte moves in for the kill. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get one of those on our lip. Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother, not knowing what to say. Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into the living room. Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away. \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D) Eugenia? \nSKEETER Yes, Ma'am. \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) Come in here, please. Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room. \nINT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nCharlotte pats the sofa as Skeeter enters and sits. \nSKEETER Ma'am? \nCHARLOTTE Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible study? Anything like that? \nSKEETER No, Ma'am. \nCHARLOTTE Good. We're going shopping. Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) `Cause no single daughter of mine is going to New York, representing the great state of Mississippi, without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe. \nSKEETER What? \nCHARLOTTE I'm very proud of you, Eugenia. \nSKEETER How do you know about New York? \nCHARLOTTE A friend of Constantine's told me. Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of \"The Help\". \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) Would you do me the honor of signing my copy? Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good it would feel. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING \nAibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring. She answers. Minny screams on the other end of the line. \nEXT. GAS STATION (INTERCUT) - SAME TIME \nMinny stands barefoot inside a phone booth, her lip swollen, face bleeding. Her kids stand outside, crying. \nMINNY They fired Leroy last night! And when Leroy ask why, his boss say Mister Holbrook told him to do it. Said his nigger wife the reason. \nAIBILEEN Oh, Law! \nMINNY He try to kill me with he bare hands! He threw the kids in the yard, lock me in the bathroom, and say he gone set the house on fire. \nAIBILEEN Where are you now?! \nMINNY The gas station. I climbed out the window, and we all ran here. \nAIBILEEN I'm on come there now. \nMINNY Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant. \nAIBILEEN Minny, now, you listen to me. That baby gone be fine, and you ain't never gone lose your job. Mister Johnny told you that hisself. They's more book money coming. Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat. You hear me? You free, Minny! You are free. Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) You hear me? \nMINNY I hear you... The Leefolt front door opens. Elizabeth calls out. \nELIZABETH (O.C.) Aibileen? \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her. Elizabeth is two weeks WAY PAST DUE. \nAIBILEEN Good morning. Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table, drawing Aibileen's attention to it. \nHILLY Aibileen, the silver I lent Elizabeth last week. \n", "test1_input": "AIBILEEN (CONT'D) You drunk up two glasses a grape juice, I know you got to tee-tee. \nMAE MOBLEY Nooo. Mae Mobley shakes her head. \nAIBILEEN I give you a cookie if you go. Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Mae Mobley! You going! Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms into the bathroom in her finished dress. The hemline now slants in the other direction. \nELIZABETH Aibileen, the girls are pulling up, and the table isn't set! \nMAE MOBLEY Mae Mobley go, Momma! \nELIZABETH Get in your room! Right now! Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg. \nMAE MOBLEY I sorry. Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack of potatoes. Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her eyes have welled up. Aibileen mouths \"I love you\" and blows her a kiss. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom \"ranch\" is destined to become income property one day. FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two collapsible card tables arranged in the living room. Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waitin' on the Leefolts... Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly. \nCLOSE ON: Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK making sure it's hidden. \nAIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore. Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat. \nHILLY Hey, girls! \nYOUNG WOMEN \n(IN UNISON) Hey, Hilly! Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm. \nHILLY (over her shoulder) Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip. \nMISSUS WALTERS I'm not deaf yet, Hilly. Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a \"here we go\" look as she lowers Missus Walters into a chair. Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat. \nHILLY Aibileen, I want you to have this coat. It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive. Hilly extends the coat with a smile. \nHILLY (CONT'D) All yours. Aibileen takes the coat. \nAIBILEEN Thank you, Miss Hilly. \nHILLY Go on. Try it on. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nMinny plows through the swing door and reaches for Hilly's deviled eggs. Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short. \nAIBILEEN Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's. Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Gots to have paprika on `em. Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite. \nMINNY Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have to kill that woman. \nAibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair. \nAIBILEEN Watch yo mouth, Minny. \nMINNY Looks like a walking Christmas present with all them bows. Aibileen shakes with silent laughter. \nMINNY (CONT'D) And, now she gone to puttin' pencil marks on the toilet paper. \nAIBILEEN Oh, law! Did she? \nMINNY Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from my own damn house. That fool don't know. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME \nElizabeth and Hilly cackle with a group of girls as Missus Walters sits on the couch watching \"Guiding Light.\" Skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door. \nSKEETER Hey, girls. \nGIRLS \n(IN UNISON) Hey, Skeeter. JOLENE FRENCH, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter. \nJOLENE Well, if it isn't Long-Haul- Skeeter. We didn't think you'd ever leave Ole Miss. \nSKEETER Well, it's supposed to take four years, Jolene. Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by the cleaners and pick up my black dress. Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) What? \nHILLY About supper club tonight...Honey, Stuart had to cancel. \n", "test1_true": "HILLY He can't get off the rig, Skeeter. It's offshore! Stuart is a very successful oil man. \nSKEETER I'm starting to think this Stuart is a figment of your imagination. \nELIZABETH Raleigh called his cousin down in Hattiesburg. He'll drive up. \nSKEETER The cousin with one eye?! Elizabeth nods. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) I guess his black patch will match my dress. Just forget it. Skeeter storms off. Hilly glares at Elizabeth. \nHILLY One eye?! \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THE SAME DAY \nAibileen clears the dining table as bridge begins. Hilly, Elizabeth and Skeeter sit with Jolene. Skeeter takes a deep breath and belts out her news. \nSKEETER I got a job today... at The Jackson Journal! Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself. Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg. \nHILLY They'd be a fool not to hire you. Jolene raises her glass. \nJOLENE To Skeeter...and her job. Last stop `til marriage. Hilly kicks Jolene under the table. \nSKEETER The Miss Myrna column. Have y'all read it? \nHILLY Well, no! But, I bet the poor girls without any help, in South Jackson, read it like the King James. Everyone laughs. Skeeter's forehead crinkles. \nSKEETER Elizabeth, would you mind if I talk to Aibileen? To help me answer some of the letters? Just until I get a knack for it. Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing. Elizabeth gets very still. \nELIZABETH Aibileen? My Aibileen? What can't you just get Constantine to help you? Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head. \nSKEETER Constantine...quit us. \nELIZABETH HILLY What?! Oh, my gosh! Skeeter nods her head sadly. \nHILLY I'm so sorry, Skeeter. \nSKEETER I really don't want to talk about it. Okay? The girls nod. \nSKEETER (CONT'D) Anyway...I don't know how to answer these letters. Elizabeth looks to Aibileen. \nELIZABETH Well...I mean as long as it doesn't interfere with her work. A phone rings. Elizabeth nods to Aibileen. \nINT.

FOOTE ESTATE (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nCLOSE ON: Pink, fuzzy slippers anchoring bare, sexy legs stand on a black and white check floor. \nCELIA FOOTE (O.C.) Ah-hem. Hello, is Elizabeth in? Rising up a slim torso, sizeable cleavage bursts out of a pink robe's collar. \nAIBILEEN She having bridge club right now. May I take a message? CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country girl glory. She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in insecurity. \nCELIA Please tell her Celia Foote called again. I'll call back tomorrow. \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord. \nCELIA Ah-hem. Miss? \"Miss\" strikes Aibileen as very odd. \nCELIA (CONT'D) I'm looking for some help at my house. You know any maids looking? \nAIBILEEN No, ma'am. \nCELIA FOOTE Okay. Celia Foote. Emerson 6-8-4. Bye, now. Celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca- cola bottle. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAibileen enters the living room with a coffee pot. \nELIZABETH Who was that on the phone? \nAIBILEEN Miss Celia Foote called again. Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm. \nELIZABETH I've never called her back, Hilly. \nHILLY She can't take a hint, can she? \nJOLENE Who's Celia Foote? \nHILLY That tacky girl Johnny married. \nELIZABETH Girl? I heard she's twenty-eight. \n", "test2_input": "STUART The money's good. If that's what you really want to know. \nSKEETER That's not what I- Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on the front of the restaurant. Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube. \nSTUART Isn't that your old boyfriend, Hilly? Johnny Foote? Hilly scowls. \nSTUART (CONT'D) Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter than Delta asphalt. Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave. \nHILLY William! The Lieutenant Governor just walked in. Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns with Stuart's drink and the water backs. \nSTUART So, what do you do with your time? \nSKEETER I write a...a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal. Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink. \nSTUART You mean housekeeping? Skeeter nods and grabs her water. \nSTUART (CONT'D) Jesus, I can't think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column. Except maybe writing one. \nINT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME TIME \nHilly and William finish shaking hands with the Lieutenant Governor. As he walks away, Hilly shouts out. \nHILLY We'd love your support on election day! Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens. \nJOHNNY Hilly, you look lovely tonight. \nHILLY Thank you, Johnny. \nJOHNNY William, have you ever met Celia? William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand. \nWILLIAM Nice to meet you. Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm. \nHILLY Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners. Celia musters up all the courage inside her. \nCELIA FOOTE Hilly, did you ever get the messages that I've been calling you? \nHILLY I did not. \nCELIA FOOTE Well, I would love to help with the benefit. I have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed. \nHILLY \"Save the dates\" were mailed weeks ago...You didn't get one? Celia shakes her head. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh? \nHILLY (CONT'D) \n(TO WILLIAM) Now, come on, before they run out of Trout Almondine.

LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSTUART Sounds like a ploy to find a husband...becoming an expert on keeping house. \nSKEETER Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme. Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit. \nHILLY What'd we miss? \nSTUART Isn't that what you women from Ole Miss major in? Professional husband hunting? \nSKEETER I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant? Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands. \nHILLY Who? Is? Hungry? Skeeter stands. \nSKEETER Not me! A kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince.' Tables begin to stare. \nSTUART Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart! As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap. \nINT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING \nHilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes. Yule May lingers nervously. \nHILLY Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower. \nYULE MAY Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you and Mister William something. Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching her hands. \nYULE MAY (CONT'D) My twin boys finished high school, both on the honor roll...My husband and I have been saving for years to send them to college. \nHILLY Okay... Only now does William lower his paper. \nYULE MAY We are short seventy-five dollars on one of the tuitions. William stands up, kisses Hilly on the cheek. \nWILLIAM Well, I'm late. Gotta go. William leaves. \nHILLY Go on... \nYULE MAY Now...We're faced with having to choose. Which son gets to go...if we don't find all the money. Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May. \n", "test2_true": "HILLY That's not working for free, Yule May. That's paying off a debt. \nYULE MAY Yes, ma'am. \nHILLY As a Christian, I'm going to do you a favor. Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms. \nHILLY (CONT'D) God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able. You need to come up with this money on your own. You'll thank me one day. Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits. \nINT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNING \nMinny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually. Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while shopping) keep quietly to themselves. White women smile and chat with one another as they meander down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there. Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls Aibileen close as they peer around the corner. \nMINNY That's her. Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting produce. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Lord, she's trying to shop. Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato, hands it to Celia, and scurries away. \nCELIA \n(SHOUTS OUT) Thanks, Doll! \nMINNY Miss Celia just don't see `em. The lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly, nobody. Aibileen just nods. \nMINNY (CONT'D) What you so quiet for? I know you got a opinion `bout all this. \nAIBILEEN You gone accuse me a philosophizing. \nMINNY I ain't afraid a no philosophy. \nAIBILEEN I don't believe in lines anymore. Lines is in our heads `cause people like Miss Hilly try to make us believe they there. Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid. \nMINNY Oh, they there. I know. I get punished for crossing them. \nEXT. BUS STOP - MOMENTS LATER \nAibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store. \nAIBILEEN Lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband, you crossed a line...need to be punished. \nMINNY You know I ain't studying no line like that. \nAIBILEEN Cause it ain't there. `Cept in Leroy's head. Lines between black and white ain't there either. Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her groceries and prances toward her car. \nMINNY So, I ain't crossing no line if I tell Miss Celia she ain't good enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her she ain't in Miss Hilly's league? \nAIBILEEN All I'm saying is kindness don't have no boundaries. Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and a \nDAUGHTER, 8. Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a bench. \nAIBILEEN (CONT'D) Law, the Evers children have gotten so big! \nMINNY \n(QUIETLY) Cause they happy. Myrlie got her a good man...And you better not try to say they ain't no line between her Medgar and my Leroy. \nAIBILEEN No. You got me. A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first. \nEXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY \nAibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby shower. A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white linens and Hilly's best sliver. Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy pools. Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs with a sterling crumb scraper. Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last year's one piece. \nMAE MOBLEY Mae Mo hungry, Momma. Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up. \nELIZABETH She's always hungry. All the women laugh except for Skeeter. \nSKEETER You know she can hear you, Elizabeth? Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley. \nAIBILEEN I'm on cut you some cake, Baby. \nELIZABETH Aibileen, we gave that scraper to Hilly and William for their wedding present. Chantilly! \nAIBILEEN It so pretty. Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee. \nHILLY Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's? Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at Skeeter's red satchel. \nHILLY (CONT'D) Nice to have your own, isn't it? \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. \nHILLY Separate but equal. That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the Governor. \nSKEETER Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of modern day government. Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen. \nHILLY Aibileen, did you know that me and Mister Holbrook arranged for that bathroom? Sent the boys over and the equipment, too. Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something. Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it. \nAIBILEEN Yes, ma'am...And I thank you. Hilly smiles and nods. \n", "test3_input": "Celia yells at Minny for the very first time. \nCELIA (O.C.) I said go home, Minny! Minny sees water creeping out from under the door. She steps back and charges, shoulder first. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe bathroom door bursts open with splinters of wood. Minny slips in a pool of watered down blood. Celia sits against the wall in a bloody nightgown. \nMINNY Miss Celia! Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth. \nCELIA There's so much blood. Why is there so much blood this time? Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags. \nCELIA (CONT'D) Please, Minny. Will you get it out? I can't look at it again. Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can. She puts her hand on Celia's neck and pushes it down. \nMINNY Keep your head down. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE- BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nCelia lies in bed while Minny presses a cool rag to her forehead. Celia stares out of her bedroom window. \nCELIA'S POV: The two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn. A DOCTOR enters the room. \nDOCTOR Give her another pill if she gets too agitated. There'll be more bleeding, but don't call me unless it's heavy. Minny nods as the doctor leaves. \nCELIA We got married because I was pregnant. But it slipped out too. \nMINNY That's just God's way. Next one's gonna catch. \nCELIA Johnny wants kids now. I thought if I was real still, brought somebody in to do the house and cooking, maybe I'd hold on to this one. Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do with me? \nMINNY He gone have to get over this. He needs to know this takes time. \nCELIA He doesn't know about this one, or the one before... Minny turns to Celia, stunned by this revelation. \nCELIA FOOTE Minny, you know how to play bridge, don't you? Minny nods. \nMINNY Yes, ma'am. I used to help Missus Walters practice. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING \nAibileen holds a plate of grits covered in toasted marshmallows, strawberries and three lighted candles. \nAIBILEEN Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two today! Mae Mobley laughs as Aibileen sets down the grits. \nMAE MOBLEY Mae Mobley three! \nAIBILEEN You sure is, Baby Girl. Blow'em out `fo they run up in your grits. Mae Mobley blows out the candles. \nMAE MOBLEY How old are you, Aibiee? \nAIBILEEN Fifty-three. \nMAE MOBLEY Do you get burfdays? \nMae Mobley picks up a candle and licks off the grits. \nAIBILEEN Gone be fifty-four next week. \nMAE MOBLEY Do you have some babies? \nAIBILEEN I gots seventeen of `em. \nMAE MOBLEY Where are the babies? \nAIBILEEN They all over town. \nMAE MOBLEY Aibee...You're my real mama. \nAIBILEEN Now, you know who your momma is. \nMAE MOBLEY I'm your real baby, Aibee. Those other ones are just pretend. \nEXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT YARD - EARLY MORNING \nCelia digs a hole next to the two existing rosebushes. A closed shoebox and new rosebush wait to be planted. Celia lowers the box in the grave, covering it with dirt. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING \nCelia and Minny sit at a card table holding playing cards. Two additional hands lay face up on the table in front of two empty chairs across from them. Minny lays down one of her cards then looks over to Celia's hand. She removes a card from Celia's and lays it down. She then points to the hand next to Celia. Celia nods. \nINT. JUNIOR LEAGUE - MEETING HALL - DAY \nHilly stands at her podium, tan and ready to lead. She holds her gavel like a weapon. \nHILLY Okay. First order of business. We're updating our newsletter. Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back. \n", "test3_true": "HILLY (CONT'D) Now it's time to choose a new editor for our new modern monthly. Skeeter braces herself as hands pop up everywhere. Jolene French stands. \nJOLENE FRENCH I nominate Hilly Holbrook. Jolene looks back and snarls at Skeeter. \nHILLY Jolene, you're the sweetest thing! \nOTHER MEMBERS I second. I third. All in favor of Hilly, say \"Aye.\" The room erupts. \nMEMBERS Aye! Skeeter's ousting took less than ten seconds. Elizabeth secretly turns to Skeeter from a few rows ahead. \nELIZABETH \n(MOUTHING) I'm so sorry. \nEXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - FRONT PORCH - MORNING \nSkeeter sits alone on the porch swing in her nightgown, shifting through the Miss Myrna letters. Charlotte steps onto the porch. \nCHARLOTTE Honey, would you like me to drop you off at bridge club on the way to my doctor's appointment? \nSKEETER \n(COVERING) No, Ma'am. It's been cancelled. Mae Mobley's sick or something. \nINT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nBridge is underway at the Leefolt house. Aibileen enters holding a tray of coffee cups. Elizabeth, Hilly, Jolene and several other girls giggle as they kneel down behind furniture. \nAIBILEEN Everything okay? Elizabeth looks back. Her belly is huge. \nELIZABETH Shhh! There's a knock at door. \nCELIA (O.C.) Elizabeth, it's me, Celia Foote. I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by. The girls giggle more loudly now. Celia peers into the living room window. The bridge tables are in plain view. Celia's face grows pinker than her sweater. \nCELIA (CONT'D) I...brought you a chocolate pie...My maid, Minny, made it. Hilly's face hardens... \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - DAY \nMinny stands at the sink shelling peas. A distinct red cut is perched above her swollen eye. Celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie. \nCELIA They made me stand there like the vacuum man. Why, Minny? Minny freezes, keeping her face on the peas. \nMINNY Because they know about you getting knocked up by Mister Johnny. They mad you married one a they mens. Especially since Mister Johnny and Miss Hilly had just broke up, too. \nCELIA So, Hilly probably thinks I was fooling around with Johnny while they were still going steady. \nMINNY Missus Walters says Miss Hilly still sweet on Mister Johnny, too. Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement. \nCELIA No wonder! They don't hate me...They hate what they think I did! \nMINNY They hate you cause they think you're white trash! And don't be takin' pies to those women! \nCELIA Well, I'm just going to have to let Hilly know I'm not a boyfriend stealer. In fact, I'll tell her Friday night at the benefit. Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer. \nMINNY Now, Miss Celia...please don't be going to that benefit. Celia gets some ice out of the fridge. \nMINNY (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said? Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She looks at the cut above her eye. \nMINNY (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nCELIA That looks bad. \nMINNY I got to get my work done. \nCELIA I know you didn't fall in the tub, Minny. Let me take a look. Celia grabs Minny's hand. Minny pulls away. Just then Johnny pulls up in the driveway. Celia and Minny turn to the window, then spring into action. \nINT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMinny sits crouched on the lid of the guest bath toilet as Johnny chases Celia around the house. Celia giggles. \nJOHNNY (O.C.) Come here, Sexy! \nCELIA(O.C.) Johnny, you are bad! Bad! Bad! Minny looks at the ridiculous image of herself crouching on the toilet in the bathroom mirror. She raises Celia's ice rag up to her swollen eye. \nINT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT AFTERNOON \nSkeeter enters quietly through Aibileen's kitchen door. She is surprised to see twenty other black women standing solemnly around the kitchen and the living room. Aibileen approaches with a worried look. \nSKEETER What's wrong? \nAIBILEEN Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter. Gone be there four years. Minny shouts out across the kitchen. \nMINNY Hilly Holbrook been sent from the devil to ruirn all our lives. \nINT. HOLBROOK HOME (FLASHBACK) - LIVING ROOM - DAY \n"}

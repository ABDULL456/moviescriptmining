(dark with disgust) I just made this his most exciting game ever. 
Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as.. 
THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD 
A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until they reach 
97 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 97 
THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road. 
EDWARD The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there. 
BELLA 
(horrified) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of us! 
EDWARD 
(calmly) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow. 
He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING 
98 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 98 
Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated- 
BELLA I said, leave me alone! 
EDWARD Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please 
BELLA Get out! It's over. 
She SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned. 
CHARLIE Bella? What happened? 
BELLA I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. 
Bella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her 
99 INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99 
Bella slams the door behind her. REVEAL Edward's already there, pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against the door. 
BELLA (a pained whisper) I can't hurt him. 
Edward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK. 
INTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them. 
CHARLIE Bells. Did he hurt you? 
BELLA No, Dad. 
CHARLIE Then what? Did he break up with you? 
BELLA I broke up with him. 
CHARLIE I thought you liked him? 
BELLA That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home. 
EDWARD (whispering) I'll be in the truck. 
And he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into 
100 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STAIRS (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 100 
Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows. 
CHARLIE Your mother's not even in Phoenix. 
BELLA She'll come home. I'll call her from the road. 
CHARLIE You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning. 
BELLA I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise. 
She heads down the stairs. Charlie follows.. 
101 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101 
Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels. She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her. 
CHARLIE 
Bells, I know I'm not around much, 
but I can change that. We can do

The Russians put that Sputnik into outer space, the Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot Frank Costello in the head, and missed, and the Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barber shop in the Park Sheraton Hotel. It was total chaos. With Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese figures he's king shit, but Carlo Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both want to be boss of all bosses. So they call a meeting -- a big meeting. \n2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2 \nCREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps through the peaceful landscape. \nMANETTA (V.O.) It was the first time the whole commission was ever gonna meet face to face. Bosses and wiseguys were comin' in from all over the country, and all the New York families, too -- maybe sixty bosses, the whole wiseguy world -- all headin' toward this little town upstate to figure out what's what. \n3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3 \nA sign reads, \"Entering Apalachin - pop. 342.\" The black Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy, then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Your father and me, we were goin' up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.

Anyway, I don't know what anybody was thinking, but some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting at Joe Babara's farm in the country where nobody would notice. \n4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4 \nA local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks up and scratches his head at the unusual sight. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Turns out the local cops were watching Joe Babara like a hawk. So now you got about fifty Caddies and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin and some deputy sheriff with cow shit on his shoes notices all the traffic and calls the Feds. \n5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5 \nThe Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and greeting each other on the big front porch. \nOne WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car. \nWISEGUY You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away from the fuckin' car. \n6   EXT.

The Feds moved in -- \n7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              7 \nAgents with weapons drawn charge the house and start breaking down the front door. \n8    EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SAME TIME                                  8 \nMANETTA (V.O.) -- and we moved out. \nGangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows and leaping off balconies. \nWIDE - WISEGUYS \nfleeing into the surrounding woods and fields. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Your papa and me hid in a field with hay or corn, some kinda foliage, I don't know. \n9    EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY                                           9 \nTwo wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass. Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on them. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor, so your father hauls out his piece, this .44 cannon he used to carry, and hijacks the goddamn tractor. Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw. \n10   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         10 \nThe farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two wiseguys drive off on it. \nThe farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN. \nEND CREDITS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n11   SWIRLING CLOUD OF CREAM                                         11 \non top of an espresso.

RITZ CLAM BOX - LATE AFTERNOON (PRESENT) \nThe place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late forties, and a powerful boss in his own right. \nMANETTA Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now. \n", "test1_true": "They finish eating. \nMANETTA The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. This meeting is about how we're gonna survive. You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with. Everything's changing. We need a leader. Someone with fresh ideas. Someone like you. It's gonna be a new century, Paul. We gotta change with the times. \nVITTI What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site? \nMANETTA You remember what else happened in 1957, Paul? \nVITTI Yeah, I remember. \nMANETTA When your father died, I promised him I'd always look out for you.

Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost out the door when Vitti hesitates. \nVITTI Wait a second. I'm just gonna grab a toothpick. \nThe instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS. \nVitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind the counter, shielding him with his body. \nOutside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up with tears. \nCUT TO: \n12   KLEENEX                                                         12 \nbeing pulled out of a box. CAROLINE, a woman in her early thirties, dabs at her eyes with the tissue. She's sitting on the couch in -- \nINT. BEN'S OFFICE - SAME TIME \nThe office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated. \nCAROLINE (weepy) I kept telling him that I needed room to grow and find myself as a person. Not just as a woman but as an independent entity. \nBEN SOBOL \nher therapist, seems to be listening intently. \nCAROLINE I told him I needed to get in touch with my uniqueness, but he couldn't handle that. He said I was driving him away. Do you think I was driving him away, Dr. Sobol? \nBen leans forward sympathetically. \n(CONTINUED) \n12   CONTINUED:                                                       12 \nHe's in his mid-forties, has an expressive face and a quick wit, and despite the occasional lapse, he is a gifted and caring psychologist. \nBEN Things end, Caroline. That's just a part of life. It's how we deal with things ending that's important. \nCAROLINE I just can't believe it's over between me and Steve. Maybe there's still hope. \nBEN Well, he did take out a restraining order against you. I have to be honest, that's usually not a good sign. \nCAROLINE But what should I do? \nBEN Well, Caroline, I think the first thing you have to do... (voice rising) ... is stop whining about this pathetic loser! You're a tragedy queen! (mocking) 'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives a shit! Get a fucking life! You are, without a doubt, the most boring human being I have ever met! Please, say something interesting before I lapse into a goddamn coma! \nCaroline looks curiously at Ben, unperturbed. \nCAROLINE Dr. Sobol? \nBEN \nLost in his fantasy, not really listening.    He comes to attention and tries to cover. \n(CONTINUED) \n12   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               12 \nBEN Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting on your whole -- situation. It's very interesting what you were just saying. I want you to think about it, and I'm going to think about it, so we'll both think about it and we'll continue next week when I get back from my vacation. \nCaroline bursts into tears again. \nBEN Or not. \nCUT TO: \n13   INT.

His 14-year-old son MICHAEL is in his room putting on a tuxedo. \nMICHAEL You're late. \nBEN (changing hurriedly) I know. I couldn't get rid of my last patient. I think she was a tick in a past life. \nMICHAEL Yeah, what's Caroline's problem? Your boyfriend's gone, he hates your guts, get over it. \nBEN Michael! What did I tell you? You can't listen to my sessions! It's private stuff. \nMICHAEL I can't help it.

I can't piss off these big book stores. If I cancel, they'll stick me down on the bottom shelf. That's how they are. \nBEN Yeah, that's the word on the street. The self-help book business is full of vindictive pricks. \nDOROTHY (looking around) Ben!   The language. \nBEN I'm sorry, but I've been alone for eight years, now I've finally met someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and I would really like you to meet her before we get married. You're going to be her family. I think it's better she knows that up front. \nISAAC You're really hostile tonight. \nBEN I'm joking. \nDOROTHY (jumping in) I think I'll go talk to the mayor. \nBEN The mayor's here? \nDOROTHY I can only hope. \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               17 \nDorothy exits. \nISAAC What's wrong? \nBEN Nothing.

Fascinating actually. \nMICHAEL Dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout. \nBEN Thanks, Mike. \nISAAC Excuse us, Michael. \nIsaac pulls Ben into the foyer. \nISAAC Why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks? New York City is the Mecca of Madness. \nBEN I'm just not sure I could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid. \nISAAC It beats a guy with an ass full of flounder. \nBEN Trout! And don't minimize my practice. \nISAAC Why are you getting so defensive? This is about your own feelings of inadequacy. \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                  17 \nBEN You always turn it back on me. Why do you do that? \nISAAC Why do you think I do that? \nBEN Why do you think I think you do that? Go ahead, now you ask me why I think you think I think you do that. \nISAAC Enough. I want you to think about what I said. And when you're ready to talk to me like a normal person, I'll be at the piano with Regis Philbin.

I had a mild heart attack and now it's over. You understand? \nThe Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the pressure around his neck increases. \nVITTI If anyone asks you, you never saw me, and I was never here.

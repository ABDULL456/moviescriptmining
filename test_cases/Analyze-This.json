The Russians put that Sputnik into outer space, the Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot Frank Costello in the head, and missed, and the Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barber shop in the Park Sheraton Hotel. It was total chaos. With Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese figures he's king shit, but Carlo Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both want to be boss of all bosses. So they call a meeting -- a big meeting. \n2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2 \nCREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps through the peaceful landscape. \nMANETTA (V.O.) It was the first time the whole commission was ever gonna meet face to face. Bosses and wiseguys were comin' in from all over the country, and all the New York families, too -- maybe sixty bosses, the whole wiseguy world -- all headin' toward this little town upstate to figure out what's what. \n3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3 \nA sign reads, \"Entering Apalachin - pop. 342.\" The black Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy, then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Your father and me, we were goin' up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.

Anyway, I don't know what anybody was thinking, but some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting at Joe Babara's farm in the country where nobody would notice. \n4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4 \nA local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks up and scratches his head at the unusual sight. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Turns out the local cops were watching Joe Babara like a hawk. So now you got about fifty Caddies and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin and some deputy sheriff with cow shit on his shoes notices all the traffic and calls the Feds. \n5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5 \nThe Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and greeting each other on the big front porch. \nOne WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car. \nWISEGUY You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away from the fuckin' car. \n6   EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME                                        6 \nFederal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed, wearing big FBI arm bands. \nMANETTA (V.O.) The meeting never even got started. The Feds moved in -- \n7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              7 \nAgents with weapons drawn charge the house and start breaking down the front door. \n8    EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SAME TIME                                  8 \nMANETTA (V.O.) -- and we moved out. \nGangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows and leaping off balconies. \nWIDE - WISEGUYS \nfleeing into the surrounding woods and fields. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Your papa and me hid in a field with hay or corn, some kinda foliage, I don't know. \n9    EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY                                           9 \nTwo wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass. Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on them. \nMANETTA (V.O.) Then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor, so your father hauls out his piece, this .44 cannon he used to carry, and hijacks the goddamn tractor. Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw. \n10   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         10 \nThe farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two wiseguys drive off on it. \nThe farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN. \nEND CREDITS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n11   SWIRLING CLOUD OF CREAM                                         11 \non top of an espresso. PULL BACK as a hand reaches in and runs a lemon rind along the rim of the cup. The espresso is picked up and sipped by MANETTA, the aging boss of a prominent New York crime family. \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                      11 \nINT. RITZ CLAM BOX - LATE AFTERNOON (PRESENT) \nThe place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late forties, and a powerful boss in his own right. \nMANETTA Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now. \nMICHAEL Okay, okay. How's that guy who dreams about shitting trout? \nBEN (entering, putting on his tux shirt) Fine. He moved up to striped bass. Put on your cummerbund. Boy, have you grown. Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant? \nMICHAEL (struggling with the cummerbund) Why do we have to wear rented clothes to Grandpa's party? This blows. \nBEN (helping him) We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable. (looks at Michael and makes a quick decision) Forget the tux. Regular clothes. \nBen exits, pulling off the tux shirt. \nMICHAEL (taking off his tux shirt) Are you ambivalent about Grandpa Isaac? \nBEN (O.S.) (from his room) Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff? \nMICHAEL Mom. \nBEN (annoyed) She's not supposed to do that, you know.

So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth. (comes back into Michael's room) Did she say anything about me getting married again? I think she could be feeling a little anger about it. \nMICHAEL Oh, yeah. She really cares. She says you're intimidated by women your own age, and that's why you go for these young babes. \nBEN (fuming) Okay. Listen, for two seconds, pretend I'm not your father. I'm just some guy, okay? \nMICHAEL You gonna vent? \nBEN Yeah. (venting) I hate her! I really hate her! (a beat, then brightly) Okay. Dad again. Let's go. \nCUT TO: \n14   EXT. WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME                                        14 \nPaul Vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse with his most trusted soldier, Jelly, a hulking bruiser, and his sidekick JIMMY, a tightly-wound ferret with chips on both shoulders. \nVITTI So what did you find out? \n(CONTINUED) \n14    CONTINUED:                                                       14 \nJELLY (as they walk) The word is Primo Sindone must have ordered it, but, uh -- \nHe hesitates. \nVITTI What? \nJelly looks at Jimmy. \nVITTI What? \nJELLY (reluctantly) A lot of people think you set him up. \nVITTI Why the fuck would I want to kill Dominic? He was like a father to me. \nJELLY So you could be the big boss. Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting. \nVITTI Oh, is that what they figure? \nJELLY It's alright with me if you did -- \nVITTI I didn't kill him! I told you that! Don't you hear? \nCUT TO: \n14A   INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               14A \nThey enter a room where other Vitti family soldiers, EDDIE COKES, TUNA, and JOHNNY BIGS are waiting. In the middle of the room, a young rat named NICKY SHIVERS is tied to a chair under a strong overhead light. When he speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence. \n(CONTINUED) \n14A   CONTINUED:                                                      14A \nNICKY Please, Mr. Vitti, I told 'em I don't know anything but they don't believe me 'cause that one time I said Little Joe hit Dukey and it turned out he didn't but I didn't know because -- \nJIMMY (smacks him) Shut the fuck up! \nNicky goes suddenly quiet. He watches in terror as Jimmy steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length of lead pipe. \nVITTI Nicky, you know me, right? \nNICKY Yeah.   You're Mr. Vitti. \nVITTI And you know what I'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right? \nNICKY Uh, you're gonna crack me on the head with that pipe? \nJIMMY (slaps him) It's a rhetorical question, you fuckin' idiot. \nVITTI I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Who killed Dominic Manetta? \nNICKY I don't know. \nVITTI (roars) Don't fuckin' lie to me! \nNICKY (in tears) Honest to God, I don't know! \nVITTI You little rat bastard... \nJELLY Anything. \nVITTI You have to find me a doctor. \nJELLY We just came from the doctor. \nVITTI Not that kind of doctor.   I need a head doctor. \nJELLY You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black? Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig. \nVITTI Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud. Do I have to spell everything out? \nJELLY It saves time. \nVITTI I need you to find me a psychiatrist. \nJELLY Wow. This is like the Psychic Network or something. I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually he ran into me. \nVITTI Is he any good? \nJELLY Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy. He had a business card and everything -- \nVITTI He had a card? That's a real fuckin' achievement. \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED:                                                        21 \nJELLY What do you need a shrink for anyway? \nVITTI It's not for me. It's for a friend. This friend is having some problems, so I'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend. \nJELLY Got it. \nVITTI And nobody can know. If anyone hears I'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way. You know what I mean? \nJELLY Of course. Absolutely. (then) Can I ask you one thing? \nVITTI What? \nJELLY This friend.    Is it me? \nCUT TO: \n22   INT. BEN'S OFFICE - DAY                                           22 \nBen is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung milquetoast in his late forties. \nBEN Carl, I'm detecting a pattern here. You seem to settle too easily for things. \nCARL You're right.    I do. \nBEN No, well, there you go. You just did it again. I suggested something and you immediately agreed. \n(CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED:                                                        22 \nCARL You're right.    I did. \nBEN Why do you think you do that? \nCARL I don't know. \nBEN Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl. And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. Stand your ground. Don't let people roll over you. \nThe door opens and Jelly enters. \nJELLY Dr. Sobol? \nBEN Excuse me!    I'm in a session here. \nJELLY Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. \nBEN You're... You're one of the guys I rear-ended the other night. \nJELLY Bingo. (to Carl) Get outta here. \nJelly takes Carl by the elbow and lifts him off the couch. \nJELLY Upsa-daisy.   You got a coat, nutbar? \nBEN What are you doing? \nJELLY He's leaving. \n(CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 22 \nBEN The hell he is. He's not going anywhere until we're done with his session. \nJelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket, removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of fifties. \nJELLY (to Carl) I'll give you a hundred bucks to get out of here. \nCarl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive look. \nBEN Don't take it, Carl. \nCarl looks back to Jelly. \nBEN Panic attacks. \n(CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED:    (6)                                              22 \nVITTI What's with all you doctors and the fuckin' panic? Did I say panic? \nBEN Not panic. Dizzy -- breathing -- chest pain attacks. \nVITTI Right. So the question is, what can he do to make it stop? \nBen decides to go for it. \nBEN I'm going to go out on a limb here. I think your friend is you. \nVITTI You -- you -- you -- you have a gift, my friend. Go on. \nBEN Medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy. \nVITTI With you? \nBEN (hedging) With me? Oh, I don't know. I'd have to look at my schedule. I'm very heavily booked right now and I'm going on a short vacation tomorrow. \nVITTI Where you going? \nBEN I don't really share that information with... \nVITTI Where? \nBEN Miami Beach. \n(CONTINUED) \n22    CONTINUED:    (7)                                                 22 \nVITTI You know, this could be good. Just getting that off my chest, I feel better already. It's like a load is off my shoulders. Thank you. \nBEN Well, I really didn't do anything -- \nVITTI You did something. The load? Off. Where is it? Don't know. You're good, Doctor. I'll be in touch. But listen to me. (leaning close, menacing) If I talk to you and it turns me into a fag, I'll kill you. You understand? \nBEN Could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up -- \nVitti silences him with a wave of his hand. \nVITTI I go fag, you die. Got it? \nBEN Yes. \nVitti gives Ben a little pat on the cheek, then turns and exits. Ben is stunned. \nCUT TO: \n23    OMITTED                                                           23 \n23A   EXT.

Hey, Dad? One thing though. \nBEN Yeah? \nMICHAEL I go fag, you die. \nBEN Michael! That's it!      I am sealing that vent. \nMICHAEL You are so cool, Dad. Was that really Paul Vitti? \nBEN (throwing the bags in the car) I didn't ask to see his Mafia decoder ring, but yeah, it was him. And you cannot tell anyone he was here.

We could take him out with a rifle and a scope, but I don't have any of that shit with me. My scope's in the shop... Nah, it's a warranty item... Hey, don't sweat it.

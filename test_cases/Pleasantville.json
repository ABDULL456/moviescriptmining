{"train": "Pleasantville - by Gary Ross - October 7, 1996 \nPLEASANTVILLE \nA Fairytale by Gary Ross \nOctober 7, 1996 \n\"He was part of my dream of course but then I was part of his dream too.\" \n- Lewis Carroll \"Through the looking glass\" \nFADE IN: \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY. \nA college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high school seniors about their future. \nCOLLEGE COUNSELOR ... For those of you going on to college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop from thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs will go down as well ... \nThere is some rustling in the audience. \nCOLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT) Obviously, my friends, it's a competitive world and good grades are your only ticket through. By the year Two Thousand  ... \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS. \nA different teacher lectures a different class of students. \nHEALTH TEACHER ... The chance of contracting HIV from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty. The odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred. (beat) Now this marks a drastic increase ... \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS. \nSame angle. Different teacher. \nSCIENCE TEACHER ... From just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level. By the time you are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees. Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine. \nREVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS. \nThey stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth. Nobody moves ... \nSCIENCE TEACHER (chipper classroom tone) Okay. Who can tell me what famine is? \nCUT TO: \nBirds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in beautiful BLACK AND WHITE. \nMAN'S VOICE (OS) Honey, I'm home. \nSUBURBAN HOME. \nGEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a tour guide at Disneyland. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (OS) Hello darling. \nWIDER. \nMRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek. \nBETTY How was your day? \nGEORGE Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought. \nBETTY Oh darling that's wonderful! (an adoring gaze) I always knew you could do it. \nWAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. \n1996 -- (LIVING COLOR) \nDAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants, black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly ... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never taking his eyes off the show. \nGEORGE (OS) (on T.V.) Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell? (sniffing) Is that your meat loaf? \nDAVID (by rote) \"It might be ...\" \nBETTY (OS) (shy smile) It might be. \nHe leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek. \nGEORGE (OS) Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to this man's heart. \nThere is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room. \nDAVID'S MOM (OS) ... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the deal \nINT. KITCHEN. \nDavid's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand. Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix her age. \nDAVID'S MOM No--you have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend ... (pause) I don't care if yesterday was the thirtieth, this is still the first weekend. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. \nHer words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the show. \nDAVID'S MOM (OS) No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to go to La Costa ... (beat) Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's really my business, isn't it? \nHe reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at an unnaturally high volume. \nGEORGE (on T.V.) Hey. Where are those kids? \nDAVID (reciting--a little louder) \"Right behind you father.\" \nBUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER (on T.V.) Right behind you father. \nRESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE) \nThe Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud has on a Letterman's sweater. \nMARYSUE Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little surprise for you. \nBETTY What's that Bud? \nHOWARD (weighing it) A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night? \nDAVID Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon. \nCUT TO: \nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. \nDavid's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends are hanging out. \nKIMMY Omigod, it's so mortifying, being related to him. I can't believe you're like-- \nJENNIFER Only on my parent's side. \nKIMMY I know, but you're like ... twins and stuff. (beat) You must be from like, the cool side of the uterus. \nA group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen year olds. The girls freeze when they see them. \nKIMMY (CONT) Omigod, omigod--here they come. \nCHRISTIN Don't do anything. Just don't like--do anything ... \nJENNIFER (cooly) Hi Mark. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nHe pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan Pathfinder like a small summit conference. \nMARK (to Jennifer) Hey. \nJENNIFER (right back) Hey. \nBeat ... \nMARK'S LACKEYS (to Jennifer's lackies) Hey. \nJENNIFER'S LACKEYS (back to them) Hey. \nMARK Saw you at the mall yesterday. \nJENNIFER Yeah ... Saw you too. \nEveryone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything. \nJENNIFER (CONT) So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight? \nMARK Yeah. (beat) \nJennifer pauses, weighing the next statement. \nJENNIFER My mom'll be out of town. \nKimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster. \nMARK So uh ... Maybe we could uh ... \nJENNIFER (smiling) Cool. \nMARK (nodding faster) Cool. \nVARIOUS LACKEYS Cool. \nEverybody bobs and shuffles for \u0094 beat, when Mark nods, summoning his flock. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK. \nlt is a south-westem version of \"Leave it to Beaver.\" The uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of hell. \nJENNIFER (VO) ... I know, I know--He's just like so FINE ... I'm still like: \"Omigod.\" \nINT. WAGNER HOME. \nlt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the cordless phone attached to her ear. \nJENNIFER It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like: \"Well my Mom'll be out of town.\" And he's like \"Well then, maybe we could-- you know ...\" And I'm like \"Yeah, sure.\" And he's like \"Well, cool.\" (beat) I know, he's just so smart. (pause ...) I don't know. Maybe that black thing I just got. (pause ...) It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute. (pause ... ) Well, \"hello?\" He's not coming  over here to study ... (beat) I know. Well I'm jealous of you too sometimes. \nINT. DAVID'S BEDROOM. \nlt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside with a cordless phone in his hand. \nDAVID ... He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives. (pause ...) Well it's a silly question. (pause ...) Because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville. \nREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. \nHis mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her Mercedes. \nDAVID ... because that's just not what it's like. \nShe fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway... \nDAVID (CONT) Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty. I gotta go. \nINT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM. \nThe huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from the other direction, fiddling with her clothes. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nThey hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at each other in shock. \nJENNIFER (stunned) What are you doing? \nDAVID What are you doing? \nNeither one moves. They clutch the remote together. \nJENNIFER David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes. \nDAVID Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty. \nCLOSER. \nHe flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while Jennifer and David stare at him warily ... \nDAVID (beat) How much does it cost? \nDICK VAN DYKE Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free. \nJENNIFER Free? \nDICK VAN DYKE Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do. \nThere is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first. The house rattles for a moment then is quiet. \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) Well, I better get going. Your show's almost on, and ... (smiling at Jennifer) It's almost time for your date. \nHe places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he looks back at them and smiles. \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) (grinning) Take care now. \nThere is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his head. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nDavid glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he picks it up. \nCLOSER. \nDavid points the remote toward the TV set with an apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then pushes one of the buttons. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nThe TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an angry housewife screams at a transvestite! \nDAVID Hunh. \nIt ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time the channel changes. \nDAVID (CONT) (relaxing) Great. \nHe continues to press the button, flipping through the channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches for the remote. \nJENNIFER Lemme see that. \nDAVID No way. \nHe continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on the Pleasantville Marathon. \nBUD'S VOICE fills the room. \nBUD (OS) (on TV) Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow your transistor radio? \nMARY SUE (OS) (on TV) I promised Betty Jane she could use it over the weekend. \nFULL SHOT. TV SET. \"PLEASANTVILLE\" (BLACK AND WHITE) \nBud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control. \nANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER. \nShe tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction. \nJENNIFER Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life. \nDAVID Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this. \nBUD (OS) (on TV) \"But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a transistor in to electric shop.\" \nMARY SUE (OS) (on TV) \"And I told Betty Jean she could have it for the picnic with Roy.\" \nJENNIFER (yanking at it) God, David. Just give it to me! \nDAVID (yanking it back) Get lost! \nJENNIFER YOU get lost! \nWIDER. LIVING ROOM. \nShe tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands. David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT. \nA huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets sucked into the TV. \nWIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM. \nIt is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight. \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY. \nDavid and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They still clutch the remote control in the exact same position that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE... \nDAVID (a whisper) Oh my God. \nJENNIFER What happened? \nDAVID I'm not sure. \nWIDER \nGeorge Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots. \nGEORGE (as if to his own children) Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a move on, you're gonna be late for school. \nHe continues to cross through the living room whistling into the kitchen ... \nJENNIFER (desperately) What did you do? \nDAVID I don't know. \nJENNIFER (examining her black and white skin) Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty! \nINT. KITCHEN. \nDavid and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them: \nTHEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN. \nEvery breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table. There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs. Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham. The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children. \nGEORGE (once again) Morning kids. Better get a move on or you're going to be late for school. \nThey nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare straight ahead as their \"mother\" adds some waffles to the heap. \nDAVID (under his breath) I don't believe this. \nJENNIFER Neither do I. \nGEORGE Well, c'mon. Dig in. \nDavid and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves. \nBETTY (to Jennifer) I put blueberries in them just the way you like. \nJENNIFER Actually--I'm not real ... hungry. \nBETTY (big smile) Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast. \nShe takes Jennifer by the shoulders and \"guides\" her into the chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES. \nBETTY (CONT) (oppressively chipper) Here. Why don't you have some waffle cakes. (beat) And there's sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon ... (beat) ... And a ham steak. \nBetty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge slab of butter. \nBETTY (CONT) ... And of course, a nice big bowl of oatmeal. \nJennifer hesitates then glances over at her \"mother\" who looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a forkful of the oozing mess ... \nCUT TO: \nFULL SHOT. PAT BOONE. \nHe stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958. The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a letterman's sweater and button down shirt ... \nPAT BOONE \"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity ... Oh rooty.\" \nHe CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and lilting melody ... \nPAT BOONE (CONT) \"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ...\" \nSERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE. \nThe MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image of this strange \"Utopia.\" The effect is a weird, sanitizied version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video. There are men tipping their hats and women walking their dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen. \nPAT BOONE (VO) (slowly ...) \"... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom.\" \nPruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs. \nJENNIFER I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God. \nDAVID Just take deep breaths. \nJENNIFER All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something. \nJennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from side to side--totally absorbed. \nJENNIFER (CONT) I still don't see why we're doing this. \nDAVID We're supposed to be in school. \nJENNIFER We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color! (wailing) Oh God ... \nA man calls out from across the street. \nMR. SIMPSON Hello Bud. \nDAVID Hello Mr. Simpson. \nMR. SIMPSON Hear your Dad got a new car. \nDAVID Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell. \nJENNIFER You know him? \nDAVID Owns the hardware store. \nJENNIFER Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR! \nDAVID We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ... \nJENNIFER Play along? \nDAVID Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue. \nJENNIFER (ripping the barette from her hair) No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you! \nDAVID We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. \nJENNIFER Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT? \nDAVID To who? \nJen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the block. \nWIDER. \nJennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN) \nThey work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing across one of the lawns, in full \"emergency response\" anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a tree. \nFIREMAN C'mere, kitty ... \nBIFF (OS) Bud ... \nWIDER. \nBiff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero-- somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut. \nBIFF (a little nervous) Hi ya Bud. \nBUD Hi ya Biff. \nHe fidgets nervously for a moment looking down. \nBIFF Can I ask you a question? \nBUD Sure. \nBIFF Well ... If I was to ask your sister ... What I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue ... \nDAVID Oh God! Are we in that episode? \nBIFF What? \nDAVID I don't believe it. \nBIFF What's the matter? \nDAVID You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ... \nBIFF Yeah ... How'd you know? \nDAVID (shaking his head) Lucky guess. (beat) Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ... \nBiff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David. \nDAVID (CONT) What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little \"different\" lately ... \nBIFF (stunned) She won't go out with me? \nDAVID I didn't say that. It's just that right now ... \nBIFF I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ... \nAll at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out. \nWIDE ANGLE. GYM. \nPlay comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE, DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT. \nSHOT. DAVID. \nHe retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff. David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other side of the gym. \nDAVID (under his breath) Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something. \nBiff looks at him, troubled. \nDAVID (CONT) Honest. It'll be fine. \nBiff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR. LATER ... \nDavid stands off to the side with his sister, while class pours out around them. \nJENNIFER No way. \nDAVID One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack. \nJENNIFER It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank? \nDAVID What? \nJENNIFER I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them. \nDAVID What were you doing in a library? \nJENNIFER I got lost. (beat) Oh here ... look at this! \nShe reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches. Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire. \nDAVID JENNIFER! \nJENNIFER Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ... \nSure enough the tissue has become flame retardant. \nDAVID Jen, listen ... \nJENNIFER (trembling) I like--really need a cigarette, too. \nDAVID (putting his arm around her) I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. \nShe looks over at him, slowly. \nJENNIFER You really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if I don't have a chocolate malt with this guy. \nAt that moment, three of Mary Sue's \"friends\" come tittering around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of wind-up toys. \nPEGGY JANE (high-pitched--rapid fire) You won't believe what we just heard. \nLISA ANNE Biff Martin's going to ask you out. \nBETTY JEAN And that's not all ... \nPEGGY JANE No, that's not all ... \nALL THREE TOGETHER He's going to give you his pin! \nThey explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer looks over at David. \nDAVID Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. \nMr. Johnson stares at him. \nDAVID (CONT) Really. It's fine. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE. \nThe screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her \"girlfriends\" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing against him as she goes. \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all over his chest. \nFULL SHOT. TABLE. \nBiff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross between Troy Donahue and a mannequin. \nBIFF (haltingly) I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue. \nJENNIFER (full blown \"Mary Sue\") Well \"gee whizz\" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me. \nHe guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again. \nBIFF I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ... \nJENNIFER Really Biff? The keenest? \nBIFF Oh yeah. \nJENNIFER (all sarcasm) Gosh. I hardly know what to say. \nDAVID (OS) What can I get you two? \nWIDER. \nHe stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty angle with large white apron tied around his neck. \nBIFF Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke. \nMore goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the same dopey countenance. \nJENNIFER Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a salad and an Evian Water. \nHe shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him. \nJENNIFER (CONT) Cheeseburger it is. \nANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID. \nHe glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an eye on the table the entire time ... \nRESUME. TABLE. \nBiff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him. She's still trying to do her best \"Mary Sue.\" \nBIFF See the whole time we were in civics together, I really wanted to sit next to you--but you were always sitting between Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne. \nThere is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond. \nBIFF (CONT) ... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on \"Our Town Hall.\" Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about. \nJENNIFER Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think? \nBIFF Hunh? (goony laugh) Oh, right ... \nHe still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' \"MISTY\" starts up all over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself. \nBIFF (CONT) So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important. \nJENNIFER Oh, gosh no. \nBIFF I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you? \nJENNIFER Oh you bet. (beat) Will you excuse me for a sec? \nJennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom. \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister practically stumbles through the bathroom door. \nINT. BATHROOM. \nOf course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way to the sink and leans against the counter. \nJENNIFER Jesus Chirist ... \nShe turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open. \nGIRL'S VOICES (overlapping) \"Did he give it to you ... Did he give it to you ... I bet he gave it to her ... Did he give it to you?\" \nJENNIFER (straight ahead) I don't think he knows how. \nThey TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It sounds like an aviary. \nLISA ANNE I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's Lane. \nPEGGY JANE I bet he is. I bet he is. \nBETTY JEAN I bet he's even gonna hold her hand! \nThey TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head. \nINT. SODA SHOP. \nDavid is standing beside their table as she retums from the bathroom. \nDAVID (chipper) Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes. (pointedly) If you need anything, I'll be right over there. \nJENNIFER (Mary Sue) Gee whiz \"Bud\", what could we possibly need when we have each other? \nA Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is completely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the backseat. The car is rocking. \nINT. CAR. \nThey are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings desperately to the steering wheel. \nBIFF (some terror) I think I better go home now Mary Sue ... \nShe holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard. \nJENNIFER (breathless) ... Why? \nBIFF (more terror) I think ... I might be ill ... \nHe glances down at his lap a little confused. \nBIFF (CONT) (a whisper) I think something's happening to me. \nHe looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up and grabs a handful of his hair. \nJENNIFER It's s'posed to happen, Biff. \nBIFF It is? \nJENNIFER Trust me ... \nHe looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down, and OUT OF FRAME ... \nCUT TO: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT. \nA single light is burning in the kitchen window. \nBETTY (OS) Do you want some more cookies? \nINT. KITCHEN. \nDavid is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs all over the table. \nDAVID (sick) Oh no ... I'm fine. \nBETTY How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares? \nDAVID I'm fine. \nThere is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up. \nBETTY Now who could that be. \nFOLLOWING DAVID. \nHe crosses into the foyer ahead of his \"parents.\" David swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the porch. \nDAVID Oh hi! \nMR. JOHNSON Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay. \nDAVID Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early. \nMr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone of voice. \nMR. JOHNSON Bud ... \nDAVID Yeah ... \nMR. JOHNSON (sotto) You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors. \nDAVID Yeah ... \nMR. JOHNSON (proud) Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself. \nCLOSER. \nMr. Johnson has a strange look of \"manly pride\" on his face. His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little. There is a sudden sparkle in his eye. \nMR. JOHNSON (more confidential) Not only that, I didn't even do it in the same order. First I lowered the shades, then I closed the register. \nHe looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance behind him. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) Oh, hello Betty. \nBETTY Hello Bill. \nNeither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and his new found virility. \nDAVID (quickly) Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ... really appreciate it. \nHe turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's convertible pulls up at the curb. \nINT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER. \nShe looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT OF FRAME). \nJENNIFER Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really wonderful time. \nANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR. \nHe sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit with a couple of thousand volts. \nBIFF ... Me too. \nShe leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff smiles back. \nEXT. CAR. \nShe climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr. Johnson as she heads up the walk. \nJENNIFER (sweetly) Hello Mr. Johnson. \nMR. JOHNSON Oh, hello Mary Sue. \nShe is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch. David grabs her arm. \nCLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER. \nHe looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair. \nJENNIFER I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the flagpole. \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nIt is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY. \nIt is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother sits at her side. \nDR. HENDERSON Let me see it again. \nLisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE. Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her tongue literally gleams with color. \nDR. HENDERSON (CONT) (examining it) Well ... I don't think it's anything to worry about ... It'll probably just clear up by itself. (to Lisa Anne) Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate. No french fries, that kind of thing. (aside/ to the Mother) It's just a \"teenage\" thing. \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nIt is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the edge of the lake as the REAL (AND NASTY) VERSION OF TOOTY FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS: \nLIL RICHARD (VO) \"... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She knows just what to do ...\" \nSERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE) \nPARKER LIVING ROOM. \nTOOTY FRUITY CONTINUES AS DAVID FLIPS FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS LOOKING FOR DICK VAN DYKE. THERE IS ONLY A PEPSODENT COMMERCIAL. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD ... \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...) \nThe Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half. The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ... \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...) \nDavid examines the back of the TV set ... \nINT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...) \nA large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in \"2001\". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ... \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...) \nDavid sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ... \nLIL RICHARD (OS) \"... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam boom!\" \nSODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID. \nHe heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He shakes his head. \nSODA SHOP. \nThe place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air. Somebody has played the flip side. \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return to normal. David shakes his head. \nFOLLOWING HIM. \nHe crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder. \nDAVID What'll it be? \nBIFF (still chipper as ever) Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke. \nBud has already written it down. He glances over at his sister. \nJENNIFER Me too. Sounds swell. \nDAVID (pointed) Really? It seems so fattening. \nBefore she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson. \nDAVID (CONT) Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes. \nMR. JOHNSON (staring straight ahead) There aren't any cheeseburgers. \nDAVID (exasperated) Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ... \nMR. JOHNSON Oh--what's the point, Bud? \nCLOSER. \nMr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness in his eyes. David grabs his arm. \nDAVID C'mere. \nHe pulls him along the counter toward a little office storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the door. \nINT. STOREROOM. \nIt is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a happy family motoring in their Rambler. \nDAVID What did you say? \nMr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion. \nMR. JOHNSON Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore. \nDAVID What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point! \nMR. JOHNSON No I know ... I know I do ... (he pauses, then looks up) But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ... \nDAVID Just listen to me ... \nEXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ... \nDavid walks away from the center of town looking down at his plaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge when a young woman comes up beside him. \nGIRL'S VOICE Hi Bud ... \nWIDER. \nShe is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school, and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure. Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence. \nMARGARET That was sure swell ... \nDAVID Oh. Thanks, Margaret. \nMARGARET (smiling) I baked you my oatmeal cookies. \nDAVID (vaguely remembering an episode) Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. \nMARGARET No. I baked them for you. \nDAVID No. You baked them for Whitey. \nMARGARET (low and gutteral) No. I baked them for you. \nAll at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her mouth is inches away from his. \nDAVID Um ... thanks. \nDavid can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment, unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville smile. \nMARGARET See ya. \nShe turns and heads around the comer, while David just watches her dumbstruck. \nCUT TO: \nSODA SHOP. DUSK. \nDavid heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat. The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to \"hip\" '50s JAZZ. DAVE BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside. \nSODA SHOP. \nThe place has \"morphed\" even more. If it was a teenage hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house now. Brubeck's \"TAKE FIVE\" plays in the background while several patrons talk \"intensely\" in their booths. \nDOORWAY. \nDavid walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table. Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him. \nJENNIFER (in a whisper) I had nothing to do with that fire. \nDAVID (quietly) It's okay. \nJENNIFER Not directly anyhow ... \nDAVID It's fine. \nDavid glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at him, with a weird expression of awe. \nJENNIFER (still under her breath) Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ... \nDAVID Sure. \nHe crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at him. It's like Elvis has entered the building. \nDAVID (CONT) How you doin? \nVARIOUS KIDS Swell ... \nThey keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ... \nBOY How'd you know about the fire? \nDAVID What? \nBOY How'd you know how to put it out and all? \nDavid hesitates, weighing his words. \nDAVID Well--where I used to live ... That's just what firemen did. \nThis sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward. \nBOY And where's that? \nDAVID (carefully) Um ... Outside of Pleasantville. \nThis sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids. It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A hush descends. \nBOY What's outside of Pleasantville? \nDAVID Look it doesn't matter. It's not important. \nBOY What is it? \nDavid stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word. \nDAVID It's really not important. \nGIRL'S VOICE (OS) What's outside of Pleasantville? \nREVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY. \nMargaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the same excitement as the others, it just means so much more. \nMARGARET (CONT) (hungry for knowledge) C'mon. Tell us ... \nShe stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might as well be touching him. \nDAVID (slowly) Well ... There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going. \nThere's an excited giggle. They lean forward. \nBob takes a belt of his drink ... \nBIG BOB George, everyone likes you. \nGEORGE Oh well ... \nBOB No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ... \nGEORGE (heartfelt) Thank you very much. \nBOB And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it. \nGEORGE No. Of course not. \nBOB (big patriarchal smile) And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce. \nGEORGE (stunned/ moved) Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say. \nBOB (smiling) Why don't you start by saying \"yes,\" and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs. \nGEORGE Oh sure ... You bet. (calling out) Betty ... \nThere is no answer. \nGEORGE (CONT) (louder this time) BETTY ... \nStill no answer. \nGEORGE (CONT) BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ... \nWIDER. \nGeorge turns around to see David, standing on the landing, listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a moment ... \nDAVID I'll get her. \nHe moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him. \nINT. KITCHEN. \nDavid gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across the room to see: \nREVERSE ANGLE. \nBetty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen counter. \nDAVID (approaching slowly) Are you okay? \nShe doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on her shoulder. \nDAVID (CONT) Are you alright? \nBetty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED. SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains on either side of her face. \nBETTY (fighting tears) What am I going to do? \nDavid moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering. \nDAVID It's okay. It's alright. \nBETTY (trembling) I can't go out there. How can I go out there? \nShe looks right up at David. \nBETTY (CONT) (quieter) Look at me ... \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nHe stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile. \nDAVID Have you got any make up? \nBETTY In my handbag. \nHe crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex. \nDAVID Okay--first we'll dry you out a little. \nHe dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude, Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY powder puff. \nCLOSER. \nIt is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup, she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips. \nREVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER. \nHe works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back. All at once, David seems to wince: \nREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE. \nThe life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the fictional version of herself all over again. \nBETTY (off his reaction) What? \nDavid shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her face, turning her head first right, then left. \nBETTY (CONT) (beat) Does it look okay? \nDAVID Looks just like it did. \nBETTY And they won't be able to tell? \nDAVID (even quieter) No ... They won't be able to tell. \nBetty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide \"stewardess\" smile ... \nDAVID (CONT) Wait. \nBETTY (turning back) What? \nHe wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his head. \nDAVID Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... \nMARGARET Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes. \nShe giggles. David looks at her in amazement. \nMARGARET (CONT) Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean. \nDAVID Yeah. \nMARGARET What's that like? \nDAVID Well it's big. And it's blue ... (as if realizing it for the first time) ... It's really really blue. \nMARGARET Mmmm. (beat) Boy. It's hot up here. \nSuddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts. She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it. \nMARGARET (CONT) You want some berries? \nDAVID Hunh? \nShe unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES. \nMARGARET I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. (eating one) Mmm. So sweet. \nDAVID (looking at them) They just grow like that? \nMARGARET (looking straight up) Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you. \nShe hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ... \nMARGARET (CONT) Here. \nCLOSER. \nMargaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the moonlight. \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a whisper. \nMARGARET Go on. Try it. \nHIS POV. \nShe is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David reaches out and takes it. \nWIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET. \nFor this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. \nGeorge heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache case as he turns and heads up his front walk. \nINT. FOYER. \nGeorge opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly greeting: \nGEORGE Honey--I'm home. \nThere is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles as he calls out again: \nGEORGE (CONT) Honey--I'm home ... \nThere is more silence. George looks around a little confused when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT. \nBetty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel, painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ... \nCLOSER. \nShe looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER BOOM ... \nANGLE. WINDOW. \nThe \"Cubist Snowscene\" lights up brightly, illuminated by the sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the chair and crosses to the window looking out. \nBETTY (frightened) What is that? \nMR. JOHNSON I don't know. \nBetty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide. \nREVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING. \nIt is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime. There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER. \nWIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON. \nShe looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing it, moves slightly closer. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nDavid and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in the sky. \nMARGARET What is that? \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks to him in terror. \nMARGARET What's going on? \nGEORGE (faintly) Rain. \nBOB (beat) Real rain? \nGeorge nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning lights up the sky. \nBOB (CONT) Oh my God ... \nHe turns back to George. \nBOB (CONT) ... We had no idea. Burt was rolling a 250 and ... (beat) Are you alright? \nGeorge shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches and guides him into the seat ... \nBOB (CONT) What happened? \nGEORGE (still shivering) Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said \"Honey. I'm home.\" \nANGLE. MEN. \nThey all nod in recognition. \nANGLE. GEORGE. \nGEORGE ... Only no one was there. \nA MURMUR goes through the men. \nGEORGE (CONT) So I went into the kitchen and I yelled it again. \"Honey--I'm home.\" But there was no one there either. No wife. No lights. No dinner. \nThey all GASP. \nGEORGE (CONT) So I went to the oven--you know-- because I thought maybe she had made me one of those \"TV dinners ...\" \nThe men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head. \nGEORGE (CONT) But she hadn't. She was gone. \nA LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up and puts a hand on his shoulder. \nBOB (gently/ the patriarch) ... It's gonna be fine George. \nGeorge looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly on the back. \nGUS What do we do Bob? \nBOB Well--we'll be safe for now--thank goodness we're in a bowling alley-- but if George here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next. It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil ... \nThey murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam. \nBOB (CONT) (like a WWII movie) ... That's real rain out there gentlemen. This isn't some little \"virus\" that's going to \"clear up on it's own.\" There's something happening to our town and I think we can all see where it comes from. \nThey nod in agreement. \nBOB (CONT) We're gonna need a town meeting. Phil, how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop? \nPHIL Couple of hours. \nBOB Gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks ... \nGus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm, patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder. \nBOB (CONT) (soothingly) And the first thing you're gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt. \nINT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT. \nThe rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow pink ... \nMR. JOHNSON You can't go out there. \nBETTY But I really should get home. \nMR. JOHNSON But you can't go out there. \nThere is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the roof. \nBETTY Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it. \nMR. JOHNSON (listening) Yeah. It does. \nThere is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this time. \nBETTY Like a drum. \nMR. JOHNSON Yeah. (thinks) Or like sprinklers in the summer ... \nBetty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr. Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two. Betty starts to smile ... \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. \nDavid huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she nestles against him with her head on his shoulder. \nINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. \nShe lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE. \nDrops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT RED IN THE MORNING SUN ... \nAERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. \nThe rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky. Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card. \nINT. SODA SHOP. \nBetty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens his eyes and looks outside ... \nMR. JOHNSON (seeing the rainbow) Oh my Gosh ... \nThere is a murmur from the crowd ... \nCLOSE UP. GEORGE. \nHe sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a shiny new pin can give you. \nSHOT. BOB. \nHe holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS. \nBOB Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket. \nThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats. Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair. \nBOB (CONT) This is from Mary Petersen's front porch. She found one last week. There were two more this morning ... \nThe MURMUR starts to grow ... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. \nDavid and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright RED bow. \nDAVID (softly) I got you something. \nMargaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled. \nMARGARET It's beautiful. Where'd you get it? \nDAVID It was a prop for the school play ... \nShe looks down and giggles. \nMARGARET Can I open it? \nDAVID Sure ... \nMargaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the corner. \nWIDER. \nDavid grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with BLACK AND WHITE faces ... \nDRIVER Hello Bud ... \nDAVID (clipped) Hello Whitey. \nThey smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and arrogant. \nWHITEY (more pointed) Hello Margaret. \nMARGARET Hello Whitey ... \nWHITEY (loud) Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now? \nDAVID (curt) No reason. (pause/ firing back) How come you're not? \nWHITEY Oh. We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. See. \nHe points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and leers ... \nWHITEY (CONT) No reason hunh ... See I thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend. \nMargaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around her and pulls her close. \nDAVID Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here. \nWHITEY Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that. \nHe guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns toward Margaret. \nWHITEY (CONT) (leering more) You know Margaret, you can come over and bake those Oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to. \nThey share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David holds her tighter ... \nDAVID It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything. \nShe nods, groping for reassurance ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT. \nThe chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing. Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the audience. \nWOMAN Ed McFadden's got a blue front door. \nED MCFADDEN It's always been blue! \nWOMAN Not that blue! \nMAN There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard! \nSHOT. GEORGE. \nHe still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ... \nBOB People, people ... I think we all know what's going on here. \nSHOT. BOB. \nBob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit. \nBOB Obviously certain \"changes\" have been happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been-- well ... \"Pleasant.\" And, recently, certain things have become ... \"Un-Pleasant.\" Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are \"Un-Pleasant.\" \nThere is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ... \nBOB (CONT) George, why don't you and Burt take the lead on this. Why don't you put together kind of an \"Un-Pleasant\" Activities Committee ... \nCUT TO: \nDAVID (gathering strength) I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that. \nDICK VAN DYKE (nuts) JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE! \nHe lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the \"barrier.\" \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) OW! \nDAVID (terrified) I'm going to leave now. \nDICK VAN DYKE You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!! \nDick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves the shop. \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) Don't make me get rough with you! I can get awfully fucking rough! \nELM STREET. DAY. \nDavid sprints down the tree lined street toward his house. The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's hedge and goes tearing up his front walk. \nINT. FOYER. \nThe door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He crosses into the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. \nDavid rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door. \nMAIN STREET. DAY. \nDavid moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the street. \nWIDER. \nDavid turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to his feet as the voices get louder. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nThe crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a group of young men who circle around her, taunting and harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face: BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd circles her like a pack of dogs. \nCLOSER. BETTY. \nThe ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one another \"Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her picture ...\" One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to the ground ... \nWIDER. \nDavid shields his \"mother\" as he shoves one of the boys into the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.) David steps in front of his \"mother\" with both fists clenched. \nDAVID (as scared as she is) Come on! \nHe plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black and white thugs just stares at it. \nDAVID (CONT) COME ON! \nANGLE. CROWD. \nThey look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts backing away. \nDAVID Get out of here! \nThey back away further and David takes a threatening step. The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his \"mother.\" \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER) \nDavid moves up to her gently. \nDAVID Are you alright? \nShe nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go wide. \nDAVID (CONT) (off her look) What? \nCLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER. \nBetty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR. \nREVERSE ANGLE. DAVID. \nHe holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle arm around her shoulder. \nDAVID (quietly) Come on. \nHe begins to lead her up toward the corner. \nCUT TO: \nFULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY. \nA larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are even louder. The \"closed\" sign still sits in the doorway. After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ... \nWIDER. \nA big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an instant, Mr. Johnson's \"canvas\" is totally destroyed. The CHEERING grows louder ... \nAlmost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together. The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND BROKEN GLASS. \nINT. SODA SHOP. \nIt is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick in the front of the juke box ... \nEXT. MAIN ST. DAY. \nDavid and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok. After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped open. \nDAVID Oh my God. \nHe takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David strokes her hair. \nDAVID (CONT) Are you alright? Are you okay? \nShe nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two, then glances down to her side ... \nThey respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage. Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as the kids try to put their shop back together. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT. \nBig Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills. Bob points his finger. \nBOB This is not the answer people. \nThe crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern. \nBOB (CONT) No matter how upset we may get, or how frustrated we may be, we're not gonna solve our problems out in the street. It's just the wrong way to do it. We have to have a \"Code of Conduct\" we can all agree to live by. \nHis tone grows softer--more concerned ... \nBOB (CONT) Now, I asked George and Burt here to sketch out some ideas-and I think they've done a terrific job. (beat/ scans the crowd) If we all agree on these then we can take a vote and I think we'll start to move in the right direction. \nANGLE. CROWD. \nThey murmur and nod ... \nBOB (reading from the CODE OF CONDUCT\") \"ONE: All public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately.\" \nEXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT. \nIt is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb. \nSHOT. FIRETRUCK. \nThe same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and extinguish the raging bonfire ... \nBOB \"TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and \"pleasant\" manner ...\" \nSERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS. \nThe CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop windows ... \nSODA SHOP. \nDebris is still strewn around the street. A dim light emanates from inside. \nINT. SODA SHOP. \nIt looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads the code of conduct out loud by flashlight. \nLISA ANNE \"Courteous and Pleasant manner.\" That doesn't sound too bad. \nDavid just looks at her then continues. \nDAVID (reading from THE CODE) \"THREE: The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice.\" \nThis sends a murmur amongst the kids. \nDAVID (CONT) \"FOUR: The only permissible recorded music shall be the following: Pat Boone, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones, The marches of John Phillips Souza or the Star Spangled Banner. In no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or \"pleasant\" nature.\" \nVARIOUS KIDS (overlapping) \"Oh my gosh ... No ...\" \nDavid holds up his hand. \nDAVID \"FIVE: There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind.\" \nVarious glances dart back and forth between them. David continues. \nDAVID (CONT) \"SIX: No bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide.\" (pause) \"SEVEN: The only permissible exterior paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or GRAY, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives.\" \nDavid looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly. Betty clutches his hand. \nDAVID (CONT) \"EIGHT: All elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the \"non-changist\" view of history-- emphasizing \"continuity\" over \"alteration.\" (David pauses) Wow. \nDavid lowers the paper. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nIt is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of sadness. \nOff in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner. \nBOY Hey. This thing works. \nHe hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop. RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive time. \nBUDDY HOLLY Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo ... \nLISA ANNE (suddenly/ in a panic) Turn that off! \nThe boy looks back at her. \nLISA ANNE (CONT) (shrieking) You're not allowed to do that now! \nHe flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it. David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear tone. \nDAVID Sure you are. \nHe walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance. \nWIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP. \nBuddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious reputation. \nBUDDY HOLLY The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ... RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ... RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ... \nJennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel ashamed. \nTwenty \"colored\" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship ... \nEXT. STREET. LATER ... \nHe steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge. The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids. \nDAVID (whisper) Stick together till you get off Main Street. \nINT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT. \nDavid sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling. \nINT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ... \nMr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in true \"inmate\" fashion. \nREVERSE ANGLE. WALL. \nRather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr. Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at his work and smiles. \nSHOT. POLICE CHIEF. \nHe approaches David's cell from the other direction and knocks gently on the bars. David turns around. \nDAN There's someone to see you Bud. \nDAVID. \nDavid sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles. \nDAVID I thought it might be you. \nREVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE. \nHe stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND WHITE. \nDICK VAN DYKE Hope you're proud of yourself. \nDAVID I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors. \nDick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the cell behind him. \nDICK VAN DYKE Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control? \nDAVID Why? \nDICK VAN DYKE Because you're coming home. \nDAVID (smiles) Why don't you just take me back without it? \nDICK VAN DYKE Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? (tightly) It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came. \nDavid just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back on the bunk ... \nDAVID So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ... \nDICK VAN DYKE Just gimme the damn remote! \nDAVID I'm sorry. I can't do that. \nDick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the barred window. \nDICK VAN DYKE I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ... \nDAVID They weren't my memories. (beat) I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them. \nDick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to tremble. \nDICK VAN DYKE (containing his rage) How long do you think you've been here? \nDAVID (warily) I don't know ... Three, four weeks. \nDICK VAN DYKE Much less than that. (checks his watch) An hour and a half. \nDavid looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad nasty smile. \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) See--and this is really great-- the show was on for what--half an hour a week? So that means for every week that goes by in Pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real world. \nThe smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him. \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... (calculates) Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down. \nDAVID I'm going on trial tomorrow? \nDICK VAN DYKE This is TV pal. They don't fool around. \nDavid is rocked but tries not to show it. \nDAVID (stoicly) There's worse places. \nDICK VAN DYKE Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous. (beat) Sleep well. \nHe taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David looks around his cell, truly afraid. \nCLOSER. \nHe stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it ... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David crosses to the small window and looks out. \nHIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW. \nAcross the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall complete with the newly painted mural. The \"Utopian\" view of Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to BLACK AND WHITE. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOWN HALL. DAY. \nIt is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history. There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air. \nINT. TOWN HALL. DAY. \nThe place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped across the back wall. \nANGLE. BENCH. \nAt the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange combination of Franz Kafka and \"Inherit the Wind.\" Big Bob bangs the gavel ... \nCLOSER. \nThe undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the pews are Black and White. There is a \"colored\" section in the back for standing room only. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen while David confronts his \"father.\" George straightens up. \nGEORGE (solemn) Yes Bud. \nDAVID (beat) Don't you miss her? \nCLOSE UP. GEORGE. \nHe looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens. George just stares at him like he got shot. \nDAVID I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ... \nGeorge swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room. \nDAVID (CONT) (softer whisper) Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. (shrugs) You might even call it \"love.\" \nBIG BOB (BANGING the gavel loudly) Okay, that's IT!!! \nDAVID (motioning toward the back) Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? \nSlowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of COLOR behind it. \nDAVID (CONT) Don't you wish you could tell her that? \nHe nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well. \nBOB (POUNDING the gavel) YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! \nDAVID Why am I out of order? \nBOB BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS! \nDAVID Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. \nDavid motions behind him to the black and white section. There are now ten to fifteen \"colored\" faces. \nBOB THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. \nDAVID But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you. \nBOB (tightly) It's not in ME. \nDAVID Oh sure it is. \nBOB No it isn't. \nHe crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans over the bench and gets right up in his face. \nDAVID (smug whisper) What do you want to do to me right now? \nBig Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves closer. \nDAVID (CONT) C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ... \nBIG BOB That's not going to happen! \nDAVID But it could happen. \nBIG BOB No it couldn't! \nBig Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely RED IN THE FACE. \nWIDER. \nA gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window. \nCLOSE UP. BIG BOB. \nHe sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom. \nANGLE. DOORWAY. \nAs Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside. \nEXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!) \nAll the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars, Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation. The whole town is washed in joy. \nWIDER. \nMargaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out. \nJENNIFER Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ... \nDavid turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET. DAY. \nDavid and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control. \nDAVID Are you sure? \nJENNIFER I told you. I'm like positive. \nDAVID This thing works. We could go home right now. \nJENNIFER I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while. \nWIDER. \nThey stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge). \nA large sign says: \"Springfield 12 Miles\" and for the first time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning. Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance. \nJENNIFER Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there? \nDAVID (thinks ...) Honestly ... no. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT. \nThe SOUND of the television plays OS while a warm light burns in the window. \nINT. KITCHEN. \nJennifer and Betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes. Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places a dish in the drying rack. \nBETTY Mary Sue? \nJENNIFER Yeah? \nBetty hesitates. Rinses out a pot. \nBETTY Can I ask you a question? \nJENNIFER Sure. \nShe pauses for a long moment. \nBETTY What goes on up at Lover's Lane? \nJENNIFER (turning toward her) What do you mean? \nBETTY Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... (she looks over) Is it holding hands? That kind of thing? \nJENNIFER Yeah ... (beat) That--and ... \nShe stops herself. \nBETTY What? \nJENNIFER It doesn't matter. \nBETTY No. I want to know. \nJENNIFER (glances toward the living room/ lowers her voice) ... Sex. \nBETTY Ah. \nBetty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A beat goes by ... \nBETTY (CONT) What's sex? \nJennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates. \nJENNIFER You sure you want to know this? \nBETTY Yes. \nJENNIFER Okay. \nShe crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to the kitchen counter and turns to her. \nJENNIFER (CONT) You see Mom ... (softer and with understanding) When two people like each other very much ... \nBetty looks at her and nods ... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT. \nThe TV keeps flickering in the window. \nINT. KITCHEN. LATER ... \nThe CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies. It finally comes to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table with a concerned look on her face. \nJENNIFER You okay? \nREVERSE ANGLE. BETTY. \nShe nods--shaken but \"fine.\" Betty stares long and hard at the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away. \nBETTY Yes ... (softly) It's just that ... \nJENNIFER (gently) What? \nBETTY Well ... (looking up) ... Your father would never do anything like that. \nSHOT. JENNIFER. \nShe bites her lip weighing her next sentence ... \nJENNIFER (leaning forward) Oh. Hmm ... (whisper/ woman to woman) Well, Mom ... there's ways to \"enjoy\" yourself without Dad. \nANGLE. BETTY. \nShe looks across the table, perplexed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nGeorge crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the middle of the room. He wears long sleeve pajamas that are buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering. \nGEORGE Sweetie? You coming to bed? \nThere is no answer. \nGEORGE (CONT) Betty? \nINT. BATHROOM. \nShe stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. Her dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well. \nBETTY (calling out) Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath first. \nCLOSER. BETTY. \nShe swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN. \n", "test1_true": "Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top of her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor, standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a deep breath and steps into the tub. \nEVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ... \nBetty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in the tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There is the slight trace of a smile. \nEXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE. \nHer eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The water continues to THUNDER DOWN as she arches her back. Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all over again: \nHER POV. BATHROOM ... \nALL AT ONCE, EVERYTHING AROUND STARTS TO TURN FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO COLOR. A BIRD OUT THE WINDOW BECOMES A RED BREASTED ROBIN. THE TILE ON THE TUB TURNS OUT TO BE PURPLE. GREEN TOWEL ... PINK ROBE ... BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES ON THE PLASTIC SHOWER CURTAIN. \nCLOSE UP. BETTY'S FACE. \nShe stares in amazment. Beads of sweat form on Betty's forehead as the world goes to TECHNICOLOR. The THUNDERING WATER POUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND, but beneath can be heard the beginnings of a faint, low, MOAN. Her eyes dart around the room. Her breathing quickens: Faster ... Harder ... More intense ... THEN SUDDENLY ... \nEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. \nThe HUGE ELM TREE across the street suddenly BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing clouds of black smoke fill the air. BRIGHT ORANGE FLAMES LIGHT UP THE NIGHT. \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. \nDavid is staring at the television set when he notices a weird orange glow. He glances behind him, out the living room window ... \nDAVID Oh my God! \nEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. \nDavid comes racing out of the front door and down the walk. A small CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't seem frightened--just sort of amazed.) The street is still BLACK AND WHITE but it is now bathed in a weird ORANGE LIGHT. The flames leap higher and higher ... \nDAVID Jesus Christ ... \nFOLLOWING DAVID. \nHe takes off down the block, as fast as he can run. The crowd continues to stare as David turns the corner at Main Street ... \nEXT. FIRE STATION. \nHe races in the front of the building SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. \nDAVID FIRE! FIRE! \nINT. FIRE STATION. \nThere is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story. \nINT. BUNKROOM. \nAll the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when David rushes in the front door. They can hear his voice from down the hall. \nDAVID (entering) FIRE ... FIRE ... \nThey still don't move. All the firemen just look at him from their bunks with a perplexed expression. \nDAVID (CONT) (beat) CAT!!! \nAll at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole ... \nEXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT. \nThe FIRE HAS SPREAD TO AN ADJOINING TREE as the FIRE ENGINE comes SCREAMING toward the house from the top of the block. David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief who drives the vehicle at break neck speed. \nDAVID Right here! \nThe Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks around ... \nFIRE CHIEF Where is it? \nDavid shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He shakes his head and leaps from the truck. \nFOLLOWING DAVID. \nHe races around to the back where the other firemen are standing just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and begins to pull it from the truck. \nDAVID Here! Grab this nozzle. \nFIREMAN But where's the ... \nDAVID Just grab it! \nHe strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the fireman and pulls him toward the curb. David parts the crowd and positions the man right in front of the flames. \nDAVID (CONT) (shouting) Okay! Now point this right at the flames--like this. \nThe Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the valve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER. \nFIREMAN Whoa! (beat) So that's what these do. \nA huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another hose ... \nBOB (VO) (fading in) ... In honor and in recognition of your heroism ... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TOWN HALL. DAY \nDavid stands at a podium receiving a commendation from \"Big\" Bob McGee (the man from the barbershop). He holds a large plaque up for public display, while \"David's\" whole family beams in the background. \nBOB ... And with great appreciation from the citizens of Pleasantville ... \nWIDER. \nA huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps. There are lots of balloons and bunting. \nBOB I am pleased to present You with this special commendation, from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce! \nHe hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into APPLAUSE. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_input": "DAVID (calling back) Sorry ... \nFOLLOWING DAVID. \nHe races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a time flinging open the door. \nINT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER. \nDAVID \"Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching in ...\" \nHe lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs, when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room. \nMAN'S VOICE (OS) Bud ... \nHe pauses a second and glances back. \nMAN'S VOICE (CONT) David ... \nHe peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ... \nHIS POV. TELEVISION. \nDick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble. \nDICK VAN DYKE Hello there. \nDAVID (wary) ... Hi. \nDICK VAN DYKE (stage whisper) Well c'mere, young fella. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. \nDavid crosses slowly over to the TV set. \nDICK VAN DYKE (big smile) You know I've been thinkin' ... I might have been a little \"hasty\" the other day when you asked to come home--just took me by such surprise, ya know--ha ha ... \nHe gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ... \nDICK VAN DYKE (CONT) So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again. \nDAVID (quickly) I can't. \nDICK VAN DYKE What? \nDAVID Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... \nThe look turns suddenly dark and ominous. \nDICK VAN DYKE Bud--I thought you wanted to come home. \nDAVID Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my \"dad\" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ... \nDICK VAN DYKE (getting testy) I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ... \nDAVID Re-runs? \nDICK VAN DYKE Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. (losing it a little) ... Those aren't your cookies Bud. \nDAVID Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just \"cookies\" after all ... \nDICK VAN DYKE Excuse me? \nDAVID Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? \nDICK VAN DYKE BUD. \nDAVID Terrific. I'll talk to you then. \nHe swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room, breathing hard ... \nINT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. \nShe sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to open it when she senses something and glances toward the door. \nREVERSE ANGLE. \nBud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems to be out of breath. \nJENNIFER What's wrong? \nDAVID Nothing. \nJENNIFER Nothing? \nHe keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the remote in his hand. \nDAVID Listen ... \nHe takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly stops. \nDAVID (CONT) You're reading? \nJENNIFER (glancing at the book) Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad. \nShe holds up the cover. \nJENNIFER (CONT) D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him? \nDAVID (amazed) ... Yeah. \nJENNIFER Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages. \nDAVID (still stunned) That's great. \nHe just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift ... \nJENNIFER So what is it? \nDAVID Well ... I just ... (out of the blue) Can I ask you a question? \nJENNIFER Sure. \n", "test2_true": "JENNIFER Yeah ... \nDAVID Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up. \nJENNIFER No. She really liked you. \nDAVID You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me? \nJENNIFER Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils. \nDAVID Wow. \nHe looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity. \nJENNIFER Can I ask you a question? \nDAVID Yes. \nJENNIFER How come I'm still in black and white? \nDAVID (back to earth) What? \nJENNIFER Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor. \nDAVID Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... (thinks) ... it's not just the sex ... \nJENNIFER (looking up quickly) What? \nShe stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her expression changes: a vague look of recognition. \nJENNIFER (CONT) No, it's not just the sex, is it? \nShe glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After a second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a beat ... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY. \nDavid gets out of his \"dad's\" convertible, carrying a dozen \"gray\" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front walk ... \nINT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ... \nDavid sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road, holding the wheel at \"10 and 2\" as he steals a glance to his right. \nHIS POV. MARGARET. \nIt's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm wind that swirls inside the convertible ... \nSHOT. DAVID. \nHe studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to avoid a parked car on his right ... \nWIDER. \nThey pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads: \n\"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE\" \nMain Street turns into a winding country road as they leave the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a second sign appears, much like the first: \n\"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE\" \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. \nSure enough, the town emerges in front of them again, completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused. \nMARGARET Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street. \nDAVID Oh ... Right. \nHe looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio. \nEXT. CAR. DUSK. \nSAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road. It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat between them ... \nHIS POV. CAR SEAT. \nTHE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ... \nINT. CAR. \nDavid looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems to be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty percent of the petals have \"bloomed\" in some weird false spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as they finally reach a crest in the hill. \nDAVID Wow. \nTHEIR POV. LOVERS LANE. \nThere, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all \"turned\" now) SWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG LINE OF PASTEL CARS STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE SHORE. \nSAM COOKE (VO) (over the car radios) \"Cupid, draw back your bow ...\" \nSHOT. CAR. \nSlowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It almost looks \"Athenian.\" \nINT. CAR. \nDavid looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly cocks his head to the side. \nDAVID What's that smell? \nMargaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is blooming beside the car. \nMARGARET Aren't these great? \nDavid takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the flower ... \nEXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK. \nBetty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on either hand. From a block away, she looks like any other homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray make-up. \n", "test3_input": "CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY. \nShe nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street when she glances up, and suddenly stops. \nHER POV. ACROSS THE STREET. \nThere, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist Santa hovering over the roof tops. \nSHOT. BETTY. \nShe stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of the block, staring straight ahead. \nINT. SODA SHOP. \nThe door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters. \nMR. JOHNSON (OS) We're closed right now ... \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nHe sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway. \nMR. JOHNSON Oh, hi ... \nBETTY (turning to leave) I'm sorry ... \nMR. JOHNSON No, no ... Come on in. \nREVERSE ANGLE. \nHe gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the \"Cubist Christmas\" in the window. \nBETTY I just thought ... It's beautiful. \nMR. JOHNSON Thanks. \nTheir eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr. Johnson motions toward his easel. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) I was just trying to do one of these \"still lifes.\" \nHe sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of GRAY FRUIT. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) Having kind of a tough time. \nBETTY I think it looks nice. \nMR. JOHNSON Well ... (shrugs) Here's what it's s'posed to look like. \nHe leads her over to the table and points down at the art book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page. \nBETTY Oh my ... \nCLOSER. \nThey are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world. \nMR. JOHNSON Here. Look at this. \nHe turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is nearly electric. \nBETTY (breathless) Where'd you get this? \nMR. JOHNSON Bud brought it to me. \nBETTY Bud? \nMR. JOHNSON Here's my favorite. \nINSERT. BOOK. \nHe turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's \"Weeping Women.\" The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her head is a large sphere, laying \"peacefully\" on her own shoulder. \nMR. JOHNSON What do you think? \nShe doesn't answer ... \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) Isn't it great how she's resting like that? \nBETTY (faintly) She's crying. \nWIDER. \nMr. Johnson looks down at the painting. \nMR. JOHNSON What? \nBETTY She's crying. \nMR. JOHNSON No she's not. \nBETTY Yes she is. \nHe looks up at her ... \nREVERSE ANGLE. \nA single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP. A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath. \nANGLE. MR. JOHNSON. \nHe stares up at her in amazement. \nANGLE. BETTY. \nShe senses something and glances down at her hand. Her fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts for the door. \nWIDER. \nMR. JOHNSON (following her) Wait ... \nBETTY I've got to go ... \n", "test3_true": "He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) It's alright. Let me see. \nBETTY (shame) No ... \nHe reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves around to glimpse the other side of her cheek. \nMR. JOHNSON It's beautiful. \nCLOSER ... \nShe freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly, turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed underneath. Betty stands there exposed. \nMR. JOHNSON (a whisper) ... It's beautiful. \nShe swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) You shouldn't cover that up. \nMr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek. \nCLOSER STILL ... \nShe recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr. Johnson is gazing at her \"true color\" with wonder and acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ... \nCUT TO: INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT. \nShe lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting the book. The cover is plainly visible: \"LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER.\" \nCLOSER. \nShe doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed and crosses to \"her\" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the little desk. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE. \nShe flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony tail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer notices something across the desk. \nREVERSE ANGLE. \nA pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances back down at the print. \nJENNIFER (impressed) Hunh. \nShe can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel when there is a loud TAP on the window. \nShe rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer slides open the window. \nEXT. PARKER HOUSE. \nBiff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window. \nBIFF Mary Sue--C'mon ... \nJENNIFER (leaning out the window) What are you doing? \nBIFF (jiggling in anticipation) It's six-thirty ... \nJENNIFER So. \nBIFF We were gonna ... You know ... \nHe jiggles some more. \nJENNIFER Oh. (remembering) I can't. \nBIFF Why not? \nShe glances down at her book. \nJENNIFER I'm busy. \nBIFF (surprised) With what? \nINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. \nShe hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her own image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is pulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of her nose. \nJENNIFER (turning to Biff) I'm studying. \nShe thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and quietly closes the window ... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nDavid and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out across the water. Even in the moonlight, the COLORS are vivid. David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking a long hit like an Opium addict. \nDAVID (inhaling) Mmmmgh. \nMARGARET Do they have those ... Where you come from? \nDAVID Yeah ... I guess. (beat) I don't know. \nMARGARET You don't know? \nMargaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass. \nMARGARET (CONT) So what's it like? \nDAVID What? \nMARGARET (a whisper) Out there. \nShe clings onto the words like they could transport her by themselves. David thinks for a moment. \nDAVID Oh. don't know ... It's different. \nShe leans forward. \nMARGARET How? \n"}

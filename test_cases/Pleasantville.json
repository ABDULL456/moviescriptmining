CAR. \nThey are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings desperately to the steering wheel. \nBIFF (some terror) I think I better go home now Mary Sue ... \nShe holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard. \nJENNIFER (breathless) ... Why? \nBIFF (more terror) I think ... I might be ill ... \nHe glances down at his lap a little confused. \nBIFF (CONT) (a whisper) I think something's happening to me. \nHe looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up and grabs a handful of his hair. \nJENNIFER It's s'posed to happen, Biff. \nBIFF It is? \nJENNIFER Trust me ... \nHe looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down, and OUT OF FRAME ... \nCUT TO: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT. \nA single light is burning in the kitchen window. \nBETTY (OS) Do you want some more cookies? \nINT. KITCHEN. \nDavid is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs all over the table. \nDAVID (sick) Oh no ... I'm fine. \nBETTY How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares? \nDAVID I'm fine. \nThere is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up. \nBETTY Now who could that be. \nFOLLOWING DAVID. \nHe crosses into the foyer ahead of his \"parents.\" David swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the porch. \nDAVID Oh hi! \nMR. JOHNSON Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay. \nDAVID Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early. \nMr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone of voice. \nMR. JOHNSON Bud ... \nDAVID Yeah ... \nMR. JOHNSON (sotto) You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors. \nDAVID Yeah ... \nMR. JOHNSON (proud) Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself. \nCLOSER. \nMr. Johnson has a strange look of \"manly pride\" on his face. His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little. There is a sudden sparkle in his eye. \nMR. JOHNSON (more confidential) Not only that, I didn't even do it in the same order. First I lowered the shades, then I closed the register. \nHe looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance behind him. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) Oh, hello Betty. \nBETTY Hello Bill. \nNeither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and his new found virility. \nDAVID (quickly) Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ... really appreciate it. \nHe turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's convertible pulls up at the curb. \nINT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER. \nShe looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT OF FRAME). \nJENNIFER Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really wonderful time. \nANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR. \nHe sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit with a couple of thousand volts. \nBIFF ... Me too. \nShe leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff smiles back. \nEXT. CAR. \nShe climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr. Johnson as she heads up the walk. \nJENNIFER (sweetly) Hello Mr. Johnson. \nMR. JOHNSON Oh, hello Mary Sue. \nShe is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch. David grabs her arm. \n", "test1_true": "JENNIFER (innocently) Nothing. \nShe starts up the staircase.

That's ... \nShe reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him. \nJENNIFER Relax \"Bud.\" We had a really nice time. (mock YAWN) ... Now I'm really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so ... \nShe flashes her brother an evil grin. \nJENNIFER (CONT) 'Night. \nShe shuts the door softly in his face. David stairs at the gray wood in front of him. \nEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. \nBiff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in his eye. The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or two, before he glances over to his right. \nCLOSE UP. BIFF. \nThe stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement: \nBIFF'S POV. ROSE. \nThere, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white street in a black and white neighborhood, A SINGLE RED ROSE IS BLOOMING. \nCUT TO: \nAERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. MORNING \nIt would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white. The church steeple gleams in the sunlight. The perfect little houses look like a row of pretty toys ... \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. DAY. \nDavid sits parked in front of the TV furtively turning through the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign of Dick Van Dyke. \nBETTY (OS) Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you watching television? \nHe gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ... \nCUT TO: INT. SCHOOL GYM. DAY. \nIt is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their Pleasantville \"Lions\" jerseys, white sneakers and black socks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had much sleep. \nCLOSER. \nHe looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side, staring across the gym. \nHIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS. \nThey are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball under his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly describing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION. \nWIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID. \nDAVID (quietly) Oh no ... \nBiff continues his story while they stare at him with their mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle. \nCOACH Come on men. Let's go. Big game next week. \nThe huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym. Everyone stares in disbelief. \nDAVID Oh my God ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. DAY. \nDavid stands face to face with his sister in mid conversation. \nDAVID You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you. \nJENNIFER So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy. \nDAVID You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE. \nJENNIFER Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you? (beat) You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before. \nPEGGY JANE (walking past) \"MS\". How you doin'? \nJENNIFER Kewl \"PJ\". How you doin'? \nPEGGY JANE (relishing her new word) \"Kewl.\" \nJennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by. \nDAVID You have no right to do this. \nJENNIFER Well if I don't who will? \nDAVID They're happy like this. \nJENNIFER David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. (pause ...) You like all this don't you? \nDavid recoils slightly. \nJENNIFER (CONT) I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it. (shudders) Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ... \nDAVID I just don't think we have the right to ... \nJENNIFER David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be \"attractive.\" They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better. \nDAVID They don't have that kind of potential. \nJENNIFER Um--hello? You want to like take a look? \nJennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is sexually charged. They speak to one another in a close whisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum, but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME. \nBOY Wow. What kind of gum is that? \n", "test1_id": 675, "test2_input": "CLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER. \nHe looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair. \nJENNIFER I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the flagpole. \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nIt is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY. \nIt is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother sits at her side. \nDR. HENDERSON Let me see it again. \nLisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE. Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her tongue literally gleams with color. \nDR. HENDERSON (CONT) (examining it) Well ... I don't think it's anything to worry about ... It'll probably just clear up by itself. (to Lisa Anne) Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate. No french fries, that kind of thing. (aside/ to the Mother) It's just a \"teenage\" thing. \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nIt is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the edge of the lake as the REAL (AND NASTY) VERSION OF TOOTY FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS: \nLIL RICHARD (VO) \"... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She knows just what to do ...\" \nSERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE) \nPARKER LIVING ROOM. \nTOOTY FRUITY CONTINUES AS DAVID FLIPS FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS LOOKING FOR DICK VAN DYKE. THERE IS ONLY A PEPSODENT COMMERCIAL. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD ... \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...) \nThe Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half. The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ... \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...) \nDavid examines the back of the TV set ... \nINT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...) \nA large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in \"2001\". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ... \nINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...) \nDavid sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ... \nLIL RICHARD (OS) \"... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam boom!\" \nSODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID. \nHe heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He shakes his head. \nSODA SHOP. \nThe place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air. Somebody has played the flip side. \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return to normal. David shakes his head. \nFOLLOWING HIM. \nHe crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder. \nDAVID What'll it be? \nBIFF (still chipper as ever) Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke. \nBud has already written it down. He glances over at his sister. \nJENNIFER Me too. Sounds swell. \nDAVID (pointed) Really? It seems so fattening. \nBefore she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson. \nDAVID (CONT) Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes. \nMR. JOHNSON (staring straight ahead) There aren't any cheeseburgers. \nDAVID (exasperated) Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ... \nMR. JOHNSON Oh--what's the point, Bud? \nCLOSER. \nMr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness in his eyes. David grabs his arm. \nDAVID C'mere. \nHe pulls him along the counter toward a little office storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the door. \nINT. STOREROOM. \nIt is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a happy family motoring in their Rambler. \nDAVID What did you say? \nMr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion. \nMR. JOHNSON Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore. \nDAVID What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point! \nMR. JOHNSON No I know ... I know I do ... (he pauses, then looks up) But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ... \nDAVID Just listen to me ... \n", "test2_true": "DAVID Forget about that! \nMR. JOHNSON Oh ... Okay. (beat/ lower) ... But I really liked it. \nBud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries to speak softly. \nDAVID Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway. \nMR. JOHNSON Why? \nDAVID (exasperated) So they can have their hamburgers! \nThis sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head. \nMR. JOHNSON (like a secret) You know what I really like? \nDAVID (warily) ... What's that? \nMR. JOHNSON Christmastime. \nDavid rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking furtively. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint the Christmas decorations in the window. And every year, I get to paint a different thing ... (beat) One year it's the North Pole. The next I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show you. \nHe pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens it for David. \nDAVID (impressed) Wow ... That's pretty good ... \nMR. JOHNSON Thanks. (continuing) But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought \"Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?\" \nDavid looks at him speechless. \nMR. JOHNSON (CONT) Well don't you? \nDAVID I think you should try not to think about this anymore. \nMR. JOHNSON Really? \nDAVID Yeah. \nMR. JOHNSON Oh. Okay. I'll try that then. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARBERSHOP. DAY \nThe Barber Pole spins in three shades of gray. Several men are gathered around the two chairs in the front of Gus' shop. Besides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male life in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's \"father\" (George) sits in one of the chairs. \"Big Bob\" McGee, owner of the drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the other. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter. \nGUS Have they ever lost before? \nGEORGE Basketball? No they sure haven't. \nBOB Just feels \"wrong\", that's all. \nThere are several murmurs. \nTHIRD PATRON Maybe that's where they get that saying, \"can't win 'em all.\" \nGUS Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They do have that saying. \nBOB But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've always won 'em all. \nGUS Well, yeah. That's true too. \nMore murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY. \nThe women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen like it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix between them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office. \nMARGE (dealing the cards) ... He said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets ... \nBETTY Well that makes sense. \nMARGE Except it's spread to her lips now too. Oh, I don't know. \nMARY (a THIRD WOMAN) And you say it's just \"red?\" \nMARGE Well--like red, only ... \"redder.\" \nMARY Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was going by it the other day and it looked green only \"greener.\" \nSHOT. BETTY. \nShe looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix. \nMARGE (lowering her voice) Have you seen him lately? The man doesn't look like himself. I was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. Wasn't looking at anything in particular--just staring off into space. \nMARY That is strange. \nBetty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in front of her, when her eyes go wide. \nHER POV. BRIDGE HAND. \nThey are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a fistfful of valentines. \nCLOSE UP. BETTY. \nShe puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath. Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before lifting them up and taking another look. \nMARGE Betty, it's your bid. \nShe swallows trying to keep her composure. \nBETTY Uh ... Seven hearts. \nThey murmur at the strength of the hand. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_id": 676, "test3_input": "DAVID Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... \nMARGARET Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes. \nShe giggles. David looks at her in amazement. \nMARGARET (CONT) Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean. \nDAVID Yeah. \nMARGARET What's that like? \nDAVID Well it's big. And it's blue ... (as if realizing it for the first time) ... It's really really blue. \nMARGARET Mmmm. (beat) Boy. It's hot up here. \nSuddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts. She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it. \nMARGARET (CONT) You want some berries? \nDAVID Hunh? \nShe unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES. \nMARGARET I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. (eating one) Mmm. So sweet. \nDAVID (looking at them) They just grow like that? \nMARGARET (looking straight up) Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you. \nShe hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ... \nMARGARET (CONT) Here. \nCLOSER. \nMargaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the moonlight. \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a whisper. \nMARGARET Go on. Try it. \nHIS POV. \nShe is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David reaches out and takes it. \nWIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET. \nFor this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. \nGeorge heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache case as he turns and heads up his front walk. \nINT. FOYER. \nGeorge opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly greeting: \nGEORGE Honey--I'm home. \nThere is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles as he calls out again: \nGEORGE (CONT) Honey--I'm home ... \nThere is more silence. George looks around a little confused when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT. \nBetty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel, painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ... \nCLOSER. \nShe looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER BOOM ... \nANGLE. WINDOW. \nThe \"Cubist Snowscene\" lights up brightly, illuminated by the sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the chair and crosses to the window looking out. \nBETTY (frightened) What is that? \nMR. JOHNSON I don't know. \nBetty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide. \nREVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING. \nIt is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime. There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER. \nWIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON. \nShe looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing it, moves slightly closer. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. \nDavid and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in the sky. \nMARGARET What is that? \nANGLE. DAVID. \nHe is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks to him in terror. \nMARGARET What's going on? \n", "test3_true": "MARGARET Real rain? \nDAVID Yeah ... You don't have rain either? \nShe looks at him frightened. David smiles. \nDAVID (CONT) Right. Of course you don't ... \nHe puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank, looking in terror at the water falling from the sky. \nMARGARET What do we do? \nDAVID (reaching the car) We'll just put up the top. \nHe goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing around as the rain starts to pound harder. \nMARGARET What top? \nHe looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to shiver. \nDAVID It's fine. Come on. \nHe leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together. They look at one another, terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock. \nDAVID (CONT) It's alright. There's nothing to be afraid of. \nThey look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm howls a few feet away ... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nShe stands at the window looking out at the driving rain. Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand. There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of thunder. \nJENNIFER Cool ... \nShe flops back down on the bed and continues to read ... \nPARKER LIVING ROOM. \nGeorge wanders through the empty and darkened house completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms and the sound of the driving storm. \nGEORGE (a little frightened/ a little petulant) Honey, I'm home ... \nHe still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM. The lights are dark there as well and he looks around confused. \nGEORGE (CONT) (baffled) Where's my dinner? \nHe sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's empty as well. \nKITCHEN. \nHe crosses into the darkness ... \nGEORGE Where's my dinner ... \nINT. FOYER. \nGeorge comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ... \nGEORGE (insistent) Where's my DINNER ... \nEXT. HOUSE. \nIt's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still dressed in his shirtsleeves. \nGEORGE Where's my DINNER! \nON GEORGE. \nHe stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin. \nGEORGE (over the storm) WHERE'S MY DINNER ... \nEXT. ELM STREET. \nA tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming skyward in the distance. \nGEORGE ... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY DINNER! \nSERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ... \nHe turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ... Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain. George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ... \nGEORGE (plaintively) Where's my dinner? \nHe wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk. \nINT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT. \nThe regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt, sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses. \nThe NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ... \nANGLE. BIG BOB. \nHe picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up and suddenly stops. \nREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. \nGeorge is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His hair is drenched and dripping. \nBOB What happened? \nHe doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps shivering. \nWIDER. \nThe men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a couple of times, still soaked to the bone. \nBOB Are you alright? (looking at him) What is it? \n", "test3_id": 677}

DRIVE-THRU GIRL (CONT'D) Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be four eighty-nine, please. 
Lester pays her. As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN in the corner of the window that reads: 
NOW TAKING APPLICATIONS 
COUNTER GIRL Would you like some Smiley Sauce? 
LESTER No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out an application. 
She stares at him, confused by his age and attire. 
COUNTER GIRL There's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter. 
LESTER Good. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility. 
INT. MR. SMILEY'S - A SHORT TIME LATER 
Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr. Smiley's logo. He looks over Lester's application, baffled. 
MANAGER I don't think you'd fit in here. 
LESTER I have fast food experience. 
MANAGER Yeah, like twenty years ago. 
LESTER Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn. 
The Manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair, wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this. 
INT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY 
Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex. 
CAROLYN That was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so to speak. 
They laugh. 
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I was so stressed out. 
BUDDY Know what I do when I feel like that? 
CAROLYN What? 
BUDDY I fire a gun. 
Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master. 
CAROLYN (intrigued) Really. 
BUDDY Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few rounds. 
CAROLYN (embarrassed) I've never fired a gun before. 
BUDDY Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful. (smiles seductively) Well, almost nothing. 
Carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for another round. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT DAY 
Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't. After a beat: 
JANE So how do you like your new house? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RICKY I like it. 
A beat. 
JANE The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And then she cut down their tree. 
An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly. 
RICKY Have you ever known anybody who died? 
JANE No. (a beat) Have you? 
RICKY No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad.

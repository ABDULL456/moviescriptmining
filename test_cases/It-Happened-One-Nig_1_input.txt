Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you? 
PETER 
(dryly) 
Yeah, swell. 
Peter takes the rope out of his bag. It is the one used for the "Walls of Jericho" previously. He lays it aside and then, remembering, retrieves it. For a moment he holds it in his hand, speculatively; then turning, proceeds to tack it up. The noise of the tacking attracts Ellie's attention, and Ellie (again seen close) turns and looks toward Peter. 
ELLIE 
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up? 
PETER'S VOICE 
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
(at which she turns back to the window) 
PETER (also seen close) stretches the rope across the room and tacks the other side. 
PETER 
(then reaching for blanket) 
We certainly outsmarted your father. 
(he throws the blanket over the rope) 
I guess you ought to be happy. 
There is no response from her, a close view revealing that she quite obviously isn't happy. They are now separated by the blanket, and Peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase and throws them over the blanket. 
ELLIE 
Thank you. 
(there is silence while Peter starts undressing) 
ELLIE 
(suddenly) 
Am I going to see you in New York? 
PETER 
(laconically) 
Nope. 
ELLIE 
Why not? 
PETER glances up at the "Walls of Jericho" and after a speculative pause, speaks quietly. 
PETER 
I don't make it a policy to run around with married women. 
A close-up of Ellie, disclosing only her neck and shoulders, shows her slipping out of her clothes. She pausesthen looks up. 
ELLIE 
No harm in your coming to see us. 
PETER'S VOICE 
Not interested. 
(at this Ellie's face falls, this is a definite rebuff) 
ELLIE 
(weakly) 
Won't I ever see you again? 
PETER (seen close) is now getting into his pajamas. 
PETER 
What do you want to see me for? I've served my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley, didn't I? 
(his mouth screws up bitterly) 
That's what you wanted, wasn't it? 
ELLIE is already in bed, staring up at the ceiling. 
ELLIE 
Peter, have you ever been in love? 
PETER crawls into bed. 
PETER 
I probably did the world a great favor at that. Got two pinheads out of circulation. 
(he reaches over and lights a cigarette) 
Cupid thinks he's doing something when he brings two lovers together. What good's that? I'm bringing two pains-in-the-neck together. I think I'll start an institutionhang out a shingle. 
The view now widens to include both sides of the blanket. Ellie doesn't hear a word of Peter's attack. She is too intent on her own thoughts. 
ELLIE 
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love? 
PETER 
Me? 
ELLIE 
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. 
PETER 
(disdainfully) 
Maybe. 
(after a pause) 
Suresure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd 
(interrupting himself) 
Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more. 
ELLIE'S disappointment is apparent. 
PETER 
(seen close) 
I've even been sucker enough to make plans. 
(a long puff on his cigarette) 
I saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it. That's where I'd like to take her. But she'd have to be the sort of a girl that'd jump in the surf with me on moonlight nightsand love it as much as I did. 
(he loses himself in his romantic contemplations) 
You know, those nights when you and the moon and the water all become onewhen something comes over youand you feel that you're part of something big and marvelous. 
(sighing) 
Those are the only places to live. Where the stars are so close over your head that you feel you could reach right up and stir them around. 
A close-up of ELLIE at this point shows that she is affected by his stirring description of a heavenfrom which she is excluded, as she listens to him continuing. 
PETER'S VOICE 
Certainly I've been thinking about it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who's hungry for those things 
PETER (again seen close) has disposed of his cigarette and now stares dreamily heavenward. 
PETER 
I'm going to Swim in the surf with herI'm going to reach up and grab stars for herI'm going to laugh with herand cry with her. I'm going to kiss her wet lipsand 
Suddenly stopping, he turns his head slowly, sensing Ellie's nearness; and the view, drawing back to include Ellie, shows her standing at his bedside, looking down at him yearningly. 
Then we see them close together: Peter's face is immobile. Ellie drops to her knees. 
ELLIE 
(fervently) 
Take me with you, Peter. Take me to your island. I want to do all those things you talked about. 
Peter stares at her lovely face. His heart cries out with an impulse to crush her in his arms. 
PETER 
(after a long pause; hoarsely) 
Better go back to your bed. 
ELLIE 
(simply) 
I love you.

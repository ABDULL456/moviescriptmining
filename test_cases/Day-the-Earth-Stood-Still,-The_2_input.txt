INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 
Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel Heater's voice. 
GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE --and so, this Sunday morning, we ask the question that's been plaguing; the entire nation for two days now: "Where is this creature and what is he up to?" If he can build a space ship that can fly to Earth -- and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns -- what other terrors can he unleash at will? ...Obviously we must find this monster. We must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him. 
INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS 
It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.) 
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU 
He is reading his paper with considerable interest. 
INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY 
The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study the recently landed "Space Ship." 
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU 
His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying. 
GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE But where would such a creature hide himself? Would he disappear into the north woods? Or would he slither off into the sewers of some great city? 
Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously distasteful idea. 
GROUP SHOT 
AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES: 
GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE There is grave danger -- everyone agrees to that. The question is what can we do to protect ourselves? What measures can we take that will-- 
During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in sharp annoyance. 
MRS. BARLEY George, I wish you'd turn that radio off. I'm trying to concentrate. 
Mr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio. 
MR. BARLEY (snorting, he tosses his paper down) Why doesn't the Government do something -- that's what I want to know. 
MR. KRULL (mildly) What can they do? They're only people -- Just like us. 
MR. BARLEY People my foot! They're Democrats! 
MR. KRULL It's enough to give you the shakes. He's got that robot standing there -- ten-foot tall -- just waiting for orders to destroy us. 
HELEN (thoughtfully) This space man -- or whatever he is. We automatically assume he's a menace... Maybe he isn't at all. 
MR. BARLEY (glaring at her for this silly notion) Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't he come out in the open? 
MR. KRULL Yeah. (indicating the radio) Like the fella says: "What's he up to?" 
HELEN Maybe he's afraid. 
MRS. BARLEY (with a derisive snort) He's afraid! 
HELEN After all, he was shot the moment he landed here. (she pauses for a moment thoughtfully) I was just wondering what I would do. 
KLAATU (to Helen, helpfully) Perhaps before deciding on a course of action, you'd want to know more about the people here -- to orient yourself in a strange environment. 
MRS. BARLEY (sharply) There's nothing strange about Washington, Mr. Carpenter. 
KLAATU (quietly, tongue in cheek) A person from another planet might disagree with you. 
MRS. BARLEY If you want my opinion, he came from right here on Earth. (with significant emphasis) And you know where I mean. 
MR. KRULL They wouldn't come in a space ship. They'd come in airplanes. 
MRS. BARLEY (as though with superior knowledge) I wouldn't be so sure about that. 
MR. BARLEY (delivering the final word) Stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he wouldn't be here. (facing Klaatu) That make sense, Carpenter? 
Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly. 
KLAATU I must admit I'm a little confused.

FATHER (offering RAY three cigars) Have some cigars. 
RAY No thanks, I don't smoke. 
FATHER Go on--Give 'em to your friends. 
RAY No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark. 
MOTHER Frank--he doesn't want any. 
JIM grins at RAY who nods.  They all leave.  RAY looking after them, shakes his head and lights a cigarette.  We see JIM and his family pass through the main door.  Waiting to enter, in the custody of some uniformed police, are BUZZ and the kids we saw at the opening, sullen and truculent.  As they march into the lobby and JIM grows smaller in the distance, the music comes up and out. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN. 
Low angle.  Alley.  Morning.  A rabbit comes running down the alley followed by a group of young kids, screaming with pleasure. 
As camera pans with the group, the littlest, a boy of five, stops near us looking after the disappearing group.  The shouts of the children wane. 
JUDY rushes out from a backyard beyond him.  She is carrying school books and a bag lunch.  She wears a polo coat against the winter wind. 
JUDY (yelling) Beau! 
The boy, who is her brother, BEAU, looks up but doesn't move. JUDY stops at her gate.  A car careens down the alley, past him. 
Long shot.  JUDY and BEAU seen through a window in JIM's house.  JIM is in f.g. looking out through the curtains.  He smiles. 
JUDY (yelling) What are you trying to do, get yourself killed? 
BEAU (laughing) Yes! 
MOTHER (O.S.) Your eggs are on the table, dear. 
JIM turns from window and passes camera. 
Full shot JIM's dining room.  The MOTHER is just settling a plate of eggs at JIM's place.  They FATHER is seated, drinking coffee and looking at the newspaper.  GRANDMA comes in from kitchen.  JIM is neatly dressed in tie, tweed jacket and slacks. 
MOTHER (continuing) Sit down and eat--you'll be late. 
JIM (approaching table) It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something-- 
GRANDMA It's a wonder we don't all have TB or some other terrible disease after living in all those smokey cities! 
MOTHER Well, drink your milk anyhow. 
GRANDMA (muttering) There aren't so many factories here. 
FATHER Mother-- 
JIM (still standing; he drinks) You make any sandwiches? 
FATHER My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess-- 
MOTHER (bringing bag of lunch from buffet) There's nothing to be nervous about. Here's peanut butter and meat loaf-- 
JIM makes a mouth-stuck-together-with-peanut-butter sound. 
GRANDMA What did I tell you?  Peanut butter! 
MOTHER Well, there's a thermos of orange juice and some apple-sauce cake in the wax paper to wash it down. 
GRANDMA I baked that! 
JIM (kisses her cheek) 'Bye, Mom. 
MOTHER Goodbye, dear. 
FATHER (rising) So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to! 
JIM Sure-- (gets to door and turns) You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here. 
FATHER And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you-- 
But JIM is on his way out.

Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES --- 
--- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick --- 
--- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder. 
Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels another cross-wire for support. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage. 
NOSY PACER You got it. 
Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures. 
GREM (O.S.) Hey, Professor Z! 
Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it. 
GREM This is one of those British spies we told you about. 
ACER Yeah. This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong. 
Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Agent Leland Turbo. 
The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo. 
Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the Professor. He looks up. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the camera! Kill him!! 
Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He STOPS: 
BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from - BLOWTORCHES ready. 
Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS, having just found his escape. 
THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE CRANE --- 
--- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck! 
Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners. A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control --- 
--- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig! 
The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity... 
He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces. 
ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp, PAST FINN --- 
--- PAST the pursuing CARS --- 
--- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS! 
ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No more road. Nowhere else to go. 
The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce. 
Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means he's got something cooking. 
Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars. 
Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water. 
He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away. 
GREM (NONPLUSSED) Get to the boats. 
THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they do so. 
ACER He's getting away! 
COMBAT SHIP Not for long. 
The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water. It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds. 
UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS. We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts. 
ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away. 
GREM (OVER RADIO) He's dead, Professor. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now? 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY 
TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view. 
MATER Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is here to help you! 
He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first time. 
MATER Hey, Otis! 
OTIS Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I thought I could make it this time, but... (he tries to start his engine, stalls) Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who am I kidding? I'll always be a lemon. 
Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him. 
MATER Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house. 
OTIS You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.

172 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT 
Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first class woman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even small dogs. 
Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him. He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the steam... 
LIGHTOLLER 
Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir? 
Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightoller sees the awesome truth in Smith's face. 
LIGHTOLLER 
(to the men) 
Right! Start the loading. Women and children! 
The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes. 
ON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play. 
HARTLEY 
Number 26. Ready and-- 
The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side, near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike up a waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship. 
LIGHTOLLER 
Ladies, please. Step into the boat. 
Finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the drop to the water far below. 
WOMAN IN CROWD 
You watch. They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and we'll all be back on board by breakfast. 
Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band. 
RUTH 
My brooch, I left my brooch. I must have it! 
She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to let her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her. 
CAL 
Stay here, Ruth. 
Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.

173 INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT / CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL 
It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. Some have lifebelts on, others don't. 
STEWARD #2 
(to Steward #3) 
I told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw, bloody hell! 
He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and bags, completely blocking the corridor. 
Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. They rech a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio spots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with suitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him. 
Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is a steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen on the other side. 
STEWARD 
Stay calm, please. It's not time to go up to the boats yet. 
Near Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small children and their battered luggage. 
LITTLE BOY 
What are we doing, mummy? 
WOMAN 
We're just waiting, dear. When they fiish putting First Class people in the boats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won't we? 
CUT TO: 
174 EXT. STARBOARD SIDE 
Boat 7 is less than half full, with 28 aboard a boat made for 65. 
FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH 
Lower away! By the left and right together, stady lads! 
The boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the pulley blocks. The women gasp. The boat descends, swaying and jerking, toward the water 60 feet below. The passengers are terrified. 
CUT TO: 
175 EXT. / INT. TITANIC HULL AND MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE 
TRACKING along the rows of portholes angling down into the water. Under the surface, they glow green. PUSHING IN on one porthole which is have submerged. Inside we see Jack, looking apprehensively at the water rising up the glass. 
INSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next to the porthole. Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a .45 bullet on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks up the bullet. 
LOVEJOY 
You know... I believe this ship may sink. 
(crosses to Jack) 
I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation... 
He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. 
LOVEJOY 
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. 
Lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in his pocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe. 
CUT TO: 
176 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE, FORWARD 
At the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the sky and EXPLODES with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall. 
WHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director of White Star Line is cracking. Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the rocket panics him. He starts shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of BOAT 5. 
ISMAY 
There is no time to waste! 
(yelling and waving his arms) 
Lower away! Lower away! Lower away! 
FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks up from the tangled falls at the madman. 
LOWE 
Get out of the way, you fool! 
ISMAY 
Do you know who I am? 
Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay. 
LOWE 
You're a passenger. And I'm a ship's bloody officer. Now do what you're told! 
(MORE) 
LOWE (CONT'D) 
(turning away) 
Steady men! Stand by the falls! 
ISMAY 
(numbly, backing away) 
Yes, quite right. Sorry. 
CUT TO: 
177 EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE 
SECOND OFFICER LIGHTOLLER is loading the boat nearest Cal and Rose... Boat 
LIGHTOLLER 
Women and children only! Sorry sir, no men yet. 
Another rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. Startled faces turn upward. Fear now in the eyes. 
DANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping to get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has Mary posed in front of the scene at the boats.

MCMURPHY Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is! 
NURSE PILBOW (stepping back a little) Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy... 
MCMURPHY I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus... 
BIG NURSE That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may... 
MCMURPHY No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes. 
McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth, holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice. 
McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him. 
HARDING Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy? 
TABER Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too much for ya? 
McMurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into Harding's forehead. 
MCMURPHY You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh? 
HARDING I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right? 
MCMURPHY Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me! 
HARDING (CONT'D) She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady. 
The men look at Big Nurse. 
The patients look at the nurses' station. 
PATIENTS' POV 
Big Nurse is busy at her work. 
INT. NURSES STATION - BIG NURSE'S POV - NIGHT 
The patients looking at her. They turn back to their card game. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse as McMurphy's VOICE is HEARD over INTERCOM. 
MCMURPHY (V.O.) (through intercom) Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card? 
MARTINI (V.O.) (through intercom) Me. Hit me! 
Big Nurse looks up and studies the men gathered round the table. 
INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT 
The patients are asleep except for Bromden, who stands by the window looking out. 
McMurphy is asleep in the bed next to his. A beat when TURKLE, a fifty-year-old Negro night attendant, slightly drunk, lays a gentle hand on Bromden's shoulder. 
TURKLE Le's get back to bed, Mistah Bromden... 
Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself. 
Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees McMurphy looking at him. 
Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in the eye. 
MCMURPHY (whispering) Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'. (sings) Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? This question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? 
McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles through his nightstand. 
MCMURPHY Here ya go, Chief... 
A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package of gum. Bromden picks it up. Examines it. Unwraps it. Deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame, then inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
SHOWING the MEN'S DORM, the empty DAY ROOM, TURKLE ASLEEP in the NURSES' STATION, EMPTY HALLWAYS, the NIGHT SUPERINTENDENT AT HER DESK, MORE HALLWAYS... ENDING ON: 
INT. MEN'S DORM - SUNRISE 
ABERRATED SHOT of INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS SEEN THROUGH STEEL MESH SCREEN -- as the sun rises above the treetops. 
REVERSE SHOT - BROMDEN 
looking out of the window. His face washed by the sunlight. His eyes have a vague look, almost vacuous, as... 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. 
INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY 
as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of bed. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Time to got up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up! 
McMurphy is in bed, not ready for the world, when Washington crosses to Bromden, who is looking out the window, and leads him off. 
WASHINGTON Le's go, Chief. Le's go get ourselves all nice and clean... (to McMurphy) You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy! 
Washington goes off with Bromden.

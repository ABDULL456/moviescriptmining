Glass explodes into glittering mist, and terrorists explodes into bloody spray as Harry pivots the plane and the cannon sweeps the floor clear from side to side.  The Crimson Jihad is vaporized. 
309   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY 
Malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing, but from where he is he can't see what's going on.  He focuses on the key.  He must have that key. 
310   EXT. ROOF - NEAR HELICOPTER - DAY 
Malik's TWO REMAINING MEN run to the helicopter, gesticulating to the pilot to get ready to take off.  The pilot revs the turbine and the rotor whirls faster.  The two men jump in, picking up M-60 machine guns. 
311   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY 
MALIK IS STILL ADVANCING out the crane boom.  Dana slips as she backs up, toppling off the boom.  She is hanging now by her hands over a 20 story drop. 
Malik is almost to her.  He needs a hand free to grab her.  He sets his gun down on the girder.  He grabs for her wrist. 
312   EXT. ROOF - OVERLOOKING EDGE - DAY 
ANGLE LOOKING DOWN.  Malik, Dana, the street far below.  With an unbelievable roar the Harrier sweeps in beneath Dana, FILLING FRAME. 
313   EXT. CRANE BOOM / OVER EDGE - DAY 
Harry has the canopy up.  Malik sees Harry, ten feet below. His eyes narrow with an all-consuming rage.  He glances at the pistol on the beam.  Back at the girl, the key in her teeth-- So close. 
Harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under Dana. 
HARRY (shouting) Let go baby!  I've got you! Daddy's got you! 
314   EXT. ROOF / HARRIER - DAY 
Malik lunges for her wrist.  She screams and lets go-- Dana drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet-- Harry grabs her with his left hand, right hand still on the stick-- He holds her until she can get a grip.  She is lying across the nose of the plane.  Harry starts to bank away and-- 
315   EXT. CRANE BOOM - DAY 
Malik shrieks in rage.  He grabs his 9mm pistol and leaps off the crane-- 
316   EXT. HARRIER - DAY 
Onto the back of the plane.  He starts crawling toward the cockpit.  Dana screams and Harry looks back, but just then-- 
317   EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
The Aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of them-- The door-gunner OPENS FIRE. 
318   EXT. HARRIER - DAY 
Harry banks hard, taking the hits under the wing.  He pivots and slides sideways around the building, playing tag with the copter. 
He can't do anything radical enough to dislodge Malik without tossing off his own daughter. 
319   EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
The helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the doors.  Harry pivots the plane and FIRES THE NOSE CANNON.  The helicopter is riddled.  It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating out of control. 
320   EXT. BUILDING - ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL - DAY 
As the copter hits the ground and explodes.  Fortunately the police had created a cleared perimeter. 
321   EXT. HARRIER - DAY 
THE HARRIER dips and slews, half out of control.  Malik is taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head.  Harry grabs his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming-- He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge-- Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The last Sidewinder missile. 
322   EXT. HARRIER / SIDEWINDER - DAY 
Harry and Malik lock eyes for one long second.  Then Harry hits the FIRING STUD.  The Sidewinder drops away and ignites. Carrying Malik out over Miami Beach.  It explodes a mile out to sea. 
323   INT. HARRIER - COCKPIT - DAY 
HARRY PULLS DANA into the cockpit, settling her on his lap. 
HARRY Don't touch the stick, baby. 
She stares at her father in amazement.  He banks away from the building, accelerating the jet.  He grins at her.  Raises one eyebrow.  Woggles the plane's wings. 
HARRY Hi, pumpkin. 
ONE YEAR LATER 
324   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Dinner at home, and everybody's there.  We come in on the end of some story that everybody thinks is hysterical. 
HELEN ... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope. 
HARRY I told the guy--- (snorts, it's too funny) I told the guy, this isn't even my order. 
Dana is laughing too, a part of it.  They are happy.  They are a family.  Dana gets up, her meal half-eaten as usual. 
DANA I'm done. 
She heads for the front door. 
HARRY I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.

WANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling! 
CLAPPER Scene six, take four! 
NICK And, action. 
INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR 
The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all it's worth. 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
PALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. 
NICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? 
Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration. 
PALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. 
PALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? 
NICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere -- God! 
Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and begins pacing at the rear of the set. 
INT. THE SET. DAY 
NICK Cut! 
WANDA That's a cut. Hold the work, going again, right away. 
NICOLE I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. 
Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a curtness that is a little startling. 
PALOMINO Nick, could I talk to you a second? 
Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head indicating his wish for Nick to follow him. 
WANDA A momentary delay. Everyone stand by. We're going again, right away. 
SOUND Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low on that take. 
NICOLE Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually could I listen to the take before? 
The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last take are heard through the headphones. 
INT. OFF THE SET. DAY 
Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers fiercely. 
PALOMINO I'm out of here, man! 
NICK What's the matter?! 
PALOMINO I like you, but I made a big mistake taking this part. Have someone call me a cab. 
NICK Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to me. What's going on!? 
PALOMINO I can't act with this woman. I know she's a friend of yours but I got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit! I'm giving her everything! The whole thing I just did with the hair; did you see that? I came up with that on my own because I thought it would help her. But no, she's giving me nothing! I'm out of here.

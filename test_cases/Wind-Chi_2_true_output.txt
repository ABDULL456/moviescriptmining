GUY (calling) Ready! 
The tail lights come on as she turns the ignition.   He hears her crank the starter motor. 
Cranking... cranking... cranking... 
Finally turning over. 
She slips the Oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing. 
The rear tires spin, throwing slush; but car won't budge. 
GUY (cont'd) (calling) Give it more gas! 
She floors it; the tires SCREAMING.

He puts everything he's got into pushing, but it's no use. 
Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side. He drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust. 
A beat later he pulls himself up, pounds on the trunk. 
GUY (cont'd) Stop! 
The tires stop spinning. 
35   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                  35 
She's sitting in the driver's seat of the idling car when she hears the crunch-crunch-crunch of his approaching footsteps. 
In that moment she makes a decision. 
Scrambles across the front seat, pulls the door shut hard. 
36   INT./EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                       36 
He arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the power locks all go THUNK. 
He's locked out. 
GUY Hey, open up. 
He tugs at the handle a few times.      Knocks on the window. 
GUY (cont'd) You wanna pop the locks? 
When there's no response from her he puts his lips to the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window. 
GUY (cont'd) You gonna unlock the door or what? 
She sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window. 
She keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone. 
No signal.

GUY (cont'd) Hey, c'mon, it's freezing out here! 
GIRL Better get used to it, asshole. 
He rattles the door handle, starting to get panicked now. 
GUY What the hell is wrong with you? What did I do? 
But she's in full-blown paranoid mode now, near hysterics. 
GIRL You drove us here, that's what you did!! What the hell did you think you were doing!? 
GUY I thought I was driving you home. 
GIRL You're not driving me home because one, you don't live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere. Now what are we doing here? Why did you get off the highway? 
GUY I told you, this is a shortcut. Anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway. This used to be called `Scenic 606' because there's an amazing view of the valley- 
GIRL One, you've never been anywhere near here before so don't pretend you knew it's a shortcut, and two, there's an amazing view of shit BECAUSE IT'S PITCH BLACK OUT! 
He stands there as she freaks out.

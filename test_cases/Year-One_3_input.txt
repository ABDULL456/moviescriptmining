CAIN (louder, mock sincerity) I said good luck. I'm really worried about him. He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's benefit. 
ADAM You're not coming? 
CAIN Yeah, I am. I just have to finish toiling over here, then I'm right behind you. Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart. CAIN                                                           (cont'd) (to Zed and Oh) Now listen, I'm getting out of here, and you better come with me. I have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole "Abel- killing-thing" on you. 
ZED Why would they blame us? 
CAIN Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh. CAIN                                                           (cont'd) Four! It makes four! Now stop asking so many questions and hop on. We gotta get out of here! He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward.

Adam and the other farmers discover Abel's body. 
ADAM 
(BITTERLY) 
CAIN-- (to the others) After him! The farmers shout and race back to the hamlet.

Adam and the other farmers jump onto two more oxcarts and set out after Cain, Zed and Oh.

Cain's cart lumbers along. He looks back over his shoulder. 
CAIN (urgently, to Zed and Oh) They're gaining on us! Zed and Oh look back. 
THEIR POV The other oxcarts are a hundred yards back, "chasing" them at maybe two miles per hour. Cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to 3 MPH. 
CAIN 
(GLEEFUL) Hah! They'll never catch us now! An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his pursuers. Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into the cart. He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged burn mark on his forehead.

Zed and Oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at the sky.

The ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the seacoast, a kind of makeshift tent city around a central marketplace. Several dhows are tied up at the shore, camels and pack animals are tethered on the fringes, while TRADERS and MERCHANTS inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over prices.

Zed, Oh and Cain wander through the crowded market. PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy, sell, and barter goods from distant lands. Zed and oh gawk like a couple of yokels. 
ZED Look at all these people! And this stuff! Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread. 
OH (to the Merchant) Can I have one of those? He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with a cane. OH                                                              (cont'd) Ow! 
MERCHANT Two silver pieces. 
CAIN 
(HUNGRY) We're gonna need some money.

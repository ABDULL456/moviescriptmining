Last chance, "love". 
NOAH 
(DEFIANT) 
Get bent, you dried-up bitch. 
From behind, we see Kali lower the vibrating needle towards Noah's eye. His SHRILL SCREAMS split the night as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT 
Curve and Kali are leaving the shop. Suddenly Curve clutches at his chest, wincing in pain. He opens his coat, looks down at his chest... 
THE CROW TATTOO 
is dripping blood from its beak and talons. 
Curve staggers back, horrified. Kali is watching him. 
CURVE 
No...no... 
KALI 
What is it? 
But Curve isn't listening. He leaps onto his motorcycle and hits the ignition. He takes off with a ROAR... 
KALI 
Curve! 
It's no good. Curve is long gone. 
CUT TO: 
NOTE: The following scene appears here in the script, but in the film it appears in Chapter 12. 
INT. SECOND COMING FETISH CLUB - NIGHT 
Curve makes his way to the bar. He rips open a glassine bag of Trinity and vacuum snorts it. His eyes roll up in his head as the chemicals flow. Another wave of pain washes over him. Curve claws at his chest, falls against the bar... 
CURVE 
...goawaygoawaygoawaygoaway... 
TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL 
The MUSIC fades to a muted echo of distant WAR DRUMS. As a feeling of inexorable doom settles over him, Curve lifts his head and sees... 
ASHE 
reflected in the bar mirror, materializing out of the narcotic haze. He's wading through the ocean of bodies. In his face paint and black leather Ashe looks like he's just another part of the twisted scene. people are stroking him, brushing up against him - like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma. 
Ashe lifts his hand - he's clutching House o' Peep Zeke's sawed-off shotgun. 
Curve DIVES to the floor as Ashe's shotgun blast shatters the bar mirror, taking out his own reflection. Curve rolls, climbs to his feet, starts running... 
The Samoan bartender grabs a semi-auto pistol, opens up on Ashe. Now some of the other ARMED DOORMEN are FIRING too... 
...but Ashe keeps on coming, trudging through the HAIL OF GUNFIRE. Bullets are EXPLODING over his body at an insane rate. Ashe is a human roman candle. Nothing is going to stop him from reaching Curve, nothing. 
The Samoan stops firing. He takes one look at Ashe, who's still coming at them... 
Fuck this. He turns tail and run. 
EXT. SECOND COMING FETISH CLUB - NIGHT 
Curve comes storming out the back door like a bat out of Hell. He takes the rear stairs three at a time, spilling into a couple of back-alley JUNKIES. He stumbles into a pile of garbage, scatters some rats... 
Curve makes for his bike, which is parked nearby. He fumbles with the key, hits the starter switch... 
Ashe comes flying off from a second story fire escape, landing atop a car roof on all fours, popping the windows. 
ASHE 
Time's up, Curve. 
CURVE 
Fuck you, bird-dick! 
Curve jerks his bike towards the street and guns it... 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Yes. 
DERM 
It's Detective Derm.  I'm sorry to call you so late, but I thought you would want to hear this. 
ED 
Yes? 
DERM 
I'm afraid I have some bad news. 
ED 
What is it? 
DERM 
It's your wife.  We've found her... 
ED 
You found her. 
DERM 
We found her body. 
ED 
Her... 
DERM 
Yes, sir.  In the woods, near George Simian's house, where we found her car.  I'm afraid she's dead. 
Ed drops the phone.  He walks trance-like into the hallway. 
He follows the noise into the - 
INT. BATHROOM 
The noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human, like a baby gurgling. 
As Ed walks into the bathroom, he can see that there is something in the bathtub. The shower curtain is closed, but behind it, there is some sort of body moving. Ed pulls the curtain back. He reveals a baby, just born, lying in the tub. Most of the murky water has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub. 
The BABY is a newborn, except that its eyes are maybe larger than they would be. The Baby is also SIX FEET TALL. It's immense frame fills the bathtub. It is naked (it's a boy). 
Ed watches with amazement. The baby looks incredibly real, except for its size. The stare at each other for a minute. The baby looks a lot like George Simian. It has his eyes. 
Other than this, it behaves like a baby. It is lying on its back, gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and his left hand gripping the shower curtain. 
The baby reaches out for Ed lovingly. 
Ed backs away. 
Seeing this, the baby starts crying. 
Ed, panicking, approaches the baby. It is still crying. Ed reaches out to touch it. He touches its arm and the baby's crying starts to subside. The baby moves with typical, quick, chaotic movements that, because of the baby's size, are almost threatening. 
Ed puts his hand in the baby's hand. The baby grips it as baby's do, but this baby's hand is about the size of Ed's. The baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling. 
Ed tries to pull his hand back, but the baby won't let go. The baby, it seems, is incredibly strong. Ed pulls harder. He still can't get the baby to let go. Ed tries to pry the baby's fingers off, and this time manages to get his hand out of the baby's grip. 
But as soon as he does, the baby starts crying again. 
He backs out into the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed is in a panic.  The baby's cries echo around him as he backs away from the bathroom. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Ed finds himself in the kitchen. He looks at his hands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub. He washes them off in the sink. He looks over at the kitchen knife which has been drying in the dish rack. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed walks slowly, purposefully to the bathroom.  The crying baby gets louder as he approaches. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He comes into the bathroom, but in the tub, instead of the baby, there is a grown man's body. It is Ed, staring up at himself from under the water. We only see a very tight shot of BATHTUB ED's head and part of his neck. His head is under water and he looks up, unable to move. 
We then see the reverse shot of this and it is also of Ed, so that Ed is, in effect, looking up at himself through the cloudy water. 
The baby cries continue, although the baby is no longer in the scene. 
From Bathtub Ed's point of view, we see the other Ed takes the kitchen knife and lean forward and to the right, off-camera. 
Bathtub Ed, who can move his eyes, tries to look to his arm, where the other Ed is cutting. Soon, blood starts to mix with the water, diffusing over Bathtub Ed's face. 
The blood also diffuses over Bathtub Ed's P.O.V., as he looks up at the other Ed cutting him. When the other Ed is finished cutting, Bathtub Ed sees him put the knife aside and then reach down, off-camera. After a short struggle, the other Ed pulls up Bathtub Ed's severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has already prepared. 
The blood from Bathtub Ed's cut fills the water with dark blood, turning the film red. 
The red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed, with a bucket and sponge, is cleaning pockets of blood from the floor and walls.  He is crying while he does this. 
He squeezes the sponge for the last time, then inspects the hallway as closely as he can, searching for any spots he might have missed. 
Then he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He dumps the water from the bucket into the bathtub. The water is pink and dirty. He sits down on the edge of the bathtub and watches the water go down the drain. 
He stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front door.  He turns to listen to it in the other room. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
As he opens the bathroom door, he sees that the sun is shining in from the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Geoffrey stands patiently outside as Ed opens the door. He carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work. His appearance is a stark contrast to the half-dressed, blood-shot Ed.

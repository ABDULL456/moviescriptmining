Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes. Marcel is in the kitchenette. 
DANIEL (to Zero) When we get back to Paris I'll take you dancing. 
Zero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag.      He places it on the counter. 
DANIEL Bring me the scissors. 
ZERO And the Vodka. 
Sami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls. 
DANIEL Cut his pants up the leg to the groin. 
ZERO And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one. 
He winks at Sami. 
SAMI What's he joking around for?    He's been shot. 
DANIEL He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it. 
Raymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench, the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes some white bread. 
SAMI Anybody hungry? 
DANIEL What'd you get? 
SAMI Some bread and... 
He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the bread. 
SAMI Cheese. 
All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet. 
DANIEL Cheese?   In a can? 
Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite. 
SAMI It's good. 
MARCEL God, I want to go home. 
SAMI Hey, you know you can't this in France. 
DANIEL Thank God. 
Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about to happen. 
DANIEL (to Zero) Ready? 
Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His face contorts violently from the pain. 
INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- EVENING 
Zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta. DEAN MARTIN "Innamaraia" plays on the stereo. EDDIE, 60's, arthritic, finishes making an espresso. He starts carrying it over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in front of the other. Zammito watches him with strained patience. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" enter. Their faces tell the story. 
ZAMMITO What happened? 
NICKY "THE RAKE" They sort of got away. 
ZAMMITO I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss. 
ZAMMITO Oh, I'm sorry. 
Zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws it at him. 
ZAMMITO Had enough? 
Joey "Two Tons" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are stuck to his face. Zammito walks over to him. 
ZAMMITO Try to get this through that fat, stupid fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead. 
They turn around and leave.       Zammito stares after them angrily. 
ZAMMITO Cafones! 
He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table. 
ZAMMITO You gonna bring that over here today, or what? 
INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING 
Zero is passed out, a half empty Vodka bottle on the nightstand. The others have been up all night. Raymond is across the table from Sami. 
RAYMOND The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?

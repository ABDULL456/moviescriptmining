Natalie scrunches it up and throws it down. Leonard and Natalie sit down on the couch. 
NATALIE You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure. 
LEONARD There are things you know for sure. 
NATALIE Such as? 
LEONARD I know the feel of the world. (reaches forward) I know how this wood will sound when I knock. (raps knuckles on coffee table) I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up. (handles glass) Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much. (runs hands over objects) I know the feel of the world, (beat) and I know her. 
NATALIE Your wife? 
LEONARD She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes. 
Natalie stares at Leonard, thinking.

NATALIE Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket. 
Leonard takes his jacket off and places it on the back of the couch, patting the pockets as he does so. 
LEONARD It's not easy to be calm when - 
NATALIE Just relax. 
She reaches for his arm and unbuttons his cuff, revealing the end of Leonard's tattoos. 
NATALIE (cont'd) You don't seem the type. 
She pushes back the sleeve, trying to read the tattoo. Leonard watches her.							    * 
NATALIE (cont'd) Come on. 
She starts to unbutton his shirt. He watches. Natalie gasps as she opens Leonard's shirt and pulls it back over his shoulders. She tilts her head, trying to read the different messages. 
NATALIE (cont'd) It's backwards.							    * 
She pulls him up and turns him around in front of the mirror    * to read the backwards tattoo across his chest.			   * 
"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE". 
Natalie touches the blank area of skin above Leonard's heart.   * 
NATALIE (cont'd)					   * Here?							    * 
Leonard looks down at the blank patch, then at Natalie,	    * vulnerable, confused.							   * 
LEONARD							  * It's... it must be for when I've found him.		 * She looks at Leonard. Leonard shrugs. Natalie studies		 * Leonard's chest, avoiding his eyes.					    *

Natalie picks up a photograph from off a messy desk in the corner. She shows it to Leonard. The picture shows Natalie smiling and hugging a smirking YOUNG MAN (JIMMY). Natalie	  * looks up at Leonard to see his reaction. 
NATALIE His name was Jimmy. 
LEONARD What happened? 
NATALIE He went to meet somebody and didn't come back. 
LEONARD Who did he go to meet? 
Natalie studies Leonard. 
NATALIE A guy called Teddy. 
Leonard does not react to the name. 
LEONARD What do the police think? 
NATALIE They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy. 
Natalie puts the photo down. She reaches out to Leonard,	   * spreading her fingers over the blank part of his chest.	    * 
NATALIE (cont'd) When you find this guy, this John G., what are you going to do? 
LEONARD Kill him. 
NATALIE Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people. 
58   INT. NATALIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT <>		 58 
Natalie, eyes closed, has her head on Leonard's chest. He is shirtless, lying on top of the covers.

LEONARD I don't even know how long she's been			  * gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow I just		   * know that she'll never come back to bed.		    * I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone. If I could just reach out and		   * touch her side of the bed I could know			 * that it was cold, but I can't. I have no		    * idea when she left.							* 
Natalie's eyes are open. 
LEONARD (cont'd) I know I can't have her back, but I want		    * to be able to let her go. I don't want to wake up every morning thinking she's still here then realizing that she's not. I want time to pass, but it won't. How			 * can I heal if I can't feel time?

JIMBO Yeah, "Sorry."  I get strip searched and you go off playing snow angels... 
RADIO HOST (O.S.) Well, we've got one now, don't we!? 
WOMAN CALLER (O.S.) That was different. From what I read in the paper he was unconscious. And now people are going to use this as an excuse to-- 
RADIO HOST (O.S.) Hey lady, why don't you tell Raymond Barnell how wolves have gotten a bad rap. 
WOMAN CALLER (O.S.) I can tell you from years of experience that wolves do not operate-- 
JIMBO Wait a minute. 
RADIO HOST (O.S.) You can tell me all you want, lady, but it is an undeniable, indisputable fact.  This Barnell guy got turned into a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild animals... 
JIM'S POV: Through the windshield, looking at the sign for "Barnell Great Escapes Travel."  Jimbo and Gary look at each other. Maybe...

Ted at his cubicle on his phone. 
TED Yeah, hi, it's Ted Watters from Fidelity Mutual. (beat) I need a complete credit work up on a Raymond Barnell... and Paul, a Paul Barnell too... sure, I'll hold. 
Cam walks by, leans his head over the top of the cubicle. 
CAM You start the month ends yet? 
TED Can you take care of it?  I'm kinda... working on something. 
CAM Oh God, you're not still on the Barnell thing are you-- 
Ted pulls Cam down into his cubicle, talks in a harsh whisper. 
TED I went to see him. 
CAM And?  Then?  So? 
TED Trust me. Something's not right.  I can smell it.  Help me buy a week. 
CAM We're gonna get in such trouble. 
TED I promise from now on you can come along on everything. 
CAM No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted disappears for three hours? 
TED I'll try. 
CAM And you'll work on your interpersonal skills? 
TED (a long beat) Yes. 
CAM Good.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go start covering your ass.

Paul sits beside his desk, flipping through travel brochures. Margaret enters, teetering in the doorway.  Paul looks up. 
PAUL Hey.  How's my Princess? 
MARGARET OK.  I took some Adavan.  And called my psychic. 
PAUL (picks up the phone bill) Honey, you know how expensive that is.  I thought we agreed that... 
She moves to him, runs her hand through his hair. 
MARGARET Don't be mad.  It's just... this week has been so... well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and someone trying to steal the fridge. 
PAUL I know.  Why don't you -- 
MARGARET We got another letter from the HMO today. 
PAUL Have you opened it yet? 
Margaret starts to CRY, holding the letter up to her face the SOBS building to a full blown breakdown. 
PAUL (cont'd) Oh hey honey, come on now. 
MARGARET I'm sorry.  It's just, fucking cocksuckers. 
Paul takes the letter, unfolds it and reads... 
PAUL "As we have stated previously... usual onset before the age of 18... coupled with no genetic history..."

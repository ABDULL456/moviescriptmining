She tries the handle. Tries it again. Desperately yanks it. Not opening, no sir... 
Elena looks over, see Chad's limp elbow on the door lock... 
OUTSIDE THE CAR 
The small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and...WHOOSH! 
INSIDE THE CAR 
Elena can't help but hear the unmistakable sound of FLAMES CRACKLING. Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of FIRE racing towards the car she's trapped in! 
She reaches over, clawing her way past Chad's corpse, trying to reach the door lock. Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable to pull it up. 
THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet away... 
Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face. 
The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly. Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage... 
INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON 
The Curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor. Marie looks at him like he's mad. 
MARIE What the hell are you doing? 
CURATOR One last test... 
The Curator hovers his heel over the biggest Diamond. Marie screams out! 
MARIE NO! 
He slams his foot down and the DIAMOND SHATTERS! 
INT. CHAD'S CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON 
Elena SCREAMS as the passenger side window next to her SMASHES, SPLINTERING into a million glass fragments. 
Hands reach in and grab her, pulling her through the FLAMES... 
Seconds later Elena finds herself on the swamp floor, in Kristen's singed arms... 
KRISTEN You okay? 
Elena can barely talk, looking back at the flaming wreckage in front of her... 
KRISTEN Care to explain? 
ELENA It was...it was an accident... 
The flames reflect in her tear-filled eyes. 
INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON 
Marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor... 
CURATOR Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't believe they were our top attraction all these years... 
Every muscle in Marie's body contracts...She stands before the empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of her mother cradling her as a baby. 
MARIE That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn Christmas ornaments... 
And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from the case and tears it to shreds... 
CURATOR Marie, please... 
There's no stopping her now. Red-faced, she lashes out at the display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING... 
CURATOR Marie, stop this instant! 
She continues her rampage regardless, ripping a FIRE EXTINGUISHER from the wall and hurling it through another display case... 
MARIE I hate you, Mom!    I'm glad you're dead! 
EXT. BLUE BAY PD - NIGHT 
Storm clouds gather over the whitewashed Police station...

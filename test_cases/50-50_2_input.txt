Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door. 
EDITH So what's for dinner? 
INT. ADAM'S DINING ROOM - LATER 
Everyone sits around the table. Edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at. 
RACHEL If I had known you were coming I would have made something else. 
EDITH I'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son... (looks at her plate) So this isn't meat? 
RACHEL No it's called sei-tan. 
ADAM It's made of wheat gluten. 
Edith looks more confused. 
EDITH But it's not meat. 
RACHEL No, but it has a texture just like meat. 
Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash. 
EDITH (INSINCERE) Mmmmm. It's Good. 
Edith puts her spoon down. She pulls a handful of pills out her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art. 
EDITH (CONT'D) Art, take your pills. 
Art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but doesn't swallow. 
EDITH (CONT'D) Swallow. 
As Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel. 
EDITH (CONT'D) So? Did you set a date? 
RACHEL (CONFUSED) A date? 
EDITH (TO ADAM) Do not do summer like your cousin, remember how awful that was? Schlepping around in the heat like that. Plus the bugs and the gnats. 
ADAM (whispers to Rachel) What is she talking about? 
EDITH And now Rachel. I know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert? 
RACHEL (whispers to Adam) She thinks we're getting married. 
ADAM Mom. We're not getting married. 
EDITH Oh thank god. (TO RACHEL) No offense. (TO ADAM) So then what's the big news that you made us rush all the way over here. 
Not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news... 
ADAM Have you ever seen "Terms of Endearment"? 
RACHEL Oh jesus Adam, just tell her. 
EDITH Tell me what? 
ADAM Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm. 
EDITH Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic. 
ADAM Mom, just promise me. Okay? 
EDITH I promise...You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon. 
Here goes nothing. 
ADAM (MUMBLES) I have cancer. 
EDITH What? 
ADAM (MUMBLES) I have cancer. 
EDITH (TO RACHEL) What is he saying? 
ADAM (takes a deep breath) I have cancer. 
EDITH Cancer? What do you mean you have cancer? 
ADAM I - HAVE - CANCER. 
EDITH I don't understand.

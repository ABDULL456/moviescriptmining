FOX No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me the scenic route already. Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly: 
FOX By the way, you look unbelievably beautiful tonight. You're practically glowing. Maybe it's the lighting. 
Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her cheek. (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this shot which can be literally lit from within.) With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond, bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a rapid reverse-flip with a flourish. Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs impatiently. They duck inside. They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky: 
FOX What's that? I think that's a fox-trap! Look at this. 
MRS. FOX Get away from there. 
FOX Is it spring-loaded? Yeah... (pointing to different spots) I guess if you come from over there, and you're standing at the door to the squab shack, this little gadget probably triggers the -- (gesturing to Mrs. Fox) Move out of the way, darling. That's right where it's going to land. Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm. 
MRS. FOX Come on! Stop it! Let's go! 
Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief. 
FOX No, it just falls straight down right here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring- loaded. Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open, voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says 
QUIETLY: 
MRS. FOX I'm pregnant. Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved. 
FOX Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey, that's great news! 
MRS. FOX If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I want you to find another line of work. Pause. Fox nods. 
CUT TO: A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods, green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a river running through the middle. 
TITLE: 2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years) 
EXT. HOLE. DAY 
The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with holly bushes. 
INT. HOLE. DAY 
A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin- striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk. 
She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored, Victorian-style dress. 
INSERT: A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox. 
FOX Does anybody actually read my column? Do your friends ever talk about it? 
MRS. FOX 
(STILL STIRRING) Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex- girlfriend just said to me last week, "I should read Foxy's column," but they don't get the Gazette. (yelling into the next room) Ash! Let's get cracking! 
FOX Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY 
Dr. Rumack and Elaine walk across the well-groomed lawn. Elaine carries a box of spaghetti-to-go.  As they walk, they pass patients in wheelchairs pushed by nurses.  The further they walk, the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other, patients falling out, total wheelchair chaos. 
ELAINE Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor. 
RUMACK The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder. (he stops at a patient in a wheelchair with his back TO CAMERA) Let me show you. (Rumack removes the top of the patient's skull and takes out his brain as they continue on) Ted's problem is in this area. (points with a pencil) This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

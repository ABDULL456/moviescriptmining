There is a murmur from the crowd ... 
CLOSE UP. GEORGE. 
He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a shiny new pin can give you. 
SHOT. BOB. 
He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS. 
BOB Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket. 
There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats. Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair. 
BOB (CONT) This is from Mary Petersen's front porch. She found one last week. There were two more this morning ... 
The MURMUR starts to grow ...

EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 
David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright RED bow. 
DAVID (softly) I got you something. 
Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled. 
MARGARET It's beautiful. Where'd you get it? 
DAVID It was a prop for the school play ... 
She looks down and giggles. 
MARGARET Can I open it? 
DAVID Sure ... 
Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the corner. 
WIDER. 
David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with BLACK AND WHITE faces ... 
DRIVER Hello Bud ... 
DAVID (clipped) Hello Whitey. 
They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and arrogant. 
WHITEY (more pointed) Hello Margaret. 
MARGARET Hello Whitey ... 
WHITEY (loud) Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now? 
DAVID (curt) No reason. (pause/ firing back) How come you're not? 
WHITEY Oh. We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. See. 
He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and leers ... 
WHITEY (CONT) No reason hunh ... See I thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend. 
Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around her and pulls her close. 
DAVID Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here. 
WHITEY Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that. 
He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns toward Margaret. 
WHITEY (CONT) (leering more) You know Margaret, you can come over and bake those Oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to. 
They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David holds her tighter ... 
DAVID It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything. 
She nods, groping for reassurance ...

INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT. 
The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing. Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the audience. 
WOMAN Ed McFadden's got a blue front door. 
ED MCFADDEN It's always been blue! 
WOMAN Not that blue! 
MAN There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard! 
SHOT. GEORGE. 
He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ... 
BOB People, people ... I think we all know what's going on here. 
SHOT. BOB. 
Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit. 
BOB Obviously certain "changes" have been happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been-- well ... "Pleasant." And, recently, certain things have become ... "Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are "Un-Pleasant." 
There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ... 
BOB (CONT) George, why don't you and Burt take the lead on this. Why don't you put together kind of an "Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...

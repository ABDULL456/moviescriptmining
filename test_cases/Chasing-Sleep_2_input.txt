When she left for work this morning.  She was supposed to come home after work.  I cooked dinner. 
STEWART 
And she made it to work, right? 
ED 
Yes.  I think so.  I don't know. 
STEWART 
What time does she usually come home?  Around six? 
ED 
Yes.  Usually. 
STEWART 
What does she look like? 
ED 
She's blonde, straight hair. 
STEWART 
What was she wearing?  Do you remember? 
ED 
I think it was a red sweater and a dress. 
STEWART 
What kind of car does she drive? 
ED 
A Volvo.  Gray.  '85, I think. 
Stewart lets out a sigh of relief. 
STEWART 
Well, you had me worried. There was a blonde woman involved with a car-jacking around six. Apparently she was hit on the head by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the incident in a daze. Nobody's seen her since. When I got the call on the radio, I thought that must have been your wife, but this woman was driving a Pathfinder and was wearing jeans, so it probably wasn't her. You had me worried. 
ED 
She drove a Volvo.  Drives a Volvo. 
STEWART 
That's a relief.  Do you know anywhere your wife might have gone? 
ED 
I called the only place I could think of.  And I called the hospital. 
STEWART 
Harborview? 
ED 
Yes. 
Stewart takes a couple of pills from a bottle and takes them, chasing them down with a coffee he has with him. 
STEWART 
I'm afraid there's not much I can do now. By law, we can't put out a missing persons until 72 hours has elapsed since the last time she was seen. 
ED 
72 hours? 
STEWART 
Usually in these cases, it was something stupid. Maybe she was upset about something, had to get away. Who knows? What I can do is take the license plate number of her car and if it shows up for some reason, we'll give you a call. Do you have your wife's license plate number? 
ED 
Yes.  Actually, it's easy to remember.  007 FEC. 
STEWART 
James Bond. 
ED 
Right.  And FEC, For Every Child. 
STEWART 
And what's her name? 
ED 
Eve.  Eve Saxon. 
STEWART 
And your name? 
ED 
Ed.  Saxon. 
STEWART 
Like I said, it was probably something stupid.  Did you have a fight? 
ED 
Not at all. 
STEWART 
Well, you should try to get some sleep and, if she doesn't show up tomorrow, give us a call and we'll see what things look like then. OK?

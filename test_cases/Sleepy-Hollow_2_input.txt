Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table, crossing his arms and resting his head. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT 
A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace. 
Behind her, a shadow moves across the room. 
EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT 
Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking the entrance of Sleepy Hollow. 
INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT 
Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window between him and the driver slides open. 
VAN RIPPER Sir... this is yours. (offering something) The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone. 
Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He studies it.  What melancholy. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door... 
INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT 
Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it. 
The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird appears to be inside the cage. 
Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window. 
A tear rolls down his cheek. 
The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops. 
Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans forward to the window at front. 
OUTSIDE THE COACH 
Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper. 
ICHABOD Van Ripper, turn the coach about! 
VAN RIPPER What did you say? 
ICHABOD Turn around.  Now! 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT 
Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly. 
YOUNG MASBATH Hello?  Katrina? 
Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor. 
EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT 
The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries... 
INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT 
Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern. 
ICHABOD Pardon the intrusion... 
INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor. 
ICHABOD I never examined these bodies. 
Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed. 
ICHABOD Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance. 
Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps. 
ICHABOD Stains of blood. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER What of it? 
Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck. 
ICHABOD Jagged flesh. (pause) The Horseman did not do this. 
Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand with the stitched gash on its palm. 
ICHABOD Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...

Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ... 
Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures. A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 
"AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES" 
start flashing ... 
A different set of numbers start running backwards ... 
STEED You must be joking ... 
349     EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS. 
VALENTINE Fool ... 
In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead. 
STEED That will do. 
He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver. 
VALENTINE Aren't you forgetting about something? 
STEED You are, and it's behind you. 
VALENTINE Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- 
Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace. 
VALENTINE Let go, you ... idiot ... 
Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine. 
STEED I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? 
VALENTINE Ugh ... 
As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as -- 
One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine locked in her arms in a dying embrace. 
They fall into the mists and liquid below. 
Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ... 
350     EMMA 
Dead. 
STEED Emma! 
He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body. 
Emma lying sprawled out on the ground. 
Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with tears.  He lays her down. 
STEED Emma ... 
He produces Peter's ring. 
351     CLOSEUP - RING 
Slips it onto her finger and ...

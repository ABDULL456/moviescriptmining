HOLMES (indicating) Your Trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you -- it's a chilly morning -- we don't want to keep them standing around too long, do we, Fraulein Hoffmanstal? (Gabrielle looks at him without answering) Come now. It's too late to play cat and mouse. 
GABRIELLE (flatly) Unter dem Schloss. 
HOLMES Thank you. (holding out parasol) Here's your signalling device -- it's a bit damp, I'm afraid -- would you care to let them know where they can find the submersible? (Gabrielle makes no move to take the parasol) No? Then I'll just have to do it myself. (moving toward window) I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion. 
Keeping well to one side of the open window, he extends the parasol outside, opens it, starts sending out a series of long and short signals. 
LAKEFRONT - DAWN 
von Tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in the direction of the hotel. 
HOTEL - FROM MONKS' ANGLE - DAWN 
Outside the hotel window, Gabrielle's parasol can be seen flashing the message UNTER DEM SCHLOSS in Morse code -- but it is not apparent that Holmes is doing the signalling. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN 
As Holmes continues opening and closing the parasol, Gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him. Holmes finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back into the room. Then he looks out the window. 
LAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN 
The monks turn away from the hotel, and with von Tirpitz in the lead, move off along the shore. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN 
Holmes steps back from the window, faces Gabrielle. 
HOLMES Well, it's up to the good monks now. You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal. 
GABRIELLE You're all wrong about me.   My name isn't Hoffmanstal. 
HOLMES It isn't? 
GABRIELLE It's von Hoffmanstal. 
HOLMES I stand corrected. 
GABRIELLE (glancing toward window) I suppose once they're in the castle... It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap. 
HOLMES It's more amusing than that. Once in the castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance -- it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards. 
GABRIELLE (skeptically) You mean you're going to let them have the air-pump? 
HOLMES Better than that. We're going to let them have the submersible. They will find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're all expert sailors? And since there is a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland, I expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea. 
GABRIELLE Did you say try to? 
HOLMES I would suggest you get your things together. Mycroft will be here to take you into custody. 
He opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack at the foot of the bed. Gabrielle watches him for a beat, then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothes out. 
GABRIELLE I never had you fooled for a moment, did I? You knew right from the beginning -- when the cabbie brought me to Baker Street. 
HOLMES Let me see -- not quite that soon. 
He stretches out on the bed. 
GABRIELLE It's so funny. I asked for this assignment, you know. I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best. I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer game. 
HOLMES Close enough. 
GABRIELLE You're just being kind.   I failed miserably. 
HOLMES We all have occasional failures. Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes about mine. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Watson, back in his valet's outfit again, comes bounding down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward the door of Holmes' room. 
WATSON Holmes!   Holmes! 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Bright sunlight now floods the room.   Gabrielle, fully dressed, is standing in front of the  mirror, putting on her hat. Her packed bag has been set   out in the middle of the room, and resting on it is the  parasol. 
The door bursts open and Watson dashes in. 
WATSON Holmes! 
In his haste he trips over the bag, goes down. As he picks himself up again, Gabrielle points toward the balcony.

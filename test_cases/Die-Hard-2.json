DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 1 \nJOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a \"GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD\" sign on the rear window. \nMCCLANE I'm here, I'm here, false alarm, let's just let her down nice and easy - \nCOP Sure. At the impound lot. \n(POINTING) Next time, read the sign. \nMCCLANE You don't understand, I'm just meeting my wife's-plane - you gotta give me this car back. \nCOP Sure.

How about some team spirit? \nCOP I was in LA once. Hated it. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n1 CONTINUED - \nMCCLANE (going with the flow) I can relate to that. Hate it myself- (turning to tow guy) Hey, that's a plastic fender, Jesus- (back to cop) See, I used to be a New York cop still got my ID somewhere -I only moved 'cause my wife got promoted - look, maybe we can settle this right here, we're in Washington, heartbeat of Democracy, one hand washes the other He realizes the truck is DRIVING AWAY one way while the cop is i going off the other way - McClane votes for the cop - \nMCCLANE Hey, c'mon, it's Christmas - \nCOP So Ask Santa to bring you another car. \nI \nMCCLANE \n(SOTTO) You son of a - BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat, finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into the terminal. \n2 INT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 2 \nCHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic voices. McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out of sight from the public. \nMCCLANE 1ST NEWSCASTER Telephones? (on TV) .and that White Christmas INFORMATION GIRL may be here for a while, if (pointing) that new storm front moves Right over there. to the Metro area this afternoon as predicted. McClane nods, serves across the slick linoleum. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n2 CONTINUED - 2 1ST NEWSCASTER(cont'd) Correspondent Leonard Adkins is in a warmer clime, with a story that grows hotter by the minute. \n2A WITH MCCLANE 2A he fairly SKIDS to a halt at a line of PHONE BOOTHS - and outside each booth a long LINE of people with their armfuls of luggage \nA and gifts. McClane's BEEPER goes off again. \nMCCLANE \n(DESPONDENT) Ho - ho - ho... \nthru OMITTED thru \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AIRPORT - THROUGH WINDOW - SAME TIME \nI A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg chains is hustled aboard a plane. \nHOLLY My husband doesn't think so. \nOLDER WOMAN Well, I do. I used to carry around those awful mace things - She opens her purse and displays a Taser stun gun. OLDER WOMAN(cont'd) \n(SHOWING IT) Now I zap any bastard who screws with me. I tried it on my little dog, poor thing, limped for a week. As Holly tries to smile politely, we \nCUT TO: \n15 MCCLANE 15 Coming out of the phone booth and almost COLLIDING with - \n(X) \n16 NEW ANGLE 16 Colonel Stuart. \nSTUART Excuse me - Pause as they dance away from each other. Then - \nI MCCLANE --do I know you? \nSTUART \nR (TIGHTLY) I... get that a lot. I've... been on TV. \nJ \nMCCLANE You and me both, pal. The hell with it. Now it's Stuart's turn to look at McClane oddly; then he moves off. McClane looks after him, trying to place him... shrugs... heads for the bar. \nCUT TO: \n17 A LITTLE SEMI-RURAL CHURCH - NEAR THE AIRPORT 17 Charming until the SUB WOOFER ROAR of a big jet SCREAMS by, practically in the little church's backyard. Now we notice that the church is a little run down - trim needing paint, sidewalk cracked - and a neat SIGN confirms our \nSUSPICIONS: \n\"FUTURE SITE OF PARISH DAY CARE CENTER. \nWORSHIP WITH US AT OUR NEW CHURCH, \n52 KENSINGTON ROAD, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA.\" A DWP VAN pulls up, snow tires CRUNCHING on the driveway here. Two MEN (BAKER and THOMPSON) get out in official DWP wardrobe. But we remember the trim bodies, trimmer hair... and we remember those gift wrapped packages, - which one of these guys carries. \n18 INSIDE THE CHURCH 18 On a TV here, the newscast CONTINUES, now back to the tropical airport. Esperanza is at the top of the steps, waving to the press like a triumphant hero - not a felon en route to prison. The plane doors close and it taxis down the runway. WIDEN from the set, which an elderly CUSTODIAN is watching while he eats some instant soup. The DOORBELL RINGS. The custodian answers it. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n18 CONTINUED - 18 \nCUSTODIAN NEWSCASTER' Yes? (on TV) Although Esperanza was BAKER removed as Commander in Sorry to bother you, sir.

Baker and Thompson glance at each other. \nTHOMPSON Would you mind if we take a look? \nCUSTODIAN Help yourself. \n18A WIDER 18A The three men walk down the main aisle of the church. Dust motes dance in the colored light. \nCUSTODIAN Don't seem right, somehow, closing a church down. Oh, I know the parish is gonna keep using it, but it won't be the same. Been here a lot of years; and I been right here with it. They've arrived at a rear window. FOCUS CHANGE to a green CONDUIT BOX on the the church's rear lawn, half covered in snow. FOCUS back through the glass. Thompson looks questioningly at Baker, who nods. \nCUSTODIAN Yep. I kinda feel a part of me is dying along with this church. \nBAKER Well, you're right about that. BLAM BLAM GLAM. BULLETS RIP through the end of the Christmas package, SLAM the custodian up and into a row of pews, which \nOVERTURN. \n(X) \n19 NEW ANGLE 19 { Baker rips the rest of the smoking package away from his weapon, s 1i s it over his shoulder and begins to SHOVE the pews aside to make a larger open area. Thompson, meanwhile, takes out a very futuristic transceiver. He turns it ON; getting a RED light; enters a NUMBER CODE on the keypad and gets a GREEN LIGHT. There's an EERIE QUALITY to the transmission. \nTHOMPSON This is team one. We're here. \nNEWSCASTER(CONT'D) This is Leonard Adkins, in Val Verde - where the war on drugs has finally taken its first prisoner. With an annoyed expression, Thompson CLICKS OFF the newscast. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AIRPORT - SERVICE AREA - DAY 20 \nTwo PAINTERS pull up in a van. Move around the back and start to pull out ladders and cans. \nFIRST PAINTER Busting our asses Christmas week like they're gonna land extra planes if we finish - Suddenly two MEN O'REILLY and SH DON) are there. \nPAINTER Need something? \nO'REILLY Yeah. BAM! BAM! Both painters are SHOT. Quickly, the two men toss their bodies into the rear, get into the van... and BACK IT INTO the airport garage. O'Reilly enters a NUMBER CODE into a transceiver- \nORILLY into radio, as iffey \nDRIVE) Team Two. In position. \nCUT TO: \nMCCLANE Elvis.

But one reporter - Sam - NOTICES - \n33 STUART - MOVING THROUGH AIRPORT -HER POV' 33 I as she watches, Garber joins him - \n34 BACK TO SCENE 34 \nSAM (nudging her cameraman) Hey. Colonel Stuart. \nCAMERAMAN Old news. \nSAM Better than these loxes. Very quietly, Sam and the cameraman do their best to slip away from the pack. \n35 STUART AND GARBER - WALKING ALONG TOWARDS EXIT 35 \nSTUART \n(SOTTO) Everything on schedule? \nGARBER Tapping airport phones right now. Got a slight problem with personnel: Last minute replacement. What's the status of the security here? \nI \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n35 CONTINUED - 35 \nSTUART (nodding towards the \nJUSTICE PEOPLE) Like we figured. A joke - But suddenly both men are in the GLARE of a portable light. \nSAM Colonel Stuart! Can we have a few words with you? \nI \nSTUART You can have two: \"Fuck\" and \"you\". And the interview is over and he's out the door. \nCUT TO: \n36 INT. TERMINAL - ESCALATORS - NIGHT 36 \nMcClane's head panning the holiday crowd - then SEEING Cochrane. Quickly, he FOLLOWS Cochrane downwards - into \n37 LUGGAGE AREA 37 where a TOURIST JUNKET gets between McClane and his quarry- \n38 C9CC $ANE 38 a GLIMPSE of him at a door marked \"NO ADMITTANCE\" - then he's gone. McClane runs up, too late; the door is shut again. He looks around, sees a LUGGAGE WORKER, flashes his badge. \nMCCLANE Open this. (as the guy obeys) Got a cop on duty around here? \nLUGGAGE GUY Airport police - \nMCCLANE \n(SCOWLS; THEN;) Get 'em. \n39 INT. LUGGAGE CONVEYOR AREA - DAY 39 \nDark. Clatters and bumps, machine sounds... more bumps. McClane moves cautiously along. He JUMPS as a large SHADOW moves nearby, but it's a big CASE on a conveyor belt. Now, he stoops to go under another conveyor belt - the different tracks intersect and pass each other like freeway off-ramps discharging luggage from one to another - and then he SEES - \n(X) \n39A COCHRANE AND MILLER 39A \nI One has his jacket off, and just now dusts off his hands like a man finishing a job. The other one has one of those transceivers. \nMCCLANE'S VOICE Excuse me. \n41 NEW ANGLE 41 They turn, see McClane with his badge in his left hand - his right hidden under the long coat which is draped over his shoulder like Clint Eastwood's serape in a Spaghetti Western. \nMCCLANE(CONT'D) This is a restricted area. You boys too impatient to wait for the skycaps? \nMILLER We... work for th amine. \nMCCLAN.E Yeah? Let's see some ID - Instantly both men DIVE to the outside, drawing guns. \n42 THE TRANSCEIVER 42 Falls, skids... somewhere. \n43 BACK TO SCENE 43 Dropping his'wallet, McClane JUMPS aside as SHOTS WHIZZ PAST -McClane's COAT takes the BULLET HITS in MID AIR as he LANDS on a conveyor belt, which CARRIES him UP and OVER the gunmen. They FIRE UP at him - He aims.back - and then a SUITCASE falling from another belt and knocks his gun away! \n44 BELOW 44 The gun CLATTERS on the floor. Seeing it, the two men exchange a glance - split up. \n2ND STEWARDESS (pushing him in seat) (X) And I've got yours - so park it, pal! \n62 NEW ANGLE 62 Thornberg simmers - and then he SEES HOLLY. FOCUS CHANGE. \nTHORNBERG Stewardess! \nCONTINUED \n62 CONTINUED - 62 \nSTEWARDESS Mister Thornberg - you cannot monopolize my - \nTHORNBERG You cannot put me near that woman. \nSTEWARDESS Excuse me? CAMERA ADJUSTS to feature Holly - and the Stewardess' growing fascination with her. \nHOLLY He.means he has filed a restraining order against me. I'm not allowed within fifty feet of him - \nTHORNBERG \nFIFTY YARDS - (to Stew ardess) And by seating me here you're violating a court order - I could sue you and this airline - this woman has assaulted me and besmirched my \nREPUTATION - \nSTEWARDESS (kneeling, sotto)? What'd you do? \nHOLLY I knocked out two of his teeth. \nSTEWARDESS \n(PAUSE) Would you like some champagne? \nCUT TO: \n63 THE GUNMAN'S BODY 63 as it is ZIPPED into a body bag, our view of the mangled head and shoulders mercifully brief. The body is set on a gurney. We WIDEN and see Airport police and coroner's people about to make off with it... and the MEDIA, now drooling over this new story dropped right into their laps. As FLASHBULBS POP and CAMERAS ROLL, Sam NOTICES - \n64 MCCLANE 64 One of the cops hands McClane his wallet. As he pockets it, he notes the CROWD milling about the luggage area. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n-,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 64 CONTINUED - 64 \nMCCLANE Whoa, wait a second. This is a crime scene. Aren't you going to seal off this area? \n2ND AIRPORT COP That's up to the Captain. \nMCCLANE Up to the Captain? Take me up to the Captain, too. \nCUT TO: \n65 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH - DAY 65 \nBAKER guards the rear door with an ASSAULT RIFLE. He REACTS, tense as a FIGURE appears, running up from the snowy expanse behind the church. It's 'filer- the man who escaped from McClane. Baker waves him in. KAHN and B\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd are DIGGING in theme y rd with pickaxes and hardly 0o at him. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n66 INSIDE 66 Stuart's poring over MAPS of the airport. He looks up, nonplussed; wipes away SNOW that falls from Mi\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 1 's shoulder to the table top. \nSTUART You're late. \nMILLER We ran into trouble; a policeman. He killed Cochrane; I barely got away. \nSTUART Did you finish your assignment? \nMILLER Yessir. But - \nSTUART Then the damage is minor. (drawing a PISTOL) But the penalty could be severe. In a blur of motion, Stuart is on his feet, the pistol is at Miller's temple. CLICK. \nCONTINUED \n66 CONTINUED - 66 \nSTUART(CONT'D) (as Mil a SHUDDERS) Fail me again and it won't be an empty chamber. Dismissed. \nCUT TO: \n67 INT. AIRPORT POLICE OFFICE--DAY 67 \nMcClane comes in, first double taking the name on the door: \nCARMINE LORENZO, CAPTAIN OF AIRPORT POLICE. The man himself - a 20 year veteran of bureaucratic wars that have earned him this little kingdom - rises behind his desk. \nLORENZO \nYOU - (a glance at a FAX) McClane? \nMCCLANE Lorenzo? \ncruising along, its FIGHTER ESCORT a few wingtips away. Now, the fighter WAGS ITS WINGS and PEELS AWAY. \n72 INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT - NIGHT 72 \nCAMERA MOVES from the cockpit back through the rest of the plane. \nCO-PILOT Ay, Alle va nos escorto. \nPILOT Es bueno; el peligro es pasado. Estamos segur hasta los Estados Unidos. Cuanto tiempo? \nCO-PILOT \n(CHECKING WATCH) Tres horas y media. By now we are on Esperanza. Looking astonishingly carefree, (X) he smiles at the young CORPORAL guarding him, puffs on a cigar... (X) and casually examines the military chronometer on his handcuffed (X) wrist. We PUSH IN on it. (X) \nCUT TO: \n73 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH 73 \nWIDEN from Stuart's Huer, showing the exact same time. Now we SEE that the church is full of ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT: In fact, it looks very much like a mini-version of an airport control tower, complete with radar screens and a big glass board to mark positions on. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \nCONTINUED - 73 CAMERA follows a MAN with a Pizza sized RADAR DISH as he crosses the room, a CRONY unrolling WIRE behind him. CRANE UP as the man CLIMBS into the STEEPLE... UP, UP, UP, until he's in the BELFRY where a PRERIGGED TRIPOD WAITS for the dish. As he CLAMPS it in place we SEE the yard behind the church and the SPARKLE of WELDING TOOLS; someone is making CONNECTIONS to the now open conduit box and underground CABLES. \nCUT TO: \n74 INT. TERMINAL - RENT A CAR COUNTER 74 \nMCCLANE Excuse me, honey - can I borrow your office for a minute? Before she can answer, he's over the counter and reaching for her phone. \nCUT TO: \n75 INT.

How's the vacaction treating you? \nMCCLANE Vacation? Holly stood me up for a last minute meeting. I'm alone in DC with the in-laws. \nPOWELL Ah, the in-laws. They love their policemen son-in-laws, don't they? \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n76 CONTINUED - 76 \nMCCLANE R' ht. Listen, Al, what's our FAX n u mber in the station there? \nPOWELL 550-3212. This is a first. \nMCCLANE Yeah, well my wife's company makes 'em, I figure it's time to get one of them pregnant. (aside to girl) This way? \n(AH) This way. The FAX starts to leave McClane - voila, it's already arriving at Powell's office. \nPOWELL (as it arrives) Fingerprints? \nMCCLANE From a stiff down here at Dulles. I marked the whorls with a pen in case the transmission's fuzzy. Can you run that through State and Federal for me - throw in Interpol if you got it. \nPOWELL \n(WATCHING IT) Will do. What's this about? \nMCCLANE I don't know. Just a feeling. \nPOWELL Ouch. You get those feelings insurance companies start to go bankrupt. \nMCCLANE The FAX number is uh - \nGIRL -on the top edge of the transmission he just got - \nMCCLANE \n(AUTHORATIVELY) -on the top edge of your transmission. \n81 INT. \"THE CAB\" - NIGHT 81 \nLorenzo has joined the regulars here to cover his ass \nLORENZO -well, the press was here, crawling all over the Esperanza story... so they got it right on the fucking news, bloodstains and all... \nTRUDEAU Couldn't be helped, I guess. What was it, gangs? \nMCCLANE'S VOICE Yeah... if your gangs get their training at Fort Bragg. \n82 NEW ANGLE 82 Surprised, they turn to see McClane step out of the elevator. \nTRUDEAU Who the hell is this? \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n82 CONTINUED - 82 \nMCCLANE (pushing past Lorenzo) I'm a police officer, Mr. Trudeau- \nLORENZO L.A., Mr. Lorenzo-don't mean shit- \nTRUDEAU That's what I said about my last cholesterol test. What's your problem- \n(READING BADGE) Lieutenant McClane? \nMCCLANE I think something serious is going to happen here tonight - \nTRUDEAU Hey. Something serious happens every night, only it doesn't make the newspapers. Ever see those guys on TV, juggling knives and cha n i saws? That's what we're doing with those planes up there, only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground. \nMCCLANE Anybody try and fix the deck tonight? (on his look) Anything weird going on besides the shooting? \nBARNES We did. lose FAA approach control- \nMCCLANE What's that? \nTRUDEAU One way we manage the planes. But we've got backup - Long look from McClane. \nCUT TO: \n83 EXT. VIRGINIA CHURCH - BACK YARD 83 \nBurke turns off his acetyline torch, flips up his face shield. \nBURKE We're hot! \n(X) \n84 INT.

EVERYTHING \nCOMES ON LINE. \nSTUART 5 minutes to zero hour. Stand by. \n85 INT. CAB - NIGHT 85 \nMCCLANE Okay. You clot back-up - back-up for everything you think can go wrong. What about something nobody anticipated? Not accidents, not \nWEATHER - \nF \nTRUDEAU (a bit dryly) The human element..? \nMCCLANE Damned straight the human element. You've got the world's biggest drug dealer on the way, one body and a'- lot of questionsl Doesn't anyone want to look for answers? \nTRUDEAU (after a moment) Lorenzo. Have all your shift Commanders report in... now. \nLORENZO What? You're buying into this - \nTRUDEAU I want them to report anything out of the ordinary --no matter how trivial. You got that? \nLORENZO (annoyed, but obeying) I got it. \nBARNES Oh, my God... Everyone turns at the chill in Barne's voice. \nTRUDEAU What is it? \nCONTINUED \n85 CONTINUED - 85 But Barnes doesn't reply... just tries - and fails - to point out the window. Everyone turns. (X) \nSTUART \n(DRYLY) I think by now I've got your attention. I know your recorders go 24 hours around the clock, so I'll be quick -you can play me back later all you want. \n94 INT. CAB - INTERCUT 94 \nTRUDEAU How. did you get on this line? Who is this? \nSTUART Who I am is unimportant. What I want... well, if you don't want those planes overhead to start dropping like flies when they run out of fuel... what I want is very important. All REACT - McClane as much as anyone. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n94 CONTINUED - 94 \nSTUART(CONT'D) A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes. It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1. \nMCCLANE Esperanza? Trudeau nods - \nSTUART This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled. \n95 FAVORING MCCLANE 95 As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over to Barnes. \nMCCLANE What's all that about? \nBARNES A 747 has the furthest flight capacity of anything we've got here. Take out the seats and save some weight, add the wing tanks and it could go to Australia, Africa, Asia - hell the whole Goddamn world.' \nMCCLANE Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties. \nLORENZO They're talking to us on our own Goddamn system! They gotta be close - I'll have my men tear this airport \nAPART - \nMCCLANE About time, Carmine. Guess you have to light a fire under your ass to light a fire under your ass. \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n95 CONTINUED - 95 \nCD \nLORENZO McClane, I got a first class unit here, SWAT team and all, and we don't need any Monday morning quarterbacks. \nMCCLANE (pissed, moving in) Monday morning? My wife's on one of those planes these aasstards are fucking with! That makes me a player on the fucking field, you putz! And if you got off your fat ass when I told you to, maybe we wouldn't be knee deep in shit right now! \nLORENZO (turning, shouting) Security! (back to McClane) You're out of here! And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau REACTS, unsure - \nLORENZO Mr. Trudeau. Do I have to remind you about FAA regulations regarding unauthorized personnel in the control tower? \nTRUDEAU \n(TO GUARDS) See Mr. McClane out. \n96 AT THE ELEVATOR 96 It opens. Someone's inside., but we don't feature them yet. \nMCCLANE (as he's muscled in) Trudeau, can't you see you're dealing with pros? You can't fuck with these \nGUYS - Sam comes out of the elevator, holding up her ID. \nSAM \n(TO TRUDEAU) Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau, there's a lot of rumors flying around \nTHE - \nLORENZO Oh, no, no way - \nCONTINUED \n(X) \n-96 CONTINUED - 96 \nTRUDEAU This is off limits, Coleman, you know that! Together with McClane she's shoved into the elevator. \nMCCLANE Anything you can think-of, they'll think of, too! But the elevator DOORS CLOSE on him and now Lorenzo turns a KEY on the control panel, then SPEAKS into his walkie talkie. \nLORENZO Lobby Security, come in. \n96A AIRPORT - LOBBY - INTERCUT 96A \nLOBBY COP (into RADIO), Tomlinson here - \nLORENZO And Lorenzo here, with two unauthorized personnel in the fucking tower! Get your thumb out of your ass and get over to the elevator. Get them out and post a guard or you're gonna have a pink slip in your Christmas stocking! Rattled, the guard signals a comrade, hustles to obey. \n114B BACK TO SCENE 114B McClane takes a breath, starts across the beam. There's a scary moment at first but he gets quickly confident - a bit too ; 7-7 confident midway - he starts to lose his balance and all-but runs to the far end, JUMPS to safety. As he pulls himself up he HEARS Marvin CLAPPING behind him. With a scowl, McClane checks his map, pushes on. \nCUT TO: \n115 INT. ANNEX CORRIDOR - NIGHT 115 \nBarnes and the SWAT cops run forward, get on the SLIDEWALK; impatient, they run even while on it. \n116 A WORKER - AT FAR END OF SLIDEWALK 116 reaches into the open slidewalk CONTROL PANEL-hits a SWITCH. \n117 THE SLIDEWALK 117 JERKS to a halt -the( six men n it almost TUMBLING.

There's a sickening CRACK as his neck goes and then he TWITCHES and slides to the floor, a SMEAR of blood on the slick wall. \n136 BACK TO SCENE 136 McClane takes a long overdue breath. Then he picks up his 4 pistol, checks the'bodies to make sure there's no surprises, and, goes over to Barnes. \nMCCLANE You okay?. \nBARNES \n(SHAKILY) The antenna array - 'Both look ,at it - and then \n137 WIDE 137 The antenna array outside BLOWS UP, pieces SHATTERING the glass window.

Our people took out their Swat team... completely. \nGARBER You were right... they went for the antenna array. We're right on schedule. \nSTUART Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals. \nSTUART Attention, Dulles. You were warned not to try and restore your systems. \n146 INT. CAB 146 \nThey listen, fearful - \nSTUART'S VOICE You've wasted lives and time on a futile and obvious target. Now you have to pay the penalty. \n147 MCCLANE - IN ANNEX - SAME TIME 147 They HEAR this too, over Barne's cellular tie in to the tower.

You- He stops, seeing the chilling look Trudeau is giving him. \n149 STUART 149 has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's. His brow furrows. Ah, yes. \nSTUART McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though... \nMCCLANE Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor? \nSTUART I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression. \nMCCLANE And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb? \nSTUART I think we can find something in between. (aside, off mike) Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper.

He gives the scream of an. animal in a trap and falls to his knees. \n169 IN THE TOWER 169 Everyone RECOILS at the explosion, which turns this room BLOOD RED with reflected light. CHUNKS OF METAL and PLASTIC boil through the sky. Something HITS the GLASS here, starring it and smearing it with what we hope is only grease. Somewhere SIRENS wail. \nCUT TO: \n170 STUART 170 Silence here, too. His men look at him. Except for ThampSm, who clearly enjoyed his part in the above, their faces are blank. Maybe they're admiring Stuart's incredible coolness. Maybe. \nSTUART \n(INTO MIKE) That concludes our object lesson for this evening. If the 747 we requested is ready on time and General Esperanza lands unmolested, further lessons can be avoided. \nCONTINUED \n1170 CONTINUED - 170 He DISCONNECTS. \nCUT TO: \n171 THE RUNWAY - LONG DOLLY SHOT - NIGHT 171 Firemen and medics scramble over a chaos of metal and fabric that used to be an airplane.

VIRGINIA CHURCH - NIGHT 174 \nIn the silence since the crash, no SOUNDS here, except the faint MONITORING of the Tower and aircraft chatter and the muted AUDIO of a TV. Garber breaks the silence. \nGARBER Sir. They've done everything we've anticpated... so far- Stuart smiles tightly at the unvoiced question. \nSTUART Don't worry, Captain. If this goes into extra innings... \n(A SHRU ) Well, we'll just call an our man in the other team's locker room. And - almost in afterthought - he wipes the flight number from the clear glass board. CAMERA PUSHES to the TELEVISION. \n175 ON THE SCREEN 175 SAM COLEMAN is on CAMERA, \"live\" supered over her face. She's OUTSIDE on the airfield, her NEWS HELICOPTER beside her. In the distance behind barricades we see the CRASH SITE. \nSAM --hundreds of people in the terminal heard or saw the crash, but still there has been no official word from authorities. Meanwhile - despite the fact that only one runway has been closed due to the tragedy, several dozen airliners are visible from where I stand, endlessly circling the field.

Now they kick away at AIR - \n218 MCCLANE AND PLANE - IN ONE SHOT 218 It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part of the rifle is half under the grid. Now, he puts all his energy into levering the rifle against the steel. Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole. \nAND THE PLANE IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE. McClane DIVES OUT OF THE HOLE. \n219 NEW ANGLE 219 McClane rolls away from the wheels, which miss him by inches.

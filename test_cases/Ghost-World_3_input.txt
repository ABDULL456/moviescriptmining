They both have drinks now. He puts on a jazz record, an instrumental. 
ENID (picks up an antique knick knack) Wow, this is so cool... 
SEYMOUR If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not? 
ENID I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date... 
Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile. 
ENID What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this? 
SEYMOUR What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now. 
ENID What, are you a klansman or something? 
SEYMOUR Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise? 
ENID (quoting TV commercial in deep voice) "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"! 
SEYMOUR Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo. 
He takes out a scrapbook. 
SEYMOUR I'm obsessed with all this stuff - this lost culture of the 20th century. 
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company. 
ENID Why doesn't everybody know this? 
The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable. 
SEYMOUR (somewhat bitterly) It's ancient history. The same reason nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco record. 
He puts on another record. 
SEYMOUR Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them... 
ENID You work at Cook's Chicken? 
SEYMOUR For nineteen years... 
ENID What are you, a fry cook or something? 
SEYMOUR Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters. 
ENID Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day. 
SEYMOUR Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me... 
ENID Yeah, but still... 
SEYMOUR I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want? 
Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting. 
ENID So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then (points at painting) even though there was stuff like this? 
SEYMOUR No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something... 
ENID (suddenly) Hey, can I borrow this? 
SEYMOUR What? Why? 
ENID I promise I'll take good care of it. 
SEYMOUR I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you -- 
ENID Don't you trust me, Seymour? 
INT. ART CLASS - DAY 
We see another wall of student art dominated this time by Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting. 
ROBERTA Let's address some discussion to this piece. 
SNOTTY GIRL I don't like it. 
ROBERTA Can you tell us why? 
SNOTTY GIRL I don't know. 
HIPPY-ISH BOY I think it's totally weak. 
BLACK GIRL Yeah, it's not right.

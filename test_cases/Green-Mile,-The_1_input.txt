COFFEY I'm smelling me some cornbread. 
Paul speaks softly so the others can't hear: 
PAUL It's from my missus. She wanted to thank you. 
Coffey nods thoughtfully, absorbing this notion. Then: 
COFFEY Thank me for what? 
PAUL You know. For helping me. 
COFFEY Helping you with what? 
Paul motions discreetly to his crotch. 
COFFEY Ohhh. (beat) Was your missus pleased? 
PAUL Several times. 
Paul hands him the bundle through the bars. Coffey takes it, uncovers the cornbread reverently, gazes back up. 
COFFEY This all for me? 
Paul nods. Across the way, Del is pressing his face longingly through the bars while Mr. Jingles crawls on his shoulder. 
DEL Oh my. John, I can smell it from here. I surely can. 
COFFEY (looks to Paul) Can I give some to Del? 
PAUL It's yours, John. You do with it as you please. 
John carefully scoops a big chunk of cornbread out with his enormous hand, holds it through the bars to Paul. 
COFFEY Here's for Del and Mr. Jingles then. 
BILLY Hey! What about me? I'm'a get some too, ain't I 
Coffey looks to Paul--do I have to? 
PAUL It's yours, John. As you please. 
COFFEY Well. Fine. I think I'll keep the rest, then. 
He smiles like a big kid, digging in with his fingers. Paul crosses the Mile to Del's cell, hands him his share. 
PAUL Courtesy of the gentleman across the way. 
DEL Oh, John. So very fine of you. So very kind. Mr. Jingles t'ank you. 
COFFEY (mouth full) ...wel'cm... 
BILLY Hey! What about me? Don't you hold out on me, ya big dummy nigger! 
Paul's temper flares--he steps to Billy's cell. 
PAUL You'll keep a civil tongue on my block. 
Beat. Billy spits in Paul's face and follows it up with a big grin--what are you gonna do about that? Paul is seething as he wipes the spit off, but keeps his temper where it belongs. 
PAUL You get that one for free. But that's the last one. 
Paul walks away. Billy laughs, hollering after him: 
BILLY That's it? Just that little bitty one? Guess I'll have to pay out for the rest, huh? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. E BLOCK - DAY 
Harry is walking the Mile, doing a cell check and jotting on a clipboard. He pauses, making a notation... 
...and a long stream of piss hits his leg. Billy's at his bars, peeing on him. Harry jumps back, stunned. Billy howls with laughter, hosing his aim wildly from side to side. 
BILLY Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it? Oh, the look on your face! 
Paul and Brutal come running. Harry's just flabbergasted: 
HARRY You believe this? Son of a bitch pissed on me! 
BILLY Hey, d'jall like that? I'm currently cooking some turds t'go with it! Nice soft ones! I'll have 'em out t'yall tomorrow! 
Paul stays calm, turns to Brutal, nods at the restraint room. 
PAUL We've been looking to clear that room out anyway. 
TIMECUT: 
A STREAM OF GUARDS comes toting the last of the restraint room stuff past Billy's cell while he heckles them from the bars... 
BILLY Hey! Whassit now, movin' day? Y'all wanna come in and dust a little? Y'can shine my knob for me while yer at it! 
...and he pauses as Paul and Brutal step to the bars. Paul has a canvas straitjacket. Brutal pulls his nightstick. 
BILLY You can come in here on your legs, but you'll go out on your backs, Billy the Kid guarantee ya that. (motions to Brutal) C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up on me this time. We'll go man to man, see who's the better fel-- 
Brutal unlocks the cell--and sidesteps, revealing Harry pointing a fire hose. The hose erupts, driving Billy across the cell with bone-jarring force. They batter him half- senseless, then cut the water. Billy collapses in a heap. 
Paul and Brutal drag him semi-conscious from his cell and get the straitjacket on him. He comes around as they draw the straps tight and pull him to his feet. 
PAUL C'mon, Wild Bill. Little walky walky.

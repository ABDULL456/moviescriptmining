CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D) What color are your boarding passes? 
Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their guns at them. 
(CONTINUED) 
YURI (O.S.) I have green card. 
Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green plastic cards. 
YURI (CONT'D) For my boys and me. 
Tamara can't believe what she's hearing. 
TAMARA It's a joke... a mistake... (LAUGHING) Right Yuri? 
Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) (in Russian) You disgust me. You pig. 
Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all understand him. 
YURI You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul. 
With that Yuri turns to the others. 
YURI (CONT'D) I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys! 
The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara. 
The next moment, the helicopter takes off. 
GORDON What!... Did that just happen!? 
They're stranded. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIRFIELD IN CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN 
Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of waiting helicopters. (CONTINUED) 
Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise. 
CHINESE OFFICER (POINTING) Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same. 
Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval Officer greets them, and raises his voice. 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you! 
Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door slides shut and it lifts off. 
INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN 
Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away. 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father... 
Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser. 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) Your party is the last to arrive. 
ANHEUSER I've been told of damages? 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted. 
Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance. 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) There it is! 
EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN 
The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing-- 
Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories, built into the face of a mountain. 
(CONTINUED) 
In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped metal support structures, which are the launching towers for the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an unparalleled feat of engineering. 
EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN 
The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting. 
The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows. She looks around in awe. 
Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain. 
In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with military personnel, waving his tickets. 
YURI What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor. 
SOLDIER I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements. 
YURI I want your name! 
SOLDIER (pointing to his BADGE) Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained. 
The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE GLACIER/CHO MING - DAWN 
Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape. They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a scree field. 
It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly. 
JACKSON Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great.

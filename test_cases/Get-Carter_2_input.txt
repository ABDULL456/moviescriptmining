Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond.  There, he promptly throws up. 
Carter watches from behind a tree. 
His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out. 
CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad. 
BRUMBY Jesus wept! 
MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat. 
MRS BRUMBY Now, Cliff, don't get mad. 
BRUMBY I'll murder the little bitch! 
MRS BRUMBY Cliff ... 
Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a latecomer, is stunned to see who it is. 
SANDRA Daddy! 
BRUMBY That's right, bloody Daddy. 
SANDRA I wasn't expecting you until three o'clock. 
BRUMBY And this is what you call having a few friends back for coffee, is it? 
Brumby pushes past her into the house. 
BRUMBY Running bloody riot over my bloody furniture, drinking my bloody booze... 
The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers out through the side door 
BRUMBY ... spewing over my fucking goldfish. 
He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face-down into the lily pond. 
Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers. 
MRS BRUMBY Cliff ... 
Brumby throws the boy out. 
BRUMBY Shut up, Phyllis. (He walks back into the house.) Sandra! 
Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a bedroom. 
BRUMBY Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch. 
Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in. 
INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT 
Carter passes silently through the hall into the large sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. 
Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs. 
CARTER Good evening. 
Mrs Brumby jumps.  The front door is open. 
MRS BRUMBY (standing) Who are you? 
CARTER I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I want to see him.

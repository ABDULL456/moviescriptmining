Caleb now pulls the SILENCED GUN he's been trying to get his hands on throughout the fight from his jacket pocket. He stands, gasping for breath. He aims the gun at her. 
CALEB A bitch. I been had by a bitch! (starts to laugh) Stand, bitch. 
She just maintains her guard, balled up on the floor. 
81 | P a g e CALEB I said stand up. No way we're gonna have chats with you sprawled. Less you wanna fuck me now that is. 
She looks up at him. Her evulsion is obvious. 
He gestures up with the gun. Slowly, carefully, she stands. 
CALEB Well shocky-shocky-shock. Wasn't expecting quite such a welcome. 
Shona could be a statue. 
CALEB What the fuck. 
Caleb still points his gun at her. He looks at her. Nice. 
CALEB It's Christmas, ho, ho, ho . . . 
Keeping his gun on her, Caleb turns a lamp on. He sees her: average height but athletic, powerful: attractive, damaged. 
CALEB Way 足 ho. Choice. Smile for the camera. You got names? 
He comes closer to her, examines her 足 but keeps his distance. She seems calm, but he sees the storm beneath the surface. 
CALEB All fucked up now ain't ya, babe. Who did this to ya? 
All that moves is her eyes: she watches the gun 足 nothing else. Caleb moves the gun deliberately, making her eyes move. 
CALEB Notable: Lara fuckety Croft. 
He moves the gun erratically. He can't outpace her eyes. 
CALEB (game over) Well shit, bitch: ain't you the self-same night owl. Name. I said what's your fuckin' name? 
82 | P a g e Still her eyes on the gun. Suddenly annoyed, he 
LASHES OUT 
He goes to hit her in the face with his gun but she ducks. He swings at her again, and again she ducks. She assumes a combat position: fists up, body ready again. She looks at his eyes. 
CALEB Well ain't you the pocket battleship. We gonna have another swingers, you an' me? Don't think so, bitch. Think you an' me we gonna have chats, get under each other's skinny, maybe get some cosy. Howzat. 
Fighting some inner battle, she just waits for his next move. 
He's impressed, but suddenly he's bored by this game. 
He aims the gun at her head. 
CALEB OK. Let's play the you-kneeling -on-the-floor-now game. I liked you down there. (she doesn't move) Yesterday, bitch. 
He starts to squeeze the trigger. She doesn't move. 
He aims the gun at her left shoulder and 
SHOOTS HER 
The bullet NICKS shoulder. It's just a flesh wound 足 but enough to shut her up and make her drop to her knees in AGONY. 
CALEB Now we got some kind of understanding. Some kind of parity goin' down. Name, ho. 
He stands over her, looks down at the booty. She grabs her left shoulder with her right hand and squeezes. The pain makes her cry out, but she immediately bites her lip silent. 
CALEB Well well. Now I'm more than (more) 
83 | P a g e (cont'd) somewhat. Don't know that I could take one like that. 
He looks away from her, sees the photographs on the mantle: Shona the soldier with her squaddie buddies in Afghanistan. 
CALEB Well that explains. A bona fide fuckin hero. Heroine. Which makes me wonder, actually: where's your stash? The gear?

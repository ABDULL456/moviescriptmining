As they come out the door, rather than beating Will mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in. 
CHUCKIE Shut up, Morgan. (to Will) Here's your present. 
Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in front of the bar. 
WILL You're kiddin' me. 
CHUCKIE Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day... 
Laughter. 
CHUCKIE Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass. 
MORGAN No I didn't... 
Will approaches the car to take a closer look. 
CHUCKIE But you're twenty-one now, so-- 
BILLY Yeah, now that you can drink legally, we thought the best thing to get you was a car. 
More laughter. Will inspects the Nova. 
WILL You're kiddin' me. (a beat) This is the ugliest fuckin' car I ever seen in my life. 
Laughter, a beat. 
WILL (serious) How the fuck did you guys do this? 
CHUCKIE Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day. 
MORGAN Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo? 
CHUCKIE Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car. 
WILL So, you finally got a job Morgan? 
MORGAN Had one, now I'm fucked again. 
WILL (to Chuckie) So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house? 
CHUCKIE Fuck you. I re-built the engine myself.  That thing could make it to Hawaii if you wanted it to. 
Chuckie gives Will a look. 
CHUCKIE Happy 21, Will. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Will sits across from Sean. 
SEAN Which one did you take, Will? 
WILL Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy. 
SEAN That's what you want? 
WILL Yeah, I think so. 
SEAN Good for you. Congratulations. 
WILL Thanks you. (a beat) So, that's it? We're done? 
SEAN We're done. You did your time. You're a free man. 
A beat. 
WILL I just want you to know, Sean... 
SEAN You're Welcome, Will. 
WILL I'll keep in touch. 
SEAN I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be. 
Will smiles. 
SEAN I just... figured it's time I put my money back on the table, see what kind of cards I get. 
Will smiles. Sean hands him a piece of paper. 
SEAN I'll be checking in with my machine at the college. If you ever need anything, just call. 
Sean smiles. 
SEAN Do what's in your heart, son. You'll be fine. 
WILL Thanks you, Sean.

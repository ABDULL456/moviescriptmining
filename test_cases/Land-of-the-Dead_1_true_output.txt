EXT. "UNIONTOWN TEXACO" - NIGHT 
DEAD TEENAGE COUPLE walks hand-in-hand near the gas pumps of a defunct TEXACO STATION. The boy steps on the little hose that BINGS when a car pulls in. Out of the building comes... 
...AN ATTENDANT. It was once tall and handsome. Now his face is a wrinkled map of death. He has lost its left arm. Dried blood darkens the shoulder of its jump-suit, where the arm was torn away. A "TEXACO" PATCH tells us the Thing used to work here. Embroidery tells us his nickname was once "BIG DADDY". He goes to the pump and removes the nozzle. Turns, as 
if searching for a car to fill with gas. There is none. 
MIKE (O.S.) 
It's like they're pretending to be alive. 
EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
RILEY 
Isn't that what we're doing, son? Pretending to be alive? 
EXT. DUMP - NIGHT 
THE SOUND OF GROANING WOOD as THREE heavily-armed GUERILLAS push a large CRATE over a PRECIPICE into a deep GARBAGE PIT below. FIVE SIMILAR CRATES lie amid the rubble. Insects BUZZ. RATS crawl. HUMAN SKELETONS, most HEADLESS, lie everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. Those with heads show various wounds to their skulls. Except for one, which... ...suddenly, startlingly MOVES! Its bony arm reaches up from the bottom of the pit toward... 
...CHOLO DeMORA, a Latino in his 20s, handsome, roguish, and confident...a bit too confident. He reaches over his shoulder and unstraps a CROSSBOW. 
CHOLO 
Poor bastard. WFFFFT! Cholo shoots the skeleton. His arrow goes completely through the WHITE SKULL. 
EXT. MOVING VAN - NIGHT 
The doors of a beat-up WHITE MOVING VAN open. Cholo reaches in, throwing back an oilcloth that covers ANOTHER CRATE. 
GUERILLA 
Whole lotta trash this week. 
CHOLO 
That's life, brother. A whole lotta trash. 
As the men tip the crate onto a dolly, MAGGOTS are revealed 
in the darkness beneath, squirming in a POOL OF BLOOD. (What's in that crate?) 
EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
RILEY and MIKE watch THREE DEAD THINGS lumber toward them 
R 
from the town below. 
ILEY 
They know we're here. They can smell life. Smell blood. 
EXT. "UNIONTOWN TEXACO" - NIGHT 
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: BIG DADDY replaces the nozzle in the gas pump. Sensing something, it looks around. Up. His dead eyes lock on Riley's. Big Daddy grunts. Responding to him... 
EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
...the THREE DEAD THINGS move up the hillside with more determination. 
RILEY 
Glancing at Mike's guns) You any good with those? 
MIKE 
Dunno. It's my first trip. Never had to use `em before. 
M 
R 
RILEY 
Great. I'm out here with a guy who can't shoot. Let's go. 
Mike stands, turns, and... ...is GRABBED from behind by a ZOMBIE! It's not one of the three they've been watching. This one wears the remains of a CLOWN SUIT. Half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away. Painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. Its ORANGE HAIR is crawling with SPIDERS. It wrestles Mike to the ground. Opens its lipsticked mouth. Is about to bite Mike's neck when... ...Riley FIRES his .45. BLAM! A bullet SHATTERS the Clown's SHOULDER CAP. The dead thing is pitched backward, but seems to feel no pain. It hunkers over Mike again. 
iley FIRES four more times. THREE BULLETS RIP into the Clown's CHEST, NECK, CHEEK. Finally, the FOURTH PUNCHES A HOLE above the thing's left eyebrow. The Clown DROPS. ike looks at Riley. 
M 
IKE 
Jesus. You can't shoot, neither! 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
RILEY and MIKE step into a tight, uncomfortable space. 
Generators whir. Gears turn. The two men open a storage locker and strap on ammo belts as... 
...SOMETHING TERRIBLE LOOMS out of the shadows! It moves toward Riley and Mike, who can't see it from behind the locker. The LEFT SIDE OF THE THING'S FACE has been BURNED AWAY. Only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye bulging from a socket.

MOUSE You lyin'! 
EASY No, I swear I'm not. 
MOUSE Aw shit! 
And he fumbles with the ignition and shifts gears. 
MOUSE Oh, my God!... Oh, my goodness! 
116   EXT. L.A. STREET - NIGHT                                      116 
The engine roars from a punch to the accelerator, and Mouse's voice can be heard cutting through the darkness as the car powers off down the street. 
MOUSE (O.S.) Oh, my goodness! 
117   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                       117 
Easy, with the gun on Joppy, strains to see the dimly lit road in front of them. 
EASY Is that it up there? 
JOPPY Yeah, that's it. 
118   THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD                                        118 
The headlights bounce off a signpost: "Route 9." 
119   EXT. ROUTE 9 - NIGHT                                          119 
The Pontiac makes the turn onto a graded dirt road. 
120   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                       120 
A ranch-style cabin emerges up off the road, drawing nearer in the headlight beams. 
121   BACK TO SCENE                                                     121 
EASY Shut off the headlights, Mouse. 
Mouse kills the lights. 
EASY Is that it? 
JOPPY Naw.   It's farther up. 
EASY How much farther? 
JOPPY Another ten minutes, I guess. Easy, I swear, I ain't done nothin' to nobody. I swear, I ain't. 
122   EXT. ROUTE 9 - NIGHT                                              122 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:    House lights show through thick shrubbery. 
JOPPY There it is. 
Mouse pulls to a stop and kills the engine. 
EASY There's some rope in the trunk, Raymond. 
Mouse gets out of the car and is heard opening the trunk. 
JOPPY Easy, come on, man. That girl is lying if she told you I killed them folks. 
EASY Who said she told me? 
SCREAM! It's muted and distant.     But it's a woman all right. SCREAM! 
Easy pushes out of the back door on the right as Mouse opens the opposite door on the driver's side. 
EASY Stuff this in his mouth.    I gotta get up there. 
He tosses Mouse the stocking. 
122   CONTINUED:                                                      122 
MOUSE Let's just shoot him. 
EASY (on the run) No, Mouse. And they'll hear it. 
123   EXT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT                                   123 
The cabin draws nearer as Easy scrambles up the hill. He can hear Daphne crying out something, but he can't make out the words. 
It quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a window with the shade pulled down. 
He moves cautiously, quietly to the window and peers through the crack between the shade and the windowsill. He can make out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low ceiling. SMACK! And Daphne screams again. 
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE Come on, talk to me. Talk to me while you still can. 
DAPHNE'S VOICE (sobbing) Please! I don't have them!     Easy has them!

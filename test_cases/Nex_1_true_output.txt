Cris looks at her, almost bereft, and makes a tough decision. 
CRIS Look, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. 
LIZ It doesn't matter. 
CRIS It does. 
She's afraid to hear it. He's afraid to say it. 
ext. another church - DAY 
Cavanaugh is milling around after services when his cell phone chirps. He answers, peeved. 
CaVANAUGH Cavanaugh...No, you were right to call...Ring Ferris and have her meet me there. 
He closes his cell phone. Turns to his WIFE. 
CaVANAUGH They've located him near Tahoe. 
CaVANAUGH's wife If you let him get away again, you may not have a job. 
CAVANAUGH I know. 
Cavanaugh takes his leave. 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
Liz reacts to Cris' confession with disbelief. 
LIZ What are you saying, you're some sort of prophet? 
CRIS It's not religious. I just happen to see my life before it happens. 
LIZ Cris, it's sweet that you feel responsible for people. But I think you need help. 
She looks down. 
LiZ And I'm...I'm not the one to help you, right now. I've got too much going on in my own life. 
Cris can't let her go. He takes a quarter from his pocket and hands it to Liz. 
CRIS Flip it. 
LIZ Why? 
CRIS Just do it. 
She takes the quarter and flips it. Cris calls it in the air. 
CRIS Heads. 
She looks. It's heads. 
CRIS Flip it again. (calls it in the air) Tails. 
Tails it is, but so what. She flips again. 
CRIS Tails. (she looks;flips again) Heads. (she looks, flips again) Tails. 
She looks. Amazed. Disturbed. 
CRIS Now you believe me? 
She stares at him like he's the devil. 
LIZ Yeah. And I don't want to have anything to do with you. 
She walks away. 
CRIS Liz. (follows) Don't you see? I can get us all the money we need. 
She turns abruptly. 
LIZ Don't follow me. Don't talk to me. Get out of my life! 
She walks on, leaving Cris bereft. 
SNAPBACK TO: 
WALKING IN THE PARK - fiVE MINUTES AGO 
Cris What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die? 
LIZ Cris...I think you should move on. Today. 
Cris squints, then chooses his words carefully. 
CRIS Why? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact? 
His words hit the bull's-eye. Liz's whole demeanor softens. Although still troubled, she takes his arm, and they walk on. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - BINOCULAR MASK 
ferris (o.s.) Who's the woman? 
Ext. Hillside overlooking park - DAY 
Ferris, Cavanaugh, and Policeman Rick are each looking through a pair of binoculars. 
POLICEMAN rick Liz Cooper. Nice girl, but very erratic. 
cAVANAUGH Think she'll cooperate? 
POLICEMAN RICK Hard to say. She's impossible to control. 
Ferris Sounds like you've tried.

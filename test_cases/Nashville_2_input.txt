NORMAN and BILL are there. An ENTERTAINER is singing the CONNIE WHITE song that CONNIE is doing at the Opera. BILL is eager to know where MARY is. 
NORMAN Maybe she's at the Opera. 
BILL Why the hell would she be there? 
NORMAN shrugs. 
106	NEW ANGLE 
BILL You know goddamn well where she is. 
BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge. 
107	ANOTHER ANGLE 
It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera. 
OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying much in one language and she might just be talking to the OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive. 
108	NEW ANGLE 
CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill. After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian. 
109	NEW ANGLE 
As CONNIE and group step out of the lounge, MARY enters. BILL and NORMAN see her. BILL reacts.

She spins him around, but he tosses her onto the bed. He calls her all kinds of things. The PHONE RINGS. BILL wants it to be TOM, so he can yell at him, too. 
BILL Tom! 
TRIPLETTE'S VOICE No, ah, Bill?

CHANCE Yes. It has. 
PRESIDENT ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you? 
CHANCE Yes. I will. 
PRESIDENT Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you. (turns to Rand) Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello. 
RAND No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you. 
PRESIDENT I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts. 
RAND Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man. 
PRESIDENT Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life! 
The President clasps Rand's hand. 
RAND You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself. 
PRESIDENT Take care of yourself, Ben. 
RAND You take care too, Bobby. 
PRESIDENT (as he turns to go, a smile to Chance) Mr. Gardiner... 
The President leaves the library and Chance sits back down. 
RAND (as the door closes) He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he? 
CHANCE Yes, Ben - he is. 
RAND He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all. 
CHANCE I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President. 
EXT. RAND MANSION - MORNING 
An aide, KAUFMAN, waits by the front door of the Rand mansion. As the President comes out, he speaks quietly to Kaufman. 
PRESIDENT Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background. 
KAUFMAN (makes note of name) Gardiner, yes, sir. 
PRESIDENT And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible. 
KAUFMAN No problem, Chief. 
They head toward the waiting limousines. 
INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING 
Rand has an arm around Chance, hangs on for dear life as the two of them walk through the hall. Behind them, Wilson and Perkins push empty wheelchairs. 
RAND (very weak) ... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night? 
CHANCE (blankly) No, Ben. 
RAND Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time. 
CHANCE I understand. 
RAND (stops outside his door) And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment. 
CHANCE Thank you, Ben. 
RAND And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden. 
Wilson and Perkins leave the wheelchairs, assist Rand into his hospital room. 
CHANCE (as they go in) I'm sorry that you are so sick, Ben. 
The door closes, Chance limps off down the hall. 
EXT. RAND MANSION - GARDEN - DAY 
Chance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden, admires the greenery. In the background, coming from the house, we see Eve.

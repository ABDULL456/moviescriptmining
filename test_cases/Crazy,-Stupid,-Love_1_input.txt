88 INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM 88 
Meanwhile. Claire is putting away laundry. She throws some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer. 
Notices something. An envelope. It's addressed to Cal Weaver. Curiosity piqued, she picks it up. Looks inside. Almost faints. 
89 INT. CLAIRE AND BERNIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 89 
Big Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and drinking a cold one. Jessica lies on the floor, doing homework. 
Claire ENTERS, ashen. Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the envelope. Jessica looks up, sees it. 
JESSICA No!!!! 
She jumps, but it's too late. 
(CONTINUED) 89 CONTINUED: 89 ON BERNIE 
Staring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare. 
Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope. He looks at the envelope again. 
ON ENVELOPE 
Cal's name. A heart. 
BACK TO SCENE 
JESSICA Daddy? 
Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY. 
ON JESSICA 
Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys. 
90 EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 90 
Jessica runs into a second car. Races after her father. 
91 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE 91 
Meanwhile. Tracy approaches Robbie. Not only is he wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES. Tracy LAUGHS. 
TRACY Baby! What are you wearing!? 
ROBBIE Dad's here. 
Tracy's face drops. 
ROBBIE I have to blindfold you. 
TRACY (WEARY) What is this? What is he doing? 
(CONTINUED) 91 CONTINUED: 91 ROBBIE Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. 
She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind. 
He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER! 
ROBBIE Okay, we're good, let's do this. 
92 INT. BERNIE'S CAR 92 
Meanwhile. There's no expression on Bernie's face. It's frightening. He looks down at passenger seat. At the ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address. 
He RACES through a light. A HORN blares behind him. 
93 INT. JESSICA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 93 
Jessica is the one BLARING THE HORN, crying and panicked. 
She too RACES through the same light. 
94 EXT. WEAVER BACKYARD 94 
Robbie leads a blindfolded Tracy into the backyard. She looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face. We see what she is not yet privy to. 
ON THE BACKYARD 
Cal's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all. 
Cal stands behind it all, in a tux. 
CAL Hi, T. 
TRACY Can I take these off, please? 
CAL Almost. Kids?

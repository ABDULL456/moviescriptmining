Unrest in the attendance. 
...because they wanted to "get even". Get even for what? Because their mother had died while she was working in the sawmill, and it was supposedly  my  fault,   which  is  an  absurd assertion. 
The farmer, Leni and the other children are there, with the exception of Franz. 
The unrest grows. 
At least, that's what Franz Felder gave as the motive for his "mowing prowess", when the policemen arrested him. I have always supported the farmer Felder and his family, but one can't always expect people to be grateful. That's a matter of character. 
The farmer wants to leave the church. 
BARON: Don't run away, Felder. It's your honor I want to salvage. It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder has been boasting of his feat in front of his fianc√©e. Then the coward that he is, hid among his family, and so he didn't have time to torture my son. And there's one thing I know for sure: the senior Felder would rather bite off his tongue, than cover for his wayward son. May I remind you something what most of you have already forgotten. Almost two months ago, the doctor had a riding accident and he has still not returned from the hospital. This accident was caused by a wire that had been strung in his garden with the explicit intent of bringing him down. And in that case too, nobody knows anything, saw anything or heard anything. 
Disconcerted MUTTER among the attendance.

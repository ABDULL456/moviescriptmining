RICHARD What does that mean? 
SETH (distracted) What? 
Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side. 
RICHARD You just called me a fuckin' nut. 
SETH No, I didn't. 
RICHARD Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut. 
SETH Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool. 
RICHARD You meant that, but you meant the other, too. 
Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth. 
SETH (serious as a heart attack) This ain't the time, Richard. 
RICHARD (his voice rising) Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks. 
SETH (real quiet and violent) Keep your voice down. 
RICHARD (quiet back) Or what? 
BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT 
JACOB Have you forgotten about your sister? 
SCOTT They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us. 
JACOB If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go. 
SCOTT Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance. 
JACOB What about Kate? 
SCOTT They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance. 
JACOB Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this. 
SCOTT If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will. 
Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him to him. 
JACOB Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions. 
SCOTT He's running the show. 
JACOB I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass. 
There's a HONK behind them. 
They both look out the window. It's their turn with the BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up. 
A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window. 
BORDER GUARD How many with you? 
JACOB Just my son and I. 
BORDER GUARD What is your purpose in Mexico? 
JACOB Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight. 
BACK TO BATHROOM 
RICHARD I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did? 
SETH This ain't the time. 
RICHARD Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.

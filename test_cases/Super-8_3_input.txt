CHARLES ... you gonna be okay without me? 
JOE (a meaningful beat) ... yeah. 
Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary: 
CARY I'm not staying with the girls! 
CHARLES God, Cary. Shut up! 
CARY Calm down. 
MARTIN Oh, my leg hurts! 
JOE Come on, Cary, we gotta go. 
Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off -- 
CHARLES This is going to hurt. 
Martin screams. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I haven't even done it yet. 
Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone figures in town. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves. 
CARY So what are we doing here? 
JOE Just follow me. 
CARY I've been following you for the last five blocks. What are we doing here? 
Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the CARETAKER'S SHED. 
EXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT 
They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows. Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked. 
JOE Help me! 
CARY Help you with what? 
JOE We need to get inside. 
CARY For what? What's in these windows? 
JOE Cary, help me. 
CARY It's dirt. Why is there dirt in these windows? 
JOE Help me, on three. 
JOE/CARY One, two, three.... One, two, three.... One, two threee. 
The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one -- two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their breath. 
CARY Whoa. This is scary. 
JOE You got any sparklers in there? 
CARY Are you kidding me? 
Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER. LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump. 
But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom. 
JOE -- Alice is down there. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
A JEEP roars past. 
INT. JEEP - NIGHT 
Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad: 
LOUIS I came to your house that day. To tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone. Swear to God. (beat, respectful tears) I'm sorry, Jack. About what happened to your wife.

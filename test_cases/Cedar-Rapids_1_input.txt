The sun is low. Long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of 70-foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice. 
Tim and Joan run up to Orin, who is waiting by the silos. 
ORIN OK guys, this is it. First team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match. (unfurls a scroll, reads) ASMI's past is behind us; But our future looks nice; Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century... by scaling this silo of ice! 
Some DUDES with ice climbing equipment-- ropes, picks, etc. appear. Tim looks petrified. Joan shakes her head. 
JOAN That doesn't even... There's no such thing as silo ice climbing. 
TIM No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa. ABC news did a story about it. I saw it on YouTube. 
JOAN Of course you did. Well, you can do it then... 
TIM Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared crapless of heights. 
JOAN You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz I'm not climbing jack. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
JOAN (CONT'D) Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that... 
Tim's nostrils flair. Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner arrive. Tim looks to the top of the silo. It is dizzyingly high. He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales. 
TIM Yeah. Let's do this thing. 
Orin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music (Whitesnake's HERE I GO AGAIN, perhaps). 
QUICK CUTS: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons. 
And they start climbing. Sort of. Tim jams his pick into the ice. He tries to pull himself up, but can't. Mike fares worse. He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice. 
TIM (CONT'D) Hang on... How's it...? 
MIKE PYLE Little help here... 
The Dudes shout instructions. Tim and Mike try again. To no avail. Neither could do a pull-up if his life depended on it. 
A LITTLE WHILE LATER -- 
All the contestants have shown up. But not a damn one of them can get more than a foot off the ground. 
TIM Ugh. This is frickin' hard. 
RONALD Really hard. 
DEAN I think I just shit my pants. 
Joan cheers. Orin looks to the Dudes, who shrug. 
A LITTLE WHILE LATER -- 
Orin talks on his cell phone, conferring. The contestants wait in a field, shivering. The sun is getting lower. Orin hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
ORIN OK gang, that was Rick Martini with the National Chapter. Here's the deal. Since no one could do the final task, and since Joan and Tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. Unless anyone's got a problem with that? 
Ronald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance. 
RONALD Dangit. You could've done better, Wilkes. 
TIM Wait, we won? 
ORIN Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75 gift card for the Westdale Mall. 
Orin hands Joan the gift card. Despite the anticlimax, Tim is overjoyed. He picks up Joan and spins her around. Everyone else just wanders away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) - THAT EVENING 
Tim is ebullient. Joan rides shotgun. The screen on Tim's phone says that he's missed 11 calls. It rings again. 
TIM Oh crap. I forgot... (ANSWERS PHONE) Hey, Millie. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) I have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours, Timothy. I was going to call the police. Where have you been? 
TIM I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! My teammate and I, that is. Joan. 
JOAN Hi Millie! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM That was Joan saying hi. (beat, to Joan) Millie says hi.

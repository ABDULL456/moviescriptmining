And then a 15 WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we... \nFADE IN: \nEXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK \nThe image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY, just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm water runs down its face and body. \nTIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA: \nMIDWIFE He is strong. \nThe baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out to the new MOTHER: \nAMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized. She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly: \nAMANDA ... hello. \nCLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room. She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks: \nYOUNGER MIDWIFE The baby is healthy. Why does she cry? \nMIDWIFE (a beat; then) She is human. \nA distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time, that the Midwife has POINTED EARS. \nMIDWIFE (CONT'D) Sarek arrives. \nThe Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for a moment, clearly disquieted. \n15A   OMIT                                                              15A \n15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]                      15B \nA planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built seamlessly into a rocky mountainside. \nA SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06. \nThe speeder parks outside the home -- \n15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C \nSAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He looks at the child -- his child -- and says: \nSAREK Well done. \nShe looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just enough rancor: \nAMANDA Thanks. \nHe regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE -- \nSAREK Your tone suggests disappointment. The Science Council required my presence for a session regarding-- \nAMANDA Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you here. \nThe Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods. The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says, clinically: \nSAREK As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery. \nAMANDA Well traditionally, I'm not the one giving birth. (then) (MORE) \n15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C AMANDA (CONT'D) I moved here -- to another planet -- to be with you. I needed you to be with me today. Holding my hand and telling me I'm doing great, even when I'm just... breathing the best I can. \nSad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately: \nSAREK You are correct. I should have been here. I am sorry. \nAnd with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses him. And the two look at the baby. \nSAREK (CONT'D) I had a thought. That we might name the child after one of our respected early society-builders. His name was \"Spock\". \nShe looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name. \nSAREK (CONT'D) Your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm. \nAMANDA No... Spock. (smiles, touches his face) ... Spock. \nShe looks at Sarek: Spock it is. \nSAREK The child has your eyes. \nShe pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS, revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR. \nAMANDA ... and your ears. \nAnd off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan, we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER \"THREE YEARS LATER\" APPEARS -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON: \n15D   INT.

The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks: \nCAPTAIN ROBAU Report. \nPUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he forces optimism: \nGEORGE KIRK I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart. \nHe disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES -- \n26MA EXT.

That was-- that was a big one! \n-- as they put her into the shuttle bed: \nNURSE Just keep breathing, Honey, you're gonna be just fine-- \nWINONA (through the pain) -- the baby, too, right? \nNURSE -- the baby too. \n26R   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26R \nAs George Kirk pilots, he checks the monitors -- one reads the COUNTDOWN TO SELF-DESTRUCT (180 SECONDS, 179 SECONDS, 178 SECONDS...) and another reads IMPACT PROXIMITY (36,054 METERS, \n26R   CONTINUED:                                                      26R \nAnother screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS DOCKED -- \nThe NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink: \nGEORGE KIRK Captain to shuttle 37 -- is my wife on board? \nINTERCUT WITH: \n26S   OMIT                                                            26S \n26T   INT.

We can't go, my husband isn't here yet! Please! STOP--! \n-- but she's suddenly WINCING as another CONTRACTION hits -- \nNURSE You'll need to push now-- are you ready? \n26U   EXT. U.S.S.

I'm not going to be able to be there. \nAnd she just stares -- realizing what's happening -- that he's been made Captain -- that there was an evacuation -- and somehow she just KNOWS.

Logic dictates you would cease by now. \nVULCAN BULLY #1 Look. He has human eyes. They look sad, don't they? \nVULCAN BULLY #2 Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli. \nAnd Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling into one of the bowls. He looks up as: \nVULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D) He's a traitor, you know. Your father. For marrying her. \nSpock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable -- AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2! The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO: \n46   INT. LEARNING CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER                             46 \nTIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents ARGUE at a distance down the hall: \nAMANDA                                SAREK -- where I'm from, when someone hits you, you hit back- - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being tease him -- every day.            physically injured -- -- Which is precisely when reason must guide his actions -- I want him to embrace           above all. Vulcan, you know that... but he has to be himself-- which means, occasionally, being         -- His \"humanity\" is very the human.                             source of his ostracism. -- When Vulcans get disgusted with each other, they never just walk away, do they?           -- No. -- Well humans do. \nAnd Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns -- sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in front of him, looming there, looking down stoically: \nYOUNG SPOCK I did not mean to create conflict between you and mother. \nAfter a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his face. Takes a seat beside his son... \nSAREK In marriage... conflict is... \nYOUNG SPOCK ... constant? \nSAREK Natural. (a beat) Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly destroyed us... that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you must choose. \nYOUNG SPOCK ... between you and mother? \n46   CONTINUED:                                                            46 \nSAREK Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings... so that they do not control you. \nYOUNG SPOCK They called you a traitor. (then) You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan... and yet you married a human... why? \nSarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady: \nSAREK As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother... was logical. (Spock seems disquieted) Spock. You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are faced with... is which path you will take. This is something only you can decide. \n47   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                             47 \nBAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them: \nUNCLE FRANK Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I could give a damn! \nYOUNG KIRK -- wait-- no!    Where are you going? \nGEORGE JR. Anywhere but here, far as I can get! \nUNCLE FRANK Which won't be far enough -- know what your problem is?! (big luggie spit) No one ever taught you respect! How to follow orders! Do as you're told! (to Jim) -- what the hell are you doing? \nYOUNG KIRK I-- I just don't want my brother to go. \n47    CONTINUED:                                                      47 \nUNCLE FRANK Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the car! How many damn times do I need to repeat myself?! How many damn times? How many? \nA glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC -- \nYOUNG KIRK Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo! \nGeorge hits it away: \nGEORGE JR. This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank. I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no idea what he's like when she's not here-- d'you hear him talking like he's our dad?! And that's not even his car you're washing! That was Dad's car! You know why you're washing it? Because he's gonna sell it! \nJIM Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom when she gets back from Africa. \nGEORGE JR. She's gone for five more months, by then I'll be in a different system. (sees fear in Kirk) You're gonna be okay. You always are. Always doing everything right -- good grades and obeying every stupid order... (then) I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me how to do that and I'll stay. \nBut Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go. \n47A   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       47A \nKirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over his brother's departure. Devastated. \nAnd he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition. PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE- LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO: \n48-49 OMIT                                                          48-49 \n50    EXT.

TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as he is determined -- \n50A   EXT. IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER                                     50A \nThe CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD. \nHe reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS -- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF -- SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING! \nBACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he calls through his PA: \nCOP Son, you pull over that car! \nBut Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER: \nJIM I CAN'T HEAR YOU! \n51    EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS                                       51 \nGeorge, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks... familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the middle of the road, mouth agape -- \nGEORGE JR. -- no... way. \nBack at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS QUICKLY to follow -- \nSPOCK (CONT'D) May I ask a personal query? \nAMANDA ... anything. \nSPOCK Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all emotion... I trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you. \nShe stares at him, moved.      Touches his face. \nAMANDA As always... whoever you choose to be... you will have a proud mother. \nHOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded: \n58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58 \nAn imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER, seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS. \nSCIENCE MINISTER You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well. \nSPOCK It was logical to cultivate multiple options. \nSCIENCE MINISTER Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy. \nThey all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled: \nSPOCK If you would clarify, Minister-- what \"disadvantage\" are you referring to? \nSCIENCE MINISTER ... your human mother. \n58   CONTINUED:                                                         58 \nAs the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat. His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life -- \nSPOCK Council -- ministers.    I must decline. \nEveryone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold: \nSCIENCE MINISTER No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy. \nSPOCK Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished. \nSAREK                               SPOCK Spock. You have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can way--                                think of no greater way to honor our race than to attend Starfleet as its first Vulcan. \nSCIENCE MINISTER Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel? \nSPOCK I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your \"insight\" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. (a contained \"fuck you\") Live long and prosper. \nHe looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident -- still, God bless him, Spock walks out -- \n59   EXT. \"THE WARP TRAIL\" BAR - IOWA - NIGHT                              59 \n-- PUSH DOWN A HALLWAY -- MUSIC HEARD -- what seems like a PARTY is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious: \n59   CONTINUED:                                                    59 \nUHURA Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft. \nVOICE (O.S.) That's a lot of drinks for one woman. Wearing those boots. \nJAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty, dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives him a look, then back to the bartender: \nUHURA And a shot of Jack, straight up. \nKIRK (to the bartender) Make it two -- her shot's on me. \nUHURA Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks. \nKIRK Don't you want my name before you completely reject me? \nUHURA I'm good without it. \nDamn, he likes her already. \nKIRK You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim Kirk. (long beat) If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up. \nUHURA (beat) Uhura. \nKIRK Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what? \nUHURA Just Uhura. \nKIRK They don't have last names in your world? \n59   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    59 \nUHURA Uhura is my last name. \nKIRK They don't have first names in your world? Wait, let me guess. Is it \"Jim\"? \nThat makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her: \nKIRK (CONT'D) Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying. What's your focus? \nUHURA Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't know what that means. \nKIRK Let me guess: study of Alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means you've got a talented tongue. \nUHURA And for a moment I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals. \nKIRK Well.    Not only. \nUHURA You think you're smart. \nKIRK Oh, baby, I'm the smartest. \nSomething sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears. \nBURLY CADET This guy bothering you? \nUHURA Beyond belief, but nothing I can't handle. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three. \nPike grins as Kirk passes him. \nInside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND. \n64   CONTINUED:                                                      64 \nKIRK (CONT'D) At ease, Gentlemen.

He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS. \nACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D) An incident has occurred today that concerns the entire student body. Academic immorality by one is an assault on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code. Is there anything you care to say before we begin? \nKIRK (uncomfortable beat) Yessir.

He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years. \nSpock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods. \nSPOCK Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test. \nWe happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed. \nKIRK Your point being? \nACADEMY PRESIDENT In academic vernacular, you cheated. \nKIRK Respectfully.    Define \"cheating\". \nSPOCK To deceive by trickery. \nKIRK Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable. \nSPOCK Yes, Lieutenant? \nUHURA Was I not one of your top students? \nSPOCK Indeed you were -- \nUHURA Did I not receive a Gold rating for Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet first place over Kyoto and MIT at the Oxford Invitational? \nA LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY -- \nSPOCK An exceptional achievement, to be su-- \n84   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    84 \nUHURA -- and did I not, on multiple occasions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, \"unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies\" in subspace transmission tests?! \nSPOCK Consistently, yes-- \nUHURA And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S.

Quiet. \nSPOCK It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism. \nShe gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance: \nUHURA No. No. I am assigned to the Enterprise. \nTheir eyes hold.

I'm creating an opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have chutes -- you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship. \nKirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look -- \nKIRK ... okay. \nPIKE Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the ship.

The Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here, getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound -- her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage... \nSPOCK (V.O.) We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero. \n151A INT.

(beat) While the essence of our culture has been saved, in the elders who now reside upon this ship... I am now a member of an endangered species. \nSpock considers this.

Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the intimacy before -- this is their secret... \nUHURA I'm so sorry. \nSpock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost... \nUHURA (CONT'D) What can I do?     Tell me what you need. \nSPOCK ... I need... \nHe's on the verge of some emotional release... but self- consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again: \nSPOCK (CONT'D) I need for us all to continue performing admirably. \nHe looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her. \n152A INT.

Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him. After a beat he moves to her. Awkward. \nKIRK Hey. (she turns to him) Listen, about what happened at Starfleet. The test and everything-- I know it looks like I was... using you, or whatever. And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I just hope you'll forgive me. \nShe just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed. But Kirk's face changes... and then he says: \nKIRK (CONT'D) ... you're not Gaila, are you? \nNOT GAILA (pissed) No. \nKIRK (nods) Sorry. \nAnd he walks off.   (NOTE: ALT.

Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero. \nNERO It's not the fault of the human race that Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your extinction. \nPIKE How reassuring. \nNero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS \nNERO The frequencies, please. \nPIKE Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S.

Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage.

As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential. \nMCCOY My God, Man... you could at least act like it was a hard decision. \nSPOCK I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical expertise. \nA strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.

There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. (off Kirk's confusion) Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command. \nKIRK So I need to emotionally compromise you? \nSPOCK PRIME Jim.

If we could drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to Nero's sensors. We could follow him to Earth by staying in his blind spot. \nKIRK What blind spot? \nCHEKOV Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect us. \nMCCOY Wait a minute-- anyone understand this kid?

They look sad, don't they? \nVULCAN BULLY #2 Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli. \nAnd Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling into one of the bowls. He looks up as: \nVULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D) He's a traitor, you know. Your father.

His parents ARGUE at a distance down the hall: \nAMANDA                                SAREK -- where I'm from, when someone hits you, you hit back- - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being tease him -- every day.            physically injured -- -- Which is precisely when reason must guide his actions -- I want him to embrace           above all. Vulcan, you know that... but he has to be himself-- which means, occasionally, being         -- His \"humanity\" is very the human.                             source of his ostracism. -- When Vulcans get disgusted with each other, they never just walk away, do they?           -- No. -- Well humans do. \nAnd Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns -- sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in front of him, looming there, looking down stoically: \nYOUNG SPOCK I did not mean to create conflict between you and mother. \nAfter a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his face. Takes a seat beside his son... \nSAREK In marriage... conflict is... \nYOUNG SPOCK ... constant? \nSAREK Natural. (a beat) Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly destroyed us... that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you must choose. \nYOUNG SPOCK ... between you and mother? \n46   CONTINUED:                                                            46 \nSAREK Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings... so that they do not control you. \nYOUNG SPOCK They called you a traitor. (then) You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan... and yet you married a human... why? \nSarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady: \nSAREK As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother... was logical. (Spock seems disquieted) Spock. You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are faced with... is which path you will take. This is something only you can decide. \n47   EXT.

Where are you going? \nGEORGE JR. Anywhere but here, far as I can get! \nUNCLE FRANK Which won't be far enough -- know what your problem is?! (big luggie spit) No one ever taught you respect!

This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank. I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no idea what he's like when she's not here-- d'you hear him talking like he's our dad?! And that's not even his car you're washing! That was Dad's car! You know why you're washing it? Because he's gonna sell it! \nJIM Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom when she gets back from Africa. \nGEORGE JR. She's gone for five more months, by then I'll be in a different system. (sees fear in Kirk) You're gonna be okay. You always are. Always doing everything right -- good grades and obeying every stupid order... (then) I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me how to do that and I'll stay. \nBut Jim can offer nothing.

The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book: A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book. \nKLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D) When you were captured we assumed you were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil the Empire. But because the Romulans deny your existence, I believe you are much more than that. \nInterrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP- FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is. \nKLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D) Your ship remains in orbit above us now. We've been asking for its secrets for too long. That is why I am here.

This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying like hell to look impassive. \nAMANDA (CONT'D) There is no need to be so anxious. You'll do fine. \nSPOCK I am hardly \"anxious\", mother.

Even if we're still aboard. It's an order. \nSULU Yessir.   Good luck. \nSpock turns to Uhura, who hands him a small TRANSLATOR DEVICE: \nUHURA We'll be monitoring your frequency... \nUhura gives the translator to Spock -- AND HE KISSES UHURA. \nSPOCK Thank you, Nyota. \nThey part, revealing KIRK'S SHOCKED FACE.

By the last tally, only twenty five percent of the galaxy's been chartered... I'd call that negligent. Criminal even -- an invitation. (MORE) \nCONTINUED: KIRK/SHATNER (CONT'D) You once said being a starship captain was my first, best destiny... if that's true, then yours is to be by my side. If there's any true logic to the universe... we'll end up on that bridge again someday. \nStops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most... \nKIRK Admit it, Spock.

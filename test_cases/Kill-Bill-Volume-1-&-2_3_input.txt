The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and automobiles. 
When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,... 
She jerks the wheel... 
SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite direction. 
SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN... 
SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN... 
BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street. 
In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back. 
Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around. 
She gets ready to make a third pass. 
Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their front door. 
The Bride yells at them; 
THE BRIDE Stay in your house and stay down on the floor! 
Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for her. 
The Bride runs into the house she's in front of. 
She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is hiding and they block the door. 
Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and says; 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Time for the rabbit to come out of her hole! 
She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself face down on the lawn. 
The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters. 
Everybody in the kitchen is blown back. 
Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms. 
Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand... 
The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall... 
WHEN... 
Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg. 
The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING -- blood pours out of her gunshots. 
Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up the house. 
The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge. 
Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the hallway. 
The Bride fires... 
The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking her through a bedroom doorway. 
THE BRIDE (to herself) Gotcha! 
Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from the doorway into the hallway; 
YUKI (JAPANESE) You fucking bitch! You shot me in my breast! They're not fully developed yet, you fucking asshole! Now I'm always gonna have a dimple! 
The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top. 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Piss me off! 
She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up everything around the Bride. 
When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells; 
THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE) Yuki, in about two    minutes there's going to be an army    of police here. So if you're gonna    kill me, now's the time. 
From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue powder. It gives her energy. 
THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH) So what's it gonna be bitch? 
Slapping a new clip in her machine gun. 
YUKI (JAPANESE) That fucking does it! 
Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the 
Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her. 
The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm. 
The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat. 
Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style. 
Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs. 
The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs. She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead. 
Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open... Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her head turns in the    direction of the Bride... 
The Bride sees this and can't believe it... 
They lock eyes... 
...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream... 
She charges up the steps at the Bride. 
The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty... 
Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high... 
The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster. 
Yuki chargin... 
The Bride cocks back the hammer... 
...Yuki charging, getting closer... 
The Bride FIRES 
Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but she keeps charging... 
The Bride fires again... 
Yuki jerks but keeps on charging... 
Bride fires... 
Yuki jerks, but keeps charging... 
Bride fires... 
Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised high... 
The Bride FIRES 
Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

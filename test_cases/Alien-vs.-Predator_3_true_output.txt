INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT 
DE VRIES YELLS at GUTTIEREZ over the ROAR of the flames. 
DE VRIES Hotter 'n hell out there! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT 
HIROKO leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the platform.  She dashes towards the hoverbike, some thirty feet away. With no time to loose, she slides her boots into the foot-supports, which automatically WHIRR closed.  Gropes for the ignition key... 
Before she's even located it, the hoverbike moves.  SCRAPING across the concrete.  ALIEN claws appear around the edge of one of the bike's manta wings.  She's parked the bike over a drainage exit! 
HIROKO SPINS the key and guns the engine.  The white-hot downblast from the turbine exhaust SPLASHES across the SCREECHING ALIENS.  The vehicle tilts and KICKS forward. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The two crawlers emerge from the conflagration, scorched and trailing fire. In the BACKGROUND, the crane-hoist centers over the admin module. 
CATWALK P.O.V., looking straight down.  Four lasers scan quickly around the module's edges. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT 
A blinking message on the crane's monitor screen: POSITIVE MATCH.  COMMENCE LIFTING OPERATION. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
The sound of SHREDDING METAL makes HIROKO look down.  An ALIEN is hanging on the underside of the bike!  She twists the throttle, reducing acceleration and causing the vehicle to drop several inches. Sparks shower the ground from where the creature makes contact with the roadway.  The ALIEN's determination is astounding.  It's tail SLAMS up through the alloy 'wing', anchoring it. 
The biomechanoid starts to pulls itself up, shifting the bike's center of gravity.  She fights the controls, but finds herself swerving.  One- handed, she takes aim.  BLAM!  BLAM!  She misses the ALIEN, rupturing a fuel pipe instead. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The crane's clamping mechanism closes around the admin module, locking into place. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
CLANG!  Everybody reacts as the SOUND penetrates through the walls and ECHOES around admin. 
PARSONS Okay, people.  Hold on tight... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The crane hoists the module aloft, free of it's umbilicals. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
Pencils, disposable cups, and anything else not bolted down all roll from table-tops.  Most are grabbed by their owners. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
HIROKO's bike veers blindly around the corner of a building, with HIROKO still SHOOTING.  She looks up and her eyes widen.  Ahead is the out-of-control blaze.  A tongue of flame licks out across the platform, directly in her path. 
HIROKO slides the gun quickly into her shoulder-holster and ducks for cover behind the bike's windshield.  The ALIEN's head twists around, and they plunge into the inferno... 
WHOOMPH!  The liquid from the breached pipe ignites, trailing a plume of yellow flame.  HIROKO jams down on the foot-release and wrenches the steering bar hard to the right.  She leaps for safety as the burning bike with it's ALIEN passenger crashes through the station's safety- rail and plummets into the swamp. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM RAMP - NIGHT 
The two crawlers THUNDER down the ramp.  GUTTIEREZ' vehicle pulls into a tight right turn, while MATT's continues on it's course.  The crane with it's underslug module continues to RUMBLE slowly forward. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
HIROKO mechanically tries to get up from the concrete roadway.  Winces. Something hurts.  She looks down at the back of her left hand.  The skin has been scraped away. 
A DISTANT NOISE, something else being broken.  HIROKO turns.  Through the conflagration, ALIENS are advancing. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ' smoldering crawler pulls-up alongside Big Bertha's titanic wheels. 
INT. FIRST CRAWLER - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ turns his head to one of the guys in the rear. 
GUTTIEREZ Take the wheel, Roy! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES exit the crawler in a big hurry.  The moment they're clear, the vehicle starts up and is gone.  DE VRIES is alert, the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings. 
DE VRIES C'mon, man!  Let's shag it!

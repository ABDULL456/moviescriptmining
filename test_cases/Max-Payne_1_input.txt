He pulls the door shut. It won't. Something's blocking it. The guard stands up, opens it wider to build some momentum... 
Max stands on the top step. 
BACK ROOM 
Lupino shoots up, gritted teeth tugging his belt tourniquet tight. Eyes clinched, beads of sweat already forming. 
The muffled BLAST of a machine gun, out on the dance floor. The Guards surrounding Lupino spring into action. 
GUARD #1 W ait here, Mr. Lupino. 
Lupino lets the belt slip free, a deep SIGH rattling out. He opens his eyes, just in time for us to see the irises retracting. Candles shine in the black holes left behind. 
UPINO I don't need protection.   I have my own. 
The Guards at the door lock and load, moving out... 
BALLROOM 
Max walks into the ballroom, motionless Guard bleeding out on the dance floor before him. Gunsmoke hangs in the air... 
In that final stillness, Max checks his clip.     Stone-faced. 
Thundering BOOTS echo out from the belly of the building. Doors fly open - Guards racing out from the kitchen on the first floor, two more from the office CRASHING out upstairs. 
ax OPENS UP, flames of automatic fire lighting his way. 
BACK ROOM 
Lupino and the Guards listen to the SHOOTING grow closer. Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop. With lightning reflexes, THE GUARDS BLAST down the hallway. 
upino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle flash. Forgotten now, he fades away into the smoke. 
The Guards crumble and fall until the room goes SILENT. M ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised.     Hunting.

The back room is deeper than the poor light gives away. Max's boots grind over burned-out candles, occult runes... 
Lupino launches out of the darkness at Max.   Before he sees it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull. 
Max stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow. Lupino draws a gleaming knife from his boot and springs on Max. 
upino swings the knife so quickly it becomes a blur, blade WHISTLING as it cuts through the smoke. He slashes the knife across Max's thigh, dropping him to the ground. 
nable to stand, Max thrusts the rifle up for protection. The blade CLANKS against the barrel, carving deep trenches in the stock, finally gashing the back of Max's fingers. 
Blood rushes from the cuts, loosening Max's grip on the weapon. Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands. 
upino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.    He CRIES OUT. 
LUPINO an you hear them, now? 
Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest. Arm numb from the stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered. Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage... E XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT 
Outside, no voice could carry on that raging WIND. TWO FIGURES walk up the street, closing slowly on Ragna Rok. 
NT. RAGNA ROK - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 
Lupino leans over Max, one hand grinding the knife deeper into his shoulder, the other wrenching the machine gun free. Max desperately tries to dig his nails into the grip... 
LUPINO We'll see which one us they're flying for. We'll see who they love best. 
Sweat streams down Lupino's face, dripping down onto Max. Fingernails splitting, Max finally loses hold of the gun. The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back. 
For an instant, they are apart.

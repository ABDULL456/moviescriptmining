DAY SUBTITLE Berkeley, California -1981- \nDISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981 \nA busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange, self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up. The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Mark O'Brien has been going to UC Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien in the motorized gurney heading for class last week. \nThe gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus. Passers-by just go about their normal business. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.O.) He had polio when he was 6 years old. The disease left his body crippled but his mind remained sharp and alert, and since he wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien entered Cal to major in English and learn his trade. \nWe hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark in his contraption. \nMARK (V.O.) Graduation Today I hear the crowd's applause Receive congratulations from my friends Today I ask if I've found a place among the rest I hope you see a man upon this stage Who studied...read..wrote, and passed the test In cap and gown, diploma on my chair \nTHE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS, rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles. 1A. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.O.) And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from Cal, one of 250 English majors to receive degrees today. \nThe DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the rest of the stage to thunderous applause. \nTHE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news reporter talks to camera. \nNEWS REPORTER If this report tells us anything, it is that a disability is not necessarily a handicap. \nIn the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered round him in a jubilant mood. \nNEWS REPORTER (CONT'D) Mark O'Brien teaches us that courage and perseverance overcome obstacles. With Mark O'Brien at UC Berkeley, Bill Hillman, Channel Five Eyewitness News. \nEND OF NEWS FOOTAGE \n1A   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO. NIGHT                                    1A \nClassic shot of the illuminated Golden Gate Bridge. \nSUPER CAPTION: \"A FEW YEARS LATER\" EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S.    NIGHT It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment. It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially-opened window. \nINT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close-by. \nIn the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep. 2A. \nMARK (V.O.) Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean. Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life. \nHaving now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung. \nIt hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches. He opens his eyes and grimaces. \nMARK Shit! \nMay the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always. \nMass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his head or chest and say, \"God bless you.\" In the background we can also hear Father Brendan. \nFATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) May the peace of the Lord be with you. \nPARISHIONERS And also with you. \nA LITTLE LATER 5A. \n7A   INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY                                     7A \nMark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that of a true believer. \nMARK (V.O.) I'm definitely a true believer. But I believe in a God with a sense of humor. A wicked sense of humor. One who created me in His own image. \nFather Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands. For no good reason, he nods instead. \nFATHER BRENDAN Hello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't think we've met. \nMARK No, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I knew Father Seamus very well. I'm sorry that he's not here any more. \nFATHER BRENDAN As are many others. I'm going to do my best to fill his shoes. I understand you'd like me to hear your confession. \nMARK Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed Mass. I liked your tone. \nFather Brendan is not sure how to take this. \nFATHER BRENDAN Thank you. \nMARK You don't believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional, do you? \nFATHER BRENDAN No, I do not. I believe sincerity is the most essential part. \nMARK I told my attendant to come back in half an hour. Is that okay? \nFATHER BRENDAN Yes, take your time. I'm in no rush. \nMARK Did Father Seamus say anything to you about me? FATHER BRENDAN No one said anything to me about you. \nMARK I can be a bit time consuming, but I'm worth the trouble. \nFather Brendan breaks a smile for the first time. FATHER BRENDAN I'm here for you Mark. \nMARK Look, this is not exactly a confession. I haven't yet done the deed. I was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance. \nFather Brendan sits down. \nFATHER BRENDAN Tell me what's on your mind. \nMARK The most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, Joan. I'm thinking of getting rid of her. It's an evil thought, but I can't help it. \nFATHER BRENDAN Is she dishonest, or incompetent? \nMARK No, neither of those. She looks at me the wrong way. It's that you- need-me-more-than-I-need-you look. I'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me. Is that a sin, Father? \nFATHER BRENDAN Well, it obviously troubles you. \nMARK Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because maybe it's really a power trip. Me against her. Me against the world. \nMARK (V.O.) What did the boyfriend think? That I was in his way? I'm always in somebody's way, I thought, the sun in my eyes. \nWe sense Mark's deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and the sun warms his face. \nMARK (V.O.) As she glided through crowds of lives She couldn't leave me lying there Dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence. \nINT.   BATHROOM.   NIGHT Amanda and her boyfriend MATT, are sharing the tub. \nMATT Do you touch him? \nAMANDA I do everything. Any other questions? \nMATT You don't have to be so defensive. I'm not about to get jealous. \nAMANDA Why not? He's a much nicer person than you are. \nShe gets out of the bath suddenly. \nINT.    MARK'S PLACE.      DAY Amanda is shaving Mark. \nMARK What does your boyfriend think of me? \nAMANDA He's an asshole. It doesn't matter what he thinks of you. \nMARK I'm interested in the opinion of an asshole. \nAMANDA He thinks you're some kind of Svengali, and that you're going to hypnotise me into your cult. \nMARK He's right. \nAMANDA He says he can already see changes. \nShe finishes shaving him and cleans him up. His eyes feast on every detail of her face. \nCut to somewhere at night, Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror- ball lighting. \nMARK (V.O.) So with her gentle fearless heart She took me in. I thrived in her garden And wanted more. \nA16   EXT. STREET NEAR CLOTHING STORE. DAY                     A16 \nAmanda wheels Mark towards a clothing store. INT.   CLOTHING STORE.    DAY Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store, stopping from time to time to take something down from the shelf. She picks out a shirt. \nAMANDA This you must have. \nAs she leans over to show it to him, Mark doesn't seem to be listening. He whispers to her. \nMARK I love you. \nShe says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then puts the shirt back. They continue round the store in thoughtful silence and avoid eye contact with each other. We sense from the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a beautiful friendship. \n17    OMITTED                                                      17 INT. SIDE CHAPEL.   DAY Mark and Father Brendan are huddled together in the little chapel. \nFATHER BRENDAN Did she reciprocate your feelings? \nMARK She didn't seem to. 11A. \nFATHER BRENDAN Sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions. \nMARK Well, in case she didn't get it the first time, I told her again that I was in love with her, and wanted to marry her, thinking it might swing things. \nSANDY (V.O.) No particular reason. If you're working on something else, then we can talk about it later. \nMARK No, now is fine. \nEXT. CARMEN'S DRIVEWAY.      DAY Vera wheels Mark towards his first interview. The more we see Vera, the more we like her. \nMARK (V.O.) There was no denying it. A door had opened which I could not close, and in invisible writing it said: \"Do not enter\". \nINT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY We see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette recorder. We hear a female voice. \nCARMEN (V.O.) Some positions, like that one, are pretty much impossible. \nCarmen, early 30s, is a paraplegic in a wheelchair. She is pretty and animated, and has full use of her hands. \nCARMEN I don't know if you can quite visualize it. It's called a lateral, or sideways reverse cow- girl. \nIt is obvious that Mark cannot visualize it. Although she doesn't give much away, we sense that Vera can. 14A. \nCARMEN (CONT'D) Don't worry about it then. It's just a question of depth of penetration. (MORE) \nCARMEN (CONT'D) To some people it's really important, like my partner, for example. It's not such a big deal for me. I get just as excited when he licks my nipples, if and when he bothers to do it. \nMark looks troubled. \nCARMEN (CONT'D) I think the tape's about to run out. \nAt that very moment, there is a click, and the tape runs out. Vera flips the tape over, sets it running in record mode, and takes her place again behind Mark's gurney. \nCARMEN (CONT'D) Do you want to keep going? \nMARK Uh, I think I've actually got enough to work on. Thanks. \nCARMEN Get back to me if you need anything else. Oh, and let me give you Greg's phone number. He's full of stuff you wouldn't think was possible. \nINT.   MARK'S PLACE.     DAY Rod vacuums the floor while Mark taps away on his typewriter. Mark looks troubled. \n23A   EXT. GREG'S PLACE. DAY                                      23A \nWe hear voices. \nMARK (V.O.) Okay, shall we start? \nGREG (V.O.) Sure. \nWe hear the cassette recorder click on. \n23B   INT. GREG'S PLACE. DAY                                      23B \nGreg is a handsome quadriplegic. Vera is there with Mark. \nGREG Oral sex is a matter of taste. \nMark doesn't get it. Vera, as usual, is impassive. \nGREG (CONT'D) And one thing that really works in my favor is that I smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded. This gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department, and stamina is key in cunnilingus. INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT The alley cat creeps in through the open window. Mark watches it approach from his iron lung. \nMARK Who are these people? I feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters. \nThe cat seems to understand. \nFather Brendan shakes his head with concern. \nFATHER BRENDAN What is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute? MARK I don't know, but I think there's a difference. 23A. \nFATHER BRENDAN How do you know she's not some hooker gussied up as a social worker, who's just going to rob you? MARK I trust what my therapist said about her. FATHER BRENDAN How old are you? \nMARK Thirty-eight. \nFATHER BRENDAN Why exactly now? \nMARK I never had any spare cash before. That's a major factor, and I'm probably getting close to my use-by date. \nFATHER BRENDAN And this is what you want my advice about? Fornication? \nMARK Your advice as a friend. \nFATHER BRENDAN And do I have the casting vote, so to speak? \nMARK Let's say I value your advice just as much as I do the therapist's. \nFATHER BRENDAN You're serious, aren't you? \nMARK I think sex is a serious matter. It's one of the most persistent themes in the bible. (MORE) \nMARK (CONT'D) So, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do I want to find out? \nFATHER BRENDAN And you want my opinion? \nMARK Please. \nFather Brendan contemplates for a few moments. He looks up at the statue of Jesus, then makes a decision. \nFATHER BRENDAN I know in my heart that He'll give you a free pass on this one. Go for it. \nMARK What? FATHER BRENDAN I said, go for it. MARK Really? \nFATHER BRENDAN If you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it? \nMARK To tell the truth, I'm scared. \nFATHER BRENDAN Then we should pray. \nFather Brendan and Mark pray together. \nFATHER BRENDAN (CONT'D) Sweet Jesus, Mark and I sit at your feet and pray that You bless this little journey, this one small step for a man. \n34   OMITTED                                                   34 \n35   OMITTED                                                   35 \n36    OMITTED                                            36 \n37    OMITTED                                            37 \n37A   OMITTED                                           37A EXT.   STREET NEAR CARMEN'S.   DAY ROD is wheeling Mark along in his gurney. \nMARK I really feel proud of myself, imposing on someone I hardly know, to fornicate in their home. \nROD Get over it. It's perfectly normal. \nSuddenly, Cheryl notices that Tony has opened the refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice bottle. \nCHERYL Hold on a moment, please. \nShe covers the mouthpiece of the phone. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, cut that out! \nHe takes no notice. She puts the phone down and moves towards him. He closes the fridge door and runs. \nINT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY Mark is having a bed bath. His shoulders and neck are covered with soap suds. Rod is washing his back. The phone rings. \nMARK Would you get it please? \nROD Sure. \nRod eases Mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to answer the phone. \nROD (CONT'D) Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone. \nHe switches it to speaker so Mark can hear. \nCHERYL (V.O.) Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene. May I speak to Mark? \nRod holds the phone toward Mark like a question. Mark's face looks drained of blood. \nROD Just one moment, please. \nRod switches the phone off speaker. \nROD (CONT'D) What am I doing here? Yes or no? Make up your mind. \nMark hesitates, then nods weakly. Rod puts the phone back on speaker. \nMARK Hullo, this is Mark. \nCHERYL (V.O.) Hi, Mark. I'm Cheryl. Laura called to introduce you. I understand you'd like to meet. Is that right? \nMark can hardly speak. He eventually forces the sound from his throat. \nMARK Uh, yes. \nCHERYL (V.O.) I could see you on the seventeenth, at eleven o'clock. Would that be any good for you? \nMARK Uh, yes, I think that would be fine for me. \nCHERYL Hey, where you from? \nMARK Boston. You? \nCHERYL Salem. Small world. \nMARK Wouldn't want to paint it. INT.   CHERYL'S KITCHEN.     DAY Cheryl is on the phone, holding the receiver with one hand while she puts away groceries with the other. 29A. \nCHERYL We'll be talking for a while to begin with. Then, if you agree, we can also start doing some body awareness exercises in your first session. \nINT.   MARK'S PLACE.   NIGHT The iron lung pumps away. Mark is alone. He stares at the picture of the Virgin Mary. \nMARK Holy Mother of God, what are \"body awareness exercises\"? \nCHERYL Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late. \nVERA No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers. \nCheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile. \nCHERYL Hi, Mark O'Brien. \nMark clears his throat with a little difficulty. \nMARK Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene. \nVera is already at the front door. \nVERA I'll be back, say, in two hours? \nCHERYL Yes, two hours, that would be perfect. \nShe closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abandoned. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) So... \nMark blurts out. \nMARK Your money's on the dresser. \nCheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned, Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an envelope. \nCHERYL Thank you. \nShe puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully. \nMARK That was the wrong way to start off. \nCHERYL Yes, it was. Shall we start again? \nMARK Please, you start. \nShe sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in. \nCHERYL Although the aim is for us to have sex, I'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front. I've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference. We can talk about that later. \nMARK I'm sorry. \nCHERYL The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. Did Laura mention that when you saw her? \nMARK I'm sorry, I don't remember. \nCHERYL The limit is six. But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. Now, I understand you are able to have an erection. \nMARK Yes, but not out of choice. \nCHERYL Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection? \nShe looks around the room. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Is this your place? \nMARK No, it's a friend's. The only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung. I've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose. \nCHERYL Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't worry. \nShe carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off. \nMARK Be careful, please. \nCHERYL Mark, I'm going to be really careful with you. I don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me. Okay? \nMARK I won't yell at you any more. \nCHERYL But you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt? MARK Yes. CHERYL Now, let's do the other arm. \nLittle by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally sets his shirt down on the end of the bed. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Nice shirt. \nMARK You already said that. \nCHERYL Did I? I guess I'm a little anxious, too. \nShe undoes the top of his pants. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Okay, I'm going to slide these down. Hold your breath. \nShe pulls. He screams, in fear more than pain. \nMARK Shit, fuck! No, don't do that! 36A. \nINT.   BATHROOM.   DAY Cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of deep breaths. \nINT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.   DAY Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the bathroom door. He can hear the sound of water running. He looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time. \nINT.   BATHROOM. DAY Cheryl turns off the tap. She has done a great job of pulling herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has brought herself. \nINT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.   DAY Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress. \nCHERYL Ready? \nMARK No. \nCheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away. \nCHERYL Okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that I don't want your return business. I'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner. \nShe stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him and he finally looks at her. \nMARK Whenever I'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed. Now that I'm in bed with another naked person, I'm very confused. \nShe strokes his hair. \nCHERYL So, why is it confusing? \nMARK I'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening. \nShe slides her hand down. She can feel his heart thumping. 37A. \nCHERYL Mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch. \nHe closes his eyes. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me? \nMARK I was terrified. \nCHERYL You can be proud of yourself. You did great. We've made real progress. \nMARK Can I ask you something? \nCHERYL Of course. What would you like to ask? \nMARK Anything, really. Tell me something about yourself. Anything. \nCHERYL Sure. I'm a very private person. I have a private life, I do need you to be aware of that, but that's about it. This therapy is about you. \nThere is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key turns in the lock. A few moments later, Carmen and Vera come in. \nMARK Welcome back. \nCHERYL Perfect timing. \nCARMEN I hope you guys kept the noise down. \nEXT.   STREET NEAR CARMEN'S.   DAY Vera wheels Mark back the way they came. She is very discreet and they travel in silence for a while. Finally, curiosity overcomes her. \nVERA How do you feel? \nMARK Cleansed and victorious. \nVERA Doesn't get any better than that. \nMARK Tell me about your first sexual experience. \nVERA Let me think. It wasn't all that pleasant. I mean, it was consensual and everything, and I really was in love with the guy, but his dick seemed enormous to me, I didn't think it would fit. It was scary. But he was nice. I guess he couldn't help it. \nMARK Was he Chinese? \nVERA Are you kidding? I only hung out with white guys at high school. \nMARK Why is that? \nVERA I don't know. To stick it to my mum and dad, I suppose. \nMARK Are they happy now you've got a Chinese boyfriend? \nVERA They're happy. I'm happy. \nMARK What's his dick like? \nVERA Perfect size. \nMARK Why do you call it a dick instead of a penis? \nVERA Penis sounds like some vegetable you don't want to eat. Dick sounds like what it is. \nThey continue in silence for a little while. \nMARK The thing is, it was all over so damn quickly. \nVERA Yes, tell me about it. \n82   OMITTED                                                      82 EXT.   CARMEN'S DRIVEWAY.   DAY Vera wheels Mark up to the front door. \nMARK You couldn't have wished for nicer weather. \nVERA You're not listening, are you? I said, stop thinking about it. \nMARK Beautiful weather. \nShe steps up to ring the bell, then hesitates. There is something of a hubbub coming from inside. Both she and Mark can hear it clearly. \nINT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY The doorbell rings, amidst a loud background chatter. We reveal a ROOMFUL OF WOMEN, gathered for some intense group activity of some kind. Carmen buzzes her way to the front door in her wheelchair. She opens it. She has an expression of horror. \nCARMEN Oh, my God, I forgot! Oh, Mark, I'm so sorry. \nThe entire roomful of women stare at Mark and Vera. In the background we see Cheryl's car pull up. \nEXT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY Cheryl, Mark and Vera are by the car. Mark looks grim. \nVERA She was very apologetic. \nThey are all shaking their heads. Cheryl has a thought. \nCHERYL Look, it may not be exactly what we had in mind, but I noticed there's quite a nice motel just a couple of blocks from here. Maybe it's worth checking out. \nINT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.    DAY Mark and Cheryl wait outside while Vera goes in. \nVERA Have you got anything on the ground floor? \nThe MOTEL CLERK is also Chinese. He looks at the rack of keys. \nCLERK I've got a single. \nVERA How much? \nCLERK Thirty-five plus tax. \nVERA My boss is the gentleman in the gurney. (MORE) \nVERA (CONT'D) He's supposed to be having a therapy session right now, but the facility we normally use had a scheduling mix-up. We only need the room for two hours. Can you do it for twenty cash? \nEXT.   MOTEL.   DAY The clerk leads them to the room and opens the door. \nCLERK There's a soda machine around the corner. \nMARK Thanks. \nCLERK And an ice machine, if you need it. \nMARK I'm sure it'll come in handy. \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY Cheryl, Vera and the gurney enter the room. The clerk watches in the background. Cheryl and Vera lower Mark onto the bed. Allowing for the gurney, there is not a lot of space left in the room. \nVERA Okay, I'll see you. I've got a book to read. I'll just hang around the reception if you need me. \nVera leaves. Mark looks around. \nMARK Very atmospheric. \nCHERYL Some people find motels exciting. \nCHERYL Mark, I'm just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee. When I come back, we're going to achieve full penetration. But before I go, I want you to close your eyes. \nMARK Is this a game? \nCHERYL No, it's not a game. Just do as I say. Close your eyes. \nHe closes his eyes. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach. Can you do that? \nMARK Yes, very easily. \nEXT.   BEACH.   DAY The scene has a hazy, dreamlike reality. We see the six-year old Mark, able-bodied and full of energy, running and playing in the sand with his dog. \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY CHERYL Describe some of your feelings. \nMARK I feel very exhilarated, running next to the Atlantic Ocean, feeling the wind and the wet sand between my toes. \nCHERYL Do you really feel like him? \nMARK Yes, I really feel like him. \nCHERYL But can you really picture him? \nMARK I don't understand what you mean. I said I can feel like him. Of course I can picture him. \nCHERYL From the outside, I mean, as an adult, as you are now, looking at him with his crew cut and his little face? \nMARK Yes. \nCHERYL And are you mad at him? Do you blame him for getting polio? Was it his fault? 53A. \nCheryl gets up and goes to the bathroom. Mark is obviously affected by her question. \nINT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY Mark has a faraway look. \nMARK She either forgot to close the bathroom door, or didn't bother to close it. \nMark pauses as he hears some distant footsteps. Father Brendan looks over his shoulder. They finally pass. Mark continues. \nMARK (CONT'D) I found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic, and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate. By the time she came back I had a terrific boner. \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY Cheryl gets herself into position on top of Mark. \nCHERYL I'm going to rub the tip of your cock around my vulva. When it's ready, I'll guide you in. Breathe slowly and think of something delicious. \nMark thinks. Through his mind's eye, we see a succession of images. Fingertips stroking a cat's fur. In the background, the sound of tom-toms. A tribal initiation rite. Drums, dancing, trances. Then Ravel's \"Bolero\". Clint Eastwood saying \"make my day\". Suddenly, and with a big yell, Mark comes. \nMARK Aahh! \nINT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.      DAY Vera is still there, reading her book. The clerk looks at his watch. \nCLERK They've been in there a long time. \nVERA Yes, some people can do that. \nHe does not get it. \nCLERK Do you want another coffee? \nShe gets up and starts to get dressed. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, we did really good stuff today. You were fantastic. You're a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record. You should be pleased. \nMARK Was I really inside you? \nCHERYL You were really and truly inside me. \nMARK For how long? \nCHERYL Five or six seconds. \nMARK Is that all? \nCHERYL That's a long time for some people. You were pretty excited. I don't know what you were thinking about. \nMARK I'm sorry, I couldn't tell one thing from another. It was all a jumble of sensations. \nCHERYL Well, you definitely achieved penetration. It was penis-vagina all the way. And you definitely get an A for orgasm. \nShe is ready to go. She comes over to Mark and kisses him on the cheek. \nMARK Did you come? \nCHERYL No, Mark, I didn't. \nMARK Can we try for that next time? \nShe hesitates for a moment. \nCHERYL If that's what you want. \nMARK Yes, that's what I want. \nCHERYL Okay then. \nINT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY Laura is on the phone to Cheryl. \nLAURA How's it going? \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY Cheryl is at her desk. \nCHERYL He reads too many books. He has it in his head that after meeting three times, we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm. Boom! Just like that. \nINT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY LAURA That's very funny. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY CHERYL I guess. Yes, it is. \nLAURA (V.O.) What do you think of him? \nCheryl thinks. \nINT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY LAURA I said, what do you think of him? \nCHERYL (V.O.) I like him. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT Father Brendan approaches and arrives at the front door. He rings. Rod lets him in. \nINT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT Mark is in his iron lung. Father Brendan, wearing civilian clothes, comes in with a 6 pack of beer. \nShe puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the house. She is visibly affected. \n120   OMITTED                                                     120 \n121   OMITTED                                                     121 EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.   DAY From behind, we see Vera wheeling Mark in his gurney. ANOTHER FEMALE FIGURE creeps up beside Vera and whispers in her ear, all unbeknownst to Mark. The other female figure takes over from Vera, who trails along, a few feet behind. Mark remains unaware. He has a new and different-looking shirt, even more out there than the previous one? \nMARK Do you think she'll like the shirt? \nAMANDA I like it. Does that count? \nMark can barely believe it. \nMARK Amanda? \nEXT.   PARK.   DAY They are stopped at a park bench. Vera is hovering in the background, out of earshot. \nMARK It's been a while. \nAMANDA I know. I'm sorry. I'm going to Germany. I wanted to say goodbye to you before I left. \nMARK Why are you going to Germany? \nAMANDA To study German. \nMARK For how long? \nAMANDA One or two years maybe. But we should keep in touch. \nMARK But why go to Germany? It's the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden. \nShe laughs, then smiles quietly, then touches him. \nAMANDA You could always make me laugh. I love you, Mark. I really do. \nMark's face is a picture of anguish and confusion. \nMARK Really? \nINT. SIDE CHAPEL.     DAY MARK Yes, I love you, but not in that way. I love you, but I'm not in love with you. Blah, blah, blah. You know how it goes. \nMark lets out a deep, meaningful sigh. For a time, he and Father Brendan maintain a respectful silence. \nEXT.   PARK.   DAY AMANDA I think it's great what you're doing with this surrogate lady. \nShe leans over and kisses Mark on the lips. \nMARK It could have been you. \nAMANDA It could have been, but it wasn't. \nINT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY MARK I had this faint hope that she would show the merest hint of jealousy. It shows you how na\u00efve I am. (MORE) \nMARK (CONT'D) The fact that I was no longer a virgin, that I was a `made man', so to speak, made no difference to her at all. \nEXT.   MOTEL.    DAY Cheryl's car is in the parking lot. We see her draw the blinds. \nINT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.    DAY Clerk takes two beers from a mini-bar and hands one to Vera. \nVERA Thanks. \nMARK Then afterwards, there was this moment, this glimpse of an awful sadness to come. \nFather Brendan closes his eyes and nods knowingly. \n135   OMITTED                                                  135 \n136   OMITTED                                                  136 \nEXT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT The Volvo is parked out front. The envelope is still on the dash. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.      NIGHT Cheryl is dictating. \nCHERYL Mark achieved an erection as soon as I started to suck on him. He did the controlled breathing, as I had suggested, and I was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily. \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY We see Mark's face from Cheryl's POV. His eyes are still closed. \nMARK Is it in? Is it really in? \nCHERYL Yes, it's really in. \nWe hear Mark's thoughts. \nMARK (V.0.) I couldn't believe it. \nWe hear the sound of typing. \nINT.    MARK'S PLACE.      DAY Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we can see the title of the piece: \n\"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\" Page 8. \nMARK (V.O.) I was finally there. Too soon, I came. But she kept holding me inside her. Then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face... \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we have ever seen it. \nMARK (V.O.) ... as though an all-day itch were finally being scratched. Letting me go, she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders and kissed my chest. This act of affection moved me deeply. \nCheryl's actions follow Mark's description. \nINT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY Mark is with Father Brendan. \nMARK I almost wept. No-one had ever kissed me there before. It was so unexpected and so natural. \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on the lips, light and lingering. As soon as there is enough space between them, he whispers to her. \nMARK I love you. \nShe whispers back. \nCHERYL I love you, too. \nMARK Did you come? \nCHERYL Yes. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.       NIGHT Cheryl continues dictating. \nCHERYL Mark is breathing well and learning to pace himself. There is no real physical impediment to a variety of sexual activities, given the right sort of partner. His deeper emotional needs are outside the scope of my potential involvement. \nCheryl pauses, then goes on. \nMARK Or, what? \nCHERYL Or, we could stop now. \nMARK You mean, make this the last session? \nCHERYL Yes. \nThere is a pregnant pause. \nMARK What do you think we should do? \nCHERYL It's not we, it's you, Mark. It's up to you. \nMARK I want to know how you feel. \nCHERYL That doesn't come in to it. \nMARK Yes, it does. I don't just write poems to anyone. \nCHERYL Mark, what do you want me to say? How much I was touched by that? How special this has been to me? Is that going to help you? No, it's going to make things worse. \nMARK You mean to say, come the sixth session that will be it? \nCHERYL Yes, that will be it. I explained that the first time we met. \nMark has a serious and painful moment. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, it's also hard for me to think about it. \nMARK Then maybe we should pull the plug now. \nCHERYL I think maybe we should. It's only going to get harder. I guess you might as well save the money. Maybe buy yourself a nice futon. \nA LITTLE LATER. \nCheryl is getting dressed. Mark watches pensively. She pauses and looks at him. He keeps a brave face. There is a knock on the door. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Just a moment. \nShe and Mark make eye contact for the last time. They manage to smile at each other. \nMARK (V.O.) I desperately wanted to feel that because of Cheryl, my life had changed. But it hadn't. \nApart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long mirror. \nCHERYL Bye, Mark \nMARK (V.O.) Bye. \nAs Cheryl goes out, Vera comes in. \nVERA Everything all right? \nCHERYL He did great. See you. I'm sorry, I have to run. \nVERA See you. \nVera walks in and closes the door behind her. \nCHERYL I don't think you'd understand. \nMIKVAH LADY You can try me. \nCHERYL Okay. I'm a housewife. \nMIKVAH LADY Why shouldn't I understand? \nCHERYL I guess I was mistaken. \nCheryl steps towards the pool. \nMIKVAH LADY I see you're very comfortable with being naked. \nShe takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water. \nCHERYL That has never been one of my problems. \nMIKVAH LADY Sometimes new brides come with their mothers. Do I have to take this off? Can I please leave this on? They've never been naked before. No honey, it all has to come off. \nCHERYL And it does? \nCheryl takes another step into the water. \nMIKVAH LADY And it does. They stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves. Nothing to hide behind. This is your body. This is the body that God crafted for you. \nCheryl immerses herself up to her chest. \nMIKVAH LADY (CONT'D) Immerse completely. Go completely under the water, without touching the walls or anything. \nShe immerses completely. We see her under the water. She hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same time, there is a look of elation in her eyes. \nCHERYL (V.O.) Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now. \nINT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes. \nCHERYL (V.O.) This is your body. \nA few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the mirror flicker over his face. \nMARK (V.O.) So this is the body that someone was able to love. Not quite as bad as I thought. \nINT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR.   DAY Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the ceiling from Mark's point of view. We also hear the sound of rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice. \nVOICE Mark, can you hear me? Open your eyes. \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   DAY Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a volunteer called SUSAN in the room with him. \nSUSAN They'll be letting you go today. Whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged, so you'll have at least one back-up system. \nMARK How close was I? \nSUSAN To what? \nMARK You know, to that tunnel thing and the light, and the voice saying don't go near the light. \nSUSAN Is that what you remember? \nMARK No. I assume I passed out. Before that, I remember feeling sorry for myself. \nMARK The best. \nAMBULANCE OFFICER Good to be alive, huh? \nEXT. HOSPITAL.      DAY We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of view of the departing ambulance. \nMARK (V.O.) I met Susan five years before I died. She was the love of my life. We had the same priorities, baseball pretty much came first, and we wrote each other mushy poems. I never expected it, nor did she, but that's often the way things turn out. \nINT.   MARK'S PLACE.        DAY Rod shows Father Brendan into Mark's room. \nFather Brendan sits in a chair next to Mark's iron lung. \nFATHER BRENDAN That was quite something. What do you propose to do for an encore? \nMARK Yep, I almost found out the big secret. But here I am, back with the living. If there is another place, then I think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back. \nFATHER BRENDAN And welcome back. \nMARK And thank you for coming to visit. \nFATHER BRENDAN I know it's been awhile since we talked about this... About Cheryl. At the time, you seemed to feel so badly about her... or about it? \nMARK I no longer feel like that. \nFather Brendan is rather taken by surprise. \nFATHER BRENDAN Oh? That's good to hear. In the end, you're glad that you did it? \nMARK Yes, I am. In fact, at this point in time, I feel very blessed. \nFATHER BRENDAN Blessed? \nMARK Yes, blessed. They put me on this new anti-depressant and now I can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view. \nFather Brendan looks truly amazed. \nMARK (CONT'D) It takes about six weeks to kick in, but when it does, you can really tell the difference. \nFATHER BRENDAN Hey, that's great. \nMark grins. \nMARK I'm pulling your leg, Father. I'm not on drugs. I have a girlfriend. \nFATHER BRENDAN You're kidding me. A real girlfriend? \nMARK A very real girlfriend. She adores me. She'll do anything for me. And I can get pretty kinky sometimes, believe you me. Her name is Susan. \nFATHER BRENDAN I'm flabbergasted. Is she pretty? \nMARK She sure is. FATHER BRENDAN Has she got a sister? \nMARK As a matter of fact... FATHER BRENDAN I'm kidding. MARK No, you're not. Anyway, we're starting a publishing company together. \nFather Brendan smiles and shakes his head. \nFATHER BRENDAN Here I was, all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn - that's supposed to be my specialty - and now I can just throw away that little speech. \nMARK No, no. Please make the little speech. I'd love to hear it. 89A. \n", "test1_input": "LAURA Did you ever discuss sex with your parents? \nMARK No. That would have been unthinkable. \nLAURA Why? \nMARK That's the way they saw the world. It wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex. No-one did. It was never discussed. As far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there. \nLaura listens. She is pretty in a dark, angular way. A phone on her desk rings. \nLAURA Sorry about that. \nShe walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back. She has a noticeable limp. \nMARK What's that from? \nLAURA Cerebral palsy. \nMARK You'd hardly notice. \nLAURA People notice. It's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic. \nMARK I find that hard to believe in your case. \nLAURA Well, you better believe it. \nMARK So, what sort of chance do you give me? \nLAURA Of achieving your romantic fantasy? Very small to minute. \nMARK Look, there's no need to pull any punches. You can be as direct as you like with me. \nShe smiles. \nLAURA Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist. I try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed. Your problem, I understand, is that you have never had sex. \nMARK That's correct. \nLAURA Would I be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate? \nMARK Correct. \nLAURA Has anyone done it for you? \nMARK No. \nLAURA Have you ever asked anyone? \nMARK Not specifically. I asked someone to marry me. She declined. Does that come close to masturbation? \nLAURA You know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually. There are people called sex surrogates. \nMARK Oh? \nLAURA Psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients, even if it seems like a good idea. Sex surrogates don't have that limitation. \nMARK Would this be covered by my medical benefits? \nLAURA Unfortunately, no. You'd have to pay the full fee, whatever that was. \n", "test1_true": "LAURA Yes Mark, you would be paying for sex. But the person you would be paying is not a hooker. She is a highly trained and sensitive professional, who is not motivated by money. Just as I'm not. In fact, you can think of a surrogate as an extension of me. Do I seem like a hooker to you? \nMark thinks. \n31A   OMITTED                                          31A \n31B   INT. LAURA'S OFFICE. DAY                         31B \nMark comes back to reality. MARK What sort of cost would I be looking at? \nLAURA It depends how many sessions you need. \nMARK Say, one, just to try it and see if I like it. \nLAURA I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way. It's a process. You have to be patient with yourself. There can be quite a lot of talking involved. \nMARK I've set aside $500. Do you think that would cover things? \nLAURA Oh yes, that's ample. So, what do you think? \nINT. CHURCH.   DAY Rod wheels Mark into the church. \nINT. SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY Mark waits in the little side chapel. Father Brendan enters. \nFATHER BRENDAN Hi, good to see you. How are things? \nMARK Things are sort of confusing at the moment. I would appreciate your advice, as a friend, if you know what I mean. \nFather Brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to Mark. \nFATHER BRENDAN Sure, and I understand what you mean. \nMARK Do you remember at one point you suggested I might see a therapist? \nFATHER BRENDAN Yes. \nMARK Well, one way or another, it's a long story, I ended up seeing a therapist, a particular sort of therapist, a sex therapist. \nFATHER BRENDAN Uh-huh. \nMARK My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan. Sometimes I ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant. (MORE) \nMARK (CONT'D) All I feel is shame and mortification, while other men, apparently, get pleasure. I'm sorry if I sound angry. \nFATHER BRENDAN Don't worry about it. Go on. \nMark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece, then goes on. \nMARK This therapist suggested I could work with a sexual specialist, have sex with someone known as a sex surrogate, who would be sensitive to my special needs. I've been giving it some thought. \nFather Brendan interrupts him. \nFATHER BRENDAN Hold on. What do you mean \"have sex\"? MARK Well, I don't really know how to describe... \nFATHER BRENDAN Sorry, that wasn't what... I mean, are we talking about sexual intercourse? MARK I think so. \nFATHER BRENDAN Outside marriage?

DAY Mark is in the side chapel with Father Brendan. \nMARK I did it again. This time, I ejaculated on her thigh. \nFather Brendan winces. \nMARK (CONT'D) I felt cursed, that the whole enterprise was cursed. It seemed like a totally just punishment. God wasn't actually denying my sexuality. He was merely pointing out to me how useless it was. \nFATHER BRENDAN It's amazing to me how often God is brought into the sex act. I understand that even amongst non- believers, the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is \"Oh, God!\" \n70   OMITTED                                                      70 \n71   OMITTED                                                      71 INT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY Cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed. \nCHERYL Okay, I don't want to hear any more about God cursing you. I want the credit. It was my overpowering beauty that did it. It took you by surprise. Now, where were we? \nMARK What do you mean, where were we? \nCHERYL I'm going to touch you... I'm touching you... and when we both feel you're aroused, then I'm going to guide you into my vagina. \nMARK Is there anything I need to do? \nCHERYL Close your eyes, feel your body, that's all you need to do. \nMark closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he sees the saintly figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church with the afternoon sun blazing through. An equally saintly, but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning. \nWhen he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in a Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way. It is a struggle for her, but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable position for intercourse. Suddenly, he panics. \nMARK It won't fit. It's not going to fit. \nCHERYL No, Mark, it will fit just fine. \nMARK No, it's dangerous. It's too big. \nCHERYL It's not too big. Relax. \nMARK It won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too risky. \nCHERYL Please, stop this. I promise you, nothing bad will happen. Now, let's try again while you're still hard. \nShe attempts to guide him in again. Mark grimaces, makes a strange noise. We realize that he has just ejaculated again involuntarily. \nMARK Shit! \nINT.   BATHROOM.   DAY Cheryl steps out of the shower. \n", "test2_true": "MARK I'm really sorry. \nCHERYL Stop being sorry. And stop reading those stupid sex manuals. \nShe snuggles up beside Mark. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) We still have some time.

NIGHT Cheryl's Volvo is parked in its usual spot out front. There is one light on in the house. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT Cheryl is at her desk, dictating her notes. She also has a notepad with some jottings. \nCHERYL Mark seemed to be at his most relaxed when I sucked his penis. At the moment he is fixated on penis- vagina and his anxiety is focused around that. The root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion. He believes he doesn't deserve sex. He believes he is responsible for his little sister's death at the age of seven, because his mother was too busy looking after him. \nINT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.   DAY A copy of Cheryl's notes comes through on Laura's fax machine. We hear her familiar limp as she comes over to collect them. She reads the notes with interest. \nCHERYL (V.O.)

He has   never seen female genitalia before   and seems quite frightened by the   idea. \nINT.   SIDE CHAPEL.       DAY Mark and Father Brendan are in the little chapel. \nMARK I'm sorry to lay all this on you, Father. My worry now is that it's never going to happen. I'm never going to have intercourse with Cheryl, or any other woman. Maybe intercourse would prove I was an adult. Maybe I don't want to cross that line. Maybe this was a bad idea. \nFATHER BRENDAN Do you want to know what I think? \nMARK Please. \nFATHER BRENDAN I'd forget the psychobabble. I grew up on a farm. It even takes the animals a few times to get it right. Can I suggest you try and enjoy it more? Don't worry about the technical stuff. You're a poet. Be romantic. \nEXT. CLOTHING STORE.

That coffee is pretty hot. \nMARK Thanks. \nWAITER You're welcome. \nThe waiter leaves.

She is looking gorgeous today. \nCHERYL Then why are we here? \nMARK I just want to be seen with you in public. I find that as sexy as anything we've done so far. \nHe sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes. 62A. \nCHERYL I'm glad you enjoy looking, after all. \nMARK I want people to say \"Who's the guy with the blonde? How did he get so lucky?\" CHERYL Or so rich. \nMARK Okay, if some old girlfriend from school you hadn't seen for years turned up suddenly, like right now, how would you introduce me? As your boyfriend? CHERYL No, as my husband. Why not go all the way. \nMARK Really? CHERYL Does that shock you? \nMARK Yes. CHERYL Then I guess it would shock her as well. \nMARK Who?

Give it to me. \nJOSH You're not getting it. \nCHERYL This is absolutely none of your fucking business. \nJOSH You're still not getting it. I threw it out. \nCHERYL You didn't. \nJOSH I fucking did. \nTony arrives home from school. As he comes in, his parents fall silent. He realizes he has walked in on an argument. He looks at both of them. \nTONY What's up? \nA LITTLE LATER. The three of them are sitting round the dining table eating dinner in total silence. The hostility between Cheryl and Josh is palpable. When Josh finally does speak, he addresses Tony. \nJOSH Would you please ask your mother to pass the salt? \nTONY Cheryl, would you please pass the salt? \nCheryl glares at Tony and goes on with her meal. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    NIGHT Cheryl is at the dining table, with her recorder and file in front of her, plus a late-night snack. \nCHERYL Mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behaviour. This is not unusual after first successful intercourse, but I think he is especially susceptible. He cannot help seeing me as the multi- functional, all-purpose woman, mother, sister, schoolmistress, whore, lover and best friend. At the same time, his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished. \nINT.   BEDROOM.   NIGHT Josh crawls into bed with Cheryl. She is still awake. He snuggles up to her. \nJOSH I'm sorry. I really upset you before. \nCHERYL No, you didn't. I'm fine. \nJOSH You sure? \nCHERYL Yes, I promise. \nJOSH Really? 64A. \nCHERYL Yes, I've come around to your point of view. You were right. You're generally right about these things. \nJOSH It was quite a nice poem. I mean, nothing astounding, but heartfelt, at least. \nCHERYL Josh, I need to go to sleep. Everything's good. \nJOSH Okay. Good night. \nThey kiss. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT Cheryl rummages around in the kitchen garbage. She finds nothing. She storms off to the laundry, flings open a cupboard, pokes around and comes up with a flashlight. \nEXT.   CHERYL'S BACK YARD.   NIGHT Cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard. Holding the flashlight between her teeth, she rummages around in the outdoor trash bin. Finally, she finds what she is looking for. An envelope. She takes the poem out of the envelope and reads it. \nCHERYL Let me touch you with my words. For my hands lie limp as empty gloves. \nShe goes over to the back steps, sits down and continues reading. \n", "test3_id": 3197}

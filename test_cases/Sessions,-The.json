I'm always in somebody's way, I thought, the sun in my eyes. \nWe sense Mark's deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and the sun warms his face. \nMARK (V.O.) As she glided through crowds of lives She couldn't leave me lying there Dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence. \nINT.   BATHROOM.   NIGHT Amanda and her boyfriend MATT, are sharing the tub. \nMATT Do you touch him? \nAMANDA I do everything. Any other questions? \nMATT You don't have to be so defensive. I'm not about to get jealous. \nAMANDA Why not? He's a much nicer person than you are. \nShe gets out of the bath suddenly. \nINT.    MARK'S PLACE.      DAY Amanda is shaving Mark. \nMARK What does your boyfriend think of me? \nAMANDA He's an asshole. It doesn't matter what he thinks of you. \nMARK I'm interested in the opinion of an asshole. \nAMANDA He thinks you're some kind of Svengali, and that you're going to hypnotise me into your cult. \nMARK He's right. \nAMANDA He says he can already see changes. \nShe finishes shaving him and cleans him up. His eyes feast on every detail of her face. \nCut to somewhere at night, Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror- ball lighting. \nMARK (V.O.) So with her gentle fearless heart She took me in. I thrived in her garden And wanted more. \nA16   EXT. STREET NEAR CLOTHING STORE.

DAY Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store, stopping from time to time to take something down from the shelf. She picks out a shirt. \nAMANDA This you must have. \nAs she leans over to show it to him, Mark doesn't seem to be listening. He whispers to her. \nMARK I love you. \nShe says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then puts the shirt back. They continue round the store in thoughtful silence and avoid eye contact with each other. We sense from the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a beautiful friendship. \n17    OMITTED                                                      17 INT. SIDE CHAPEL.   DAY Mark and Father Brendan are huddled together in the little chapel. \nFATHER BRENDAN Did she reciprocate your feelings? \nMARK She didn't seem to. 11A. \nFATHER BRENDAN Sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions. \nMARK Well, in case she didn't get it the first time, I told her again that I was in love with her, and wanted to marry her, thinking it might swing things. \n", "test1_true": "MARK Yes. She left. \nThey sit in silence for a while. Father Brendan seems to be at something of a loss. \nFATHER BRENDAN I wish I knew what to say. I mean, welcome to the human race. Every day someone breaks someone else's heart. And as I said, I'm here for you. I just wish I had something more useful to offer. All I have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with. Have you ever thought of discussing your feelings with a therapist? \nMARK Not as yet. Father, I think I need a hug. \nAfter a moment of surprise, Father Brendan rises to the occasion. He seems to know how to move Mark gently and efficiently. They hug. \nEXT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY Rod is in the front yard picking up the newspaper. He sees VERA, Chinese, mid-20s, a sensible type, approaching Mark's front door. \nROD Hi. Vera? \nVERA Yes. \nHe offers his hand. \nROD I'm Rod. I do four to twelve. \nINT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY Vera sits in the same spot where Amanda was interviewed, but without the same aura, although she is far from ugly. \nMARK Have you had any experience? \nVERA Some. \nShe is reserved and unsmiling. Mark seems disinterested in the whole process. The phone rings. They both look at it. \nMARK Would you get that, please. \nVera picks up the phone and answers a little hesitantly. \nVERA Hullo. \nAfter a few moments, she turns to Mark. \nVERA (CONT'D) It's Sandy, from Pacific News Service. \nMARK Could you press that button and put it on the speakerphone. \nShe does as she is asked with perfect efficiency. \nMARK (CONT'D) Hi, Sandy. \nSANDY (V.O.) Hi, Mark, how you doing? \nMARK I'm good. I have a new attendant. She answered the phone. Her name's Vera. \nSANDY (V.O.) Welcome, Vera. \nVERA Thank you. \nSANDY (V.O.)

I said, stop thinking about it. \nMARK Beautiful weather. \nShe steps up to ring the bell, then hesitates. There is something of a hubbub coming from inside. Both she and Mark can hear it clearly. \nINT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY The doorbell rings, amidst a loud background chatter. We reveal a ROOMFUL OF WOMEN, gathered for some intense group activity of some kind. Carmen buzzes her way to the front door in her wheelchair. She opens it. She has an expression of horror. \nCARMEN Oh, my God, I forgot! Oh, Mark, I'm so sorry. \nThe entire roomful of women stare at Mark and Vera. In the background we see Cheryl's car pull up. \nEXT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY Cheryl, Mark and Vera are by the car. Mark looks grim. \nVERA She was very apologetic. \nThey are all shaking their heads. Cheryl has a thought. \nCHERYL Look, it may not be exactly what we had in mind, but I noticed there's quite a nice motel just a couple of blocks from here. Maybe it's worth checking out. \nINT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.    DAY Mark and Cheryl wait outside while Vera goes in. \nVERA Have you got anything on the ground floor? \nThe MOTEL CLERK is also Chinese. He looks at the rack of keys. \nCLERK I've got a single. \nVERA How much? \nCLERK Thirty-five plus tax. \nVERA My boss is the gentleman in the gurney. (MORE) \nVERA (CONT'D) He's supposed to be having a therapy session right now, but the facility we normally use had a scheduling mix-up. We only need the room for two hours.

MOTEL ROOM.   DAY We see Cheryl from the breasts up. We hear violent coughing from down below. \nMARK (V.O.) I'm   choking \nCheryl moves away. We realize she has been perched astride his face, more or less. The coughing continues. Mark looks a bit panicked. \nMARK The mouth-piece. \nCheryl locates the mouth-piece to his oxygen supply and puts it between his lips. After a few breaths he is relatively relaxed. She lies down beside him. \nCHERYL I guess that one's off the menu until further notice. \nMark finally lets go of the mouth-piece. He looks melancholy. She does not fail to notice. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Come on, lighten up, will you. \nMark smiles. He seems to be lost in some memory. \nMARK Pony girl, Pony girl, Won't you be my pony girl? \nHe looks at Cheryl. \nMARK (CONT'D) That was what my father used to sing to my little sister, Karin. That was before she died. She was kind of a sad little girl. It didn't do much good. I'm really sorry that the last time I saw her, I fought with her. I made her cry. \nMark's eyes begin to look teary. \nMARK (CONT'D) My parents could have left me in the nursing home, you know. They found out the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was 18 months. So they took me home.

She is looking gorgeous today. \nCHERYL Then why are we here? \nMARK I just want to be seen with you in public. I find that as sexy as anything we've done so far. \nHe sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes. 62A. \nCHERYL I'm glad you enjoy looking, after all. \nMARK I want people to say \"Who's the guy with the blonde? How did he get so lucky?\" CHERYL Or so rich. \nMARK Okay, if some old girlfriend from school you hadn't seen for years turned up suddenly, like right now, how would you introduce me? As your boyfriend? CHERYL No, as my husband. Why not go all the way. \nMARK Really? CHERYL Does that shock you? \nMARK Yes. CHERYL Then I guess it would shock her as well. \nMARK Who? CHERYL My old school friend that's going to come along any moment. \nMARK You really can picture me as husband material? CHERYL As long as we're pretending, sure.

DAY Josh walks unhurriedly to the letter box at the front gate and collects the mail. As he flips through the envelopes, he stops at one which is addressed to Cheryl, sniffs it, then opens it. It contains a sheet of paper on which is typed what seems to be a poem. He reads it with interest, which develops into mild shock. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   DAY Cheryl and Josh are in the kitchen, arguing. \nJOSH You said yourself, it's not supposed to get personal. \nCHERYL That's another thing altogether. What I want to know is where do you get off opening my mail? \n", "test3_true": "CHERYL Even less reason to open it. Where is it? Give it to me. \nJOSH You're not getting it. \nCHERYL This is absolutely none of your fucking business. \nJOSH You're still not getting it. I threw it out. \nCHERYL You didn't. \nJOSH I fucking did. \nTony arrives home from school. As he comes in, his parents fall silent. He realizes he has walked in on an argument. He looks at both of them. \nTONY What's up? \nA LITTLE LATER. The three of them are sitting round the dining table eating dinner in total silence. The hostility between Cheryl and Josh is palpable. When Josh finally does speak, he addresses Tony. \nJOSH Would you please ask your mother to pass the salt? \nTONY Cheryl, would you please pass the salt? \nCheryl glares at Tony and goes on with her meal. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    NIGHT Cheryl is at the dining table, with her recorder and file in front of her, plus a late-night snack. \nCHERYL Mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behaviour. This is not unusual after first successful intercourse, but I think he is especially susceptible. He cannot help seeing me as the multi- functional, all-purpose woman, mother, sister, schoolmistress, whore, lover and best friend. At the same time, his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished. \nINT.   BEDROOM.   NIGHT Josh crawls into bed with Cheryl. She is still awake. He snuggles up to her. \nJOSH I'm sorry. I really upset you before. \nCHERYL No, you didn't. I'm fine. \nJOSH You sure? \nCHERYL Yes, I promise. \nJOSH Really? 64A. \nCHERYL Yes, I've come around to your point of view. You were right. You're generally right about these things. \nJOSH It was quite a nice poem. I mean, nothing astounding, but heartfelt, at least. \nCHERYL Josh, I need to go to sleep. Everything's good. \nJOSH Okay. Good night. \nThey kiss. \nINT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT Cheryl rummages around in the kitchen garbage. She finds nothing.

Holding the flashlight between her teeth, she rummages around in the outdoor trash bin. Finally, she finds what she is looking for. An envelope. She takes the poem out of the envelope and reads it. \nCHERYL Let me touch you with my words.

Sonny rushes in.  The phone rings.  He picks it up. 
SONNY Hello.  Hello, Leon. 
LEON Hello, Sonny. 
SONNY How are you doing? 
LEON Well... I'm out of the hospital. 
SONNY (pleased) Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out? 
LEON I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you. 
SONNY Well... huh... 
LEON Ooohh... 
SONNY Oh... huh... how you feeling? 
LEON I'm really shakey. 
SONNY Well, you know... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up. 
LEON Yeah.  It was terrible. 
SONNY That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. 
LEON You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm...  you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? 
SONNY Yeah... 
LEON You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. 
SONNY (pensive) So... that sure is something. 
LEON Yeah.  So how are you? 
SONNY (chuckling) Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am! 
LEON (chuckling) Yeah... I know. 
SONNY I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying. 
LEON What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? 
SONNY What are you talking about? 
LEON What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life? I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? 
SONNY Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit. 
LEON No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head... 
SONNY I don't know what I'm doing. 
LEON (annoyed) Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people.  This death business... I'm sorry! 
SONNY I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say? 
LEON (indifferent to Sonny) I'm sorry... 
SONNY I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that...  and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. 
LEON (excited) But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. 
SONNY (getting louder) All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it. 
LEON Well... 
SONNY I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maybe this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... 
LEON What trip? 
SONNY I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out.  And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want. 
LEON I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going? 
SONNY I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man! 
LEON You're crazy. 
SONNY That's it. 
LEON You're really crazy. 
SONNY I know! 
LEON Where you gonna go? 
SONNY Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.

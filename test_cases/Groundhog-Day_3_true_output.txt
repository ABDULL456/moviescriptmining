(OVERWHELMED) Nobody's ever done this for me. Not even a drawing. It's beautiful. 
PHIL This is how I see you. When it all gets too much, I just close my eyes and there you are-- just like this. Take it home and keep it in the freezer. Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into each others eyes. 
PHIL This one's for the Frog Prince. 
RITA What? 
PHIL Nothing. They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss. 
PHIL Will you come with me? Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming each other in the cold night air. 
RITA (looks back at the ice 
SCULPTURE) We're just going to leave her? 
PHIL It doesn't matter. Really, it doesn't. They kiss again.

CLOSE UP - THE CLOCK The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence. No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing. Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep under the covers. 
PHIL 
(DISBELIEVING) It's not true. It's not. It can't be true. Rita? Rita! 
RITA 
(STRETCHING 
LUXURIOUSLY) Mmmm. Morning. Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses. 
PHIL You're here! My god! I can't believe you're here! 
RITA Glad to see you, too. 
PHIL No! It's happened. Don't you get it? It's tomorrow! It's -- Phil turns on the radio. 
DEEJAY . . . still shoveling put the highways, but if you're walking, it's a beautiful day. 
S IDEKICK Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned e ve r yt h in g up-- 
DEEJAY --except your mouth. Phil kisses the radio. 
PHIL I love those guys. 
RITA Are you always this jolly in the morning? Phil runs to the window and looks out. 
HIS POV - THE STREET The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids are throwing snowballs. 
PHIL No groundhog! Rita! They're all gone! 
RITA You must've had some dream. Phil stops, thinks. 
PHIL Did I just dream it? Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only pajama bottoms. 
RITA Phi l? Phil! Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few bars. 
PHIL (O.C.) Yeah!!!! Phil runs back into the room. 
PHIL It really happened! You're really here! He pounces on Rita again. 
PHIL You're really actually here. 
RITA 
(LAUGHING) I'm here, I'm here! They kiss, passionately, hungrily. 
PHIL Let's go! He scoops her up in his arms. 
RITA Where're we going? 
PHIL Anywhere! Everywhere!

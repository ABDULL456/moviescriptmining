Same time. 
Henry and Fay are making mad, passionate love, oblivious to the world around them. 
INT. GRIM HOUSE DAY -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon drags Mary through the house. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Same time. 
Henry and Fay fuck. 
EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon drags Mary out the kitchen door and into the yard, looking desperately for help. He reaches the street, her limp body hanging grotesquely before him, and looks helplessly up and down the block. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY 
Simon, Henry, Mr Deng, Fay, Gnoc and Bu√±uel stand with Father Hawkes at the grave. 
FATHER HAWKES Let us pray. Lord, grant that peace be within reach for our friend, Mary. May the pain and confusion she endured on earth be fought through in the after life, so that she may enter the Kingdom of Heaven and live in the light of God. Amen. 
He sprinkles holy water on the coffin and they all drop carnations at the grave. Simon and Fay remain there looking down at the coffin. Henry waits for them a few yards away, wishing he could help, but feeling out of place. 
EXT. JUNKYARD -- DAY 
Simon is back working on the garbage truck. He collects garbage and throws it in the truck as Henry, who is just along for the ride, hangs from the side of the truck and pulls the lever whenever Simon tells him to. 
HENRY So I was a janitor! So what? 
SIMON But Angus James said he didn't even know you! 
Henry shrugs and qualifies... 
HENRY Well, I mean, we weren't like bosom buddies or anything. But we used to talk sometimes. In the elevator. In the morning. He said he liked my ideas. Being a janitor's a good job if you're a writer. Especially the night shift; all that time to think and develop my ideas. 
SIMON Do it. 
Henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed. 
SIMON Anyway, he hated my poem. 
HENRY Well, what the hell does he know? He wouldn't know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg. To hell with him! He's not the only publisher in the world! 
SIMON But nobody likes it. 
HENRY (smokes) It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded in his own land. Remember that. 
SIMON Do it. 
Henry is about to pull the lever again, but sees something in amongst the garbage... 
HENRY Hey, look, treasure! 
Henry steps down and leans over into the garbage. Simon joins him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray piece of machinery. 
HENRY What is this? 
SIMON Brass maybe. Some kinda copper. 
HENRY It's a ring. Jewelry. 
SIMON I think it's a gasket. A fitting from off of that old refrigerator over there. 
Henry puts it in his pocket, satisfied and Simon jumps on the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away. Henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction, but stops when he sees Pearl age seven. 
EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Henry comes up the street with Pearl age seven on his back. He walks into Vicky's yard and finds Warren lifting weights in the garage. 
HENRY Hey, Warren, I found Pearl wandering around by the garbage dump. 
WARREN He lost. 
HENRY Who lost? 
Warren rests. He sits up on the bench and takes a toke off the joint he has waiting. 
WARREN Congressman Feer. 
HENRY (realizing) Oh. Well, you know. Somebody's gotta lose. 
WARREN What's the fucking use. You make sacrifices. You try to be a decent human being. Try to contribute something meaningful to society. And what happens? They lose to a bunch of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups. I don't give a shit anymore. People deserve what they get. 
Henry pauses, then leads Pearl age seven towards the house. Warren lies back down and continues his lifting. 
INT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Moments later. 
Henry knocks on the door as he enters... 
HENRY Vicky? 
No answer. He comes in and finds her sitting on the couch with a drink. She's got a black eye.

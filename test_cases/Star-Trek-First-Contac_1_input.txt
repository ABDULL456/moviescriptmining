shows an exterior space shot. The image rapidly ZOOMS IN on the distant PHOENIX. The ship is racing through space. 
BORG QUEEN (reacts, to Data) Give me helm control. 
Data nods. Another console lights up. She moves to work it herself... 
223   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                223 
As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse speed. 
224   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       224 
As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st century JOYSTICK CONTROL. The ship is moving faster and faster, trembling now, a ROAR building. 
PICARD Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot... 
GEORDI I'm on it... 
The CABIN shakes a little. 
GEORDI The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort. 
PICARD Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second. 
WHOOSH! A weird DISTORTION passes through the cabin like a wave, then vanishes. 
GEORDI There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects! 
PICARD One minute to warp threshold... 
225   EXT. SPACE                                                 225 
The warp ship WHIPS by... and then a moment later, the ENTERPRISE ROARS into view, chasing the tiny ship. 
226   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       226 
Geordi glances out the window... does a double-take and looks back up in surprise... 
GEORDI Captain, the Enterprise! 
PICARD (taps combadge) Picard to Enterprise. (beat) Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me? 
No response. 
PICARD Their com system must still be down. 
GEORDI Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help. 
227   INT. BORG HIVE                                             227 
As before, the Queen floating above the helm control console. The warp ship is on the monitor, getting closer. 
DATA I have repaired the weapons array. Phasers are on-line. 
A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the warp ship. The Queen works the console. The crosshair moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship. She frowns. 
BORG QUEEN The targeting lock isn't working. 
Data looks puzzled. 
DATA I do not understand. The optical data network has been repaired, and all systems are functioning. 
The Queen works furiously, still can't get the crosshairs to lock onto the ship. 
BORG QUEEN Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons. 
DATA (thinks) The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow. 
BORG QUEEN Can you configure it? 
DATA I believe so. 
BORG QUEEN Do it. 
She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby console... and the restraints holding Data to the table are RELEASED. Two Borg drones move to him... as he stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized cable still attached to his head... 
228   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                228 
closing in on the tiny warp ship. It's like a shark chasing a guppy. 
229   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       229 
Ship SHAKING with power and acceleration. 
PICARD Approaching light speed...

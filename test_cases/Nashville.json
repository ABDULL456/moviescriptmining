NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY \nTRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building. \n3\tINT. AIRPORT - DAY \nNORMAN is attracted to large \u0093CONNIE WHITE\u0094 display. \n4\tINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nAt the entrance is another \"CONNIE WHITE\" display and from the jukebox we hear one of her songs. \nThe waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN. \nThere are several people at the counter with him, including GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them. \nA small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full or dishes. This is WADE. \nWADE (to SUELEEN) You want a ride into town? \nThey all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep \nCUT TO: \n12\tEXT. AIRPORT - DAY \nBarbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt. \n13\tINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nREESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane. \nPage Missing \n14A\tCONTINUED: \nTOM spots stews and goes to them \nTOM You ladies got room for a spare? \nSTEW Sure. \n14B\tNEW ANGLE \nL.A. JOAN is left in the dust. \nL.A. JOAN 'Bye... nice talking to you. \nGREEN sees his niece and walks over. \nGREEN Joan? \nShe turns. \nL.A. JOAN Did you see who that was? \nGREEN Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too. \nL.A. JOAN He is just wonderful. \nGREEN I'1l get your bag. \nCUT TO: \n15\tEXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY \nGLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps close to NORMAN. \nGLENN Am I late? \nNORMAN Late!  Oh, Jesus! \nHe runs off. \n16\tANOTHER ANGLE \nAs NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all shake hands. \nHAVEN Delbert, how are you? \nREESE I'm fine. This here is John Triplette. Triplette, like you to meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven Hamilton. \nHAVEN Good to meet you. (turns to BUD) Bud, have them move the horses. \nTRIPLETTE Pleasure \nREESE Where is she? \nHAVEN Still inside the plane posing for pictures and signing autographs. She's got a new album cut again. She'll be down in a minute. But she'll be late for the Opera if she doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on the walkie-talkie. \nBUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get anything. \nBUD They don't seem to be answering. The ambulance boys are here, though. Barnett always expects them to get there like a shot. That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going. \nHAVEN Thank you, Bud. \nBUD nods like he has been complimented. \n17\tANGLE TOWARD PLANE \nA wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in awe of the situation. \nATTENDANT Okay, let's get her to the wagon. \nA stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance speeds off, siren wailing. \nCUT TO: \n24\tEXT. FREEVAY TO NASHVILLE - DAY \n25\tTRICYCLE MAN \nleads the procession. \n26\tINT. GREEN'S CAR \nGREEN Eater's been asking for you. \nL.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor radio. \nL.A. JOAN Uh huh. \nGREEN She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday. \nL.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes. \nL.A. JOAN You know anything about the stations here? \nGREEN (hasn't heard) It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix. \nL.A. JOAN All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A. \nGREEN Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul. \nHe chuckles at his prepared joke. \nL.A. JOAN Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant. \nGREEN What did you say? \nL.A. JOAN I said, maybe I'll change my name again. \nGREEN I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers. \nL.A. JOAN But not unless Nashville really inspires me. \nGREEN Maybe you can look after me a little. \nL.A. JOAN That Tom sure is cute. \nCUT TO: \n27\tAMBULANCE \nspeeding by each vehicle. BARBARA JEAN and BARNETT are alone. \n28\tREPLACEMENT CAR \nbeing very piggish in its driving habits. \n29\tINT. HAVEN'S JEEP \nPEARL We had these two city boys come in last week. One or them said his Ford truck had cut off his foot. The other one said that wasn't true. Then the first said he looked just like Eddie Black when he said that... \nHAVEN Bud, would you be sure to get the oil changed? \nBUD Ya... where do you want me to take it? \nPEARL Do you remember Eddie Black? He had those blue eyes. \nHAVEN Where you always take it. There's nothing special about this time. \nPEARL And they started pounding on each other. But the one without the foot was strongest. \nHAVEN Bud, you're going to have to show up at the hospital tar me I gotta get back to that session. \nBUD Okay. Anything you want me to say? \nHAVEN Say I had to get back to the session. ~ God -- All school did for you, you can put in a thimble. \nPEARL The cops came through and broke it up. I finally just had to call Chet and say, 'Chet, get over here. There are two old bays here breaking up the furniture...' \nCUT TO: \nTRIPLETTE Oh -- \nREESE We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him? \nTRIPLETTE Well, I really think he's got a chance. \nREESE You do? \nTRIPLETTE Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new. \nREESE He ain't really new. \nTRIPLETTE He is to a lot of people. \nREESE He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago. \nTRIPLETTE You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority. \nREESE Where are you from? \nTRIPLETTE Southern California. \nREESE You always live there? \nTRIPLETTE Spent time in Arizona. Why? \nREESE Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars? \nTRIPLETTE I know a couple. \nREESE No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who? \nTRIPLETTE Ah... Peter Finch. \nREESE Who? \nTRIPLETTE Peter Finch -- he's English. \nREESE I never heard of him. Name somebody else. \nTRIPLETTE Ryan O'Neal. \nREESE You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them? \nTRIPLETTE Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff. \nREESE I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something? \nTRIPLETTE Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here. \nREESE I'll be dammed. \nCUT TO: \n33\tAIRPORT BUS \nGLENN is at the window. \"Connie White\" ads are present. \n34\tMOBILE HOME \nPart of normal traffic. It belongs to TOMMY BROWN, who lounges with four very black associates, playing serious poker. \n35\tINT. LINNEA'S CAR \nJoining the procession from an auxiliary route. With her is OPAL, who interviews LINNEA. \nOPAL Have your children been deaf since birth? \nLINNEA Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here. \nOPAL When did you start singing? \nLINNEA When I was little, in church. \nOPAL Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir? \nLINNEA Yes, it is -- \nOPAL Well, can you tell me why? \nLINNEA It just is. \nThe TRICYCLE MAN works his way through traffic. STAR has climbed from his truck and goes to help. ALBUQUESQUE takes advantage and runs off. \n41\tANGLE NEAR KENNY'S CAR \nIt overheats and explodes. KENNY gets out, carrying his violin case and starts to walk. ALBUQUERQUE spots him and steps near. \nALBUQUERQUE Hey, mind if I walk with ya? \nShe looks at his violin case. \nALBUQUERQUE You a musician? \nKENNY No. \nALBUQUERQUE Do you have people in Nashville? \nKENNY No -- Just coming to Nashville, that's all. \n42\tINT. AMBULANCE \nBARNETT is in a rage. The ATTENDANTS administer oxygen to BARBARA JEAN \nBARNETT I don't care. I pay you people twenty-five bucks an hour and keep you working steady. Now either go on or turn around. But move. \n43\tEXT. HIGHWAY \nThe ambulance passes all the vehicles, including the horse rigs. As he passes NORMAN'S limo: \nMARY Don't worry, Norman. There's no blood. Nobody's hurt. \nShe climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells for some workmen below to call the police. \n44\tANGLE AT DIESEL \nThe driver is hurt badly. TRICYCLE MAN and STAR are there. STAR looks up, relieved an ambulance is coming. His face drops as the ambulance speeds past and toward the city. \n45\tANGLE FURTHER BACK IN TRAFFIC \nALBUQUERQUE is walking with KENNY. She sees STAR returning to his truck. She ducks into the ivy. \nALBUQUERQUE Hurt my foot... \nSTAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots KSNNY. \nSTAR Have you seen a woman about so high? \nKENNY No. \nSTAR She had on high heels? \nKENNY No. \nSTAR Need a ride? \nKENNY nods \"yes\" and climbs in the pickup. \n46\tANGLE AT BRIDGE \nPeople are helping the injured driver. TRICYCLE MAN climbs on his machine and leaves, heading toward Nashville. \nCUT TO: \n47\tINT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON \nBARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE, BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is stifling. \nDOCTOR Barbara, I'd like to talk to you and Barnett alone. \nBARNETT Anything you say. \nHe turns to the visitors. \nBARNETT Doctor says you'll have to go on out now \nThere are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as the people start to leave. \nTRIPLETTE Excuse me, Barnett, how's she doing? \nBARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers who he is. He doesn't. \nTRIPLETTE I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South. \nDELBERT Monday night. \nMANAGER You want her to sing, too? \nSueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly. \nSUELEEN I can do benefits \nMANAGER (into phone) How much? \nDELBERT Twenty dollars for her and ten for you. \nThe MANAGER keeps looking at SUELEEN \nMANAGZR Well, do you want a blonde? \nDELBERT How does she look? \nMANAGER You know... blonde. \nDELBERT Okay, I'll get you your money. \nBoth hang up the telephones. \n52\tINT. DEMON'S DEN \nThe MANAGER carefully looks at SUELEEM. \nMANAGER I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit. \nSUELEEN Money's no object. \nShe kisses his cheek. He hates it. He writes on a piece of paper. \nMANAGER You go here Monday night and be there at eight sharp and look flashy you know what I mean? \nShe nods \"yes\" and takes the paper. \nMANAGER Are you sure you know what you're doing? \nSUELEEN Hundreds of times. \nMANAGER Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around. \nSUELEEN Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay. \nShe isn't convincing. \nMANAGER That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break. \nSUELEEN Thanks. You are just a wonderful person. \n53\tANOTHER ANGLE \nALBUQUERQUE enters.

They want to start in two weeks. \nTRIPLETTE Why? \nOPAL Why? \nTRIPLETTE What? \nOPAL What? Oh. A film. \nAt this point, HAVEN walks up. \nBARNETT Where'd you get the cake? \nThey are taken quite off guard. \nTRIPLETTE Someone gave it... Here, you want this... I'll... \nHAVEN No. \nSomebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is. \nHAVEN A little worried.

We can also HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying much in one language and she might just be talking to the OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive. \n108\tNEW ANGLE \nCONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and thanks her, handing her the flowers.

Finally, the bus door opens and BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and people come from stores and shops to hear. \nBARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another. \n179\tNEW ANGLE \nBARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE pulls his sleeve. \nBARNETT Well, for heaven's sake. You're just about everywhere, aren't you? \nTHIPLETTE I came out to see how you all were doing. \nBARNETT I think I should tell you I know why you're here. The answer is no ... we don't get involved in politics. \nTRIPLETTE (laughs good- naturedly) Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven. \nBARNETT Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen. \nTRIPLETTE I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out. \nBARNETT He knows better. \nTRIPLETTE Well, it's probably because it would help him. \nBARNETT How is that? \nTRIPLETTE Everybody likes to be as good as their word. \nBARNETT Whose word? \nTRIPLETTE His Word. \nBARNETT His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something? \nTRIPLETTE That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him? \nTRIPLETTE Nothing; Barnett. It's my job. \nBARNETT Your job, huh. \nHe removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he speaks. \nBARNETT She will not appear on the stage or support that Walker guy and you can't have any of his signs up while she sings. She'll be on first and out of the park before he shows up. There will be no pictures, no questions, no answers or tying her name up with his now or in the future to come. Any money she makes will go to the President of the United States. \nHe calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the statement. Then the secretary signs. \nBARNETT We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send her three songs over this afternoon. She'll be done about ten minutes after she starts and Walker better not show up till she's through. Now, get out of here. \nTRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary. \nMAN Barnett? \nBARNETT (sharply) What? \nMAN Well, Barnett, I have this terrific song I've been working on. It would be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like you to take a look at it. \nBARNETT looks at him suspiciously. \nBARNETT I'm very busy right now. (to secretary) Get me Haven. \nMAN It'll just take a minute. Here, I'll even hold it for you. \nBABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged. \nBARNETT I don't know where you got this, but something tells me you stole it and I hate thieves. \nThe MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- BARNETT yells after him. \nBARNETT Aren't you an engineer...?  I know you -- Don't you work at one of those cut a record places...? Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? Usually their last twenty-five... \nThe MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and hits the windshield with it.

And tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen. \nThey continue to walk past the many places. \nTRIPLETTE Have you ever done this before? \nShe shakes her head, \"no\" quite caught up in air. \nTRIPLETTE Well, it's not too hard. You'll sing whatever it is you want to sing. They'll applaud like crazy 'cause I can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. It really doesn't make much difference, really. But since you've never done this before, singing might help. \nThey are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the oven. \nTRIPLETTE Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise. \nSUELEEN (like a robot) I see. \nTRIPLETTE I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious. \nShe nods \"yes.\" \nTRIPLETTE Well, this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live. \n155\tNEW ANGLE \nThe waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef starts to carve the meat. We FOLLOW one of the waiters into the banquet hall. \n156\tINT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT \nIt is almost full. The pianist and the drummer are on the non- stage. At the far end of the roam, we SEE someone enter from the street, go to the sign and read it. \n157\tNEW ANGLE - DOORWAY AND CORRIDOR \nIt is ALBUQUERQUE reading \"banquet.\" The door to the room closes and she goes down another corridor and disappears. \n158\tINT. BANQUET ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe men have finished their dinner and SUELEEN finishes her song. The applause is thunderous. SUELEEN looks to the kitchen door. \n159\tANGLE AT KITCHEN DOOR \nTRIPLETTE is applauding like crazy. REESE in beside him. \n160\tANGLE AT SUELEEN \nShe blows kisses then runs to TRIPLETTE. \nSUELEEN Don't you think they'd just love another song instead? \nTRIPLETTE Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room. \nIt's too late. The ANNOUNCER speaks. \nANNOUNCER We're ready to striiippppp... for cash, gentlemen. The time has come to dig deep. Our little Sueleen in going to dig deep for you. \nThere are a few chortles. Suddenly she freezes. TRIPLETTE holds her and kisses her hair. \nPage missing \n165\tNEW ANGLE \nTRIPLETTE encases her in her coat. TRIPLETTE yells something about bringing her clothes as the audience goes crazy. \n166\tNEW ANGLE \n", "test3_id": 1667}

KAUFMAN I need to talk. 
MCKEE I make it a rule not to give private tutorials to my seminar students. It wouldn't be fair to the others. 
KAUFMAN Mr. McKee, please. My even standing here is very scary. I don't meet people well. I'm self-conscious and timid. But what you said this morning shook me to the bone. What you said was bigger than my screenwriting choices. It's about my choices as a human being. Please. 
McKee hesitates for a moment, then reaches out and puts his arm around Kaufman. 
MCKEE I could use a drink, my friend. 
EXT. SWAMP - DAY 
Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose, looking only straight ahead. As they walk the sounds and colors become subdued. Soon there is silence. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) We turned to the right and saw only more cypress and palm and sawgrass 
They turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd) So we turned to the left, and there, far down the diagonal of the levee, we could see the gleam of a fender. We followed it like a beacon all the way to the road. 
Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Kaufman and McKee sit at a table with beers.   Kaufman reads from his copy of The Orchid Thief. 
KAUFMAN ... We followed it like a beacon all the way to the road. 
Kaufman closes the book.   There's a pause. 
MCKEE Then what happens? 
KAUFMAN That's the book. I wanted to present it simply, without big character arcs or sensationalizing the story. I wanted to show flowers as God's miracles.   I wanted to show that Orlean never saw the blooming ghost orchid. It's about disappointment. 
MCKEE I see. That's not a movie.     You must go back and put in the drama. 
KAUFMAN (pause) I've got pages of false starts and wrong approaches. I'm way past my deadline. I can't go back. 
MCKEE Ah, the everpresent deadline. Yes, I was doing a Kojak once and... it was hell. 
McKee sips his beer, eyes Kaufman. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Tell you a secret. The last act makes the film. You can have an uninvolving, tedious movie, but wow them at the end, and you've got a hit. Find an ending. Use what you've learned this weekend. Give them that and you'll be fine. 
Tears form in Kaufman's eyes. 
KAUFMAN You promise? 
McKee smiles.   Kaufman hugs him.   McKee recognizes his bulk. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MCKEE You've taken my course before? 
KAUFMAN My brother did. My twin brother Donald. He's the one who got me to come. 
MCKEE Twin screenwriters. Julius and Philip Epstein,who wrote Casablanca were twins. 
KAUFMAN You mentioned that in class. 
MCKEE The finest screenplay ever written. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
A drunken Kaufman paces, tries to read Story. McKee's Ten Commandments are taped to the wall. As is a photo of Michelle Pfeiffer ripped from a magazine. 
KAUFMAN (V.O.) Climax. A revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony -- a value swing at maximum charge that's absolute and irreversible. 
Kaufman is lost.       He rubs his temples.   He dials the phone. 
DONALD (PHONE VOICE) Great writers residence. 
KAUFMAN Donald. 
DONALD (PHONE VOICE) Hey, how's the trip? Gettin' it on with that lady journalist? You dog you! 
KAUFMAN Yeah. Listen, I'm calling to say congratulations on your script. 
DONALD (PHONE VOICE) Isn't that cool? Jerry says he can make me, like, high-sixes against a mill-five. 
KAUFMAN That's great, Donald.

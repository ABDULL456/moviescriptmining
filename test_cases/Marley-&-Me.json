So, tell me, why did you want to leave the estimable - (he flips to a story, reads \nTHE HEADING) - Kalamazoo Gazette? \nJOHN Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were in college together, and he was always talking about South Florida... mostly about the women of South Florida, but anyway, after my wife and I got married we thought it might be nice to come \nDOWN HERE-- \nJOHN You like the quote about the speed bumps? \n17 CONTINUED: \nJENNY \n(LOOKS) \"If they save even one life--\" \nJOHN -\"it would be worth it. And with that, Janet Dickerson's mother's eyes filled with tears.\" \n(THEN) That one just felt exactly right, y'know? \nJENNY Yeah, no, it's good. What happened to the Desert Storm piece? \nJOHN That's it. The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait. What, that's not in there? \nJENNY (looks at the article) Uhhhh... they must've cut it... And they kinda misspelled your name. John Egan... \nJOHN What-- you're kidding-- He reaches for the paper, but she holds it away. \nJENNY Forget it. It's good, John. It's got facts, some color. It's a solid piece. \nJOHN Thanks. I'm almost done with yours. This idea of voting machines sounds \nREALLY EFFICIENT-- \nJENNY Well, except on the other page I talk about what could happen-- He goes back to reading. She sips her coffee. \nJOHN Oh, it continues... An awkward moment as he now searches for the new page, has to fold back the paper. No escaping the fact that ie article is longer and more important than his. She finally gets up... \n17 CONTINUED: (2) \nJENNY You know what? The rest is just okay, really pretty boring... \nJOHN No, no, I'm enjoying it... He tortures himself and keeps reading. She moves to the sink, starts to rinse out her cup... \nJOHN (CONT'D) Wow, they really gave you a lot of space, didn't they? She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the WILTED PLANT on the sill. \nJENNY Damn. I killed another one. How am I ever going to take care of a kid, I can't even keep a plant alive? John looks up from the paper. \"Kid?\" She comes gives him a kiss. \nJENNY (CONT'D) I'll see you later, Mr. Gorgan. She headsout, leaving John staring terrified at the plant. \nSEBASTIAN (V.0.) A kid, huh... \n18 EXT. SUN-SENTINEL OFFICE - DAY \nSebastian and John fill up at the coffee pot, start to move through the office throughout... \nSEBASTIAN Well, what'd you expect? You bought a house, man. A house with a mare room... \nJOHN What's wrong with a spare room? \nSEBASTIAN It's empty, John. That's what's wrong with it. And you know what else is empty? Her womb. \n18 CONTINUED: \nJOHN I'm starting to worry that we're already at Step Six. \nSEBASTIAN What? \nJOHN You know Jenny, she's got her whole life organized and planned out... Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back to John. \nSEBASTIAN You want my advice? Get her a PuPPY\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 \nJOHN A puppy. \nSEBASTIAN Something other than you she has to take care of. (points at him) You have a kid, you're a dad. You're not you anymore. You have a dog, you're a master. You're still a guy. With a life. \nJOHN And a dog... \nSEBASTIAN Whatever, man. You're still free. You've stopped the clock. \nJOHN What clock? \nSEBASTIAN Okay... you know in movies when there's, like, a bomb and it's ticking down, ten seconds left, and there's some guy with a wire cutter going, \"red wire... blue wire... which one do I cut?\" And the guy finally just makes a wild-assed guess and SNIP. Silence. The world is saved. \nJOHN Okay... is the bomb strapped to a dog... because I'm not sure I'm \nFOLLOWING-- \n18 CONTINUED: (2) 18 \nSEBASTIAN John, you buy this dog, you're saving your world. Because that ticking you hear, is not a bomb, it's her biological clock. John looks back at him. \nJOHN Huh. \nMarley & He Shooting Draft  18. \n20 CONTINUED: (2) \nJOHN He likes you. \nJENNY John, I don't know if I'm ready for a \nPUPPY-- \nLORI You have to wait three weeks for the litter to get weaned, before you can bring 'em home anyway. \nJOHN Plenty of time to get ready. \nJENNY I won't even be here. I'm gonna be with my sister then... \nJOHN No problem. I can take him. Be good bonding time. Get him all trained in time for you to come home. A chuckle from Lori. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Let's give 'em all the scare test. \nLORI \n(STOPS CHUCKLING) The what? \nJOHN I hear the best dog in the litter is the one who doesn't spook easily. They turn out to be the most people- centered. \nLORI \n(SLIGHTLY WORRIED) Uh, how are you gonna-- John turns away, and then suddenly turns back with a loud step and a \"BOO\"! All of the puppies scatter. Lily barks. But Clearance Puppy just leaps onto his shoes, his tail wagging. \nLORI (CONT'D) Well, that's your guy. John scoops him up. Clearance Puppy licks his face. John hands him to Jenny. She lets him lick her face... \n20 CONTINUED: (3) 20 \nJENNY I would've picked you anyway-- \nJOHN Meant to be. He watches her cuddle the puppy and knows he's done the right thing. \n21 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE -- DAY 21 \nLori waves goodbye, check in her hand, as John and Jenny walk to the car. Jenny carries a Polaroid of Clearance Puppy. \nJENNY You really sure about this? I mean, a puppy's a lot of work. \nJOHN How hard could it be? We hear A COMMOTION is coming from the woods, something crashing through the brush, breathing heavily. They both freeze as the sound comes their way. \nJENNY What's that? Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge, rampaging Labrador, soaking wet, covered with mud and burrs. It circles them, barking WILDLY, a crazed look in its eye. It jumps up on John, muddies his shirt, then barrels past Lori into the house, knocking over a chair on the porch as it goes. A beat. \nJOHN I think we just met the dad. \n22 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY 22 \nJohn kissing Jenny good-bye. They finally part... \nJENNY Call me as soon as you get him home. Oh, hey, we need a name. \nJOHN How 'bout I just call him \"Clearance Puppy\" until you get back. I only hope he doesn't say his first word without you. \n23 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn steps out of his car and the puppy, now twice the size he was three weeks ago, bounds over to him. A harried Lori follows, a rope leash and instruction. sheet in hand. \nJOHN Whoa! He got big... This is the right one, right? \nLORI You should see him pack away the puppy chow. \nJOHN So, what if I run into any problems? \nLORI \n(BACKING AWAY) Oh. Sure, call me. All sales are final, though. Not just for him. I tell that to everyone. \n(QUICKLY) You want help getting him in the car? \nJOHN No, that's okay, I'll just... John opens the door, indicates that Marley should jump in. Instead, the puppy runs around the car, barking, jumping up on the bumpers. John finally catches him, lifts him up, puts him on the front passenger seat atop some towels. \nJOHN (CONT'D) There we go. \n(TURNS) Well, anyway, thanks for-- But Lori's already inside her house, the door closed. \n24 INT. JOHN'S CAR - NIGHT 24 \nJohn and the puppy on the drive home. The puppy atop a pile of towels. John looks at him. \nJOHN Hey... guy. The dog just stares at him quizzically. Uncomfortable alone with the dog, John turns on the radio. BOB MARLEY plays and the puppy THUMPS HIS TAIL. \nJENNY Of course he is. I can't wait to see him. \nJOHN Just him? \nJENNY Jealous? \nJOHN I'm not the one sleeping in a box. \nJENNY I love you. I'll see you Friday. \n30 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 30 \nJohn, dressed to go out, is setting down Marley in his wooden box on the garage floor. \nJOHN I'll see you in the morning, okay? Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John hesitates. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Aw, come on, don't. You'll be fine, alright. And tomorrow, we're gonna tear it up. I'm thinking kibble, park, chew toy, the whole nine yards. Okay? we good? Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad. John turns and gets out of there. \n31 EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 31 \nJohn gets into his car. He can hear WHIMPERING. \nJOHN Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal! He listens a beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car. \n32 INT. BAR - NIGHT 32 \nJournalist hang out.'John and Sebastian at the bar. Many know Sebastian, he's constantly nodding at people throughout: \nSEBASTIAN So I'm there in this cave, right? Blindfolded. And I can feel the machine guns, there's like nine of 'em around me... and they tie me to a chair and then Escobar comes in and says-- are you ready? \n(SPANISH ACCENT) I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I think you captured his narcissism just right. \n(LAUGHS) Can you believe that? \nJOHN Some of it. \nSEBASTIAN Man, I wish you could've been there. \nJOHN Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been able to do the piece on the water main break at the library. That would have sucked. \nSEBASTIAN (hand on John's shoulder) Your time will come, amigo. \nJOHN I'll drink to that-- They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at his watch. \nSEBASTIAN You gotta be somewhere? \nJOHN Oh. No, it's the puppy. It's his first \nNIGHT ALONE-- \nSEBASTIAN You got adoc? \n32 CONTINUED: \nJOHN Marley. A little lab. Like you said. Remember? The bomb... \nSEBASTIAN Oh, right. Smart move. You'll see. (slaps him on the back) You've just preserved your quiet way of life for at least another two years. \n33 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD -- NIGHT \nJohn pulls up, gets out of his car. Halfway down the block, we see a POLICE CAR, lights flashing, two OFFICERS talking to a COUPLE. Another NEIGHBOR, in his robe, stands in the street watching... \nNEIGHBOR Millers got robbed again. (then, turns to John) And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up since you left. John looks towards the garage where we hear WHIMPERING. \n34 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - GARAGE - NIGHT 34 \nThe door opens and the puppy gets excited-- \nJOHN No no... I just wanted you to know I'm back. The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the box and pets him... \nJOHN (CONT'D) Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay? Yeah, I know, good to see you, too. But I'm just inside the house, I'll see you in the morning. Big day tomorrow. Get some sleep. \n35 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - NIGHT 35 \nJohn gulps orange juice from the bottle. Leaves a quarter- inch, puts it back in the fridge. And now we hear BARKING from the Garage. \n36 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BATHROOM - NIGHT 36 \nWater running. John swallows some preventative aspirin, picks some nachos off his shirt. He turns off the water. And we hear WAILING and KEENING coming from the garage. \n37 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 37 \nJohn has his head buried under the pillows AS THE WAILING AND KEENING GO ON. AND ON. AND ON. Finally, John can't take it anymore. He sits up, pulls earplugs out of his ears. \n38 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nJENNY (CONT'D) Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm? He licks her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the Pluto stuffed animal. She hugs him... \nJENNY (CONT'D) Look at us. She looks up at John and smiles. He returns the smile. Mission accomplished. \n48 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 48 \nAs Marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of Jenny's bras in his mouth. \nJENNY Marley, no! Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the newspaper... \nJOHN He gave me an extra paragraph... Marley bursts through the back screen door... \n49 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - DAY 49 \nA seemingly continuous shot, except that it's now A SIX MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes through the screen into the backyard now clutching a set of curtains in his mouth, still attached to the rod, and it's now JOHN who stumbles through the broken wire mesh to chase after him... \nJOHN Marley, no! John chases him across the backyard. Marley goes under the fence and John starts to go over into... \n50 EXT. THE NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - DAY \nAnd now it's a NINE MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes up from under the fence clutching a THANKSGIVING TURKEY in his mouth. And now it's Jenny AND John who go over the fence chasing him... \nJOHN Marley, no! They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing on his patio watching. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Hi, Tom-- Sorry... \nJENNY Happy Thanksgiving... Marley goes through a hedge and out onto... \n51 EXT. STREET - DAY 51 \nWhere Marley emerges into FRAME a FULL GROWN DOG, rapidly pulling Jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway. We track with him until a WOMAN WALKING A POODLE IS NOW IN FRAME and Marley gets the two women entangled as he starts humping the smaller dog... \nJENNY Marley, no! \n52 INT. SUN-SENTINEL - ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nJohn sits across from Arnie. He looks thrown: \nJOHN I don't understand, why me? \nARNIE I'm in a bind, John. \nJOHN But I'm a reporter, not a columnist. \nARNIE It's a step up. \nJOHN Yeah, but it's a step away from what I wanna do. \nARNIE It's also better pay, you set your own hours, pick your own topics... \n(MORE) \n52 CONTINUED: \nARNIE (CONT'D) and it's only temporary, just until I find someone permanent. \nJOHN What happened to Jerry? \nARNIE You may have noticed that in every other column, he went on about The Pie Palace? \nJOHN I really haven't read his-- \nARNIE Turns out he's been getting free meals in exchange for mentioning the joint. It's also why he became such a fat ass. John nods. Oh. \nARNIE (CONT'D) Anyway, it's twice a week. And like I said, it's only until I can find someone else to replace him. Then you're back on, uh... whatever beat you were on. \n53 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 53 \nJohn pulls up, gets out of the car. His neighbors, The year-old GIRL -- short blue hair, pierced eyebrow -- and her MOM -- in a nurses uniform -- unload groceries from the car. \nGIRL Your dog's funny. \nJOHN \n(PAUSES) Uh, thanks. \nGIRL He tried to eat one of our tires. \nJOHN Yeah, well, dogs need rubber. Little known fact, helps the digestive tract... \nGIRL Right. Along with the occasional black Converse high top which I'd still love to get back by the way. \n53 CONTINUED: \nJOHN I'll do what I can. \nMS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) Rein in that dog! All right, everyone, line up again. Demonstration. Mr. Grogan? Pay attention. She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into line with the other dogs. \nMS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) It's a simple question of confidence in one's own authority. Shall I demonstrate a simple walk? \nJOHN Be my guest. \nMS. KORNBLUT Class? Even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader. Marley? Heel. And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward. Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park. She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a walking tug-of-war. With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down, and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee. John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid. \nMS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) That's it! He's out! \nJOHN He usually just does this with poodles. (looking at her bad perm) Maybe it's the hair. \nMS. KORNBLUT He's a bad influence on the others. Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes hold in a group - he has to go! \n58 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY \nAs they follow Marley back into the house. \nJOHN Well, that was fun. (to the dog) Congratulations, Marley. You flunked obedience school. \nJENNY You know, John, there is something else we can do-- \nJOHN (looks at her) No, no, I'm not doing that to him. \nJENNY It's painless. And he'll be a lot more comfortable. It'll calm him down. \nJOHN Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer? Because he'll have nothing to look forward to. \nJENNY What're you talking about? There are plenty of other things that'll make him \nHAPPY-- \nJOHN That's where you're wrong. Trust me, Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah, lots of things make us happy, but the only thing we really look forward to is sex. Runner up: the possibility of sex. \nJENNY Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live \nLONGER-- \nJOHN It'll just feel longer. \nJENNY John, he's out of control. It's the right thing to do. John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed \"goofy\" that Jenny gave him as a puppy. \n59 INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY \nJenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the back, his front paws balanced on the center console. \nJOHN It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see. Sex is overrated. Marley looks-at him. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know that... so maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it. Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Poor son-of-a-bitch. A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap... \nJOHN (CONT'D) Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here... Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to catch the fresh air \nJOHN (CONT'D) Least I can do. John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Here you go... John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like he's drunk. \nJOHN (CONT'D) He's so happy. He has no idea what's about to happen to him. Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of the car. \nJENNY He's making me nervous. \n59 CONTINUED: \nJOHN He's fine. He just wants a little \nFRESH-- Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until his front armpits are resting on the glass. \nJENNY John, grab him! Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and scrambling out the window of the moving car. \nJOHN He's onto our evil plan, and he's making a break for it! But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for a foothold... \n60 EXT. INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY BRIDGE - SAME \nAs Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws... \n61 INT. CAR - SANE \nJenny gets the car stopped, HORNS HONKING BEHIND THEM. \nJOHN Uh, little help here... John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on for dear life... \nJENNY I got him! \n62 EXT. BRIDGE - SAME \nJOHN I can probably live with a few leaks. \nJENNY Really? Because a leak can turn into something bigger... and that can be a big responsibility. \nJOHN I know. \nJENNY I was just thinking that we might want everything fixed before we went to the next step. \nJOHN Well, we've already fixed Marley. Literally. \n(CONTINU ED) \nMarley & He Shooting Draft 65 \n65 CONTINUED: (2) \nJENNY You're serious about this? \nJOHN I think so. JENNY t an And you know we're not talking abou actual roof here. \nJOHN Yeah, I got that. She looks back at him, finally nods. They are. Then.. \nJENNY Okay. Maybe, instead of tying to have a baby, we should stop trying to not have one. \nJOHN If I'm following you correctly -- and I think I am -- this is the part where we go home and get it on, right? \nJENNY Bingo. \n66 INT. BEDROOM - DAY \nhim. As Jenny pushes John back onto the bed, starts kissing Things getting hot and heavy quickly. As they kiss... \nJENNY Honey? \nJOHN Yeah... \nJENNY Did you eat some kibble? \nJOHN What? And now they part and we see MARLEY'S HUGE FACE RESTING ON THE SIDE OF THE BED, watching, panting up a storm. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Marley-- get out of here! \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nMARLEY & ME 66 \n66 CONTINUED: \nJENNY \nKNOW it's fine, he's a dog, he doesn't what he's looking at. \nJOHN \nRESENTS Oh, he knows, and trust me, he the hell out of me right now. Go on, Marley! Get out! But Marley jumps up on the bed, tries to climb on both of \nTHEM-- \nJENNY Marley! And now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick their faces... \n67 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSilence. Arnie reads John's column, his face dead serious. \nARNIE This is even funnier than the last one. \nJOHN Thank you, sir. \nARNIE You're good, Gorgan. And not just the dog stuff. The piece on the women of Boca last week. What'd you call them? \nJOHN Boccahontis. \nARNIE Hilarious. John nods, starts for the door... \nARNIE (CONT'D) Is it true what you wrote? You and the wife are trying to have a kid? \nJOHN Well, we're not really trying. \nARNIE How's that work? \nJOHN Excuse me? \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nMARLEY & ME 67 \nJOHN (to the dog) So. This is us not trying. The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky two-piece thing... \nJENNY Hey, Sailor. She walks into the bedroom. John looks back at Marley as he follows her into the bedroom. \nJOHN Catch you later, buddy. And closes the door on the dog. \n73 INT. BAR - NIGHT 73 \nJohn and Sebastian sit at the bar. \n73 CONTINUED: 73 \nSEBASTIAN So the puppy wasn't enough? \nJOHN Well, technically, we're not trying. But you know Jenny. \nSEBASTIAN But things are good right now, just as they are, right? \nJOHN Yeah, things are really good. \nSEBASTIAN So why change it up with a kid? I mean, have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale... \nJOHN The bomb, right? \nSEBASTIAN Yes. The bomb. And just so we're clear, the countdown sequence has been reactivated. By you. \nJOHN Well, it's been a few months and nothing's happened. Which actually makes me wonder if-- \nBARTENDER Mr. Grogan? The BARTENDER sets a PHONE down in front of John. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) Phone call. I loved that thing you did on your dog watching you and your wife have sex? Really funny stuff... \nJOHN \n(EMBARRASSED) Thanks... \nBARTENDER Seriously, man, your stuff is classic. \nJOHN Well, it's just temporary, but thanks. John cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone. \n73 CONTINUED: (2) 73 \nJOHN (CONT'D) Hello. \nJENNY (PHONE) I just wanted to let you know that there's a naked blonde in your bed. \nJOHN Oh. Why don't you two get started and I'll be there as soon as I can. \nJENNY Very funny. Can you come home? I'll make it worth your while. \nJOHN Oh. Alright then. I'll see what I can do. He hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Uh, I'm sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I forgot, I had this thing, I gotta deal \nWITH-- \nSEBASTIAN She's calling you home, isn't she? \nJOHN Yeah. See you later. John starts out of the bar. Sebastian calls after him. \nSEBASTIAN Tick tick tick! \n74 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT \nRomantic Music on the stereo. John comes in, wearily, absently pets Marley. He goes into the bedroom. The bathroom door is open. John sits down on the bed. \nJOHN You know, this baby thing. I been thinking maybe we should take a break. You know? Obviously, it's not happening. Maybe that's nature's way of saying it's not good timing. No sound from Jenny. He struggles on. \n74 CONTINUED: \nJOHN (CONT'D) Maybe this is a sign that we're not ready for this. I mean, have we really thought this through? Because-- \nBEHIND He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door. From her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip. \nJENNY I'm pregnant. \nJOHN (PAUSE, then) Great. Wow, that's... great. \nJENNY But you just said \nJOHN Yeah, no, I mean-- okay, this is definitely awkward now, but... \nJENNY You wanna start over? \nJOHN Can I? \nJOHN He made me! Go! Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters away. Ah, a game! He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver Marley back into Jenny. Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Uh-oh. \n77 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - MORNING \nJohn grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop. He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into the lawn. Nothing. \nJENNY (O.S.) Dr. Jay's sending over a laxative. \nJOHN Yay. \n78 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - DAY \nJohn hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops. \nJOHN Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes. \n(A SIGH) You know, years ago, when I pictured my life, somehow standing in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my bride's swallowed and recycled ass- kissing gift just didn't spring to mind. \n(SUDDENLY EXCITED) Aha! Jackpot! \n79 INT. KITCHEN - DAY \nCarefully, Jenny lifts the shiny necklace out of a glass filled with bleach. \nJENNY I think it's shinier than before. Amazing. \nJOHN Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only threw up eight times. \nJENNY My hero. \n80 INT. OB/GYN OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY \nThe NURSE arranges the gown on Jenny. \nNURSE How's that crazy dog of yours?

That's normal. \nShooting Draft  56. \nMARLEY & ME \n80 CONTINUED: \nJOHN Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not that I care. He can be any sex he wants. Male, female, we don't care. Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our druthers, but whatever... \nNURSE Shhhhh... hang on... She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up to a speaker. Nothing. \nNURSE (CONT'D) Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending on how the baby is lying.- You're ten weeks, right? \nJENNY Next Monday, yes. \nNURSE Might be a little early for that. Let's go right to the sonogram. Did you bring your blank tape? \nJOHN (waving it, smiling) Ready to roll. \nNURSE Let's get a good picture first. It'll be on the monitor there. The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen. \nNURSE (CONT'D) \n(NEUTRAL) Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll be just a minute... She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand. We wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then... smiles down at DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse, Jenny. \nDR. SHERMAN Hi, guys. Let's have a look at your baby, shall we? \n(MORE) \nShooting Draft  57. \nMARLEY & HE \n80 CONTINUED: (2) \nDR. SHERMAN (CONT'D) (he takes the instrument) All right, there we go. Good. Now, look over there. Much better resolution, right? Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen. They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr. Sherman expands and expands. But it's empty. Jenny tries to smile. \nJENNY Is there anything in there? \nDR. SHERMAN Not what you'd expect to see at ten weeks. \nJENNY Not quite ten weeks. Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly: \nDR. SHERMAN Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no heartbeat. John and Jenny are still, silent. \nDebby looks at the piles of orange poop everywhere. \nJENNY'S VOICE Use the red shovel and the blue bucket. Watch your step. Don't worry about the color. He likes mangoes. \nMarley & He Shooting Draft  61. \n87 EXT. IRISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nJohn and Jenny enjoy the scenery. Sheep in the road surround their car.

Once or twice while we're gone, please use cotton balls and the blue ear- cleaning stuff to clean them out. Wear old clothes and try not to breathe. \n88 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDebby is throwing up in her mouth a little as she cleans Marley's ears. Marley loves it. \nJENNY'S VOICE Marley is an excellent watchdog. And in this neighborhood, that's a good thing.

IRISH TOWN - NIGHT \nJohn and Jenny stop at a bed-and-breakfast for the night. It's raining softly. \nJENNY'S VOICE Thunderstorms are his weak point. Well, one of his weak points.

Marley has stuck his head through the shower curtain and is licking the water. Debby splashes water at him to make him go away. Marley, thinking she's playing, scrambles into the tub with her. She grabs the curtain, and it pops off the curtain rings one by one as in \",Psycho.\" \nJOHN'S VOICE - actually, you might want to keep the bathroom door closed in general. \n94 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT \nDebby has run out of the bathroom, a towel hastily wrapped around her. Marley chases her. He leaps - and returns to earth with the towel in his mouth. Debby SCREAMS. \n95 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT \nDebby is standing on a coffee table, nude, swatting at an unseen Marley with a bunch of tall artificial flowers. \nJOHN'S VOICE Other than that, enjoy him!

The CREAKING is terrible. \nJENNY Look, I know we haven't had sex since... you know. But there's no way we're breaking the streak tonight. \nJOHN No kidding. 'Cause it's not just God watching. God, his mother... (indicating next door) .and apparently his best friend. \n97 INT. IRISH BEDROOM - LATER \nThey are in separate beds, staring at the crucifix. \nJOHN It's July, but I think I can see my breath. \nJENNY I can't feel my toes. John gets out of his bed and into Jenny's. Much SQUEAKING. \nGIRL At work... \nJOHN Jenny'll call her... \n125 CONTINUED: Marley sniffs at the ground, growling more and more intensely. We hear SHOUTING, \"He went that way\" as several neighbors take off running. Marley lifts his head and he, too, bolts into the night--- \nJOHN (CONT'D) Marley! NO! But he's gone and John has to stay with the girl. We hear SIRENS as she slides down the car and sits down on the ground. John sits down beside her, holding onto her... \nJOHN (CONT'D) All this time we've been living here, I never got your name. \nGIRL Lisa. \nJOHN Well, you're gonna be alright, Lisa, the police are on the way... John looks off, wondering where Marley is... \n126 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LATER 126 \nA crime scene. Jenny, clutching the baby, stands on the porch watching as an AMBULANCE pulls away. John, now in shorts and a T-shirt, comes jogging up the walk. \nJOHN I can't find him anywhere. \nJENNY Maybe we should get in the car, drive around. \nJOHN I'll get the keys... John's coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to the curb in front of the house. A POLICEMAN gets out of the driver's side, then opens the back and leads Marley out. He bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him... \nJENNY Marley! \nJOHN Where were you? \n126 CONTINUED: 126 \nOFFICER We found him outside the 76 station on Radford. He had the guy cornered in the men's room. \nJENNY So you caught the guy? \nOFFICER \nNO-- \n(INDICATES MARLEY) jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the barrel of my shotgun, and ate half my radio mic. They look at Marley wagging his tail, panting. \nOFFICER (CONT'D) Anyway, the neighbors all said he belonged here, but none of them wanted to drive him, so... \nJOHN Thanks for bringing him home. \nOFFICER Helluva dog. John nods as The Officer heads back to his car. Jenny crouches down and gives Marley a big hug and a back rub... \nJENNY My hero. \n127 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 127 \nAn upscale, newer money neighborhood. An OPEN HOUSE sign out front. John pulls up. He opens the door, holds up a hand to Marley who sits in the back-- \nJOHN Stay. --and starts to unhook Patrick from his car seat. Marley bolts out of the car and heads straight for the house... \nJOHN (CONT'D) Marley! \n128 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 128 \nA REALTOR is showing a COUPLE around the large, empty, new house. She points out the designer kitchen that looks out onto the patio and pool, a huge yellow lab now leaping in. A moment later, we see John, clutching Patrick, enter the backyard, try to haul Marley out of the pool. He gives up, heads for the house, opens the back door and peers inside. \nJOHN Hi. The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Can I see a set-up, please? \nREALTOR Certainly. (looks at the baby) First home? \nJOHN No, we live up in West Palm, over on Churchill? \nREALTOR Ooooh. Well, I think you'd find this neighborhood to be quite a pleasant change. And now Marley bolts past him into the house, tracking wet footprints all over the floor, jumps up onto the REALTOR. \nREALTOR (CONT'D) Oh... my... hello... \nJOHN Hey, who's dog is that? \n129 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 129 \nJohn enters, carrying Patrick, supplies to fix the screen. \nJOHN Jenny?

Marley runs back and forth as the MOVERS load up the truck, John and and a very pregnant Jenny supervising. John sees LISA, the girl next door, as she comes out of her house. She walks over to him. \nJOHN Hey, Lisa. \nLISA Hi. \n(THEN) You're leaving. \nJOHN Yeah. \nLISA well, I don't blame you. I just thought I'd come over and say-- But Marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet him. She hugs him a while... \nLISA (CONT'D) I'm gonna miss you. John watches as she holds on to him a bit longer, thanking him as well. John turns away, starts back for the van to give her a moment. She stands up. \nLISA (CONT'D) Where you moving to? \nJOHN Boca. \nLISA Huh. \nJOHN Huh... what? \nLISA Nothing. I just... never pictured, you know, a guy like you moving to Boca. \nJOHN A guy like me? \nLISA Yeah, you know, young, cool, whatever. \n133 CONTINUED: 133 \nJOHN So you think I'm young and cool. And you're not just saying that because I saved your life? \nLISA Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved my life. \nJOHN Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh, \nWAIT-- He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a chewed-up black Converse. \nJOHN (CONT'D) I believe this belongs to you. \nLISA Thanks. I'll have to chew up the other one to make it match. (extends her hand) Have fun down there. \nJOHN Yeah. It's gonna be great. \n134 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 134 \nStill beautiful, but now we hear the sound of a BABY WAILING \nOVER... \n135 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 135 \nThis is the elegant kitchen we saw, bare and uninhabited, several scenes ago. Now it's full of the clutter of the Grogans' life. The new baby, CONOR is screaming. We follow Jenny through the new house asshetries to soothe him. \nJENNY Shhh, honey. Come on. John follows now... \nJOHN Is he wet? \nJENNY No. And I can't get a burp out of him.

Jenny enters with a fussing Conor on her shoulder... \nJENNY Can you take him? I just need a minute to myself.

John moves into FRAME... \nJOHN Jen, you okay? \nREVERSE - ON JENNY She's crying, her back to John who's now in the b.g. A moment, then... \nJENNY I'm fine. \n145 INT.

She now lays down and closes her eyes. A moment of peace. And then, somewhere in the distance we hear a faint BEEP BEEP BEEP as some truck backs up. Marley lifts his head, perks up his ears and listens. Please don't bark, dog. Please don't bark. BEEP BEEP- And Marley BARKS, bolts out of the room... Jenny opens her eyes with a start as Marley runs barking through the house, we hear something CRASH and break O.S. \n149 CONTINUED: And now Conor's crying. \n150 INT.

Jenny comes into the room, sees a lamp on its side, a cushion torn open where Marley now stands. she grabs him by the collar-- \nJENNY Why do you do this?! Why do you wreck everything! Why?!! She hauls her hand back to hit him, but hesitates, and just shoves him away from her and storms into the other room for Conor. \n151 EXT.

But Marley going, that won't fix anything. \nJOHN (nods, then) Okay. \nJENNY \n(BEAT) Okay. She kisses him on the cheek, then gets up and goes into the bathroom.

Thought we could all sit outside. \nJENNY Sounds perfect. (takes his arm) Thank you. \n162 EXT. SIDEWALK CAPE - DAY 162 \nThey are seated at an outside table, shaded by a large round umbrella. John hooks Marley's leash to two of the table legs as a waiter brings drinks. Jenny holds up her beer. \nJENNY To a perfect day with my boys. \nBEHIND THEM A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a poodle on a jeweled leash, shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman, same type, with another small fluffy'dog. The little dogs yip. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to underneath the table to Marley who has spotted the poodles and is now locked and loaded. \nON JOHN AND JENNY As suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and starts moving down the sidewalk, crashing into other tables, banging-into waiters with trays, making a terrible NOISE as it scrapes over the faux Italian paving stones. The four Grogans sit facing each other across, their drinks suddenly in their laps. Marley is pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards the now-terrified small dogs. He is chugging forward with every ounce of rippling muscle he has. \nJENNY (CONT'D) Marley! John hurries after the dog; Jenny stays with the boys. \nMarley & He Shooting Draft  94. \n162 CONTINUED: 162 As Marley-with-table approaches the small dogs, they break free of their leashes and run. Several innocent bystanders are knocked off their feet. There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley- and-table take out most of the merchandise. Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a, one poor poodle runs for her life. Finally, back where Marley started, the terrified toy poodle leaps into Jenny's arms. Marley tries to brake - \nJOHN Marley, no! - and suddenly, he is jerked back. John has tackled the table Marley's dragging. Marley YELPS and lands on his bac k, then quickly rights himself, tail wagging, the happiest dog in the world. Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent. They all stare at Marley and the Grogans. The poodle jumps out of her arms and runs to its distraught owner. Jenny's head is in her hands, her shoulders heaving... \nJOHN (CONT'D) Jen, you okay? \n(NO ANSWER) Jenny? And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her whole body racking, tears in her eyes. Her LAUGHTER BECOMES-- --A BABY CRYING and we now go to... \n163 INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY 163 \nAs a NEWBORN BABY is placed on Jenny's chest... \nJENNY Boys, say hello to Colleen...

Marley is much heavier than the kids, and they sail past the place where the kids stopped, through the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging branches, \nTOWARDS: \nJENNY John! The creek! The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails through the air, landing with a crash on the iced-over creek. John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side. A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight. John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley comes up and romps with him. \nJOHN Hey... wanna do it again? \nJENNY John! \n182 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 182 \nJohn shuts off all of the lights, heads upstairs. We follow him up the stairs. He stops near the top, peers through the bannister into... \n183 PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 183 From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side, sleeping. And then we see Marley's head rise and reveal itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there. He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but... \nJOHN That's alright, pal. I won't tell. \n(THEN) We kicked ass down that hill, didn't we? John smiles at him and continues up to bed. \n184 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 184 \nEarly Spring. The snow has melted. Marley, still as a statue, sits at the side of the road, waiting. Suddenly, he stands up and starts to wag his tail. \n184 CONTINUED: A moment later, a yellow dot appears on the horizon. As it gets closer, Marley gets more and more excited as we now see that the dot is a SCHOOL BUS. It pulls to a stop beside Marley. Conor and Patrick get off and are greeted by Marley. \nPATRICK Hey, boy. We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road towards home, Marley bounding between them, nipping at Patrick's backpack. \n185 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DUSK \nJohn pulls up as the boys now throw a football back and forth while Marley leaps into the air, trying to intercept it. John gets out of the car, claps his hands, holds them up... \nJOHN Hit me, I'm open! Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff- arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off him as he gives the play-by-play... \nJOHN (CONT'D) My God, look at Grogan-- two three- hundred pound linemen literally hanging off him, but he won't be denied! And now Marley jumps on them. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from the Strong Safety and the unthinkable happens... GROGAN GOES DOWN... And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps, Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get. Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the steps... \nCOLLEEN Mommy says dinner and take off your shoes. \nJOHN Alright... c'mon guys... They all get up, start up the steps. Marley follows, takes one step when his hind legs buckle. John looks back at him. \n185 CONTINUED: \nJOHN (CONT'D) You okay, boy? C'mon... Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out. He looks up at them... \nCONOR What's wrong with him, Daddy? \nPATRICK \n(QUICKLY) Nothing's wrong. He's just tired. Right, Dad? John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's protecting his little brother. \nJOHN That's right. Football just took it out of him. C'mon, let's give him a hand. And now the three of them go to Marley, help him up the stairs. \n186 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nJohn sits across from the editor. \nJOHN Too much color. \nEDITOR Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good piece, but... you're reporting now, John. I want you to tell the story, I don't want you to be in the \nSTORY-- \nJOHN I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself-- \nEDITOR The point is, I still feel you in there. John sits there, thinking about that. \nEDITOR (CONT'D) All I'm saying is: less you, more facts. \n187 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT \nMarley snores on the floor while John, Jenny and the kids all watch a movie together. Suddenly, they all take a whiff, then wince at once... \nCONOR Marley!

Marley gets to his feet, follows John to the front door. \n188 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT \nRain falls as John opens the door and Marley trots outside. \n(MORE) \n197 CONTINUED: \nDR.

PLATT Mr. Grogan-- \nJOHN I'll tell you what it's based on: regular dogs. (getting worked up) Lady, we are so far from 'regular\", you have no idea. \n(INDICATES MARLEY) My guy here... He once ate an entire answering machine, and digested it. Then went back and ate the phone for dessert. So don't give me numbers like \"one percent,\" because you don't know him. But I do, and I'll see him in the morning. We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the exam room, walks down the hall, goes through waiting room, then he PASSES US as he goes out into the dark parking lot, walks to his car and stops. We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and doesn't move. \n198 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJenny's sitting at the table looking through a thick album when John comes in. She looks up at him expectantly. \nJOHN We're just gonna have to wait and see. If he makes it through the night, I think we'll be alright. He notices the album. \nJOHN (CONT'D) What're you looking at? \nJENNY Your old columns. He's in a lot of 'em. \n198 CONTINUED: John rotates the album for a better look. \nJOHN You saved these? \nJENNY Every one. He looks up at her. \nJENNY (CONT'D) Even on the crappiest day, when the boys were driving me nuts and the laundry wasn't done and a hundred other things were hard, I knew I had this. (taps the book) Five minutes of you. Sometimes they were funny and sometimes they were sad, or silly or whatever, but they were all you. And for those five minutes, you made me feel better. She gets up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his head. Then, as she starts out... \nJENNY (CONT'D) You should read them. They're pretty great. \n199 EXT.

John follows Sebastian on a \"tour.\" \nJOHN Nice place. How long you been here? \nSEBASTIAN Two years, little more. Sebastian sees John looking at all of the unpacked boxes. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm in and out of town so much I really haven't had a chance to settle in. I hired a decorator, but she and I got into a thing and it got messy-- \nJOHN Right. \nSEBASTIAN Beer? \nJOHN I can't, I still got one more interview to do. \nA Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and hunk of Parmesan. \nSEBASTIAN What's the piece again? \nJOHN \nU.N. \nSEBASTIAN Right, you told me that.

Jenny MOANS again and now Marley's eyes narrow. He takes a step towards John. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Please don't scream, honey. He'll kill me. \nJENNY You put the car seat in this weekend, right? They won't let us take the baby home without the car seat installed. \nJOHN Like I'd forget that. \n105 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 105 \nPanicking, John is struggling to get the car seat he forgot out of the box. He starts beating at the Styrofoam. Marley barks excitedly. John gets an idea, hands him one end of the box. \nJOHN Come on, Marley. Help me out here. Do what you do best... Unsure, Marley licks the box. \nJOHN (CONT'D) No, don't lick it, eat it! Destroy it!

Where'd that come from? We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in the air like a bird dog, and points in the direction of the car seat that we now see sitting on the bed... \n", "test1_true": ".Harley & Me Shooting Draft  70. \n116 CONTINUED: She moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we see the baby for the first time. She smiles at Marley... \nJENNY This is Patrick, Marley. Jenny unbuckles Patrick from the car seat and crouches down beside Marley and lets the dog sniff the baby's toes, then up his legs, finally his diaper which puts Marley into a Pampers stupor, the Holy Grail of aromas and Marley's eyes glaze... \nJENNY (CONT'D) See, he's not gonna hurt him. \nJOHN No, but I'm gonna have to put a lock on the diaper pail. \n117 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 117 \nGarbage day, and the trash piled outside the Grogan house testifies to the change inside. Empty cartons of diapers, the packaging from a crib, a stroller, the car seats, the Pack'n'Play... \n118 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 118 \nJenny tries to watch the baby, now crawling around on the floor and file her column over the phone at the same time. \nJENNY I have the quote right here-- Patrick crawls over Marley, who's supremely patient as Patrick takes a fistful of his eye. \nJENNY (CONT'D) Well, have legal call them again and get a release for it. They told me it was on the record-- Marley-- Patrick, that's his eye-- No, not you, Karla, just get the release. I'll call you back. \n(HANGS UP) Be gentle, Patrick! Jenny leans back in her chair, rubs her face. Then... \nJENNY (CONT'D) \n(GETS UP) Laundry. \n119 EXT.

Jenny looks up from her computer. \nJENNY I need to go in tomorrow for a few hours, see my editor. Think you can watch the baby for me? \nJOHN Sure. John looks around the room. The place is a disaster area. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Remember us? \nJENNY You mean, those younger, skinnier better looking people? Yeah, I think I remember them. Vaguely. \nJOHN Well, I miss them. He turns back to his work. She looks at him, sets her pad aside, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him. \n122 CONTINUED: 122 \nJENNY They're still here. He looks up at their reflection in the window, not so sure. \n123 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 123 \nJohn and Jenny now asleep on opposite sides of the bed. On the floor beside John, Marley lifts his head and GROWLS. We then hear a piercing SCREAM coming from outside. The dog is already out of the room.

BOCA HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT \nThe guests have gone. John sits in a lounge chair, holding out a fork so that Marley can lick the cake off of it. Most of the floating lights have gone out.

Because that was real nice-- She hands him an envelope. \nJENNY Happy Birthday. He opens it, pulls out an AIRLINE TICKET. \nJOHN A plane ticket? \nJENNY To Philadelphia. So you can talk to the editor of the inquirer. \n172 CONTINUED: \nJOHN That was months ago-- \nJENNY I called the editor last week. They'd still like to meet you. \nJOHN Jenny, I couldn't do that, uproot us. We've got our friends, the schools... \nJENNY First of all, you don't even have the job yet, it's just an interview. Second of all, you don't have that many friends. \nJOHN Thank you. What I was trying to say, is that our life is here. \nJENNY Baby, I got news for you, our life is wherever we are. And you're not happy here anymore, doing that column. You're restless, John. I feel it. I feel it when you read Sebastian's articles every day. And I feel it when you sit out in the driveway an extra five minutes before you come in. \n(THEN) Maybe it's time for a change. \nJOHN I'm forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for that. \nJENNY Not so late. She stands up in the dark, lifts her dress over her head. \nJOHN What're you doing? \nJENNY We're not old, John. We can still surprise ourselves. He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She surfaces and smiles at him. \n172 CONTINUED: (2) \nJENNY (CONT'D) Hey. You want your other birthday present or not? \nINTO John can't get out of his clothes fast enough.

They stand there a moment, awkward. Then... \nARNIE This would be where a mushier guy would tell you he's proud of you, give you a hug, and send you on your way. \nJOHN Really glad you're not that guy, sir.

PLANE - LATER \nThe engines ROAR up and the stewardess begins her pre-flight safety demonstration. John watches her, smiling, relieved they made it this far, when he freezes.

He's with the suitcases. John smiles weakly at the Passenger. \nJOHN What an imagination, huh? \n(MOUTHING IT:) We don't have a dog. He makes the crazy sign with his finger, gesturing at Patrick.

John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat - then over his stomach, the dog flinches. \nJOHN I'm taking him in. The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed sheep. \nCOLLEEN Is he sick again? \nJOHN Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to take him to the hospital and they'll try to make him better. Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face. \nCONOR Get better, Mar. \nCOLLEEN You can take Lamby, okay? (she puts the stuffed animal next to him) But don't chew her other ear off. Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in \nHIS EAR: \nPATRICK Goodbye. When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's crying, that he knows what the other two don't. \n212 EXT. VET'S - NIGHT 212 \nJohn lifts Marley out of the car. Marley seems a little more alert. \n212 CONTINUED: \nJOHN You wanna walk? He sets him down gingerly.

Dr. Platt has put a blanket on the cold metal table so Marley is warm. \nDR. PLATT I'll give you some time. She goes. John stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed lamb out of his pocket, places it under a paw. When John puts a hand on his flank, Marley's eyes flutter open. His tail THUMPS gently. \nJOHN Hey, buddy. He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body. His coat, still shedding. His tail. He takes up each paw, each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same time. He leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him in. Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's level. He looks into Marley's eyes. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Listen, you know all that stuff we always said about you? What a total pain you are? The world's worst dog? Well, don't you believe it. Don't believe it for a minute. You loved us, every day, no matter what. And that's a pretty amazing thing.

We hear A COMMOTION is coming from the woods, something crashing through the brush, breathing heavily. They both freeze as the sound comes their way. \nJENNY What's that? Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge, rampaging Labrador, soaking wet, covered with mud and burrs. It circles them, barking WILDLY, a crazed look in its eye.

Because it can be temporary... \nINTERCUTTING: JOHN & JENNY \nJENNY No, it's good. \n(THEN) He must be exhausted. \nJOHN Oh, yeah, he's pooped.

He drinks out of the toilet. He works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub. Another night and he'll be in. He chases a fly. Finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom. He settles himself down to sleep. He yawns, he scratches, he closes his eyes. He snores. And then - He wakes up, suddenly alert. He looks over at Jenny. He gets up, sits by her side of the bed, and waits. Suddenly Jenny sits up, rests a hand on her stomach. \nJENNY \nWHOA-- She catches her breath, leans over to John. \nJENNY (CONT'D) John.

Second of all, you don't have that many friends. \nJOHN Thank you. What I was trying to say, is that our life is here. \nJENNY Baby, I got news for you, our life is wherever we are. And you're not happy here anymore, doing that column. You're restless, John. I feel it. I feel it when you read Sebastian's articles every day. And I feel it when you sit out in the driveway an extra five minutes before you come in. \n(THEN) Maybe it's time for a change. \nJOHN I'm forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for that. \nJENNY Not so late. She stands up in the dark, lifts her dress over her head. \nJOHN What're you doing? \nJENNY We're not old, John. We can still surprise ourselves. He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She surfaces and smiles at him. \n172 CONTINUED: (2) \nJENNY (CONT'D) Hey. You want your other birthday present or not? \nINTO John can't get out of his clothes fast enough.

They stand there a moment, awkward. Then... \nARNIE This would be where a mushier guy would tell you he's proud of you, give you a hug, and send you on your way. \nJOHN Really glad you're not that guy, sir.

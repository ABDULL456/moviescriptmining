RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Richard Scruggs... 
LOWELL ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not? 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (nods) That's right... 
LOWELL (after a beat) Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman? 
LOWELL Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection. 
MOTLEY It could work.  If it's public record, it's public record. 
LOWELL Yeah, and he's going to need legal representation. 
MOTLEY He sure as hell will. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (a beat) Has he decided to go public?  Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know...  Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him.  So, is your man truly committed? 
LOWELL Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the fence.  That's the point. 
Scruggs and Motley exchange a look...  Motley shrugs... 
RICHARD SCRUGGS Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do... 
LOWELL Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him?  How do you want to do it? 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (no nonsense) It would be better if he called us. 
LOWELL Yeah. 
RICHARD SCRUGGS Alright? 
LOWELL Okay.  Thank you. 
At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.  Scruggs disconnects. 
LOWELL (cont'd) Shit... 
INT. CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY 
LOWELL (contemplating phone; to Debbie re:  show) Oh, we need cops on the street.  We don't need them on horses. 
DEBBIE DELUCA I don't know what he was thinking. 
LOWELL Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish? 
DEBBIE DELUCA Alright, alright. 
LOWELL Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself! 
TIGHTEN on mounted New Orleans police at crime scene, herding crowd. 
INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, KITCHEN - TWILIGHT 
Liane cooking dinner, making pasta.  Ingredients, diced tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  She's waiting for water to boil.  The kids are doing homework on the round table in the kitchenette.  It's an idle moment.  She's dazed-out watching them. 
DEBORAH What are you cooking? 
LIANE I'm cooking pasta primavera. 
DEBORAH Oh, I love that stuff. 
And now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on Jeffrey's computer.  It's a tiny bell, incessant...  She crosses to the basement stairs. 
LIANE I'm going to have to go downstairs. 
INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT 
Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.  And she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings - flying repetitively across the screen. 
The bell RINGING is louder.  She calls-up the E-mail...  On the screen in large RED letters: 
WE WILL KILL YOU.  WE WILL KILL ALL OF YOU.  SHUT THE FUCK UP. 
And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and... 
LIANE Debbie, Barbara...  Debbie! 
EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide. 
Algren watches, stunned. 
Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield. 
Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke. 
Algren looks over the slaughter. 
And then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him. 
Fade to... 
EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                               DAY 
Algren is unconscious, tied to a horse. 
The mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass, disappearing into the soaring mountains of Yoshino. 
EXT.              VILLAGE                                    SUNSET 
Katsumoto's village is the other Japan. The Japan we have not yet seen. 
The gorgeous mountain scenery of Yoshino envelopes the village. Snow- capped mountains soar in the distance. A valley below with rice fields. 
After the turmoil of Tokyo, this place seems a bucolic paradise. Traditional, wooden Japanese architecture. Farming. The sense of harmony so markedly absent from the cities. 
Algren, barely conscious, hunches over his horse. He has lost a lot of blood. 
Katsumoto leads his samurai into the village. As he passes, ever y person in the village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect. 
Most of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with curiosity. And suspicion. 
Katsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai helps Algren painfully slide from his horse. 
Katsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house. His officers fall into formation around him. Algren notes Ujio - the grim samurai who killed Gant -- in jet black armor, glaring at him coldl y. 
Ujio walks forward and SCREAMS at Algren in Japanese. Algren doesn't move. This only makes Ujio more angry. He paces back and forth like a caged panther spitting invective at Algren. 
Algren doesn't move. He watches Uji o evenly. This takes incredible will. His wounds are so bad that- he can barely stand. 
SUDDENLY - Ujio draws his long sword -- it slashes through the air - the blade singing -- and stops an inch away from Algren's face! Algren doesn't move. 
Ujio brings the cutting edge' into contact with Algren's check. Blood runs where even this feather-light touch cuts Algren's skin. Algren doesn't move. 
Ujio glares at him. Then sheathes his sword and walks away. 
Katsumoto looks at Algren deepl y, gauging him. Then be speaks. In English. Algren is surprised. 
KATSUMOTO You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains and winter is coming. 
Katsumoto turns and walks into his house. Uji o follows him. Algren collapses. 
Fade to black. 
As Algren begins his time at the heart of the samurai world. 
INT.                        YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT 
Algren'. eyes open... 
A WOMAN is leaning close, her eyes intent on the task of sewing up his wound. She is beautiful, but he is not really conscious enough to notice, or 
even feel the pain. He blacks out again. 
INT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      NIGHT 
Algren wakes again. He is lying on a simple mat. His injuries are such that he can barely move his head. He takes in the traditional Japanese furnishings. 
A red ball rolls across the floor. And after it... TOSHIIE, a little boy. around four. The boy l ooks at Algren. offers him the ball. Smiles. 
A1gren blacks out... 
INT                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       ANOTHER DAY 
Algren's eyes open... 
Through the archway he can see Toshiie and his older brother HIGEN, around ten. Also the beautiful WOMAN who earlier was stitching his wound. 
From his recumbent position, Algren watches as she ministers to the boys, who are dearly her sons. Algren is fascinated by her grace and the sweet attention she gives them. 
She seems to sense him. Her eyes raise, meet bit. She speaks to someone, and YORITOMO appears. He is twenty-one, too young to be the woman's husband. Yoritomo comes into Algren's room. Speaks to him. 
Algren shakes his head. Doesn't understand 
Yoritomo speaks to the woman, who approaches and places bowl of soup in front of Algren. He ignores it 
The boys stand in the doorwa y. Yoritomo shoos them awa y. 
Algren glances up at the: woman. Her eyes avoid his, her expression is opaque. 
INT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                              ANOTHER DAY 
Algren now sits in the main room. The woman is changing the dressing on his wounded right shoulder and arm. 
Yoritomo kneels across from Algren. He is impressed at the many battle wounds on Algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars. In Japanese, he indicates his admiration. 
Algren his no idea what Yoritomo is saying. Finally he interrupts with the only Japanese word he has bothered to learn: 
ALGREN Sake. 
Yoritomo's face breaks into a wide smile.

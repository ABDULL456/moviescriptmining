DRIVER Reseda Boulevard. 
IRENE You should tell Benicio you're a stunt guy. 
DRIVER He interested in that kind of stuff? 
IRENE Aren't all little boys? 
She smiles softly and he realizes she's teasing him. 
BENICIO O/S Mama, I don't like this... 
Irene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver watches her quietly, then drains his glass of water. 
IRENE Would you like another glass? 
DRIVER I should get going... 
He catches the disappointment in her eyes, but she covers it with another good humored smile. 
(CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: (3) 37 
IRENE Well, thank you for your help. 
DRIVER Thank you for the drink... 
She takes his empty glass and walks him to the door. 
38 EXT/INT. STREET/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 38 
Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball. 
Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing gently on a cup of coffee. 
39 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 39 
The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards. 
40 EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING. 40 
It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly. Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass. 
41 EXT/ INT. BUFFALO BAR AND GRILL/ LA - MORNING. 41 
Jukebox music plays in the bar and grill. Driver sits on his own, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs. 
BEARDED REDNECK OFFSCREEN Mind if I cut in?... 
Driver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat opposite him. 
BEARDED REDNECK You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last year. You drove me and my brother back from Palm Springs... 
(CONTINUED) 41 CONTINUED: 41 
Driver stares into the redneck's coked-up eyes, then looks back down at his food. 
BEARDED REDNECK Next run we hired another wheelman - I spent six months in jail, my brother got himself killed... (He grins through yellowing teeth) He wasn't much, mind you, just family... 
Driver doesn't seem to hear him. 
BEARDED REDNECK Thing is - 
DRIVER I'm not interested... 
Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a moment, then decides against it, standing up. 
BEARDED REDNECK Well, it's good to see you again... 
Driver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist. 
42 EXT. FORECOURT/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 42 
The loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the second hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine.

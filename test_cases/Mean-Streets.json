A tree is above him. The image is more diffused on the edges. It is black and white, and appears to be coming from a television. The body of the man is practically totally in shadow. \nANNOUNCERS VOICE Ladies and gentlemen, on the new tonight, the first actual motion pictures of death. \nA small orange fire appears in the breast of the man. \nANNOUNCERS VOICE Watch closely, at the moment of death. \nThe small orange fire fades away. \nCOLOR CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more. He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges quotes from it with his friend TONY. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCHARLIE has been dreaming. The dream frightened him. A TITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the frame: CHARLIE. He gets up to look at his face in the mirror. His room is lit by moonlight. It is a small tenement bedroom with a fire- escape outside. \nHe returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow, we hear the RONETTES singing \"BE MY BABY.\" \nCUT TO: \nAn 8-mm. projector whirring away. \nINT. PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY \nOpening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a celebration...a sense of \"one big unending party.\" \nDuring this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL, TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian- American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family, Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE participated. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR \nA longhaired \"freak\" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is totally different in appearance and dress from the \"freak.\" He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts. His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part of the city and owns several night club type discotheques and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is operated by TONY - \"TONY'S PLACE.\" CHARLIE is one of his closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless. He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine. \nTONY What the fuck...hey! \nTONY rushes over to the \"freak\", who is too strung out to defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around. \nTONY Not in my fuckin' place... get out... get out! \nINT. BAR AREA \nTONY pushes him out the door and into the bar area. There are a few people in the bar...mainly neighborhood guys like TONY. A few \"freaks\" are in the BG. \nTONY pushes him out the front door. \nTONY And keep the fuck out-a-here. I know your face. \nTONY crosses over to one of the neighborhood guys by the bar and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat. \nTONY And you scumbag...what did I tell you 'bout passin' that shit in my PLACE (HITS AGAIN) ...huh? \nBOY Hey I didn't do nothin'...cut it out... \nTONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the bouncers. He seems upset about the noise that CHARLIE and his friends are creating. TONY doesn't take GEORGE very seriously. \nGEORGE It's ten o'clock and they're like this. And they're just starting? \nTONY smiles. \nGEORGE (CONTINUING) Smile...What are you smiling at? This is a business night. \nTONY (INTERRUPTING) George...did I ever tell you the story about the three chickens? \nGEORGE (GENUINELY) No... \nTONY Too bad. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There is no particular logical sequence except that events are suited to the rythmic pattern of the music. \n1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the music. \n2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the bar. He fails. \n3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also fails. \n4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the darkness. \n5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half amusedly to ignore him but she can't. \n6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a chaser swigs down Aqua Velva. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE, the stripper, perform again. He stares glassy-eyed and then begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession. \nCHARLIE Y'know...she's really good-looking... really good-looking. I've gotta say that again. She's really good- looking...but she's black... You can see that real plain. (as an afterthought) When you get down to it though... there's not much of a difference, is there? (He waits for an answer) Well...is there? (He smiles and begins chewing on an ice cube from his half EMPTY GLASS) \nSuddenly MICHAEL appears and sits down at CHARLIE's table. He hands CHARLIE two cartons of cigarettes. \nCHARLIE Oh great...hey - Winstons? \nMICHAEL For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see... \nCHARLIE gives him the money. \nCHARLIE OK, ok... \nMICHAEL Sell 'em if you can't smoke them. \nCHARLIE No...I'll be ok for a week. \nMICHAEL You seen Johnny Boy tonight? \nCHARLIE (DISINTERESTED) Nope... \nMICHAEL Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean... \nCHARLIE Look...I don't know. What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something? Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head. Right? \nMICHAEL I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me... \nCHARLIE remains silent. \nMICHAEL (CONTINUING) ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me? I think you should be, you know that. \nCHARLIE (QUIETLY) Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that. \nMICHAEL I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right? \nSAL Hey Johnny, where're you goin'? \nJOHNNY BOY Sal!... fourteen street. \nSAL Come on. \nINT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON \nJOHNNY BOY This is some boat. Your father's? \nSAL Yeah...just had it delivered... \nJOHNNY BOY Hey... you got stereo. \nSAL Yeah, I think so. \nAs JOHNNY BOY admires the gadgets in the car he notices that SAL is becoming very nervous. \nJOHNNY BOY You got a speaker back there? \nHe turns to look for the speaker and sees a police car not far behind. \nJOHNNY BOY (CONTINUING) Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us. \nSAL (NERVOUSLY) I know...I know. \nJOHNNY BOY What'sa matter...forget your registration? \nSAL No...no. Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car. \nJOHNNY BOY Yeah, it's your father's. \nSAL Well...no. \nJOHNNY BOY You mean it's heisted. \nSAL You could say that. \nJOHNNY BOY (announcing it loudly) This is a heisted car! \nSAL smiles sheepishly. JOHNNY BOY panics. \nEXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe police switch on their flashing red light and try to get closer to them but the traffic is too heavy. \nSAL manages to turn the next corner at about twenty miles per hour. \nINT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON \nJOHNNY BOY frightened now, underestimates the speed of the car and quickly opens the door. \nEXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nJOHNNY BOY tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp- post. He has seriously banged his head and blood is running down his face. But because of the near proximity of the police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street. \nEND FLASHBACK \nCUT TO: \nINT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT \nTONY has now joined the group sitting at the table... CHARLIE and TONY nod in disbelief. \nJOHNNY BOY It's the truth, I swear. \nCHARLIE All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face? \nGEORGE We're closed. \nBOY I'm just waiting for Joey. \nThe BOY walks over to a bar stool and sits down. Nobody acknowledges his presence. \nSuddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up, dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to look up at him. The DRUNK stares ahead for a minute. \nDRUNK (MUTTERS) I...I gotta go to the bathroom. \nEVERYONE laughs. \nCHARLIE Well, go ahead, whaddaya want? Someone to hold it for you? \nMore laughter. Even the BOY at the bar laughs. The DRUNK rises, still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room. \nThe Big Bopper - \"Chantilly Lace\" in playing on the soundtrack. CHARLIE is playing with a deck of cards. \nCHARLIE (continuing previous conversation) This place is dead. If I had a place...every night...lively. \nJOHNNY BOY is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUING) And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE... (MORE CONFIDENTIALLY) I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it? \nTONY (QUIETLY) You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do. \nCHARLIE Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh? \nJOHNNY BOY Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what? \nTONY We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves. \nCHARLIE Don't forget what's-his-name there in the bathroom. \nEVERYONE laughs. JIMMY is drawing on a table top. CHARLIE wanders over. \nJIMMY Wanna see your picture? \nCHARLIE leans over. OVERHEAD VIEW shows large crude swastika. \nJIMMY Waddaya think? \nCHARLIE Not quite...but keep trying. \nCHARLIE picks up the cards again. \nCHARLIE Let's have a game after we close. \nJOHNNY BOY Nah. \nCHARLIE C'mon Tony, waddaya say? \nTONY No. \nCHARLIE (ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE BAR) Anybody wanna have a game? \nThe people in the bar do not respond. CHARLIE shrugs. The BOY casually leaves the bar and walks to the men's room. \nINT. MENS ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT \nThe BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back. To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat. They struggle in the open doorway. \nINT. BAR AREA - NIGHT \nThe Italian music is still playing. Everyone in the bar has frozen in position as they watch the scene. \nIn his astonishment CHARLIE allows the cards to fall from his hands. \nMICHAEL Where should I drop you Charlie? \nSAMMY (interrupting the conversation) Yes Charlie, your place or mine. \nBENTON Sammy. \nCHARLIE Away from the neighborhood. \nSAMMY Oh Benton...look! \nSAMMY leans over JOHNNY and CHARLIE to see out the window. He begins to shout at a young boy on the street. \nSAMMY (CONTINUING) Hi beautiful!!! I love you. \nCHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY hide their faces. \nMICHAEL Hey, shut up. \nCHARLIE Get him in. \nJOHNNY BOY What...are you kidding. \nBENTON Sammy, get in here this minute. \nSAMMY I won't...I won't! They're all beautiful. (SHOUTING) I'll suck them all...I'll suck them all! \nCHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY groan. They are still hiding their faces. \nCHARLIE Disgraceful. \nMICHAEL Ok...that's it. \nHe pulls the car over to the nearest corner. \nMICHAEL Out!!!! \nCHARLIE C'mon Johnny. \nMICHAEL You getting out too? \nCHARLIE Yeah, thanks, it's ok. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE \nCHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY get out of the car first so that by the time BENTON and SAMMY are out they are already on their way down the street. MICHAEL drives away. \nSAMMY (SHOUTING) Going our way? \nCHARLIE (to JOHNNY BOY) Don't answer. \nBENTON guides SAMMY the opposite way. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAWN \nCHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are walking down the street on their way home. \nJOHNNY BOY I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she? \nCHARLIE No, she isn't. \nCUT TO: \nFLASHBACK \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment. Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is evident that this is a family apartment rather than a bachelors pad. \nCUT TO: \nStills of girls, sexy pornographic nude magazine spreads. \nCHARLIE ...pluck it out and cast it from thee.\" \"Woe to the man through whom scandal does come.\" I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down. Like the priesthood... \nCUT TO: \nTextbook illustration of vocations. \nCHARLIE ...they don't get tied down do they? \"Have I not a right to do what I chose? Even so the last shall be first and the... \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE in sync. \nCHARLIE ...first last. For many are called but few are chosen.\" \nINT. RESTAURANT - MID-DAY \nCHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant. This restaurant was considered an above average business with quality and prices to match when it was first opened three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it. He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on the table. He takes a menu. \nA chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted. \nOSCAR (with a slight Jewish accent) Hey...you're here. They told me you're here...and you're here. How are you? \nCHARLIE Ok, how's everything going? \nOSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE. \nOSCAR Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh? \nCHARLIE No. \nOSCAR I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that? \nCHARLIE (LAUGHING) What pipes? \nOSCAR (MIMICKING) What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes. \nCHARLIE shakes his head in sympathy. \nOSCAR Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing. There is nothing to give him. No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing. \nCHARLIE That bad, huh? \nOSCAR I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either. \nCHARLIE Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me. \nOSCAR Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old. \nCHARLIE He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that. \nOSCAR Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him. Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place. And tell me why should I care? I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems. I should go back to Florida...I don't need this. \nCHARLIE I don't understand, where's Groppi? \nOSCAR I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself? \nCHARLIE My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself. \nOSCAR What can I say? \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side. A noisy religious street festival is being held on the block. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUED) Like, looking at my uncle back there. One way is the obvious; ...man outside the law. On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...Amen. \nThe image culminate in aerial shots of downtown New York City. (STOCK FOOTAGE) \nCHARLIE now sees MARIE totally naked as she serves the customers. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nGIOVANNI and CHARLIE are standing and talking. \nCHARLIE Uncle, how are you feeling? \nGIOVANNI Fine. Did you have a good time last night? \nCHARLIE (QUIETLY) About that shooting last night...I was there and... \nGIOVANNI No you weren't. \nCHARLIE is struck silent for a moment. He listens. \nCHARLIE (EMBARRASSED) You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else. \nGIOVANNI Yes, you did. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE and GIOVANNI are now sitting at a table. \nCHARLIE About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want. \nGIOVANNI No...his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you. \nCHARLIE Yes...I understand...I'll be careful. \nEXT. BEACH - HAMPTONS - DAY \nCHARLIE and TERESA are sitting on the beach which is fairly deserted. There are rented cottages behind them. TERESA has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to write a term paper for CHARLIE'S English class. \nTERESA C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll call in sick for work. \nCHARLIE No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right. \nTERESA Ok. \nCHARLIE picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and tries to read it. He tosses it aside. \nCHARLIE Bore. \nTERESA A paper on that one too? \nCHARLIE Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first. \nTERESA It was nothing. I'm almost finished. \nCHARLIE Take your time. I don't care. \nTERESA I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately. \nCHARLIE That's the word...preoccupied. \nCHARLIE turns towards TERESA and tries to kiss her. She playfully turns away. But CHARLIE quickly gets bored with that and doesn't pursue her. She is confused by his actions. \nCHARLIE Let's go back inside. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE and TERESA already farther up the beach, walking. They notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in front of it. \nCHARLIE Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon. \nThey laugh. He crosses to TERESA and they kiss. \nTERESA I'm sleepy. \nCHARLIE You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine. \nTERESA The green capsules in the top drawer. \nCHARLIE gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for a walk. \nEXT. ROADWAY - HAMPTONS - DAY \nCHARLIE is walking along the roadway and looking at the different cottages. He is carrying a notebook to which he periodically refers. He stops in front of a luxurious cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one in his notebook beside which is listed the name GROPPI. He remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring at it. It looks deserted. \nFANTASY \nEXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY \nCHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened door. \nGROPPI What do you want kid? \nAt that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more. \nGROPPI What do you want?.......well? \nCHARLIE I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er a magazines...newspapers...I'm conducting a survey...I... \nGROPPI We don't want no fuckin' books! \nGROPPI slams the door in CHARLIE'S face. \nREALITY \nEXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY \nCHARLIE is still standing in front of the cottage. Suddenly a little boy of about nine appears. \nBOY There's nobody here mister. \nCHARLIE turns in surprise. \nCHARLIE Isn't this Jack Groppi's place? \nBOY Yeah. But he ain't here now. \nCHARLIE Know where he is? \nBOY Follow me. \nThe BOY leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area. \nCHARLIE How much farther? \nCHARLIE repeats this question periodically as he follows the BOY. Finally CHARLIE finds himself alone in the middle of a dense forest with the BOY nowhere in sight. He calls out but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had. \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) Now, don't get excited. \nCHARLIE is trying to find his way out of the forest. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUED) 'The stone which the builders' reject will become the cornerstone'...I think. \nINT. ITALIAN CAFE - DAY \nA loud brass band is playing \"Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, How You Can Love\" inside the cafe. They are part of a religious festival and GIOVANNI has invited them in for drinks. In return they are playing for him. GIOVANNI has been drinking. The song ends. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - NEAR CAFE - DAY \nMICHAEL I gave him all the breaks I can give. \nCHARLIE Oh Michael, look... \nMICHAEL Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore... \nCHARLIE Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok? \nMICHAEL All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of. I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing. \nCHARLIE We'll settle it tonight. \nTwo YOUNG BOYS about 15 years old walk up to CHARLIE. \nBOY #1 Hey, you sell firecrackers? \nCHARLIE Firecrackers! No...no. \nBOY #1 You know where we can get some? \nCHARLIE Sure, see that guy over there... \nHe points to MICHAEL. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUING) ...him. He's got the best. \nThe BOYS go over to MICHAEL. \nBOY #1 Hey - fella...you sell firecrackers? \nMICHAEL Sssh! Quiet. (He looks around) Y'know that's illegal. \nBOY #2 Well the guy over there said... \nMICHAEL (INTERRUPTING) Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful. \nBOY #1 We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any. \nMICHAEL Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx. They don't have shit. \nBOY #2 Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy... \nMICHAEL (INTERRUPTING) All right! Quiet! For $40 I could give you... \nBOY #1 Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth... \nMICHAEL Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit? \nBOY #2 Well, we want good stuff. \nMICHAEL Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means? \nBOY #1 No. \nMICHAEL That means it's good. \nBOY #1 You got sparklers? \nMICHAEL Yeah. \nBOY #2 And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets? \nMICHAEL Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs. \nBOY #1 No, all we got is $40. \nTONY Yeah. \nMICHAEL Ok guys...have a heart. This is my business. \nBLACK & WHITE \nEXT. NIGHT - IN FRONT OF MOVIE THEATER \nThe boys are paying for their tickets. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nDONOVAN'S REEF is showing. We see a brief scene from the film which has JOHN WAYNE fighting LEE MARVIN in a big bar- room brawl. \nCUT TO: \nThe boys smile and watch. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE \nThe two boys from Riverdale are still watching on the corner, in the dark. \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCHARLIE is at home shaving. \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) You know damn well what's going to happen tonight. I'll probably get drunk at that party...it isn't every day you send one of your best friends off to war for God and country... gotta have a party. I mean, he's a nice kid. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE is gluing on a fake beard. \nCHARLIE (VOICE OVER) I don't know what You think of him but that's between You and him anyway...I can't help feeling sorry for him though. Has a talent but doesn't use it...His brain. An 'Unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside, where there will be... \nCUT TO: \nTelevision image of old women mourning their dead in India. The images are slow motion. The news continues with more trivial news images...(Washington investigations, demonstrations, etc.) \nCHARLIE (continued voice over) ...the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'...or something like that. My talent's my brain too but I use my talent...I'm not saying that I'm a genius...You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but I can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid. Take the army for example... \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE grabbing a white robe off his bed. We don't see his face. \nCHARLIE (continued voice over) That's there and I'm here and that's the way it's going to stay! \nINT. WEST SIDE TENEMENT APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT \nTONY enters the bathroom, turns on the light and locks the door. Party noises can be heard in the background TONY is wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War I \"dough boy\". Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't be seen. He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red Jello. He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming water. \nCUT TO: \nLIVING ROOM & KITCHENETTE - PARTY - NIGHT \nMost of the characters that were at the club the other night are present at the party. Many of them are dressed in semi- masquerade outfits. Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms. One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift. MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a \"Bela Lugosi\" look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys, proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down. \nTERESA Oh sure! I know her Michael...In fact, I saw her a few days ago under a bridge in Jersey, making out with a nigger. \nMICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits. \nMICHAEL You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I kissed her. \nHe wipes his lips with his cape. \nThe guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is attempting to open his going away presents, one of which turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group applauds. \nMICHAEL I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it. \nCHARLIE (in the same manner) 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away! \nMICHAEL (EXASPERATED) He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money... \nCHARLIE (more serious now) 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.' \nMICHAEL You said it. \nA loud scream is heard from the bathroom. \nCUT TO: \nAPARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nSomeone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now filled with congealed red jello. The boys are laughing and shoving each other about roughly. CHARLIE comes out of the next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through the madness, his arms outstretched. One boy kneels and kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him. There is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the bathroom and near the doorway. CHARLIE promises to save the sinner as he pushes his way through. He helps the girl remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the bathtub. It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She caresses him and they find themselves kissing. The others storm into the bathroom and grab CHARLIE. \nEVERYONE Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ! Crucify him!! \nThey drag CHARLIE into the next room where, amidst all the shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their own \"dog fight\". They are flying the planes out the open window. \nCHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few lines over their laughter. \nCHARLIE 'Father...forgive them...for they know not...what they do...' \nThe doorbell rings and TONY answers it. It is TERESA and she looks very worried. \nTERESA Charlie...? Charlie here...? \nCUT TO: \nBLACK & WHITE \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCHARLIE and TERESA dash from a tenement doorway. CHARLIE is still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give the effect of being a bulky overcoat. \nTERESA (FRANTICALLY) The building on the corner. That one! He's been on the roof a half hour now! \nCHARLIE Now don't get excited. Don't get excited!! \nIt is very late and the streets are deserted. At the corner of the building in question, a few of JOHNNY BOY'S friends cling to the wall for safety. When they see CHARLIE and TERESA they call out. \nFRIENDS Charlie, stay there...He's crazy... He's got a 22. \nTERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the block and she leaves reluctantly. \nCHARLIE Johnny it's me, Charlie. \nJOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand. \nJOHNNY BOY Don't come any closer!!! \nCHARLIE Cut it out stupid. It's me. \nJOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run for the doorway of the building across the street. He enters the building that leads to the roof. \nBLACK & WHITE \nEXT. TENEMENT ROOF - NIGHT \nCHARLIE has reached the roof. \nJOHNNY BOY Charlie...pssst. Over here. \nHe laughs with glee. \nThey leave. \nINT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nCHARLIE is sitting in the corner. The restaurant is in the same condition that it was the last time he was there. While CHARLIE waits for his uncle in his semi-private corner, a handful of old Mafiosi, invited by GIOVANNI, sit at another table. GIOVANNI enters with MARIO. The old Mafiosi are greeted first. They rise and kiss GIOVANNI on the cheek. CHARLIE is very impressed at their respectful showing. The waitresses and everyone else in the club treat them all like royalty. \nCUT TO: \nOSCAR approaches the table where CHARLIE, GIOVANNI, and MARIO are seated and greets them warmly. \nOSCAR Put the menus away. I, personally do the cooking tonight. \nGIOVANNI Fine...that's why I'm here. \nMARIO Calamari? \nOSCAR Capozelle, Calamari...anything you want... \nGIOVANNI (POURING WINE) Drink. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - LATER IN THE MEAL \nOSCAR sits. \nOSCAR Giovanni...er...can I talk? \nRefering to CHARLIE. \nGIOVANNI nods his head yes. \nOSCAR About the place, Giovanni... \nGIOVANNI ...I know all about it. We'll discuss it later. \nOSCAR (CONTINUING) Our arrangements about the place haven't changed, have they? I mean... \nGIOVANNI (GOOD-NATUREDLY) No, no, not at all...look, we leave it the way it is for now, we talk later, understand? \nOSCAR (SOMEWHAT RELIEVED) Sure, Giovanni...I understand. I'll bring the clams now. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - DURING DINNER \nCHARLIE is visible awed by GIOVANNI and MARIO'S confidence and power. He is behaving as if he were at a job interview...very formally. CHARLIE had often had dinner with his uncle but this time the conversation is more pointed. Their conversation is mostly in ITALIAN WITH ENGLISH TITLES. They are discusssing GROPPI'S suicide. \nCHARLIE I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that? \nGIOVANNI Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... (HE SMILES) ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming? \nCHARLIE Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure. \nGIOVANNI (laughing to MARIO) You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it. \nCHARLIE Wasn't a book...was a short story. \nMARIO What was it? \nCHARLIE (EMBARRASSED) Nothing. \nMARIO No, c'mon...Y'know, I read. \nCHARLIE (MUTTERING) \"Francis Macomber.\" \nMARIO Wha? \nCHARLIE What do they expect you to say? \nGIOVANNI Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm \"cumpari\" with them...so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved. \nCHARLIE All right. \nMARIO Why don't you take a look around the place if you want? \nCHARLIE Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times. \nGIOVANNI Well, maybe you missed something? \nCHARLIE (CATCHING ON) Oh yeah, that's a possibility. \nCHARLIE heads for the kitchen. \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) ...looks good...things look good, if I may say so myself. Don't you agree? Unless there's something You know that I don't know? \nCUT TO: \nINT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCHARLIE is examining the kitchen closely. A black cook is working hard, taking a piece of meat off the grill. He carefully prepares a dish. \nCOOK Hi Charlie. \nCHARLIE smiles and moves in closer to the grill. The cook is sweating and mopping his brow. \nCOOK (CONTINUING) Man, it's hot as Hell in here, every day like going through Hell in here. \nCHARLIE moves in closer and the COOK continues preparing the food. \nCHARLIE (SMILING) Hot as hell...You're not the only one going through Hell kid. \nCOOK Maybe so...but at this pay it ain't worth it...that much I can tell you. \nCHARLIE hasn't been listening to the COOK. He has become fascinated with the flames on the grill. They remind him of an old device from his Catholic School days. CHARLIE brings his hand forward and closer to the fire, testing the pain of the \"Fires of Hell.\" \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) 'If thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 'Where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.' \nCHARLIE'S hand touches the flame. He winces. Music in. \nINT. TONY'S CAR (NEW CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE-TOP UP) - DAY \nCHARLIE, JOHNNY, TONY and JIMMY are driving along in TONY'S car. As they talk, a derelict takes advantage of a red light to wipe their windshield. \nTONY rolls up the window and rolls the car forward a bit to force the derelict out of the way. \nTONY Is it near Sullivan Street? \nJIMMY No - by Bedford. \nTONY Oh - you gotta show me. I always get lost in the village. \nCHARLIE Next time, bet with your own kind. \nJIMMY The number was 235 - I bet it combination. \nCHARLIE It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you. \nJIMMY I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt... \nJOHNNY BOY Yeah, yeah - enough. \nThey arrive at the bar. \nJOEY Hello Charlie, you canonized yet? \nJOEY We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we just don't like being moved in on. \nCHARLIE C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you? Let's have another drink and forget about it. \nThey drink again. JOEY gives JIMMY the money, JIMMY goes to count it. \nJOEY Don't count it...it's all there. \nJOHNNY BOY (SARCASTIC) Count it. \nJOEY Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends. \nJOEY extends his hand. JIMMY and CHARLIE shake. JOEY extends his hand to JOHNNY. \nJOHNNY BOY Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag. \nCHARLIE and the others \"Oh no.\" \nCHARLIE Shut up stupid. \nHe is interrupted by a flying fist. The fight breaks out anew. They barely make it to the door. JIMMY is out first, with his cash. They run down the street. The west side boys don't chase them but stand by their bar shouting after them. \nJOHNNY is laughing as he runs. CHARLIE yells at him. \nCHARLIE You got some mouth! \nJIMMY Johnny, you're a real jerk-off. \nJOHNNY BOY (LAUGHING) What're ya hollering? You got your money. \nThey reach the car. TONY heads in first behind the wheel. \nTONY (about to take off) Fuck youse all. \nThe others jump in. \nCHARLIE You got no honor Tony. Charge! \nThe car starts off. \nGarbage and garbage pails are tosses after them as the boys take off. \nINT. TONY'S PLACE \nCUT TO: \nA LONG-HAIRED ROCK GROUP \nThe lead guitarist holds his guitar out like a machine gun and strums frantically on it swinging it back and forth at the audience and then at the rest of the group. As he does so, the rest of the group falls \"dead\" over their instruments. The number is over and they all get up. The place is empty except for CHARLIE, TONY, and a few others, all of whom have been listening to the band. They applaude. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TONY'S PLACE \nCHARLIE is talking to the leader of the group. \nCHARLIE No, really, I liked it...thought it was great. \nBOY Thanks. \nCHARLIE What are your plans? \nBOY Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and... \nCHARLIE Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out... \nBOY Sounds good. \nCHARLIE Don't be smart. \nJOHNNY BOY I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember? \nTERESA is crying. \nJOHNNY BOY Don't be upset Teresa. You have to understand Charlie, here...he gives of himself to help others... \nTERESA I'm going to go home. \nJOHNNY BOY No, you stay. \nCHARLIE Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this... \nJOHNNY BOY (ANGRY) Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie... \nTERESA makes it to the door and opens it quickly. JOHNNY BOY grabs her to keep her from leaving. CHARLIE rushes towards them and pulls JOHNNY BOY away. By now, they are halfway down the hall. \nJOHNNY BOY (SHOUTING) Charlie...I always wondered about her...what happens when she comes? Does she get one of those fits? Eh? That would be something to see... \nJOHNNY BOY is interrupted by CHARLIE'S fist as it lands a solid punch on the right side of his hand. TERESA screams and rushes to separate them. \nJOHNNY BOY You rat bastard!! Don't hit me again!! \nCHARLIE stops. \nJOHNNY BOY I think I will fuckin go see your uncle right now...he'd be interested. \nCHARLIE rushes JOHNNY BOY towards the stairs. They bump into TERESA, slamming her against the wall. \nCHARLIE Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see what happens to you without me. \nTERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to CHARLIE'S uncle. \nTERESA No...no...don't. \nTERESA falls, hitting the stairs with a thud. She lies there moaning and tossing her head. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY go to help her. \nCHARLIE What do I do? You know anything about this? \nJOHNNY BOY steps over TERESA to go down the stairs. He turns. \nJOHNNY BOY I don't know...she's your girl...I gotta go. \nCHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is getting worse. \nJOHNNY BOY Hate to miss the floor show, though. \nCHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY. \nThe neighbors take over. One woman appears to know how to administer aid to TERESA. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S BUILDING - STAIRS \nJOHNNY BOY is halfway down the stairs by now. The neighbor takes care of TERESA. While CHARLIE dashes down the stairs, CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY in the ground floor hallway. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nIn the deserted factory section of Manhattan, JOHNNY BOY and CHARLIE stand next to a corregated metal garage door. CHARLIE smashes JOHNNY BOY against the door sending resounding echoes into the street. \nCHARLIE You crazy bastard! What are you trying to do, ruin me? \nJOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door again--again the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street. \nCHARLIE You... \nCHARLIE leans back into the seat and peeks out the window. \nCHARLIE No...don't stop...just pass real slow, OK? \nCHARLIE looks out the window and sees DIANE, the negro stripper. She is standing on the corner waiting for him. CHARLIE nods his head for the driver to stop. \nCHARLIE Stop here. (HE HESITATES) No...what am I...crazy??? Take me back to where you picked me up. \nCAB DRIVER (SIGHING) Ok. \nThe car drives away, passing DIANE who is on the corner. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TONY'S PLACE \nCHARLIE is back inside the club. \nJOHNNY BOY Back so soon. \nCHARLIE Mind your own business. \nTONY sets up drinks for them and pours them into shot glasses. \nCHARLIE strikes a match and lights each glass... little blue flames dance along the rims of the glasses. \nTERESA Hey, cut it out. Will ya? \nHe blows out the flames. CHARLIE moves to the other and of the room with his drink. \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) You can see things aren't going too well for me at the moment. My willpower and powers of persuasion are not what they usually are today. My ability to control events and situations are wanting. I know. I know...what can I say...I offer this as part of my penance. \nA young couple, two of the few people left in the place, are having a hushed quarrel at the end of the bar. The boy leaves for the men's room. \nCHARLIE (TO TONY) Who's the girl? \nTONY Jewish... \nCHARLIE How do you know? \nTONY Look at her. \nCHARLIE She don't look Jewish. \nTONY Sure she is. She's always in here with some different guy. You know the way they are. \nCHARLIE approaches the girl. \nCHARLIE I love you. \nThe girl looks at him, first embarrassed, then annoyed. \nCHARLIE (SMILING) Ever since that first day I saw you at the convent with the nuns, playing volleyball, I couldn't help myself. \nGIRL You Italian? \nCHARLIE Yeah why? \nGIRL You don't look it. \nThe girl laughs. Her boyfriend comes out of the men's room. He has her coat in his hand. \nGIRL (to the Boy) Fuck off. \nBOY (STUNNED) What do you mean? (he looks at CHARLIE) ...let's go. \nGIRL You go...I'm staying. \nThe last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian. \nSINGERS Good night...Good night...thank you...good night! \nThe band plays a few bars of \"Home Sweet Home.\" The singers throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go in. \nCUT TO: \nMICHAEL'S CAR - PARKED \nMICHAEL'S car is parked in a deserted area on the docks. He has his head in his hands. The BOY with him says nothing. \nCUT TO: \nSTREET CORNER \nCHARLIE is still in shock, sitting on the curb. \nThe police are still walking around in a businesslike manner. \nCHARLIE stares down at his feet. The wrecked car is being pulled away. \nCHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to himself and seems shocked and bewildered. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nEarly morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens. CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing something a little ominous. \nCHARLIE My uncle didn't come? \nMARIO says nothing, just nods at him to step outside. CHARLIE goes out into the street. MARIO follows. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThere is practically no one on the street. The early morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits at the bottom of the steps. \nMARIO (pauses for a moment) Giovanni says now he done enough. He got you outta jail. Now... (reaching in pocket) he wants you outta the way. \nMARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket. \nMARIO He says use it. Don't sell it. He says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe. \nCHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously uncomfortable. \nMARIO (ABRUPTLY) Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - DAY \nTONY'S car. He is driving CHARLIE to the airport. A suitcase can be seen in the back seat. \nTONY Where to? \nCHARLIE (PREOCCUPIED) Kennedy. \nTONY (trying to be jolly) I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'? \nCHARLIE It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350. \nTONY So? \nCHARLIE (EDGY) So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there. \n", "test1_input": "JOHNNY BOY is now by the window looking out at the fire escape mischieviously. \nJOHNNY BOY Yeah...you're right. Maybe she'll have a seizure and we can watch. \nHe laughs. CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head. \nCHARLIE That's not funny. You gonna be a jerk-off all your life. Grow up. You want something to eat from your aunt's house you go knock on her door, understand? \nJOHNNY BOY I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going to bed. \nJOHNNY BOY gets into bed. CHARLIE goes into the kitchen to get a glass of milk. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAYBREAK \nCHARLIE takes a glass of milk from the icebox. He listens to the sounds of the neighborhood waking up and getting ready to go to work. He leaves the kitchen. \nINT. BEDROOM - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAYBREAK \nCHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be asleep. CHARLIE goes to the window and peers through the blinds. He sees in the window across the fire escape. \nA SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various stages of getting dressed. \nTERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious relationships with men. She has however, been having an affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept secret from both families because the families regard each other as blood relations. \nCHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has begun to dial the telephone. \nJOHNNY BOY (pretending to be angry) Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I want to report a disturbance. Yeah this man and woman next door are disturbing the peace. They're keeping me awake all night now. What the hell is this. What? Well... yelling, fighting, throwing things. Uh-huh. If they don't kill each other soon I'm goin' over there and do the job myself. Yes - the address is 270 Mott street. I think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah, right... thanks. Look, I demand immediate action. Never mind my name I don't like getting involved in things like this. \nHe hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed. CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at TERESA but she is no longer in her room. \nINT. TERESA'S BEDROOM \nCHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out in pain. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MID-DAY \nCHARLIE and TERESA are in the hotel room making love. The sounds of traffic can be heard from the street below. \nCUT TO: \nThey are getting dressed. \nTERESA I'd like to eat something before I go back to work. \nCHARLIE Ok, we'll go for lunch. \nTERESA Do you have enough? \nCHARLIE checks his wallet. \nCHARLIE Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen... \nTERESA Here. \nShe hands him a few bills. He hesitates. \nTERESA Please take it. \nCHARLIE Well... \nTERESA I don't mind. \nShe puts the money into his hand. \nCHARLIE Sure...it's not that...I mean... \nTERESA (touching his face) It's all right. \n", "test1_true": "TERESA An apartment uptown? Downtown? \nCHARLIE Maybe, who knows. \nTERESA (SEARCHINGLY) Charlie...? \nCHARLIE Nobody knows anything, believe me. \nShe kisses him gently. \nCUT TO: \nTERESA is putting on her stockings. A few minutes have passed. \nCHARLIE See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place. \nTERESA Anything specific? \nCHARLIE You know...like restaurants, night clubs... \nTERESA (AFFECTIONATELY) What is it now? \nCHARLIE Don't ask. \nHe gives her a quick kiss on the tip of her nose. \nTERESA Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night? \nCHARLIE Did you? \nTERESA No. \nCHARLIE CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though. \nTERESA It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal. \nCHARLIE You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing. \nTERESA It's still sick. \nCHARLIE Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food. \nTERESA laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly. \nTERESA You're sure he doesn't know. \nHe takes her in his arms. \nCHARLIE Don't worry. \nINT. HOTEL - BATHROOM - MID-DAY \nCHARLIE enters the bathroom to clean-up. He stares at his image in the mirror for a moment, then makes a face. He checks the whiteness of his teeth, pulls back his hair, and checks his complexion. The mirror image begins to speak. The CAMERA PANS BACK to CHARLIE'S FACE. His mouth is not moving. \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) Don't look at me like that, I can see this is not going to get us anywhere. She's a good kid, what am I supposed to do. In a way I'm doing her a favor...no??? How many guys you know feel this way about an epileptic? Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint...not yet. \nThe image of CHARLIE in the bathroom intercuts with stills from Catholic School text books - vulgar color illustrations of parables - emphasis on Christ expelling the devils from the posessed women. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUING) But I'm not like the Pharisee who said \"Oh God I thank thee that I am not like the rest of them.\"...no...I like to think of myself as the Publican... \nHe strikes his breast penitently as he delivers the next line. \nCHARLIE ...'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner!' I'm not taking advantage of her. I swear to you that if she meets someone she'd like to marry... \nBack to CHARLIE in sync. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUED) ...I'll cut out. \"If Thy eye is an occasion of sin to thee... \n", "test1_id": 1215, "test2_input": "CHARLIE We'll be here. \nMICHAEL is sarcastic. He points to the parked car in front of him. \nMICHAEL I tell you, Charlie. If that kid doesn't show up tonight... \nMICHAEL'S plan is seen on the screen as he speaks. \nMICHAEL ...I'm gonna find him, drag him down here, tie one of his legs to that Ford bumper over here... \nJOHNNY BOY is dragged to the car and MICHAEL'S friend ties his leg to the car. \nMICHAEL ...and his other leg to that Chrysler over there. \nJOHNNY BOY'S other leg is tied to the Chrysler. \nMICHAEL ...and bam!!! \nWe see a close-up of a foot slamming down on the gas pedal, twice. One car heads for the West Side--the other to the East Side. Tires screech and exhaust fumes fill the air. \nAll three laugh. \nCHARLIE Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him? \nMICHAEL Whatever. \nCHARLIE leaves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE is on the phone trying to locate JOHNNY BOY. TERESA is pacing back and forth nervously in the background. CHARLIE hangs up. \nCHARLIE Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight? \nTERESA For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing. (she moves closer) Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me? \nCHARLIE turns and smiles at her. He kisses her because he doesn't feel like listening. TERESA is too preoccupied to respond. CHARLIE turns. \nCHARLIE (MUTTERING) ...that sonofabitch. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY walking through Greenwich Village looking around as if being chased. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE is kissing TERESA who is still very upset. \nTERESA But Charlie...it's uptown and it's perfect. It's big enough for two people...she's going to get out by the end of the month. If you don't act right away, it'll go in no time. What do you think? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY is making his way back to the apartment by sneaking along the sides of the buildings in the darkened street. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE tries to make love to TERESA out of his nervous energy and impatience at waiting so long for JOHNNY BOY. TERESA is rejecting his attempts. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY imagines he is being followed and dashes into the door of a nearby building and up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE is doubly frustrated by TERESA'S rejection of his attempts at lovemaking because of his concern for JOHNNY BOY. He becomes sarcastic and abrupt. \nTERESA Don't you realize what that apartment means? \nCHARLIE doesn't answer. TERESA continues. \nTERESA Do you? For both of us. Think... after a while you might even be able to move in yourself. \nCHARLIE laughs. TERESA is visibly shaken but CHARLIE cannot be bothered. \nCHARLIE Are you serious? Me move in with you. You crazy? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY is silhouetted against the moonlight. He makes his way quietly over the roofs of the tenements and climbs down CHARLIE'S fire escape. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE (CONTINUES) Teresa, get these ideas out of your head...I've got enough on my hands right now...with that bastard cousin of yours. You wanna move? Go ahead. By all means! But keep me out of it...I've got nothing to do with it...you understand...nothing. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE'S WINDOW \nJOHNNY BOY is at CHARLIE's window. Through it he can see TERESA lying on the bed in tears and CHARLIE pacing back and forth across the room. \nHe is still talking loudly, JOHNNY BOY doesn't seem to pay any attention to the fact that TERESA is in CHARLIE'S bedroom. He opens the window and jumps in, smiling sarcastically. TERESA and CHARLIE are startled. CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY BOY by his coat collar. \nCHARLIE Where were you? Answer me, you sonofabitch! Where were you? \nTERESA is frightened and rushes towards CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY reacts to the scene with uncontrolled laughter. CHARLIE is outraged and slaps him across the face but JOHNNY continues to laugh. TERESA screams. \nCHARLIE (TO TERESA) Shut up! \nJOHNNY BOY (TO TERESA) Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie. \nCHARLIE flings JOHNNY BOY against a wardrobe, letting go of his collar. \nCHARLIE You had me going crazy! \nTERESA is crying. JOHNNY goes into the kitchen and CHARLIE follows. TERESA stays in the doorway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nJOHNNY BOY takes a drink of water from the sink as he talks. CHARLIE is calmer now; calm enough to realize that JOHNNY has figured out his true relationship to TERESA. He tries to protect himself. \nCHARLIE Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling... \nJOHNNY BOY Oh, that's too bad, Teresa... \nCHARLIE is embarrassed and TERESA is afraid. \nJOHNNY BOY (CONTINUES) Well kids...have the bans been announced yet? \n", "test2_id": 1216, "test3_input": "MICHAEL You're not going to use that gun, Johnny. \nJOHNNY BOY doesn't answer but holds the gun straight at MICHAEL'S face. MICHAEL turns to go, defying JOHNNY BOY. His friends follow. When he reaches the doorway, he turns. \nMICHAEL You don't have the guts to use that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony, and of course you John...be seeing you. \nThey leave. \nJOHNNY BOY is still frozen with the gun in his hand, pointing it at mid-air. CHARLIE slams JOHNNY BOY across the face with his fist. TONY takes the gun from his hand. \nCHARLIE You stupid bastard! Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it. \nHe hits JOHNNY BOY again. \nTONY (HOLDING GUN) ...No bullets in it. \nCHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY again. \nTONY Get out of here before this really goes up. \nCHARLIE Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean? \nTONY (RELUCTANTLY) Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands. \nCUT TO: \nSCENE FROM \"TOMB OF LIGEIA\" \nA young girl is in her room with her maid. The maid is helping her dress. Eerie music creates a frightening atmosphere. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY watch nervously affected by the film's mood. The theatre is a 42nd street one with lots of sleeping drunks. \nSuddenly, the maid's face begins to contort as if she's seeing something horrible. The audience is on edge. The young girl sees the maid and shouts \"What is it?\" - but the maid only sneezes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NIGHT - TONY'S CONVERTIBLE - BLACK AND WHITE \nCHARLIE is driving. JOHNNY BOY is beside him in the front seat. The top od the car is down and CHARLIE is driving with no particular destination in mind. \nJOHNNY BOY I think we should see your uncle. \nCHARLIE No. \nJOHNNY BOY This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame. \nCHARLIE Forget it. \nJOHNNY BOY What are you going to do? Hide me? \nCHARLIE Good idea. \nJOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock song. \nCHARLIE (CONFESSION) I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned...more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord? I know penance is penance but this is something else. \nJOHNNY BOY opens his eyes. \nJOHNNY BOY What are you talking to yourself??? \nHe turns up the radio. \nCHARLIE (SARCASTIC) Go ahead! Play the radio...play music...you're going to a party... louder! Go ahead. Louder. A party. Lots of fun. \nA black sedan has been driving along parallel to CHARLIE'S car, unnoticed by CHARLIE. Otherwise the street is deserted. The car begins to drive CHARLIE off the road. \nCHARLIE Hey, what is this guy, crazy? \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "BLACK SEDAN - MICHAEL AND ANOTHER BOY. \nVOICE Now, now's the time! \nCHARLIE turns his head to look. JOHNNY BOY looks up. They fire the gun. \nCUT TO: \nFULL COLOR SHOTS \nA barage of bullets (5 gunshots) hit CHARLIE'S car. CHARLIE is hit in the hand. JOHNNY BOY has been hit in the throat. He stands up and leans over the windshield of the car, spewing blood onto it and into the wind. He is screaming. The black sedan turns onto another street. \nCUT TO: \nTONY'S CONVERTIBLE \nCHARLIE is so shocked that the car is completely out of control. It goes screeching along the street, swerves, and slams into a fire hydrant, breaking it off and causing water to shoot out onto the sidewalk, car and street. CHARLIE has been thrown from the car. He kneels in the street holding his wrist. He is on the yellow letters \"FIRE LANE.\" JOHNNY BOY lies against the side of a building--still. CHARLIE goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand. The police arrive with their guns drawn. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET \nBack in the neighborhood, the religious fiesta is ending. The singers on the bandstand are singing the last song of the evening, \"Vincino Amare.\" A crowd of elderly Italian- Americans stand below the bandstand and listen. There are four singers, their voices projected through a PA system. \nMUSIC: \nCONTINUES THROUGH ALL CUTS. \nCUT TO: \nTERESA'S ROOM \nTERESA is in bed, asleep. The music can be heard echoing in the background. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET CORNER \nCHARLIE is still sitting on the curb holding his injured wrist. The ambulance and the police are going about their business. A crowd has gathered. \nCUT TO: \nGIOVANNI'S LIVING ROOM \nGIOVANNI is watching the Late Late Show on T.V. (Car explosion scene from \"The Big Heat\"). Aside from the light of the screen, the room is darkened. \nCUT TO: \nALL NIGHT VILLAGE LUNCHEONETTE \nDIANE is alone, sipping coffee. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET CORNER \nThe police are standing around CHARLIE with open notebooks, questioning him. He doesn't answer. JOHNNY BOY'S body is being taken into the ambulance. \nCUT TO: \nTONY'S PLACE - MEN'S ROOM \nTONY is relieving himself. He washes his hands. \nCUT TO: \nNEIGHBORHOOD STREET \n", "test3_id": 1217}

{"test1_input": "GEORGE We're closed. \nBOY I'm just waiting for Joey. \nThe BOY walks over to a bar stool and sits down. Nobody acknowledges his presence. \nSuddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up, dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to look up at him. The DRUNK stares ahead for a minute. \nDRUNK (MUTTERS) I...I gotta go to the bathroom. \nEVERYONE laughs. \nCHARLIE Well, go ahead, whaddaya want? Someone to hold it for you? \nMore laughter. Even the BOY at the bar laughs. The DRUNK rises, still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room. \nThe Big Bopper - \"Chantilly Lace\" in playing on the soundtrack. CHARLIE is playing with a deck of cards. \nCHARLIE (continuing previous conversation) This place is dead. If I had a place...every night...lively. \nJOHNNY BOY is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation. \nCHARLIE (CONTINUING) And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE... (MORE CONFIDENTIALLY) I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it? \nTONY (QUIETLY) You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do. \nCHARLIE Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh? \nJOHNNY BOY Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what? \nTONY We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves. \nCHARLIE Don't forget what's-his-name there in the bathroom. \nEVERYONE laughs. JIMMY is drawing on a table top. CHARLIE wanders over. \nJIMMY Wanna see your picture? \nCHARLIE leans over. OVERHEAD VIEW shows large crude swastika. \nJIMMY Waddaya think? \nCHARLIE Not quite...but keep trying. \nCHARLIE picks up the cards again. \nCHARLIE Let's have a game after we close. \nJOHNNY BOY Nah. \nCHARLIE C'mon Tony, waddaya say? \nTONY No. \nCHARLIE (ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE BAR) Anybody wanna have a game? \nThe people in the bar do not respond. CHARLIE shrugs. The BOY casually leaves the bar and walks to the men's room. \nINT. MENS ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT \nThe BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back. To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat. They struggle in the open doorway. \nINT. BAR AREA - NIGHT \nThe Italian music is still playing. Everyone in the bar has frozen in position as they watch the scene. \nIn his astonishment CHARLIE allows the cards to fall from his hands. \n", "test1_true": "The DRUNK, running only on sheet determination, stumbles along after the boy. \nThe people in the bar, including CHARLIE, dash behind tables and jump behind the bar for cover. \nINT. TONY'S PLACE - STAIRWAY EXIT \nThe BOY reaches the exit and fires at the DRUNK from the top of the stairs. The DRUNK still follows. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE \nThe BOY runs down the street and disappears into the darkness. The DRUNK staggers out into hte cobblestone street. His mind is gone, it is now just a physical matter of the body being stopped by the presence of a stationary object. \nHe staggers straight across the street at tremendous speed smashing directly into a parked car. \nEXT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE \nEveryone (including the two GAYS at the bar) is running out the back way. \nTONY Don't run...don't run. Everyone split up. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE \nMICHAEL and JIMMY turn the corner and calmly walk to his parked car. As they get into the car CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY turn the corner. \nCHARLIE Michael, give us a lift. \nMICHAEL OK, get in. \nAs they are getting into the car the two GAYS turn the corner. One of them, SAMMY, is very drunk and is crying hysterically. His companion BENTON is trying to calm him down when he notices MICHAEL. \nBENTON Michael...wait. \nIt is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly ushers them into the car. \nMICHAEL Get in, get in. \nINT. MICHAEL'S CAR - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE \nCHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are in the back seat. SAMMY crawls over CHARLIE into the back seat making apologies. BENTON is forced into the front seat with MICHAEL and JIMMY. They drive off, with SAMMY crying. \nCHARLIE Oh Jesus Christ...what's this. \nBENTON Sammy get control of yourself. \nJOHNNY BOY Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie. \nCHARLIE Should I slap him? \nSAMMY (suddenly in control) You wouldn't dare. \nBENTON I'm terribly sorry guys...It's just that he was terribly frightened. \nMICHAEL Just keep him quiet. \nJOHNNY BOY Friends of yours Michael. \nMICHAEL Shut up. \nBENTON (sensing the hostility) Oh...ah...I'm Benton and this is Sammy. \nCHARLIE I can't get over the way he just kept going at him. \nJOHNNY BOY Must have been all the liquor in him. \nMICHAEL (IN ITALIAN) Quiet please. \nHe returns to English. \n", "test1_id": 1215, "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nStills of girls, sexy pornographic nude magazine spreads. \nCHARLIE ...pluck it out and cast it from thee.\" \"Woe to the man through whom scandal does come.\" I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down.

Even so the last shall be first and the... \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE in sync. \nCHARLIE ...first last. For many are called but few are chosen.\" \nINT. RESTAURANT - MID-DAY \nCHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant. This restaurant was considered an above average business with quality and prices to match when it was first opened three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it. He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on the table. He takes a menu. \nA chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted. \nOSCAR (with a slight Jewish accent) Hey...you're here. They told me you're here...and you're here. How are you? \nCHARLIE Ok, how's everything going? \nOSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE. \nOSCAR Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh? \nCHARLIE No. \nOSCAR I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that? \nCHARLIE (LAUGHING) What pipes? \nOSCAR (MIMICKING) What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes. \nCHARLIE shakes his head in sympathy. \nOSCAR Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing. There is nothing to give him. No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing. \nCHARLIE That bad, huh? \nOSCAR I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either. \nCHARLIE Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me. \nOSCAR Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old. \nCHARLIE He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that. \nOSCAR Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him. Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place. And tell me why should I care? I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems. I should go back to Florida...I don't need this. \nCHARLIE I don't understand, where's Groppi? \nOSCAR I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself? \nCHARLIE My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself. \nOSCAR What can I say? \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side. A noisy religious street festival is being held on the block. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle GIOVANNI and his associates. \nGIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a head figure not by being introduced formally as was the custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man. \nGIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian. \nA man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in the corner of the room in the luncheonette area. \nCHARLIE (to repair man) Is my uncle back there? \nCHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway. \nREPAIR MAN Yeah, but I think he's busy now. Hey Charlie play 463 today - for sure. \nCHARLIE Thanks! \nCHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle. \nMARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest associate, brought into the organization in the traditional manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders). He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE. \nMARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by unnoticed and walks into the bathroom. \nCHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the conversation. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nGIOVANNI and MARIO are calmly sipping their coffee as they listen to the old man's nervous talk. \nOLD MAN (in Italian with ENGLISH TITLES) What I'm telling you is that he did it for Mario's honor. \nMARIO But you don't understand. I knew the kid. He was drunk. He made of fool of himself...not me. \nOLD MAN (in Italian with ENGLISH TITLES) Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an insult to you. \nMARIO There was no insult. \nOLD MAN (in Italian with ENGLISH TITLES) The boy only did what was right. \nGIOVANNI Your son only did what was stupid. We have enough down here without something like that. And what for? ...Nothing...no reason. Protect him? Why? I didn't tell him to do anything for me. He's going to Miami? Good...keep him in Miami for six months...a year...a good long time. After everything's forgotten then I see what I can do for him. Right now...keep him away. \nINT. LUNCHEONETTE AREA - DAY \nCHARLIE is seated at a table. The waitress, MARIE, approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... The following scene is reminiscent of a TELEVISION COMMERCIAL. \nCHARLIE Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee? \nMARIE I dunno. \nCHARLIE Just a second. Let me taste it. \nHe pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head. \nCHARLIE Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%. \nMARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues. \nCHARLIE You see. You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees. \nMARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table. CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it. \nCHARLIE Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box. \nFrom time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who is busy with her work. \nBLACK & WHITE & COLOR \nThe images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS: stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise vision of the neighborhood. All this is intercut with CHARLIE mentally stripping MARIE's clothes off with his eyes. \n", "test2_id": 1216, "test3_input": "CHARLIE We'll be here. \nMICHAEL is sarcastic. He points to the parked car in front of him. \nMICHAEL I tell you, Charlie. If that kid doesn't show up tonight... \nMICHAEL'S plan is seen on the screen as he speaks. \nMICHAEL ...I'm gonna find him, drag him down here, tie one of his legs to that Ford bumper over here... \nJOHNNY BOY is dragged to the car and MICHAEL'S friend ties his leg to the car. \nMICHAEL ...and his other leg to that Chrysler over there. \nJOHNNY BOY'S other leg is tied to the Chrysler. \nMICHAEL ...and bam!!! \nWe see a close-up of a foot slamming down on the gas pedal, twice. One car heads for the West Side--the other to the East Side. Tires screech and exhaust fumes fill the air. \nAll three laugh. \nCHARLIE Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him? \nMICHAEL Whatever. \nCHARLIE leaves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE is on the phone trying to locate JOHNNY BOY. TERESA is pacing back and forth nervously in the background. CHARLIE hangs up. \nCHARLIE Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight? \nTERESA For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing. (she moves closer) Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me? \nCHARLIE turns and smiles at her. He kisses her because he doesn't feel like listening. TERESA is too preoccupied to respond. CHARLIE turns. \nCHARLIE (MUTTERING) ...that sonofabitch. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY walking through Greenwich Village looking around as if being chased. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE is kissing TERESA who is still very upset. \nTERESA But Charlie...it's uptown and it's perfect. It's big enough for two people...she's going to get out by the end of the month. If you don't act right away, it'll go in no time. What do you think? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY is making his way back to the apartment by sneaking along the sides of the buildings in the darkened street. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE tries to make love to TERESA out of his nervous energy and impatience at waiting so long for JOHNNY BOY. TERESA is rejecting his attempts. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY imagines he is being followed and dashes into the door of a nearby building and up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE is doubly frustrated by TERESA'S rejection of his attempts at lovemaking because of his concern for JOHNNY BOY. He becomes sarcastic and abrupt. \nTERESA Don't you realize what that apartment means? \nCHARLIE doesn't answer. TERESA continues. \nTERESA Do you? For both of us. Think... after a while you might even be able to move in yourself. \nCHARLIE laughs. TERESA is visibly shaken but CHARLIE cannot be bothered. \nCHARLIE Are you serious? Me move in with you. You crazy? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE \nJOHNNY BOY is silhouetted against the moonlight. He makes his way quietly over the roofs of the tenements and climbs down CHARLIE'S fire escape. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nCHARLIE (CONTINUES) Teresa, get these ideas out of your head...I've got enough on my hands right now...with that bastard cousin of yours. You wanna move? Go ahead. By all means! But keep me out of it...I've got nothing to do with it...you understand...nothing. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE'S WINDOW \nJOHNNY BOY is at CHARLIE's window. Through it he can see TERESA lying on the bed in tears and CHARLIE pacing back and forth across the room. \nHe is still talking loudly, JOHNNY BOY doesn't seem to pay any attention to the fact that TERESA is in CHARLIE'S bedroom. He opens the window and jumps in, smiling sarcastically. TERESA and CHARLIE are startled. CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY BOY by his coat collar. \nCHARLIE Where were you? Answer me, you sonofabitch! Where were you? \nTERESA is frightened and rushes towards CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY reacts to the scene with uncontrolled laughter. CHARLIE is outraged and slaps him across the face but JOHNNY continues to laugh. TERESA screams. \nCHARLIE (TO TERESA) Shut up! \nJOHNNY BOY (TO TERESA) Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie. \nCHARLIE flings JOHNNY BOY against a wardrobe, letting go of his collar. \nCHARLIE You had me going crazy! \nTERESA is crying. JOHNNY goes into the kitchen and CHARLIE follows. TERESA stays in the doorway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT \nJOHNNY BOY takes a drink of water from the sink as he talks. CHARLIE is calmer now; calm enough to realize that JOHNNY has figured out his true relationship to TERESA. He tries to protect himself. \nCHARLIE Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling... \nJOHNNY BOY Oh, that's too bad, Teresa... \nCHARLIE is embarrassed and TERESA is afraid. \nJOHNNY BOY (CONTINUES) Well kids...have the bans been announced yet? \n", "test3_id": 1217}

{"train": "RUSH \nWritten by \nPeter Morgan \nDecember 6th, 2011 \n1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1 \nDark clouds passing overhead. \nThe bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in Germany), the past three days is on it's way out.. \n2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2 \nA pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares. Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations.. \n3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3 \nThe first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of international TV commentators in different languages. \nCOMMENTATORS ...in places the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting the decision has been taken. The race is going ahead... \n4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4 \nThe eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER wearing a fireproof balaclava... \nHighly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA. \nNIKI (V/O) My grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live, or how much we achieve - we are remembered for very little. So make sure it's the right things. \nNIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision... \nIs it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be using slicks or wets? \n5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5 \nWe widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major Grand Prix. All around us... \n(CONTINUED) 5   CONTINUED:                                                       5 \nEngines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, \"One Minute\"... \nDeafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently. \nNIKI This is bullshit. We have no control over our legacy. We cannot choose what we are remembered for... \nA Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian above the noise, (we see sub-titles)... \nMECHANIC Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare anche tu? (Mass is going on slicks. You want to change?) \nNIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres. \nNIKI Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole. And the 1976 season. \nNIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him. Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack... \nNIKI What about Hunt? Has he changed? \nMECHANIC No, he's going on wets. \nThe car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews, mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on.. \nThe Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1. \nNIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS.. \nNIKI I don't know why it became such a big thing. We were just drivers. Busting each other's balls. To me this is perfectly normal. But other people saw it differently. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   5 \nNIKI (cont\u00edd) That whatever it was between us went deeper. And changed us both somehow. Forever. \nNIKI stares, then... \nNIKI Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato. (Then we go on wets, too.) \nThe ten-second board is held up. \nNIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a split-second, eyes staring... \nNIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000 RPM. \nNIKI Maybe that explains the state of mind I was in. And why it happened. The other thing I'm remembered for. (a beat) On August 1st, that same year... \nCAPTION: \"AUGUST 1st, 1976\". \n9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9 \nWe're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring.. \nFinally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her- feet, breathlessly picks up the phone. \nNURSE Emergency... \nShe covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is being said. Then her expression changes... \nNURSE Okay...standing by! \nThe NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR colleagues... \nNURSE That was the race-track..! There's been an accident..! A driver's been injured and is on his way in..! \nInstantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma... \nAll PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way. \nThe NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by... \nCAPTION: \"EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER\" \nSwing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks through and into the accident and emergency unit. \nCamera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT, (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair... \nA man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to describe an Englishman. SEXY. \nBlood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous.. \n(CONTINUED) 9    CONTINUED:                                                       9 \nJAMES I think the racetrack telephoned ahead that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..? \nJAMES notices all the NURSES staring.. \nJAMES What's the matter? No one seen a spot of blood before? \nNURSE Are you all right? \nJAMES Absolutely fine. \n10   INT. A&E UNIT - DAY                                              10 \nThe attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls, checking for wounds, cuts and bruises... \nNURSE We all thought you'd been in an accident. \nJAMES I have. If you call a friendly disagreement with another driver an accident. \nNURSE What did you disagree about? \nJAMES None of your business. Ouch. \nNURSE Sorry. \nJAMES His wife. \nNURSE That's going to need a couple of stitches. It's a nasty cut. \nJAMES It was a nasty blow. Done with a bloody spanner. \nNURSE Why? What did you do? \n(CONTINUED) 10   CONTINUED:                                                      10 \nJAMES Nothing! Only what she begged me to do. \nThe NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest... \nNURSE Which was..? \nShe examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest.. \nJAMES looks up. Their eyes meet.. \nJAMES Be happy to show you if you like. \n11   INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  11 \n`Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes... \nThe apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two budgerigars. \nA mattress on the floor. \nNIKI Thank you. \nA silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)... \nNIKI Worked here long? \nAGNES Excuse me? \nNIKI Just wondered if you've worked here long? \nAGNES Almost eight years. \nNIKI That long? And they didn't promote you yet? \nAGNES Yes, several times. I am the AGNES. Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for the receptionist, she's on her lunch. \nNIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to say something when the door opens, and... \nTwo other F1 DRIVERS walk in.. \n(CONTINUED) 30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  30 \nGlamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars, they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES. \nWhat are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it. What have you done to the weather? \nThey make her laugh. And smile. \nNIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect him. \nAs he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the other DRIVERS. Intrigued. \nHe's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes. \n31   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                         31 \nThe car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team... \nSTANLEY Niki, let me introduce you to our number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise.. \nThe intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands. \nSTANLEY And these are your mechanics, reporting exclusively to you. As per contract... \nREGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS. \nMECHANIC You want to see the car? \n32   INT/EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                     32 \nNIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just above the driver's helmet... \nMECHANIC There she is. The P160.. \nNIKI Same as Regazzoni's? \n(CONTINUED) 32   CONTINUED:                                                     32 \nMECHANIC Identical in every detail. \nNIKI scrutinizes the car... \nNIKI She looks heavy. How much does she weigh? \nMECHANIC 540 kilos. \nNIKI That's crazy. Why so heavy..? \nMECHANIC It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing weighs 190k alone. \nNIKI What horsepower are you getting out of it? \nMECHANIC \nNIKI Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the engine needs to be 20k lighter. \nMECHANIC We already tried... \nNIKI Did you use magnesium parts? \nThe MECHANICS look at one another skeptically... \n33   INT. BRM WORKSHOPS - NIGHT                                      33 \nShooting from above: \nThe entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now spread all over the workshop floor. \nCLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe. \nHe removes his helmet, then stops. \nIn the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off.. \n40   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY         40 \nNIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees... \nCLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks English with an Italian accent.. \nREGAZZONI I know what you're going to say. That it's none of my business... \nNIKI What? \nREGAZZONI If it's the Track Manager you're taking on your date tonight? \nNIKI immediately becomes defensive... \nNIKI It's none of your business. \nREGAZZONI Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd let this one go. I'm not questioning your taste. She's a great girl. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 40   CONTINUED:                                                      40 \nREGAZZONI (cont\u00edd) But Agnes's last boyfriend was a British Formula 2 driver, who has a reputation for two things. For being a suicidal jerk on the track, and for going all night, and all day afterwards...and all night again in bed. He's an OK driver, but an IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't know about you, but that's not an act I'd like to follow. (shrugs) But if that doesn't bother you... \nNIKI What's his name? The driver? \nREGAZZONI Hunt. James Hunt. \nNIKI stares. Can hardly believe it. \nREGAZZONI See? You share information, I share information. \nCLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers.. \nREGAZZONI That's what team-mates are for. \nNIKI (quiet/defeated) Thanks. \n41   EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                          41 \nA restaurant in Marseilles. Through the window we can see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER sitting at a table alone. Waiting for NIKI. \nReverse angle to reveal: \n42   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ MARSEILLES STREET - SAME TIME                   42 \nNIKI is sitting in a car across the street. He stares at AGNES in the restaurant. Then starts his car, and drives off. \nFADE TO BLACK: \n43   EXT. EASTON NESTON - HESKETH RACING HQ - DAY                     43 \nEaston Neston. Set in 3,300 acres, one of England's great country houses. Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700. \nJAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his anything but grandiose Mini. It splutters to a stop, just in time. \nThey are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags from his filthy car. \n44   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY              44 \nThe Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted stables on the estate. HESKETH leads a blindfolded JAMES in... \nHESKETH Keep them closed...! Wait for it, wait for it... \nHESKETH removes JAMES's blindfold... \nHESKETH There! What do you say? \nJAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain white, no stickers... \nHESKETH Isn't she a beauty? The March 731. Converted by the brilliant Doc..! \nDOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER.. \nJAMES She is a beauty. But...haven't you made a mistake? \nHESKETH What? \nJAMES That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1. \nHESKETH She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got together with the beancounters, and it turns out that the economics of F1 are not so significantly different to the economics of Formula 2... \nBUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue.. \nJAMES What was the description? \nSUZY Mostly positive in terms of appearance. Negative only in terms of character. I've been told to avoid you. \nJAMES By whom? \nSUZY Alex. He says you're a bad boy. \n(CONTINUED) 68   CONTINUED: (2)                                              68 \nJAMES Was. Not any more. New me very professional. Early to bed. Early to rise. All very dull. \nSUZY Really? \nJAMES Round-the-clock work, practise and focus. Tedious, but apparently the only way to vin against ze Goosestepper.. \nSUZY Is that what you were doing when you came in? \nJAMES Visualization techniques. Memorizing the circuit, in this case Monaco, which is next up. Eyes closed, know your way round in your sleep... (a beat) I know...I've always been a great believer in getting there on the day, putting the old foot down and playing chicken with everyone else. \nSUZY laughs.. \nJAMES But they don't want me to do that anymore...they want my body like a temple. My mind like Monk. \nSUZY And your soul? Your heart? \nJAMES What does that mean? \nSUZY You can't be so disciplined in all areas of your life, can you..? \nJAMES They want me to stop messing around, get married and settle down with the next nice girl I meet. They think it would be good for me. \nSUZY What do you think? \n(CONTINUED) 68   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  68 \nJAMES Sounds bloody awful. \nSUZY laughs again... \nJAMES But since they're right about most things, they're probably right about that, too. \nJAMES looks SUZY up and down... \nJAMES You don't fancy getting married, do you? \n69   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - LONDON - DAY                      69 \nThe sound of ringing bells. London's grandest Catholic church in the heart of Knightsbridge.. \n70   OMITTED                                                          70 \n71   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - DAY                               71 \nJAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church. \nJAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and BUBBLES. \nThey make their way to the waiting convoy of cars... \nOn his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the crowd.. \nSUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even than JAMES. JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH... \nJAMES What's up? \nBUBBLES Nothing. I don't want to ruin your day. \nBUBBLES stares, then reluctantly... \n(CONTINUED) 71   CONTINUED:                                                      71 \nBUBBLES It seems your revenge against the Goosestepper might have to wait a little longer than you'd hoped. (a beat) He's just been signed by Ferrari. \nJAMES WHAT??? But that's the best team in the world. They could have ANYONE. Did he pay his way in there, too? \nBUBBLES Apparently they took back Regazzoni and he insisted they give Lauda a trial. Thinks he's a genius. Setting up the cars... \nJAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with SUZY and her FAMILY. \n72   EXT. FIORANO - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY                              72 \nFERRARI's state-of-the-art practise facilities and private test-track in Northern Italy. \n72A INT. FERRARI CONTROL ROOM                                        72A \nClosed circuit television, with 10 cameras and a complex track timing system and computers.... \nNIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front door opens... \nAnd a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress. \nNIKI Are you leaving? \nMARLENE Yes. \nNIKI Can you give me a lift to the nearest town? Anywhere with a train station. \nMARLENE Sure. Nearest town is half an hour's drive. Get in. \n77   OMITTED                                                          77 \n78   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                  78 \nThe car drives. The radio plays. Marlene sings along. NIKI can't help noticing something. He turns down the music. MARLENE's smile fades.. \nMARLENE What are you doing? \n(CONTINUED) 78   CONTINUED:                                            78 \nNIKI You hear that noise when you accelerate? \nMARLENE No. \nNIKI Your drive belt is loose. \nMARLENE My what? \nNIKI Alternator. And when you brake, your foot goes all the way down. Means there's air in the system. \nMARLENE Anything else? \nNIKI No. Apart from the rear brakes are imbalanced. The front right wheel is flat, and it feels like a crack in the engine block...which explains why you're drifting so much. \nMARLENE How can you tell? \nNIKI My ass. \nMARLENE What? \nNIKI God gave me an OK mind, but a really good ass, which can feel everything in a car. \nMARLENE You don't know what you're talking about. The car is fine. And it just had a service a week ago. \nNIKI Not a good one. \nMARLENE A very good one. From a proper garage. It cost a fortune. This car is good as new. Relax. \n79   EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY                             79 \nWhite smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down. Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail. \nNIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine. \nNIKI's hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease. \nNIKI Nothing I can do here. The car needs a garage. \nMARLENE I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are you? \nNIKI No. As long as I'm back in Maranello by Monday morning. \nNIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb... \nMARLENE So who are you anyway? \nMARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)... \nMARLENE You're from Vienna, aren't you. We can speak German. How do you know Curd? \nNIKI Who's Curd? \nMARLENE Curd Jurgens. The actor. It's his house. He is, or was until yesterday, my boyfriend. I must have been mad! There is something very attractive about an older man when they behave like one. But when they behave like a frightened child.. \nMARLENE gets to her feet... \nMARLENE C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll never get out of here. We're in Italy, after all. \nMARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs.. \n(CONTINUED) 79   CONTINUED:                                                      79 \nSSSCCCREEEEEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!! \nImmediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI... \nCommentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique, maturity and performance. But then, \"Puff\", a plume of smoke comes out of JAMES's engine. The engine has blown... \nImmediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag. \nTelevision commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI LAUDA has become world champion... \n82   EXT. FERRARI PITS/USA GP TRACK SIDE - DAY                        82 \nNIKI's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO... \n(CONTINUED) 82   CONTINUED:                                                     82 \n...then falling into a passionate kiss with MARLENE... \nChampion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German, English... \n83   EXT. USA GP/PADDOCK - DAY                                       83 \nAn impromptu party in the paddock area. The victor's garland still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations.. \nHe runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is pulled away to talk to someone else.. \nJAMES Congratulations. \nNIKI Thank you. \nJAMES Though with a car like that, the rest of us never stood a chance... \nNIKI Maybe the fact the car is so good might have something to do with me. \nJAMES You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm still in a Hesketh. On equal terms, the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat you, and you know it. \nNIKI Never. You might get lucky and win one race. Maybe two. Because you're aggressive. But in the long run, over the course of a season, no chance. \nJAMES Why's that? \nNIKI Because you're not serious. You're just a party guy. Which is why everyone likes you. \nJAMES Now try saying that and tell me you're not jealous. \n(CONTINUED) 83   CONTINUED:                                                     83 \nNIKI But all that affection, all those smiles is also a sign of their disrespect! They don't fear you. Whereas compare that to me... \nJAMES Whom no one likes... \nNIKI Right.. \nJAMES Not even his own team-mates.. \nNIKI Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't screw up. I go to bed early. I look after myself, look after my car. And then, soon as the race is finished, I go home. You should go home more often, too. I heard you got married. \nJAMES I did. \nNIKI So where is she? \nJAMES In New York. Working. \nNIKI You know I've never seen you with her, once... \nNIKI turns to MARLENE, \"Let's go\".. \n84   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        84 \nJAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt. \nJAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he uncharacteristically ignores, storming past... \n85   INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY                             85 \nJAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy doing something... \n(CONTINUED) 85   CONTINUED:                                                    85 \nJAMES Right, whatever it takes to beat Lauda, just say it, your word is my command.

And I mean it this time... \nJAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression... \nJAMES What's the matter? \nThen JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing. \nJAMES What are you doing? \nThen JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None of the usual mechanics, or engineers.. \nJAMES Where is everyone? \nJAMES Fuck off to New York, dear. There must be a moisturizer or eye shadow somewhere that needs your vapid mush to flog it. \nSUZY How quickly beauty can turn ugly. \nJAMES Agreed. Repellent. \nSUZY stares...and goes.

He strokes the birds with real tenderness.. \nThe phone continues ringing. JAMES picks it up... \n(CONTINUED) 90   CONTINUED:                                                      90 \nJAMES (INTO PHONE) Hello? \nJAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes him sit up... \nJAMES (INTO PHONE) Who? McLaren? \nJAMES is waking rapidly now.. \nJAMES (INTO PHONE) Just get me in a room with them, Pete. Say anything. Today? Yes, I can do today.

Good people... \nCALDWELL Like Jackie Ickx. \nJAMES I'm quicker than Jackie. \nMAYER But he's consistent, dependable. Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice. Say the right things. \nJAMES What do you want? A driver or a brushes salesman? \nMAYER We want to be successful. \nJAMES So do I. But I measure that in podium finishes and beating Niki Lauda not being a show pony for sponsors. \nMAYER I've heard about this thing with Lauda. \nCALDWELL (rolls eyes) Everyone has.. \nMAYER You really think you can beat him? He's World Champion. \nJAMES I beat him in Formula 3. \nCALDWELL This season alone he's had eight podiums, five wins, you've had what? \nHOGAN One. \nJAMES Only because I've been in the wrong car. I beat him when the playing field was level. I'd beat him again in a McLaren. (MORE) \n104 EXT.

You did it because you hoped it might change you...settle you down... help with the racing. Not because you loved me. And who knows, if it had been just the drinking, or the dope, or the infidelity, or the moods...it might even have worked...but when it's all of them? \nJAMES I know. I'm terrible. \nSUZY No, you're not terrible. You're just...who you are...at this point in your life. And God help anyone that wants more. \nJAMES Will he be able to give you more?

I called this meeting because as all drivers know the Nurburgring is a race track from the Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric, outdated, dangerous, track in the world. You've all seen the rain which has been falling this morning. Those of you with experience know the Ring needs perfect conditions to be even remotely acceptable in terms of risk. As you can see today is anything BUT perfect, so I called this meeting to take a vote to cancel the race. \nIs it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? \nALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the noise - no time to plug his headset in... \n(CONTINUED) 144 CONTINUED:                                                    144 \nCALDWELL Jochen's going on slicks. You want to change? \nJAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him. \nWhite helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over at the car beside him... \nJAMES Has Niki changed? \nCALDWELL No. He's going on wets. \nNIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS. \nJAMES Then we go on wets, too. \nJAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a split-second, then... \nThe STARTER waves the flag. They're off! \nJAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost 9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt.. \nJAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck, but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them, gaining fast. \nJAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres. \nMASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses under his breath... \nJAMES Shit...! \nJAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs to change tyres. With barely one lap completed... \nHe swerves angrily into the pits.. \n145 INT.

Where's Niki? \nCALDWELL Behind you! He made the same mistake! \nJAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him in the pits, then... \n\"Thump\", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac.

Tearing through the gears, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming. \nThe world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No thought of failure.. \nFailure is unimaginable. Unconscionable. \nHe turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees something ahead. \n(CONTINUED) 147 CONTINUED:                                                     147 \nFlags. Red flags.

He pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL.. \nJAMES What's up? \nMARSHALL Accident. Bad one. \nJAMES Who? \nMARSHALL We don't know yet. \nBut to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites. MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's shoulder... \nNIKI (V/O) I'm here! Can't you tell? I'm here! \n(CONTINUED) 156 CONTINUED:                                                   156 \nNIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them a sign. He's OK. He's still there.

Not give away to him how horrified she is. \nNIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes. \nMARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him. \n159 OMITTED                                                        159 \n160 INT.

But it will hurt. \nAn unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs, to try to hoover out the impurities.. \nCOMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with LAUDA on points.

I had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face. It doesn't look too good but one unexpected advantage is it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run in my eyes again - which is good for a driver. \nLaughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in, (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen. \nBRAZILIAN JOURNALIST When they heard about your condition, Ferrari immediately hired another driver, Carlos Reutemann. \nNIKI Ja. Before even my first operation. \nJAPANESE JOURNALIST Is he your replacement now? \nNIKI No. Just another team-mate. Keen to make an impression. So let's see where Mr. Reutemann finishes today. \nLaughter. \nJAPANESE JOURNALIST James Hunt and McLaren have caught up a lot while you were away. \nNIKI Yes. (a beat) Is there a question now? Or are you just trying to piss me off? \nLaughter. \nJAPANESE JOURNALIST You think you can still win? \nNIKI Of course. I have the better car. I'm the better driver. But he's a clever guy and has used the time well while I was lying half-dead in hospital to win some points.. \nLaughter. \n(CONTINUED) 167 CONTINUED: (2)                                               167 \nBRITISH JOURNALIST What did your wife say when she saw your face? \nNIKI She said, \"Sweetie, you don't need a face to drive. Only a right foot.\" \nLaughter. \nBRITISH JOURNALIST I'm being serious. Do you really think your marriage can survive? With the way you look now? \nSilence. NIKI squints into the lights.. \nNIKI And I'm being serious, too. Which asshole said this? Jesus.. \nNo one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone.. \nNIKI Fuck you. Press conference over. \nNIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up... \nJAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves... \n168 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME             168 \nJAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him.. \nJAMES Hey..! \nThe REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES.. \nJAMES I've got something for you on that last question... \nThe BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, \"Great, thanks James!\" Pulls out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then... \n\"WHACK, WHACK, WHACK\" - JAMES punches his lights out, then takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth. \nJAMES Now go home to your wife and ask her how YOU look!! \n(CONTINUED) 168 CONTINUED:                                                    168 \n\"CRASH\" a final, sickening blow splits the REPORTER's nose.. \nJAMES Prick! \n169 EXT. STARTING GRID - MONZA - DAY                               169 \nJAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS.

His doctors pronounced him dead!! Then he comes back and does THAT??? \n174AINT. BUBBLES HORSELY HOME - MORNING                         174A \nBUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England. At a breakfast table.. \nBUBBLES (ON PHONE) What did you expect? That Niki would give you the championship lying down? Of course not. He's a fighter. He's going to come at you with everything he's got. But you can do this. As a driver, you're his equal - better, maybe. And God knows you're quick and brave enough. You just.. \nJAMES (ON PHONE) What? \nBUBBLES (ON PHONE) Need to find the respect for yourself to close out when it really matters. You don't much like yourself, James - that's the problem, therefore don't believe you deserve it. \n174BINT. JAMES'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             174B \nA knock at JAMES's hotel room door.. \nJAMES I've got to go. \nJAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to reveal.. \nTwo gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps.. \nSTEWARDESS Hi. We've come for the party? \nJAMES What party? \nSTEWARDESS The party we were told was going on in room 2109. \nSure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109. \nJAMES Who sent you here? \n(CONTINUED) 174BCONTINUED:                                                   174B \nSTEWARDESS A man. On the phone. He didn't give his name. \nJAMES This man. Did he speak with an accent? \nSTEWARDESS Yes. German accent. \nJAMES can't believe it. NIKI. \nJAMES I'm afraid it was a joke.. \nSTEWARDESS (liking the look of JAMES) Awwww. Pity. \nJAMES Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not tonight. \nJAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then, after a moment... \nHe snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to disappear into the elevator... \nJAMES Wait..! \n175 EXT. TOKYO SKYLINE - DAWN                                      175 \nThe following morning, day barely breaks. The skies are ominously dark over Tokyo.

Uniforms discarded on the floor. \nMemories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING? JAMES leaps out of bed. \n178 INT. NIKI'S ROOM - HOTEL - DAY                                 178 \nVisibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes, meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking.. \nAmong them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now. Realizing what they've got into. Risking their lives. \nFinally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm. \nNIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing with pain as he puts on his helmet.. \n185 EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY                        185 \nJAMES is piggy-backed to his car by MECHANICS so his feet don't get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track. \n186 EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY                        186 \nJAMES lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat. He straps himself in. \nALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill. Leans towards JAMES, with the screaming drill... \nCALDWELL Keep still... \nJAMES What are you doing??? \n`ZZZZ\", \"ZZZZ\", \"ZZZZ\", CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES's visor. \nCALDWELL To let the condensation out. \nJAMES But it will also let the water in. \nCALDWELL Not if you're leading. \nCALDWELL stares at JAMES... \nCALDWELL Trust me. This race is all about the start. Whoever's in front will see everything. Whoever's second... \nCALDWELL gestures, \"Nothing\".. \nCALDWELL Good luck. \nThey shake hands. JAMES starts the engine with a roar. \n187 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                      187 \nNIKI's engine replies with a loud roar. He looks over at JAMES. JAMES turns to face NIKI.. \nALL SOUND GOES SILENT... \n...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another. All around them, the world slows down. Comes to a standstill. \n(CONTINUED) 187 CONTINUED:                                                   187 \nTHEIR EYES MEET... \nA connection between them. Unspoken realization of where they have both got to. What this moment means. For them both.. \nIt's what they have been waiting for. Working towards. All this time. \nNIKI raises his hand. In a gesture only JAMES sees. JAMES raises his in return. A private salute. \nChivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives. \nTHE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED.. \nThe moment's truce is broken. They return to the task at hand. \nTHE FLAG DROPS. THEY'RE OFF. \n188 EXT.

RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY                          190 \nMiraculously JAMES steadies the car... \nThe spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist. The other cars are wrapped inside it... \nBut JAMES has a clear view ahead. He slams his foot down.. \nCOMMENTATOR (V/O) It's the perfect start for Hunt! \nJAMES No! No! NO!!!! \nJAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best... \n...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM... \nJAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him! \nTHE CHEQUERED FLAG. \nJAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned.. \nJAMES has lost. Lost everything. \n200 EXT. PITS - DAY                                                200 \nJAMES's car arrives in the pits. In a fury. At himself. For refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool. But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging... \nJAMES I'm sorry! \nBut TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too. The world's media descends on JAMES... \nMAYER Sorry?? What are you talking about??

A Ferrari with a red helmet.. \nMAYER That wasn't Niki. That was Regazzoni. \nJAMES What??? \nMAYER Niki withdrew. Said it was too dangerous, refused to drive!! (gestures) You're Champion of the World, kiddo! \nTEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'. \nJAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness. \n200AINT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                     200A \nHESKETH and BUBBLES cheer in celebration... \nHESKETH He did it!

NIKI, now the ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc \nMARLENE Are you OK? \nNIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers. \nNIKI Fine. It's just one race. \nThe helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off... \n202 EXT.

PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                         14 \nJAMES continues vomiting... \nJAMES (V/O) There's a lie that all drivers tell themselves. \"Death is something that happens to other people.\" That's how you find the courage to get in the car in the first place... \nJAMES emerges, wiping his mouth... \nHESKETH All right, Superstar? \nJAMES Never better, Patron. \nJAMES (V/O) Because bad things only happen to others, right? \nHESKETH Have a gargle with this. \n(CONTINUED) 14   CONTINUED:                                                     14 \nJAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then swallows, puts on his balaclava... \nJAMES (V/O) Problem is deep down you know that's a lie. That it could happen to you at any moment. \nHESKETH Quick toke of this... \nHESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a huge lungful from.... \nJAMES (V/O) So how do you make that terror go away? Well, booze is good for that. And wacky baccy. But better than everything else is...sex. \nJAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips, then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car. \nJAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM as the engine starts... \nHESKETH Ahhhh! What music! They could never have predicted it, those pioneers that invented the automobile that it would possess us like this, in our imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men love women...but even more than that, men love CARS... \n15   EXT.

RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                           16 \nJAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner. \nNIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac. \nWhich just happens to describe JAMES perfectly.. \nJAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash... \n17   EXT. PITS - SAME TIME                                            17 \nHESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the sidelines... \nBUBBLES That move was suicide! \nHESKETH It was also quite brilliant!!

As if his car has 50 bhp more. \nAnd overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the Englishman beaten.. \nJAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast... \n...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness. \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED:                                                      18 \n...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to change gears, and continue driving... \nNIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing THE WRONG WAY on the track... \nNIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow, like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him... \nNIKI Umgotteswillen... \nNIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car, when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car. \nNIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as.... \n\"SMASH\", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it would have killed him instantly). \n\"WHAM\", another car narrowly misses him... \n\"CRASH\", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive... \nCars scream past him on all sides as the race continues... \nNIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape. He rips off his helmet, furious... \nAnd now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time. Sharp- featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth. \nSomething unmistakably rat-like about him. \n19   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON                 19 \nJAMES is on the podium, having won. He's with the NURSE, and HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with champagne.. \nNIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and shouts out, still incandescent... \nNIKI Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had that corner... \nJAMES You mean the one you spun out of? And finished facing the other way? I think that corner had you. \nLaughter. \n(CONTINUED) 19   CONTINUED:                                                     19 \nNIKI That move was total suicide. What if I hadn't braked? We'd have crashed..!! \nJAMES But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your impeccable `survival' instincts... \nJAMES makes chicken noises... \nNIKI Fuck you! What's your name? \nHESKETH James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it, my little Jerry friend. Because one day he will be World Champion. \nJAMES Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple. \"Hunt\". It rhymes with.... \n\"BEEEEP\", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word insult... \nJAMES ...a word that happens to describe you perfectly. \nLaughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, \"Screw you, asshole\". The NURSE watches NIKI go.. \nNURSE Who was that? \nJAMES No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad loser. Forget him. \nNIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised.. \n20   EXT. VIENNA SKYLINE - DAY                                        20 \nTo establish: the Austrian capital.

LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT                             22 \nA large, forbidding dining room. NIKI's FATHER and terrifying GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head, clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles) \nGRANDFATHER Never! Racing is for playboys and dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with nothing in their heads. The name `Lauda' appears on the front pages, with politicians and economists, not on the back pages with... (gestures in contempt) ...footballers and skiers. If you want my money, you do as I say and follow me into my business.. \nNIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER.. \nNIKI (V/O) It's in moments like this that you discover who you really are.. \n", "test2_input": "...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for ever, NIKI gets to his feet.. \nNIKI Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in me. But when I'm World Champion, and I have the trophy, and my name is not just on the back pages, but on the front too, you will regret it. \nNIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears... \nGRANDFATHER You dare sit at my table and lecture me on what I will or won't regret?

NIKI'S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                   24 \nNIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading \"Flughafen\".

Plus fifty per cent of starting fees and bonuses for podium finishes. \nNIKI Who's the number one driver? \nSTANLEY Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to him at all times. \nNIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up... \nNIKI Why would I defer to him if I am paying his wages? \nNIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades.. \nSTANLEY Because he's a proven winner at the highest level, a good guy, and someone who quite frankly, could teach you a thing or two. \nNIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract... \nNIKI OK. There is one clause missing. \nSTANLEY The one about mechanics' exclusivity? Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM. All information is shared between ALL our drivers.. \nNIKI And I made it perfectly clear that my mechanics work for me. No one else. This is something I cannot sign. \nNIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares... \nSTANLEY All right. I'll have the lawyers amend it. \nNIKI While you're at it you can tell them to amend the clause for podium finishes. Podium is first THREE places, not just wins. \n(CONTINUED) 26   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  26 \nNIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut, taking it with him.. \nNIKI You'll get the money on signature, as agreed. See you at winter testing. \nNIKI gets to his feet, and leaves.

My parents always wanted me to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and gave me a first class education...but to no avail. My brothers are the success stories. I get bored easily. I have a hot head, an inability to tolerate discipline. I fall out with people left and right. I'm quick to settle matters with my fists. The only creatures I've ever loved and treated well, are budgerigars. In any normal area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total liability. All I've got going for me is I'm quick in a car. \n(CONTINUED) 28   CONTINUED:                                                     28 \nA good-looking woman calls out.. \nWOMAN That's not all! \nLaughter. \nJAMES So thank you for acknowledging that. And giving me this... (indicating trophy) I'm going to give it to my Dad, and tell him to put it on the mantle-piece and imagine it's a first class degree in medicine. \n29   INT. AWARDS CEREMONY - LATER                                    29 \nAfterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched beside bottles of champagne... \nHESKETH Well done, Superstar. One more season in F2 then I'll move you up. To the big time. \nJAMES You don't think I'm ready now? \nHESKETH You are! I'm not! I've got to find you a car first. And the money. The economics of Formula 1 are terrifying. \nBUBBLES Hurry up. You don't want him to do what Lauda did. \n`Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne... \nBUBBLES (cont\u00edd) The Goosestepper. Remember him? \nJAMES makes the chicken noises again.. \nBUBBLES Said he no longer wanted to risk his life with \"a bunch of crazy amateurs and losers...\" \nJAMES Is that what he called us? \n(CONTINUED) 29   CONTINUED:                                                     29 \nDOC Charming! \nHESKETH Nothing wrong with being an amateur! \nBUBBLES Said if he was going to risk his life, he would only do so on the big roulette table. Formula 1. So he got himself a drive with BRM. \nJAMES What? How? He never won a thing! Not a single bloody race. \nHESKETH Amateurs are what made this country great. \nBUBBLES Took out a loan, apparently. Paid for it himself. \nHESKETH \"In war, as in lovemaking, amateurs are invariably better than professionals.\" Napoleon Bonaparte. \nBUBBLES A hundred and fifty grand! \nJAMES A hundred and fifty grand? \nJAMES stares. Already sick with envy. \nJAMES That's either an act of utter lunacy, or the ballsiest thing I ever heard. \nCUT TO: \n30   INT/EXT.

I'll get someone to come and collect you... \nNIKI watches as she telephones the BRM workshops... \nAGNES Hi. There's someone here for you? \nNIKI (prompting) Lauda. \nAGNES (misunderstanding, speaking louder) SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU. \nShe hangs up.

How's that working out, by the way? \nNIKI Fine. How's it at the back? \nJAMES Not planning on being there for long. \nNIKI Good. Look forward to you showing me the way today. \nJAMES `Be happy to.

Sharp right into Mirabeau, then sharp left into Loews, mind the guard rails... \nVOICE Is Alexander around..? \nJAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop- dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY MILLER, the most successful model of the day. \nJAMES He was. Then went to the house to take a call. He'll be back shortly. \nSUZY Only he wanted to show off his pride and joy... \nSUZY indicates the car... \nSUZY ...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me. And `toy'. I can't believe what I'm seeing. \nJAMES Why? \nSUZY It's just so small! For something that costs so much. And so flimsy. There's no comfort. No protection. Nothing. \nJAMES No. Just a little coffin, surrounded by high-octane fuel, being driven round at 170 miles per hour..

On wheels. \nSUZY Why don't they make it safer? \nJAMES No one wants it to be. It's like saying why not make bullfighting safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of death turns people on. Without it, I guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV, fine for everyone.. (a beat) ...except us drivers. \nSUZY looks JAMES up and down.

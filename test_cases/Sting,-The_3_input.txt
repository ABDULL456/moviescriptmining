EIRIE KID Me too.  Maybe it's our day. 
Lonnegan nods and wanders away.  Hooker comes over to him. 
HOOKER What happened? 
LONNEGAN I didn't get the bet down in time. 
HOOKER (pissed) Oh, Jesus. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STORE OFFICE 
Gondorff and Niles, back in the office. 
NILES (looking out at the floor) Looks like he's sulking. 
GONDORFF If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever. 
CUT TO: 
THE FLOOR 
CALLER Coming for home, it's Wrecking Crew by six lengths, Made to Order is second by two and a half, High Ground is third by a length and Grand Theft is coming fast on the rail.  It's Wrecking Crew, Made to Order and Grand Theft.  Wrecking Crew wins it by five lengths, Grand Theft is second by a nose, Made to Order is third by two.  Time for one and 3/8 mile, 2:11 and 4/10 seconds. 
Eirie explodes in a joyous frenzy.  He grabs Lonnegan by the shoulders and shakes him. 
EIRIE KID We won!  We won!  You hear that!  I won 30,000!  You hear that! 
Yeh, Lonnegan heard that.  Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his coat and heads for the door. 
EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
He finds Hooker waiting for him outside. 
LONNEGAN Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time. 
HOOKER How am I gonna do that? 
LONNEGAN (coarsely) I don't know, figure something out. 
Lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and drives off.  Hooker relaxes into a smile.  He's already figured something out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEZY DINER ACROSS FROM HOOKER'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING 
Hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf. Loretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter, looking idly out into space.  Hooker glances over at her every once in a while to see if she might be interested in striking up a little conversation.  She's not.  He finishes his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill. 
HOOKER Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee. 
LORETTA (ringing it up) Sixty-five. 
Hooker gives her a dollar.  She goes to the register for change. 
HOOKER What time you get off work here? 
LORETTA 2:00 A.M. 
HOOKER You doin' anything tonight? 
LORETTA (handing him his change) Yeh, sleepin'. 
Hooker figures that's enough of that.  He pockets his change and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short. 
EXT. STREET 
Across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man. It's Cole.  He's pretending not to look at the diner, but Hooker isn't fooled. 
INT. DINER 
He goes back to Loretta at the register. 
HOOKER You got a back door to this place?

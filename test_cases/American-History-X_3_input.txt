DENNIS (quickly to Derek} Santa Monica High tonight, right? 
DEREK 
Yep. 
DENNIS Perfect. (to Danny) Ben'll whip us up a couple of double deckers and we'll head over. 
DANNY (smiling) 
Okay. 
Dennis smiles, reaches over with a fatherly hand, and messes up his hair. 
BACK QUICKLY TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - DANNY - PRESENT 
He stops typing and almost cries. He leans back in his chair and and stares himself in the side mirror. He feels his bald head, almost exploring. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BEN'S BURGER SHOP - LATE NIGHT 
A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside begging for change. Seth and Cameron, both beat-up, drunk and bloody, stare at the man. 
HOMELESS MAN Spare change for a cheeseburger? 
SETH Get a job and buy one why don't you. 
HOMELESS MAN God bless you. 
SETH Fuck you. 
Seth stumbles into the shop.  Cam stares at the homeless man, psychotically. 
HOMELESS MAN Fifty cents is all I ask. Vietnam, man. 
I was in 
CAMMERON Really? So you've had what? Thirty years to get your shit together? 
HOMELESS MAN All I want is something to eat. 
CAMMERON There are plenty of fuckin' dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam boy. Go get yourself one. 
In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands. 
HOMELESS MAN Did I do something? 
CAMMERON You're a disgrace to the white race. If Adolf Hitler was alive...God bless his soul...he would have you shot. 
HOMELESS MAN Fuck you then. Now and forever.  Fuck you. 
Cameron knees the weaker man square in the face. The man slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an afterthought, Cameron kicks him several more times. 
CAMMERON Noooo. Fuck you. 
QUICKLY TO ACROSS THE STREET. Little Henry and two of his friends watch Cammeron's brutality from their bikes. They turn in the opposite direction and hurry off. 
INT. BURGER SHOP - CAMHERON AND SETH 
CUT TO: 
Seth eats a burger and chili fries at the same time. Cameron smokes across from him and watches Seth eat like a pig. He takes a look at the homeless man outside who still lays motionless. Cam feels his BANDAGED FACE. 
CAMMERON I think I need to go to the hospital. 
SETH Seriously? 
CAMMERON I don't know. I think so. 
SETH Where's Stacey?

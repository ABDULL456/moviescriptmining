BEN About an hour ago. 
MR. BRADDOCK Wait a minute.  You talked to Elaine this morning? 
BEN No.  She doesn't know about it. 
MR. BRADDOCK She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley? 
BEN No.  Actually - she doesn't know about us getting married yet. 
MRS. BRADDOCK When did you two talk this over? 
BEN We haven't. 
MR. BRADDOCK Ben - this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked. 
BEN No - it's not.  It's completely baked.  It's a decision I've made. 
MRS. BRADDOCK But what makes you think she wants to marry you? 
Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns. 
BEN She doesn't.  To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
141	EXT. ROAD NO 1 TO BERKELEY - DAY 
Ben driving his car (left to right) 
BEN'S VOICE (over) Dear Elaine - I am now visiting Berkeley, after growing somewhat weary of family life.  I have been meaning to stop by and pay my respects but am not entirely certain just how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and your mother.  It was certainly a serious mistake on my part but not serious enough.  I hope -- 
The last part runs down like a record on an old gramaphone. 
CUT TO: 
142	EXT. ROAD NO. 2 - TO BERKELEY - DAY 
Ben driving his car (left to right) 
BEN'S VOICE (over) Mr. and Mrs. G. L. Robinson take great pleasure in announcing the wedding of their daughter... 
It runs down. 
CUT TO: 
143	EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
Ben's car is being gassed up.  It is a huge gas station with dozens of pumps and many neon lights.  Ben runs to a series of vending machines.  He pushes quarters into them, receiving cigarettes, a sandwich, an apple, a cup of coffee.  Balancing them all carefully, he runs back to the car, climbs in, puts his purchases on top of the dashboard, hands the attendant a bill and drives off. 
CUT TO: 
144	EXT. ROAD NO. 3 TO BERKELEY - DAY 
Ben driving (left to right) and eating. 
BEN'S VOICE (over) Honey - I'm home. 
ELAINE'S VOICE (over) Hi - Sweetheart. 
BEN'S VOICE (over) Where are the kids? 
ELAINE'S VOICE (over) Oh, they're having a wonderful time - spending the day at Mother's - she's teaching them to... 
It runs down. 
145	EXT. ROAD NO. 4 TO BERKELEY - DAY 
Ben driving (left to right) 
BEN'S VOICE (over) Dear Mom and Dad.  You may have wondered why Elaine and I haven't written in such a long time, but the postal sytem here in Greenland isn't the most efficient.  Life among these wonderful natives... 
It runs down. 
CUT TO: 
146	EXT. ROAD NO. 5 TO BERKELEY - DAY 
Ben driving (left to right) 
MAN'S VOICE (over) Do you, Benjamin Braddock take this woman, Mrs. Robinson, for your Mother-in-law, to love, cherish and... 
It runs down. 
CUT TO: 
147	EXT. TOLL BOOTH ON THE OAKLAND BRIDGE - DAY 
Ben barely stops as he hands the change out the window of the low-slung sports car and up to the toll taker. 
CUT TO: 
148	EXT. OAKLAND BRIDGE - DAY 
Ben driving over bridge (left to right) 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE (over) Benjamin - you and Elaine have made such a wonderful marriage. I often laugh when I remember those nights at the Taft. 
BEN'S VOICE (over) Yes - how long ago that all seems. 
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE (over; chuckling) I'll never forget how peeved I was when I first... 
It runs down... 
PAN THE CAR past us and HOLD ON it as it disappears in the distance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
149	INT. WENDELL HALL RECEPTION AREA - DUSK 
CLOSE ON BEN as he comes through the door.  MOVE WITH HIM as he wanders around the the commons room which is filled with STUDENTS.  Girls SINGING, couples necking; a MAN with a heavy knapsack.  Ben walks to a LADY RECEPTIONIST NO. 1, who sits at a reception desk.

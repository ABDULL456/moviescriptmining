ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break and face the doorway. An awkward silence. 
LEONARDO Hey. 
RAPHAEL Hey. Raphael eyes Leo... and then the medallion. 
RAPHAEL So... congratulations. 
LEONARDO Thanks. 
RAPHAEL (awkward beat/fake yawn) Well, I'm goin' to bed. He leaves. TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back of the head, and keeps on walking. 
RAPHAEL Leo's home. Donatello wakes up, looks around. LIGHTS UP when he sees Leo. 
DONATELLO Leo!! ON MIKEY - He wakes up. A Cheese Doodle stuck to his upper snout. Really groggy. 
MICHAELANGELO But I don't WANNA pop out of the birthday cake, Mrs. Ro- (snaps out of it) 
LEOOOOO!!! Mikey flips past Donnie and slams Leo with a gripping HUG... and doesn't let go. 
LEONARDO Hey little bro! a beat) Mikey? You can let go now... um, Mikey? 
MICHAELANGELO 
(MUTTERING) So bored... so bored...

CAM LOWERS INTO FLOOR AS WE... 
FADE TO BLACK VER BLACK - Quick bursts of AUDIO VIOLENCE. Steel, screaming, trampling, and rumbling. Then- -with each audio burst, we now see a VISUAL BURST. Strong, rim-lit, iconic images of an IMMENSE BATTLE - a slicing blade weapon, screaming mouth, angry eyes. Then- -a monster claw! Gnashing teeth! Scared eyes! Horns and tusks! The edit gets intense, until - 
WINTERS 
AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGH!!! 
INT. WINTERS BEDROOM - DAWN 
It was all a nightmare. We go WIDER as we take in the ostentatious bedroom of MAXIMILIAN WINTERS, a young mid-40's. Famous NYC entrepreneur. inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every sense. His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes, decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is filled with adrenaline, power and machismo.

INTERS ASSISTANT (O.S.) Mr. Winters, sir. ON DOORWAY - Standing there is a beautiful black-haired assistant dressed in full suit and tie with a clipboard. 
WINTERS ASSISTANT It's time for your morning workout. 
INT. WINTERS WORKOUT ROOM 
Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning workout - a combination of weaponry work (martial arts and others), floor routines and bag work. He takes it all very seriously. Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung training block with his bare fist. He walks out of the room, grabbing a towel from a blonde assistant. 
INT. WINTERS OFFICE - LATER 
Winters walks in his crisp suit. His office is large and austere. Two levels of history in books, artifacts, warrior themed curios and power.

WINTERS ASSISTANT (O.S.) Mr. Winters, sir? ON DOOR - His Assistant stands at the large doors.

LIONEL First class. 
A long pause as Myrtle digests this. 
MYRTLE What about your... 
LIONEL Willie's a problem...not much progress. The others have been referred. 
MYRTLE What'll you do when we get home? 
LIONEL Try not to act the toff. Teach perhaps. 
MYRTLE You could... 
LIONEL No! I'm not good enough! 
MYRTLE You gave it a try, Lionel. 
LIONEL Yes, I had a go. Thanks to your patience. (grief overwhelms him) I just bloody well wasn't good enough! 
MYRTLE (studying the tickets) Oh Lionel! This must've cost you. 
CHOP!   CHOP!    CHOP! The sound of an axe. 
56   EXT.    GROUNDS AND TERRACE, BALMORAL - NEW DAY                 56 
A woodsman's axe CHOPS into the thick trunk of a massive tree. 
Nearby, a bulldozer cuts into the green turf and rich soil. 
The felling and earth removal are being watched by Churchill and Lang from a distant terrace. In the background a jazz band in white tuxedos syncopates pertly. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    63. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Five hundred year old oaks! Part of the hill! Removed to improve the view! 
COSMO LANG How ever does she do it? 
Inside the ballroom, seem through open French doors, an afternoon dance is being held. Churchill and Lang look in. 
57   INT.   BALLROOM, BALMORAL - CONTINUOUS                       57 
At the epicenter, a dashing couple: David, the very picture of insouciance, and clinging to his arm, dripping in jewelry, a rather small, angular, dark haired woman, with a high brow and square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical feature is her back, displayed fully by a dress that plunges to her nates. Surrounded by their entourage, they are the apex of chic. 
Watching from the sidelines: 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination? I realize of course, that may be outside your personal experience. 
Winston exchanges his empty champagne flute for a full one from the tray of a passing footman. 
COSMO LANG You've the Devil in you today. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL If anyone should know, it would be Your Grace. 
COSMO LANG All aspects of mankind are within my venue. Did you know, HM has trouble with his glands? 
Churchill almost chokes on his champagne. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL I'd not appreciated Your Grace was so well versed concerning things testicular! 
COSMO LANG They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    64. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL A veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information. 
COSMO LANG Apparently it affects the quality, although not the quantity, of HM's endeavors. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL And the brother? 
COSMO LANG Unscathed. Two daughters. I shepherd my flock in all matters, Winston, including multiplication. 
They make their way inside. In the distance an Austin Princess can be seen making its way up the stately tree-line avenue. 
58   INT.   AUSTIN PRINCESS, BALMORAL ESTATE - CONTINUOUS         58 
Bertie and Elizabeth are dressed for the party. 
BERTIE We must try to be pleasant. 
ELIZABETH Your father not dead six months, and That Woman throws, "A garden potty." P-o-t-t-y. She's sleeping in your mother's bedroom. And I know perfectly well she calls me `the Dowdy Duchess", and "Cookie". 
59   INT.   BALLROOM, BALMORAL - DAY                              59 
At the buffet table Churchill helps himself copiously. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Has it occurred to you, as it has only occurred to me, that a Monarch with a gland problem, who realizes he cannot produce issue, might not wish to be King...? knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed.

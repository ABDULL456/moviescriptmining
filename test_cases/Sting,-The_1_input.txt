HOOKER Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit. 
Capt. Polk almost laughs, but he checks it. 
HOOKER You got nothin' on me. 
POLK We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion. (with special emphasis) Counterfeiting, anything you want. 
Hooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now.  He's beginning to get the picture. 
POLK Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing. 
HOOKER No. 
POLK You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight? 
HOOKER I'll make parole. 
POLK Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later. 
Hooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it. 
POLK Don't be a sap, kid.  You could save us a little trouble.  But Henry Gondorff is through whether you help us or not.  There's nothin' left to do now but save yourself. 
Hooker's thoroughly whipped.  He sits down for the first time. 
HOOKER (softly) Will you wait until the chump is played? 
POLK Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets. 
HOOKER (with heat) I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya. 
POLK All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight. 
HOOKER (barely audible) Just as long as I get to finish the play. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Gondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking. Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is quiet and withdrawn.  The carousel is not in operation and a heavy silence hangs over the place. 
GONDORFF What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much. 
HOOKER Just a little nervous, that's all. 
GONDORFF Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it. 
Hooker smiles feebly. 
Billie appears at the door. 
BILLIE Things are a little slow tonight, Henry.  I wanna open the round for the girls. 
Gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her. She leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles back into the game. 
GONDORFF Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know. 
HOOKER (softly) How many guys you conned in your life, Henry? 
GONDORFF Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business. (pause) 'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game. (pause) Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen. 
Gondorff chucks his cards on the table.  He's through for the night. 
GONDORFF I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow. 
HOOKER Then why you doin' it? 
GONDORFF Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting. 
That's good enough.  Hooker gets up to leave. 
HOOKER Henry. 
HOOKER Yeh.

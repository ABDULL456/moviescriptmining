JOHN (V.O.) 
I need to see where Isabel died. 
EXT. EAST LA - NIGHT 
Graffiti-adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence, heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the six-story hospital complex of RAVENSCAR. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A rim-lit figure stands on the roof. But this one isn't wearing a hospital gown, he's wearing a trench coat. 
ANGELA (V.O.) 
Seances, crystals -- channeling... Our father thought she was just trying to get attention. She certainly did that. 
EXT. ROOFTOP 
Angela stands behind John. A large water tank is anchored to the roof next to her. Note the FLAME logo. 
ANGELA 
She'd tell everyone about things she said she saw. Crazy things. Things that hadn't happened yet. She'd scare my mother to death, talking on and on about Revelations and the end of the world. Then one day she just stopped... never said another word. 
JOHN 
So you put her in here. Angela doesn't need to be reminded.     It hurts even more now. 
JOHN 
Show me her room. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
John and Angela head toward Isabel's room. A NURSE appears from around the corner walking with a boy. It's Barry, the boy in the courtyard. He locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms outstretched. 
NURSE 
Barry! He runs right into Angela's arms, hugs her tight. Angela is totally baffled. John is thoroughly intrigued. 
NURSE 
Oh God... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She rushes in, gently tugs the boy away. 
NURSE 
No, Barry, that's not Isabel. Barry stares at Angela. He reaches out, touches her face, confused. Nurse pulls him back even further. 
NURSE 
I'm sorry. They were friends. He kind of had a crush on your sister. Angela nods, understanding. The Nurse leads Barry away. He doesn't take his eyes off Angela the entire time. Neither does John. 
JOHN 
You were twins. Angela nods, steps inside.      John pauses, thinking. 
INT. ISABEL'S ROOM 
John steps inside, gives the sterile room a thorough scan. 
JOHN 
So how long? 
ANGELA 
Two months. (beat) This time. He pulls out a drawer, looks at the bottom. 
ANGELA 
I already did all that. John runs his hands under the steel bed frame. 
ANGELA 
Now you're insulting me. 
JOHN 
You don't walk off a building without leaving something behind. 
ANGELA 
You saw everything she left behind. In that box. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
Maybe she left something else. Something more personal. Just for you. Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her. 
JOHN 
You were her twin, Angela.    Twins tend to think alike. 
ANGELA

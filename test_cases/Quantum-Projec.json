Professore Paulo Pentcho! \nPENTCHO That's not an official nickname, Jacque. \nPentcho looks from Jacque to Arlette, who blushes.

A set of lights FLARE ON.  Pentcho swallows a breath.  In awe. \nPENTCHO God. \nWE SEE WHAT HE SEES: \nA GIANT RENAISSANCE-STYLE FRESCO COVERS THE ENTIRE CEILING. \nFlocks of ANGELS fly above a GODDESS.  Cherubs.  Heralds. \nPentcho's face flushes.

I was in the middle of an experiment. \nMIA Like now? \nHe hesitates, then surrenders to the fact. \nPENTCHO Yes. \nThe firefly dances above them.  Pentcho sits up (and away from her). Mock serious: \nPENTCHO (CONT'D) Did you know electrons have lovers? \nMia notes his distance.  Faces him, cross-legged. \nMIA No.  I didn't.  (dryly) I'm listening. \nPENTCHO Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier... \nShe looks, sees him disappear into his head. \nPENTCHO (CONT'D) A strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like... \nThe vulnerability is gone.

Pentcho scans around, unfazed.  Locates a towel.  Mops up.  Dries off the computer and keyboard.  Bag still on his shoulder, he fires up the machine and logs \nON THE COMPUTER SCREEN \nE-mail.  Lots of it.  Hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by on the screen.  He turns away, sees his own rain soaked clothes forming a puddle on the floor.  LIGHTNING cascades across the sky, visible through the large bay window behind the desk.  Pentcho's eyes stray back to the screen \nSTILL SCROLLING E-MAIL MESSAGES \nas the thunder follows almost immediately.  CRACK!

Harder now.  A THUNK sounds from inside.  Or was it?  He picks one last key out in the glare of the blue lights.  Jams it in the lock.  Twists and \n43     INT.

He SPRAWLS forward as \nA GUNSHOT ERUPTS ABOVE HIS HEAD \nHe drops, convulsed with fear.  Snaps his head back to see: \nTHE EINSTEIN MAN (ALEXANDER) \nin bathrobe and slippers, hands shaking around a shotgun. \nALEXANDER Paul... Pauly... \nPentcho struggles to breathe.  Staccato: \nPENTCHO You taking any medication? \nAlexander's eyes FLARE in anger. \nALEXANDER Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me (pulling the gun out) to this particular switching station? \nPENTCHO Dad... \nHe shoves the shotgun into an open trash can. \nALEXANDER Two: what if I didn't miss? \nPENTCHO You did. \nALEXANDER Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss? \nPENTCHO You did miss -- \nALEXANDER -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?  (softer) What did your life mean? (beat) Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love? \nPentcho shifts, uncomfortably, in his seat.  Ditto Alexander's mood.

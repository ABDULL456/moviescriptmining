Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened. 
17 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 17 
Nina lies on the floor, stewing. Her legs straight in the air to drain the lactic acid in her muscles. 
ERICA (O.S.) (FROM KITCHEN) I told them it doesn't matter how talented their daughter is, if she misses any more classes, she's out. She forgets half of what I teach her, and I waste time catching her up. It's ridiculous. 
Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them on. 
She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing the waters. 
She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again. Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor. 
THWACK, THWACK. THWACK. 
She jabs her toe down, hard... 
NINA Ow! 
She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot. 
ERICA (O.S.) Everything alright? 
NINA I'm fine! 
Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe. Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood. 
Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on. 
She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and starts spinning again. 
Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain, but keeps pushing. 
Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins.... 
She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed. 14A. 
At the end of the 32nd spin, Nina jabs her foot down hard. 
She's done it! 
Nina looks at herself in the mirror, glazed in sweat, a slight smile of satisfaction. 
18 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 18 
Nina sits on the edge of the bed, as Erica douses some GAUZE with PEROXIDE and dabs it on the split toenail. Nina reacts to the sting. 
ERICA Shhh. Almost done...You're working yourself too hard. We all have off days. 
NINA If that girl hadn't barged in. 
ERICA I'm sure she didn't mean to. Remember when you started? If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you would have been completely lost. 
NINA I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it. 
ERICA He knows you can do the coda. It won't convince him one way or the other. 
Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Oh, sweetheart, I know it's disappointing. When you start to get older, there's all this ridiculous pressure. God knows, I understand. 
Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it into Nina's calves. 
ERICA (CONT'D) But it's alright. No matter what. You'll probably get to dance the Pas de Quatre again. That's such a wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll shine. 
NINA I know, mom. 15A. 
Erica removes Nina's EARRINGS, then opens a JEWELRY BOX sitting on the night stand and drops them inside. A TOY BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC. 
Nina gets under the covers. Erica tucks her in and sits down on the edge of the bed. 
ERICA Everything will be better in the morning. It always is. 
She strokes Nina's hair, humming along to the music. 
Nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined stare.

21 INT. SUBWAY - DAY 21 
Nina applies the lipstick she stole from Beth, using the side window as a mirror. The jerky motion of the train makes it difficult, but she manages. 
22 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 22

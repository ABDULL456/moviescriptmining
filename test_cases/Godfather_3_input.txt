DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace. He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply. 
DON CORLEONE Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns. 
EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945) 
JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate, armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate, and TOM enters. 
EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945) 
HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens, martinis in hand. 
WOLTZ You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom, I had to check you out.  I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. (a piece of statuary) Florence, thirteenth century. Decorated the garden of a king. 
They cross the garden and head toward the stables. 
WOLTZ I'm going to show you something beautiful. 
They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM." TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as WOLTZ approaches. 
WOLTZ You like horses?  I like horses, I love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive Racehorses. 
The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him with true love in his voice. 
WOLTZ Khartoum...Kartoum...You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.  But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud. 
INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945) 
HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous. 
HAGEN Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship. 
WOLTZ Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else. 
HAGEN He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood? 
WOLTZ You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork! 
HAGEN I'm German-Irish. 
WOLTZ Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS! 
EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945) 
An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC." next to an open-faced fruit market. 
A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO. 
INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) 
Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced. They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE. 
SOLLOZZO My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous. 
DON CORLEONE Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity? 
SOLLOZZO I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend. 
DON CORLEONE What percentages for my family? 
SOLLOZZO Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up. 
DON CORLEONE And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? 
SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN. 
SOLLOZZO My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share. 
DON CORLEONE So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me? 
SOLLOZZO If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone. 
There is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer. 
DON CORLEONE I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect... (pause) But I'll say no to you. 
We feel this around the room. 
DON CORLEONE I'll give you my reasons.  I have many, many friends in Politics. But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling.  They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business. 
SOLLOZZO takes a breath. 
DON CORLEONE No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed. 
SOLLOZZO Are you worried about security for your million? 
DON CORLEONE No. 
SOLLOZZO The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. 
This startles SONNY; he blurts out. 
SONNY The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment? 
SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line. 
DON CORLEONE Young people are greedy, and they have no manners.  They speak when they should listen.  But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. 
SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard: 
The DON turns to SONNY.

BERTIE I came here because I was taught from childhood to serve a purpose, and that purpose is to serve. Duty is our sole justification for privilege. (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   59. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) I came here because I was under the illusion you might help me perform that function! 
LIONEL Not to worry. They say the King can do no wrong. 
BERTIE He can bugger things up! And I am not the King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce. The Coronation is set for the 12th of May. Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April. That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest. 
LIONEL And if Mr Baldwin stops them? 
BERTIE That would be a tragedy. I pray to The Almighty they succeed. I'll do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne. 
LIONEL Does that include debasing yourself? 
BERTIE If necessary! 
LIONEL Your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning... 
BERTIE Are you saying he wanted me to fail? 
LIONEL Are you insisting he didn't? In the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases. You can sing them, swear them, rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow; that, combined with your growing confidence... 
Bertie doesn't want to hear. 
BERTIE Growing confidence? Growing dread!!! You're a wicked man, Lionel Logue, trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother. Trying to get me to commit treason! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    60. 
LIONEL Trying to get you to   realize you need not be governed by fear.   Again, why did you seek me out? To take   polite elocution lessons so you could   attend posh tea parties?! 
BERTIE How dare you! I'm the brother of a King...the son of a King...back through untold centuries. You presume to instruct me on my duty? A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback? The disappointing son of an embittered clerk! You're a monster, Doctor Logue. I'm going to Balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother. And these sessions are over! 
54   INT.   STAGE OF SMALL REGIONAL THEATRE - NEW DAY             54 
Closed curtains. Someone fumbles behind it. 
LIONEL (BEHIND CURTAIN) Now? 
Lionel pushes his way through the gap in the curtain. A PROVINCIAL DIRECTOR replies from a seat in the auditorium. (Not the same Director as in the earlier audition scene.) 
DIRECTOR Were you told? We aren't for London. Playing the provinces. 
LIONEL Outer Mongolia? 
DIRECTOR Available, are we? 
LIONEL Nothing prevents. 
DIRECTOR I believe that's called "desperate for a part!" Previous experience? 
LIONEL Australia. 
DIRECTOR You have played the provinces. Righto! Let's hear what you can do. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                      61. 
LIONEL Caliban? 
DIRECTOR Make him deformed. Audiences like that. 
LIONEL Of course. (rallies himself) "Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not." 
As magical as Lionel was when he performed for his boys, here he's stiff and painfully stilted. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) "Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices..." 
DIRECTOR (interrupts) Thank you! Don't abandon your day job. Next! 
Logue bows his head. 
55   INT. LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT                               55 
Lionel enters and sits dejectedly at the table.     Myrtle and the boys eat in silence. Finally: 
LIONEL You may leave. 
VALENTINE Haven't finished yet, Dad. (realizes) Oh! Right! 
THE BOYS Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mum. 
They exit.   Myrtle knows something has happened. 
MYRTLE Lionel? 
Lionel takes five slim folders out of his jacket pocket and puts them on the table in front of Myrtle. She studies them, stunned. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                       62. 
MYRTLE (CONT'D) Tickets? Home?

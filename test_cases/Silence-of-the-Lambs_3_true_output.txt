CRAWFORD He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun. 
CLARICE But if he knew we have so little time - 
CRAWFORD If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all. 
CLARICE I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal. 
CRAWFORD What would it take? 
CLARICE Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that? 
CRAWFORD (shakes his head) State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place? 
CLARICE You'll back me up with some paperwork? (he nods) Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself? 
CRAWFORD (hesitates) She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out. 
Clarice looks at him, surprised. 
CRAWFORD She's the mother, Starling. She can't possibly comprehend what Lecter is. She'd make the mistake of pleading with him. Begging him... He'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BALTIMORE STATE HOSP. FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY 
Chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the administration wing. He looks quite agitated. 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) We can't trust Frederick Chilton, either. He's greedy and ambitious. If he knew about Lecter's link to Bill, he's go straight to the newspapers... 
Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase. He points his gold pen at her accusingly. 
CHILTON What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time! 
CLARICE Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case. 
CHILTON He's my patient! I have rights! (grabs her arm, stopping her) I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice. 
She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go. 
CLARICE I'm acting on instruction, Dr. Chilton. (handing him a card) This is the U.S. Attorney's number. Now please - either discuss this with him, or let me do my job. 
She walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and hostility. He clicks his pen, watching her go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - DAY 
Dr. Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with charcoal on butcher paper. 
He uses his own hand and forearm as a model. His other drawings, books, and bedding have been restored. 
DR. LECTER Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for a United States Senator, you're an odd choice of messenger? 
Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers from her briefcase. 
CLARICE I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us. 
DR. LECTER That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort? (beat; he smiles) Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"? 
CLARICE By the book, he's a sadist. 
DR. LECTER Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God. (beat) Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl? 
CLARICE Yes. 
DR. LECTER Big through the hips. Roomy. 
CLARICE They all were. 
DR. LECTER Mmm. And what else...? 
CLARICE She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means. 
DR. LECTER Was it a butterfly? 
CLARICE (pause; staring at him) A moth... How did you predict that? 
DR. LECTER I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me. 
Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect her thoughts. She looks up at him again, evenly. 
CLARICE If you help us find Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin, the Senator promises you a transfer to the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby. Maximum security still applies, but you'd have reasonable access to books. 
He is silent. She rises, moves closer, carrying papers. 
CLARICE Best of all, though - one week a year you'd get to leave the hospital and go here. (points to a map) Plum Island. Every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour. Under SWAT team surveillance, of course... 
His face remains neutral. She puts the papers in his food tray. 
CLARICE Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her offer is final and non-negotiable. If Catherine dies - (she slides his tray through) You get nothing. 
A measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks down at the papers, without touching them. 
DR. LECTER "Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming. 
CLARICE That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.

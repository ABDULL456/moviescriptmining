GAVIN (NODDING) Of course... Are you okay? 
ROBERT You reach Mayfield? 
The ELEVATOR arrives and Robert gets in. 
GAVIN Not yet, but we'll get him... (STARES) Robert, I... 
ROBERT Thanks. Appreciate your concern. 
Gavin's still staring as the doors close. 
EXT. CONVENT AVENUE - JIMMY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
PEDESTRIANS hurry by this busy stretch of Upper Manhattan. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 50. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - SAME 
Bryer and Mills wait. Jimmy approaches. 
MILLS Let's flash him. 
They drive up on the sidewalk, blocking Jimmy's path, and Mills exits the car. 
EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
MILLS Mr. Grant? 
JIMMY Yes? 
MILLS NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car? 
JIMMY What's this about? 
BRYER (through the window) Just get in the car, Jimmy. 
JIMMY Am I under arrest? 
BRYER (through the window) You wanna be? 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
Jimmy sits across the table from Mills and Bryer. They show him PHOTOS of Julie's burned body at the crash site. 
BRYER So let's do this again. 
JIMMY Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change. 
BRYER You were asleep. 
JIMMY Right. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51. 
BRYER And your phone rings. 
JIMMY Right. 
BRYER And it's a wrong number. 
Jimmy doesn't answer. 
BRYER (CONT'D) Why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number? 
JIMMY I don't think I wanna answer any more questions. 
BRYER And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes? 
JIMMY I want to talk to my lawyer. 
MILLS Listen, kid, we know you went out there. We ID'd your photo with your neighbor who saw you getting into your truck ten minutes after this call was made. 
JIMMY Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer? 
BRYER I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide.

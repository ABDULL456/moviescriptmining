DAVID I didn't mean -- 
CONSTANCE Let's go. 
As she collects, she winces, grabs her side. 
DAVID Are you okay? 
CONSTANCE Yes, let's just go. 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - DAY 
Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles on sound stage. The main monitor is playing the end of the show's signation. 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR In three, two... 
ON SOUND STAGE 
A camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). The host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin. 
The set has an upscale regional television look. The Governor has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets. 
HOST (to camera) Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.' Tonight we continue our very special four-part series with the Governor Hardin. Arguing capital punishment with her is DeathWatch coordinator, Professor David Gale. Governor, you're up. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN Alan, let me say somethin' I always say. 
Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David -- something about the papers in front of him. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And that is I hate killin.' That's why my administration is willing to kill to stop it. 
DAVID So you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'? 
GOVERNOR HARDIN It's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive. 
DAVID It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign. 
Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with her. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN You've got me, Professor. But let me, in my defense, give you a quote. Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain.' 
The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance bites her lip. 
DAVID So, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.' 
The Governor makes an animated thinking face. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN Well, yes. I would have to agree. (chuckles again) Did I say that, too? 
DAVID No, ma'am. That was Hitler. 
Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone more sincere. 
DAVID Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. That it's expensive, inequably administered, that... 
David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance. 
DAVID ...that we may even be killing innocents. 
Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your game. Name one. Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure. One. 
A beat. David doesn't respond. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN Name one in the last twenty years. In any state in this country. 
A long, miserable beat. 
HOST Well, Mr. Gale? 
DAVID Dead men can't make a case. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN Well, as my daddy used to say: If you can't find a problem, there probably isn't one. 
Constance shakes her head in irritation. 
BACKSTAGE - LATER 
The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands. Constance stands nearby. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN Well, you certainly had me on that Hitler quote. 
DAVID Thank you, Governor. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN These debates are awfully good for the state, don't you think? 
DAVID Of course. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN Well, I've got to buzz.

JIM (with great restraint) Muriel, I know it's asking a lot, but just one morning I would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance! 
Picks up his paper. 
MURIEL Jim, you really might take a little more interest in your children's education. 
JOAN (without looking up) You can't squeeze blood from a turnip. 
Jim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts down the paper, turns slowly to Betsy. 
JIM All right. All right. I'll listen. 
BETSY (picking up her scrapbook) It's just twenty-four words. But in simple eloquence it mirrors a minor tragedy of our times. 
JIM (quietly) Well?... 
BETSY (reading) "Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak grove, apple orchard, trout stream, hay fields, four barns, seclusion, superb view, original beams, paved highway, acreage... (with emotion) Will sacrifice..." 
Pause. 
JIM Go on. 
BETSY (simply) That's all. 
JIM That's all?! 
BETSY You don't see it, do you, father? 
JIM No. Fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper. What did you expect him to do, take it to the United Nations! 
MURIEL There must be more to it than that. (to Betsy) Isn't there, dear? 
BETSY Certainly, mother. What some people don't see is the whole sordid picture. A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the wall by hardship, soil erosion, mortgages, everybody gobbling, gobbling, gobbling, until finally, in desperation, he is "forced to sell," and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspaper advertising. 
JIM (muttering) Oh, indeed... crass commercialism... advertising... 
JOAN (nose in her magazine) Miss Stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession. 
JIM (with extreme control) Oh, she does? 
JOAN Miss Stellwagon says that advertising makes people who can't afford it buy things they don't want with money they haven't got. 
JIM (elaborate sarcasm) Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right. Perhaps I ought to get out of this "basically parasitic profession," which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition, those extra French lessons, her progressive summer camp and for that matter, the very braces on your teeth! 
MURIEL I wish you wouldn't discuss money in front of the children. 
JIM Why not, they spend enough of it! 
JOAN Bicker, bicker, bicker. 
As Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the downstairs buzzer rings. Gussie enters, squeezes by Jim who automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g. 
GUSSIE Hello. Who? (calls) Miss Blandings, there's a Mr. Funkhauser wants to see you. 
MURIEL Funkhauser? (remembers) Oh, Mr. Funkhauser! 
GUSSIE That's what he says. 
Muriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied, reading his paper. Then she turns back to Gussie. 
MURIEL Uh -- better ask him to come up. 
GUSSIE (into phone) Says to come up. 
Gussie hangs up, squeezes by Jim, exits into the kitchen. Pause. 
MURIEL (tentatively) Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's here. 
JIM (looking up) ...Who? 
MURIEL You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that clever young interior decorator we met at the Collins' cocktail party? 
JIM (distastefully) What's he doing here? 
MURIEL (nervously) Well, I imagine he's brought the -- uh -- estimates. 
JIM (blankly) ...Estimates? 
MURIEL (rapidly; to conceal a feeling of guilt) Darling, you know how long we've said we've got to do something about this apartment, and, well, he called last week, and I had him come over, and he's got some simply wonderful ideas! 
JIM (quietly) There couldn't be two Bunny Funkhausers, could there? 
MURIEL Why, no, dear. 
JIM Then this is the same clever young man who's responsible for that zebra- striped monstrosity in the Collins' living room? 
MURIEL That couch is terribly functional.

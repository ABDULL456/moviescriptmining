205 CHRIS AND BILLY 
Just exactly where they are isn't clear yet, nor should it be. But we do hear the Prom noises. 
BILLY I thought you said they'd win. 
CHRIS They will. They will. Won't even be close. 
BILLY If you screwed up... 
CHRIS Don't worry. I called in a few favors. 
206 INT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT 
The black cuckoo clock ­ STRIKING TEN 
207 INT. WHITE KITCHEN 
as Margaret, mumbling to herself, with the fixated attention of the damned, continues to scrub a sliver of whetstone along the gleaming edge of the knife's blade. 
CUT TO: 
208 INT. GYM ­ CARRIE AND TOMMY'S TABLE 
as new ballots arrive courtesy of Norma, who leans over them and whispers breathily: 
NORMA Good luck! 
As Tommy picks up the pencil, Carrie puts her hand on his. 
CARRIE Don't. 
TOMMY What? 
CARRIE Don't vote for us. 
TOMMY In for a penny, in for a pound. That's what my grandmother used to say. 
CARRIE (swallowing) Don't. Please. 
Tommy hesitates for a second, seeing her face so full of premonition. Then he overcomes it, and scrawls their names on the slip of paper, folding it. 
TOMMY For you. 
He hands it to Norma Watson, and it's off ­ spirited away, gone. 
TOMMY Tonight you go first-class. 
Carrie stares at the receding figure of Norma as if she were the messenger of doom. 
CUT TO: 
209 INT. GYM ­ VOTING TABLES 
Where we get a sense of exactly what Chris meant by favors as De Lois, Trennant, and a once again completely wrecked Kenny Garson plus Norma bring over more ballots. It's not exactly what one would call an honest ballot. 
210 GYM DOOR ­ POV 
as Sue manages to slip by Fromm, who's still lazily monitoring the door. She starts heading for the backstage area, trying to be as unobtrusive as possible. 
211 NORMA 
At the voting table, she spies Sue coming in, and finding it irresistible, blurts out the news, whispering to: 
212 MORTON 
Who's just finishing the ballot counting. He looks in the direction that Norma's pointing in, seeing: 
213 SUE 
Going backstage, heading into the wings to watch: 
214 INT. GYM ­ THE STAGE 
as Ernest returns to the microphone. 
The BAND plays another FANFARE OF DRUMS. Ernest sees this as his big moment; he almost drops the ballots. He pauses for a moment, surveying the gym floor and the anxious prom-goers. An actors savoring the tension. Then he smiles, white teeth grinning: 
ERNEST Tommy and Carrie win. By one vote. 
Begin SLOW MOTION 
Silence. Everything a half-beat exaggerated, slowed. 
Carrie gasps inwardly; the candle in front of her blows out. 
Tommy grins, amused. He shrugs his shoulders at Carrie. 
And the applause begins ­ some of it, most of it, genuine, but some of it mocking too. 
The band launches into a rock version of "Pomp and Circumstance." 
Ushers appear at Tommy and Carrie's table. George is pounding Tommy's back. An aluminum foil scepter is thrust into Tommy's hand; a robe with a fur collar is thrust over Carrie's shoulders. 
215 SUE ­ STAGE WINGS

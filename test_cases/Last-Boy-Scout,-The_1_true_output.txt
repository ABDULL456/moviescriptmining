HALLENBECK watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform... Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows. All it does is piss him off. MILO You ruined my flesh! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again, a chattering BURST of GUNFIRE. The muzzle flash is blinding. The windshield of a passing car SHATTERS -- The driver panics, the car spins out of control -- Slews across the road in the middle of traffic. COLLISIONS. CRUMPLING METAL. EXPLOSIONS of GLASS. SCREECHING TIRES. 
CAR slides straight toward Hallenbeck. 
He dives aside, rolls to his feet -- And he's right in Milo's sights. My friends, the fat lady just sang. Except another lady says different: A single GUNSHOT SPLITS the air. Milo's chest explodes with bubbling blood. He shrieks. Turns, staring in disbelief at 
SARAH HALLENBECK below, on the lawn.     She aims Joe's service revolver and says: SARAH You just fucking die. 
She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward. Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard. She DROPS the HAMMER again and again.     Empties the gun. Milo jerks and twitches.     Racked by gunfire. Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier -- Clutches himself.     Looks over at Hallenbeck. HALLENBECK She's something, isn't she? Milo pitches forward.     Falls to his death. 
HALLENBECK stares, dumbfounded at Sarah.   She look up at him. A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody. Bullet-scarred. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe. They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says: JIMMY The car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you something. 
EXT. 405 FREEWAY - SOUTHBOUND LANE - NIGHT Jimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window. JIMMY Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right? There is a pause. They both stare at the car. Two million. Down the drain. Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh. First chuckling, then chortling.. Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls. Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk -- You can guess what's inside. 
JIMMY Son of a bitch got the wrong one! CUT TO: 
AUTOGRAPHED FOOTBALL on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite. Signed by Joe Montana, no less. 
CONRAD MARCON bustles back and forth, shoves the last of his needed possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near the door. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Crosses to the bed, where the other suitcase lies. Looks at it. Smiles, contented. Can't help himself.    He reaches out.    Flicks the latch. Opens it. There is a note taped to the inside: FUCK YOU 
EXT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT Marcon's flaming corpse is BLOWN OUT through the glass, along with his earthly possessions. He plummets like a meteor. CUT TO:

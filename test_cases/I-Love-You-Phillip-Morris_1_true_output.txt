Steven stares at his distorted face in the polished metal MIRROR in his cell. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Whatever the case, how does a person who doesn't exist go on existing? Well the answer is- he doesn't.

177     INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - NIGHT      177 
Steven is curled up in a ball in his cell, SOBBING as he stares at a SNAPSHOT of Phillip in Key West pasted to the wall. 
BUNKMATE (O.S.) Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to sleep. 
178     INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY CAFETERIA, 1997 - DAY         178 
Steven sits over an untouched tray of food, staring at it detached. He looks thin. Pale. 
179     INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - NIGHT      179 
Steven kneels over the toilet in his cell.   The sound of PUKING reverberates. 
180     INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - MORNING 180 
Months later, Steven sits up in his bed. He now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost an unhealthy amount of weight. "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages    5-23-08   101. 
181    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 INFIRMARY - DAY                181 
OPEN CLOSE on the gaunt and grey-skinned Steven. A MALE NURSE places a thermometer in his mouth and looks at Steven's medical history. He looks concerned. 
MALE NURSE I'll be right back. 
182    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY OFFICE - DAY       182 
Steven sits before a YOUNG PRISON DOCTOR who looks through his records. 
YOUNG DOCTOR I'm sorry to have to tell you this Steven, your t-cell counts indicate that, uh... Well... you have AIDS. 
Steven sits expressionless. 
STEVEN How long do I have? 
And off the Doctor's grave face--

183    EXT. SKY - 1966 - DAY                                     183 
CLOUDS drift slowly across the sky. 
The OPENING SCENE again- the four kids lying on the hill, staring at the clouds. Young Steven smiles at the sight. 
A dull WHINE is heard, building until-- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
184    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY           184 
The first hospital scene in the movie. The cardio ALARM blares. Steven watches from his bed as a DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside. 
DOCTOR Where's the crash cart!? 
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   102. 
STEVEN (V.O.) So here we are, where you first met me... 
CUT TO: 
185    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - LATER         185 
A sheet is pulled over the cardio victim's corpse and Steven watches as it is wheeled out of the ward. 
He returns his bleary gaze to the ceiling. 
STEVEN (V.O.) I've been in this bed for months now. Waiting to die. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I might get a chance to see Phillip one more time. (beat) But I don't know how much longer I can do this... 
Steven's eyes roll back into his head as he slips into unconsciousness. 
186    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - CELL - DAY                   186 
A slightly built, effeminate inmate (SAMUEL) raps on Phillip's open cell door as he enters. 
SAMUEL Got a minute? 
PHILLIP Samuel.   You want some crackers? 
SAMUEL No... thanks. Look- I just talked to my friend- he's a nurse at the infirmary. I don't know if you know this or not but uh... 
Phillip looks to him with curiosity.

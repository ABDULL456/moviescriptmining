INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT 
As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they hear a loud SPLAT! 
MEAGAN Stormie?! 
The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is splattered with blood and bits. 
Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES come running into the cellblock, answering the deputy's puke-choked scream. 
MEAGAN (continuing) Oh, God... what have I done? What have I done?! 
We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to... 
EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT 
An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead. The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up with a terrible SQUEAL. 
WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock. Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says: 
AMBULANCE DRIVER I'll go check it out. You stay here. 
The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious. 
The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights -- it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action! He starts towards the ambulance. 
The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver, emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face into the side of the ambulance. 
In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then... silence. 
RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his eyes... waiting for the inevitable. 
Then... nothing. 
After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm -- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently. 
ERWIN You... want me to tell you where Meagan is? 
Again with the thrusting. 
ERWIN (continuing) Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus, for a minute there I thought you were going to kill me. (then) You're not, are you? 
Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time. 
ERWIN (continuing) Okay... okay! I'll take you right to her. Could you help me out of this? 
Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps. 
Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying: 
ERWIN (continuing) I'll drive. 
Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into the passenger side door. 
ERWIN (continuing) Okay... you drive. 
As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says: 
COMPUTER VOICE Fasten your safety belt, please. 
Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach. Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts. The CHIME goes crazy. 
COMPUTER VOICE (continuing) Fasten your safety belt, please... Fasten your safety belt, please... 
Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously: 
ERWIN Fuck the bitch. Let's roll! 
With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the ambulance roars away into the early morning. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN 
Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes, she switches on the cellblock TV. 
ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program is on.

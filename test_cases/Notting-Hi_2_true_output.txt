WILLIAM What? 
BERNIE Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it... 
WILLIAM It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. 
They take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes. A pause. 
WILLIAM Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong decision, haven't I? 
They look at him.  Spike does a big nod. 
WILLIAM Max, how fast is your car? 
EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY 
Max's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the car. 
MAX If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices. 
BERNIE And we intend to use them! 
MAX Where's Bella? 
HONEY She's not coming. 
MAX Sod that.  Bernie -- in the back! 
He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of the chair. 
MAX Come on, babe. 
EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY 
Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and outside the car. 
BELLA Where are you going? 
MAX Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner. 
BELLA Crazy.  Go along Bayswater... 
HONEY That's right -- then Park Lane. 
BERNIE Or you could go right down to Cromwell Road, and left. 
WILLIAM No! 
Suddenly the car slams to a halt. 
MAX Stop right there!  I will decide the route.  All right? 
ALL All right. 
MAX James Bond never has to put up with this sort of shit. 
EXT. PICCADILLY - DAY 
The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows. 
BERNIE Bloody hell, this is fun. 
IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY 
WILLIAM Is Miss Scott staying here? 
It is the same man. 
RITZ MAN No, sir. 
WILLIAM How about Miss Flintstone?

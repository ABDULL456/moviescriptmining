MIA The Prius. 
A beat. Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. Motions to the Valet: Sorry. One second. Looks. All the keys are Prius keys. 
MIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. 
Another beat. Sebastian finds it. Grabs it. 
37   EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. Mia aims her key fob. No beep. Sebastian points his own keys, also aiming for a beep. Silence. They've been at this for a while. 
MIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... 
SEBASTIAN Those look comfortable. 
MIA They are...n't. 
A beat. She aims again. No beep. 
MIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. 
SEBASTIAN You didn't give me much of a choice. 
MIA Strange that we keep running into each other. 
SEBASTIAN It is strange. Maybe it means something. 
MIA I doubt it. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. Revision                        21. 
On that, Mia aims again. As always -- no beep. Noticing -- 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. 
MIA What? 
Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. He looks idiotic. 
SEBASTIAN It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. 
MIA Uh-huh. 
SEBASTIAN You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. 
MIA Oh my God. 
Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you can see. It's the most romantic sight imaginable. They look at each other. A beat. And then -- 
MIA (CONT'D) Eh. 
They walk on, the lights shimmering behind. 
SEBASTIAN Not much to look at. 
MIA Agreed. I've seen better. 
And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT] 
Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's "no big deal", nothing they haven't seen or felt before -- because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them... 
Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests otherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes for flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as she slips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious... Revision                        22. 
He moves his foot. She moves hers. They look at each other again. Still suspicious... 
He moves again. She moves again. They seem to be moving in sync -- without their even wanting to... 
And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE...

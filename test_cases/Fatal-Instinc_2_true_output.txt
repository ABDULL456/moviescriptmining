A beat. The LIGHT clicks ON. LANA; a sexy redhead with a cool, manipulative edge, and FRANK; a slick, smarmy Lothario, lay under the sheets, panting, glistening with sweat. 
Lana reaches for a pack of "Fatal 100's" on the bedside table. 
LANA Not bad for an auto mechanic... 
FRANK (grins, cocky) Yeah, well you're not so bad yourself... for a lawyer's wife... 
LANA Better watch your tongue, sweetie, or I'll have my husband arrest you. 
FRANK Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When does he ever find time for you? 
She lights a cigarette... exhales a soft, gloomy cloud. 
LANA He doesn't. That's why I need you to keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod? 
FRANK Maybe you should trade him in on a new model. 
LANA I would... if I could make any money on the deal. 
FRANK (reaches for her) Want to go for another test drive? 
The SOUND of an automobile engine outside. Lana stops him. 
LANA Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm still under warranty. 
EXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then takes note of his wife's silver Mercedes... sitting on floor jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it. 
INT. HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - MORNING 
Ned enters. Lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned unevenly, hair disheveled. She smokes a cigarette. 
NED Morning sweetheart. 
Ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through the kitchen on his way to the dining room. She reacts with bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot. 
LANA Uh huh. Want some coffee? 
Ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase. 
NED No thanks. 
Ned sees Frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, coveralls hastily pulled on inside-out. Frank is reading a copy of INSURANCE DIGEST magazine. A headline on the cover touts an article: "LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOUR CAT!... Cover All Nine Lives For The Price of One!" Ned's smile fades. 
LANA Frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car. 
He steps over to the table... gives Frank a cool stare. 
NED How long you been working on Lana's Mercedes, Frank? 
FRANK (shrugs) Oh... I don't know... six, seven weeks. 
NED And ya still haven't found the problem? 
FRANK (a leering smile) Think I got my finger on it though. 
Ned turns to Lana. 
NED I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't born yesterday. He's not fixing your car. He's SCREWING you! 
Lana tenses up at this. Frank freezes. He figures they've been busted. He sits there, holding the magazine, not moving a muscle... as Ned turns on him. 
NED YOU are screwing my wife! I can see what your game is, Frank. You open up her hood, poke around in there... squirt some lubrication in... play around with all her parts... then take an old used piston and stick it in... then pull it out... in, out, in, out! Every day! There's no end to it. You just keep coming and COMING!... and the bill just gets bigger and BIGGER! 
Lana braces herself against the sink, breathless... turned on by Ned's description. Ned goes to her, sympathetic. 
NED But you don't see it, do you, Lana? You're too good... too pure. You can't see the evil in people like him. (turns to Frank) Well, you're not getting away with it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're fired! 
LANA (breathless) Ned... don't you have to be somewhere? 
NED (checks his watch) Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late for court. 
He goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him. He looks at her lovingly... touches her face tenderly. 
NED You are so naive. 
He picks up his briefcase, gives Frank a nasty look, then exits thru the back door. 
Lana and Frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot now! Frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm. Lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. He lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her. 
Suddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank... not even noticing Lana on the table. 
NED Finish your coffee... then GET OUT! 
He slams the door. A beat. Lana and Frank begin to devour each other with passionate kisses. Another beat. The front doorbell RINGS once... then again. 
FRANK Who's that? 
LANA Just the postman. He always rings twice.

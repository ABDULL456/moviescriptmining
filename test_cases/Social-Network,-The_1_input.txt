(TO MARK) This came in for you. 
MARK You can put it on my desk. ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark's desk. 
SEAN She's 19, I can't he.lp it, But I'll tell you what--after tonight.she's yours. in fact, I'm. gonna get' you in with all sorts of girls you wouldn't have met before. 
(CALLING OUT) Mackey! 
MACKEY 
(CALLING BACK) Yes sir! 
SEAN Refresh! 
MARK (blandly to SEAN) You'd do that for me? MACKEY hits the "refresh" key and the big screen shows-- 
CHEERS erupts throughout the place. SEAN grabs MARK and hugs him but MARK doesn't quite hug back--he's still hearing what SEAN just said. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT 
We can hear the thumping music coming 'from the party inside and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this pristine, four-columned house. 
INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's dark but we can make out people dancing. The place is packed. 
UT TO 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN's in there with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and another GIRL. SEAN's got his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a while. 
GIRL I can't find a mirror. 
GUY Do it on anything. You can use a CD. 
ASHLEIGH Do it off this. ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of which to snort cocaine. 
GIRL Alright! The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is talking, 
SEAN The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is the true... digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously. 
ASHLEIGH Would this be easier without the bra? 
GUY It's worth finding out. The girls start happily slipping off their bras-- 
.SEAN I've spent hours-- 
ASHLEIGH Why has the music stopped? 
SEAN I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on. 
ASHLEIGH Seriously, why has the music stopped? ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just doesn't sound like a party anymore. 
SEAN flow they always checked their friends' status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...We lived on farms, then we lived in cities and now we're gonna live on the internet. 
- ASHLEIGH Sean. Stop. Something's going on downstairs, SEAN stops talking-he senses it too now. SEAN walks out of the room to the-- 
INT, STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he can react, the front door flies open-- POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking across the darkened party floor and the faces.. We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and "step to the side" and "nobody's leaving just yet", etc. SEAN bolts back into-- 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
--leaving the door open. 
SEAN It's the cops. And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm of his hand to get the coke dust off. 
SEAN (CONT'D) 
POLICEMAN What's goin' on? They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN's eyes. 
SEAN 
(BEAT) We're sorry, was the music too loud? We've got kind of a celebration going. 
POLICEMAN Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on. 
SEAN I can have them turn the music down. One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The cop uses his finger to taste what it is. 
SEAN (CONT'D) Yeah, that isn't mine. 
POLICEMAN Okay, could you all stay where you are. And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of terrified children. 
GIRL, Wait, can we just talk for a second? We start to move in on SEAM... 
POLICEMAN 
(TO SEAN) You got anything in your pockets I need to know about? 
SEAN No sir. 
- POLICEMAN Don't be stupid now, 
SEAN I don It. 
POLICEMAN (out of SEAN's shirt pocket) What's this? 
SEAN It's an Epipen, 
POLICEMAN And this? 
SEAN That's my inhaler. 
POLICEMAN #2 Ladies, how old are you? 
GIRL I'm 20. 
ASHLEIGH I'm 19, 
POLICEMAN Lying makes â¢ i_'E worse. 
ASHLEIGH I'm 17, I-'m sorry, I shouldn't have lied. SEAN closes. his eyes at hearing this news as we HEAR the sound of the-cuffs lock around his wrists and we

INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT 
A digital LED clock on the wall tells us it's 4:40AM. MARK is sitting at his computer alone. No one else is in the office. The San Francisco skyline is beautiful outside the floor-to-ceiling glass. His cell phone RINGS and he answers. 
MARK

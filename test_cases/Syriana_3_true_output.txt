PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) Who will be Emir? The Emir looks away, then back at Prince Nasir. 
EMIR Your brother. Prince Nasir looks from his father to brother and back. 
PRINCE MESHAL I would ask you to remain as Foreign Minister. Prince Meshal sticks out his hand. Nasir ignores it and speaks to his father. 
PRINCE NASIR You cannot do this. He is barely qualified to run a brothel much less a country. 
EMIR 
(VAGUELY) I like Europe, the precipitation. I will be happy to stay here. My decision is final and I ask you to support your brother. 
PRINCE NASIR I cannot do that. 
142 EXT. GENEVA LAKE FRONT - DAY 142 
The ROAR of water as the fountain cascades down. Riley plays along the low wall beside it. Bryan and Julie hover nearby. Around them people speak German and French. 
BRYAN Sure, it looks like just hanging around in a hotel but that's how these people do business. It's world historical stage time. With the delivery deals we can make in Europe, transport through Iran, this guy might be able to revolutionize not just his country, but the whole region.

142 CONTINUED: 142 
BRYAN (CONT'D) His dad's about to keel over and Prince Nasir could be like Mossadegh in Iran in 1952, with a real democracy springing up organically. I mean if we could just be a part of one of these countries getting a Parliament, helping them find efficiency, showing them how real incentivized capitalism can do its job -- 
JULIE Stop it! Look at me. The fountain shoots up and cascades down. Riley leans toward the water and for a second his feet lift up. Bryan starts up, but then Riley is playing again. 
BRYAN Julie, the little trading company I work for is now the chief economic advisor to Prince Nasir. Do you know what this means? It's like someone put a giant ATM on our front lawn. 
JULIE Here's a question: how do you think it looks to profit off the death of your six year-old? This gets through, but then -- 
BRYAN Fuck you. I changed the diapers and put cream on rashes and gave bottles in the night and went to doctor's check-ups and worried about percentiles... I did everything right. I did everything right. They look at each other and, for a second, it seems he may melt and hold her, but he doesn't and it's cruel. 
JULIE Bryan, we're going back to America. 
BRYAN Good.

142 CONTINUED: ( 2) 142 She heads for Riley who lets go of a balloon. It floats up past the watch signs plastered on the buildings. 
CUT TO: 
143 INT. BEDROOM - GEORGETOWN MANSION - NIGHT 143 
A phone RINGS a muted electronic BEEP. Dean Whiting answers the phone. 
WHITING 
(SLEEPY VOICE) Hello. 
ALARM COMPANY Hello, is this Mr. Why-Teeng? This is HomeTech Security. He reaches for the bedside light and snaps it on. Mrs. Whiting is a lump on the far side of the bed. 
WHITING This is Mr. Whiting. 
ALARM COMPANY We're showing a motion sensor failure in your downstairs study. 
WHITING Yes. Whiting glances at the wall readout on his alarm -- DOWNSTAIRS STUDY flashing. 
ALARM COMPANY Like I said we're getting a failure message. You want me to stay on the phone with you while you walk around or send a car? Whiting reaches under his bed and pulls a gun box. He flips the combination. Three pistols. He selects the largest and switches off the light. 
WHITING I'll walk around. 
144 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 144 
Whiting closes the bedroom door and switches on the hall light. Lots of closed doors. He walks down the stairs. 
145 INT. DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 145 
He reaches around a wall and hits the living room lights. He crosses the living room and library, hitting lights as he goes. Then a kitchen. The house is quiet.

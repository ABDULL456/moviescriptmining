{"train": "\"UNDER FIRE\" \nScreenplay by \nClayton Frohman and Ron Shelton \nStory by \nClayton Frohman \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nSOMEWHERE IN AFRICA \nEXT. GRASSY PLAINS - DUSK \nBIRDS ARE FLUSHED FROM HIDING. A soldier carrying an automatic weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around. A mortar shell explodes nearby. There are no sound effects. He seems unperturbed. \nSeveral more explosions in the field. The soldier motions with his arm and: \nFIFTY MORE SOLDIERS RISE UP OUT OF THE GRASS More small explosions. \nFREEZE FRAME \nWith a click-click of a camera -- still no fx. \nTHE SOLDIERS RUN THROUGH THE GRASS FOLLOWING THEIR LEADER As they do, the platoon leader waves his arms again. \nFIVE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT OF THE SHRUBBERY Through a field of small mortar explosions. \nFREEZE FRAME \nWith the click-click of a camera. \nTHE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS Each carries an enormous load of supplies, and each is ridden by a soldier with a rifle. \nA HELICOPTER GUNSHIP DIVES OUT OF THE SKY firing rockets at the soldiers and elephants. A tribal mask is painted on the nose of the chopper. \nTHE ELEPHANTS REAR UP IN TERROR \nThe soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the chopper and begin firing. \nTHE CHOPPER ATTACKS THE ELEPHANTS against an African sunset. \nFREEZE FRAME \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT./EXT. LOBBY OF THE 'NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL' - DAWN \nA door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi- pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat up canvas bag over his shoulder. \nA BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk. Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines -- one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and a coke, and begins eating his \"breakfast\" as he crosses the lobby. \nEXT. THE HOTEL - DAWN \nJIMMY, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against the wall. Several street vendors have their wares laid out on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives; there is familiar ritual in their greeting. \nThey cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi, a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the door, \"New People's Taxi Company\" and Jimmy's name in script above it. Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy. \nPRICE 'Morning, Jimmy, think you could squeeze me in? \nJIMMY Where is you would care to go at once, Mr. Price? \nPRICE Bang-bang. \nJIMMY Twenty dollar. \nPrice hands him a wad of bills. \nPRICE You're a thief, Jimmy. \nJimmy smiles broadly, nodding, then points to the sky. \nJIMMY Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap? \nPRICE I don't do skies. \nThe two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an open marketplace just starting to come alive; the cab drives off. \nEXT. A REMOTE AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY \nThe taxi arrives, and Price gets out. \nPrice ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against an old building. A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra -- with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit. \nThe sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness. Price hurries to the corner. \nP.O.V. A JEEP LEADING AN ARMY CONVOY \nA ROW OF HANGING PHOTOGRAPHS catches her eye. She stops and looks closely -- then laughs in spite of herself at a series of pictures: PHOTO OF A TALL AFRICAN NATIVE WITH A COCK SO LONG IT IS TIED IN A KNOT; PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFULLY BREASTED AFRICAN WOMAN; PHOTO OF SEVERAL POSING SOLDIERS; PHOTO OF A PHOTO -- THE RANCH HOUSE WITH POOL; PHOTO SELF-PORTRAIT OF PRICE BLOWING SMOKE RINGS; PHOTO OF CLAIRE AND ALEX IN HAPPIER DAYS. \nCLAIRE PULLS THE PHOTO OF ALEX AND HER from the clip and looks at it. \nTHE DOOR OPENS, AND PRICE ENTERS \nPRICE Oh. I didn't know you were here. \nCLAIRE Sure you did. You were taking pictures of me all over the room. \nPRICE Well... yeah... you looked great. Why aren't you partying? \nCLAIRE In a minute. \nHe notices the picture she's looking at. \nPRICE I printed that up for Alex. \nCLAIRE It wouldn't be the greatest thing you could give him right now... (beat) We just split up. \nPRICE Jesus, I'm sorry. Who left who this time? \nCLAIRE I'm the villain... I thought it could be a little cleaner this time -- me in Central America, him in New York. \nPRICE That's pretty clean. \nCLAIRE But he's decided to go to Nicaragua too. \nPRICE To cover you or the war? \nCLAIRE To cover everything. \nSilence. Price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the ear. She smiles quickly and nervously. \nCLAIRE No. \nHe kisses her on the neck. \nCLAIRE For godsakes, Russell, listen. \nThe sounds of the party can be heard. He ignores them and moves around her, trying to kiss her on the lips. She puts her hand over his mouth. \nPrice reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing. \nPRICE I don't want to wait for you again. We've been circling each other since the Montreal Olympics. \nCLAIRE You're a genius of bad timing. (beat) I'm going back to the party. \nShe heads to the door; Price stays. She stops before getting there, hesitates, then pulls the PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANT from the string and returns to Price, handing him the photo. \nCLAIRE This is a great shot. \nPRICE Thanks. \nCLAIRE I've heard the light in Nicaragua's even better. \nHe doesn't respond. They stand for several moments -- the sounds of the party get louder. She turns and heads to Alex's celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom. \nPRICE LOOKS AT CLAIRE AS SHE LEAVES, stares aimlessly for several moments, then focuses back on his PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNICARAGUA 1979 \nEXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON \nCLOSE ON: TIME MAGAZINE WITH COVER PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS, gradually PULL BACK to reveal other magazines, candy, cigars, Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally: \nA FIRE TRUCK LEADS A PROCESSION through the streets -- a group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that reads \"Our Revolution is in Christ\" (in Spanish), followed by three Catholic PRIESTS in bright robes, followed by a sound truck with P.A. system, followed by hundreds of townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs. All are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm. Small red and black flags are scattered throughout. \nA CAB DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS runs into the parade and stops. Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied precariously to the roof. The trunk of the cab has been smashed in beyond repair. Price hops out of the cab with his camera bag -- he doesn't know what the parade is about but it looks great. He hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby. \nPRICE Wait here. \nHe runs to join the procession. \nPRICE HOPS ONTO THE RUNNING BOARD OF THE FIRE TRUCK and almost simultaneously his light meter is out. HE is surrounded by images: SMALL GIRLS DRESSED AS ANGELS LINE THE STREET, TOWNSPEOPLE HANG FROM DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS, ICE CREAM CARTS AMONG RELIGIOUS ICONS, SOLDIERS WITH GUNS STAND IN SMALL GROUPS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE. \nPRICE IS QUICKLY TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING, changing cameras, occasionally taking a quick light reading; his actions are instinctive and automatic. Suddenly: \nTEN YOUNG TEENAGERS BURST INTO THE PARADE They wear red and black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks. They are chanting: \nTEENAGE BOYS Rafael, Rafael, Rafael... libre o muerte... Rafael... \nA LARGE PAINTING OF THE FACE OF RAFAEL is carried aloft on a stick, draped with red and black scarves. \nPRICE PHOTOGRAPHS the boys and the painting. \nNATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS SHOVE INTO THE PARADE Up and down the street they spring into action, running for position with their guns. \nShe starts to leave again, and again he stops her. \nPRICE Just one more thing -- is Rafael owned by the C.I.A. or the K.G.B.? I'll figure out the rest. \nIsela seems to welcome the question. Her tone is less flip, and she focuses hard on Price. \nISELA Mr. Price... the world is not divided into East and West anymore. It is divided into North and South. By the time you people figure that out -- it will be too late. (beat) Congratulations on your cover. \nShe touches his Time magazine, kisses Alex on the cheek, and floats magically through the pool area. \nPrice frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot. \nP.O.V. OF ISELA THROUGH PRICE'S FINGERS Isela kisses another journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at another table. \nPRICE So far this war's got it all over Africa. \nALEX You're gonna have a ball. \nALEX PLACES HIS HAND OVER PRICE'S \"FRAME\" blocking out his view of the sexy Isela. Though Alex's tone is gentle, the threat is obvious. \nALEX Hands off. I need an interpreter more than you do right now. \nPrice takes the hint. \nPRICE You still hanging in there with Claire? \nAlex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly. \nALEX I'm hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun... by younger men. \nSilence and an uneasiness that Alex intended. Price manages a smile. \nPRICE Younger men. \nAlex smiles disarmingly. \nCLAIRE RISES AT THE OPPOSITE BAR, picks up her papers, and heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step. \nBOTH MEN ARE A BIT SURPRISED AT HER ENTRANCE and she hands a stack of mail to Alex. \nCLAIRE Hi, Alex... Russell! When did you get in? \nPRICE Just now. \nShe shakes Price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain both men. \nCLAIRE You're not going to believe this -- I just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story... (she teases them) ...exclusive... eat your heart out. \nPRICE What'd ya get? \nCLAIRE I've just been promised a private interview with Tacho. \nALEX (impressed) Congratulations. The bastard won't talk to me. \nPRICE Who's Tacho? \nThey turn to Price as if everyone knows who Tacho is. \nCLAIRE That's President Somoza's nickname. \nPRICE I don't know who the players are yet. \nALEX Want me to order you a hot dog and a program? \nA bit of tension and awkwardness -- Claire quickly takes control and changes the tone. \nCLAIRE Fellas! No fighting after six at night, all right? Curfew. (beat) C'mon, we've all got something to celebrate. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE VIKING CLUB OF MANAGUA - NIGHT \nCorrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange combination of decorative and architectural devices. DAISY WILLIAMS, a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" with a mediocre jazz group. \nHUB KITTLE is present, and other journalists drop by the table to say hello. \nA BOY PHOTOGRAPHER, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price. They are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with the camera. They hold up the TIME COVER and a couple of beers in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no flash. \nThe boy puts the camera down disappointedly. \nBOY PHOTOGRAPHER (in broken English) Sometimes it doesn't work. \nThe three journalists relax their pose. \nPRICE Let me look. \nON THE BANDSTAND Daisy has just finished \"San Francisco\" and spots Alex, motioning to him. \nDAISY Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex ov' here... \nAs we hear Alex's gentle rendition of the standard, a NECKING COUPLE moves back into the shadows of the club. Each pulls on a mask, as in the b.g.: \nISELA AND AN ELEGANT MAN ARRIVE AT THE CLUB \nThe man, somehow out of place, dresses with casual continental style, not overdone but expensive and tasteful -- clearly from another world. He wears a neat hat and moves gracefully. Isela looks stunning, dressed for the evening. The DOORMAN greets them familiarly. \nIsela casually checks her watch as they enter the club. \nThe masked couple in the shadows check their watches. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE VIKING CLUB \nAs Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without trying. Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex gently before sitting in the booth with the man. \nIN PRICE'S BOOTH the new arrivals have caught their attention -- Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them. \nCLAIRE Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers. \nREGIS Before you fall in love -- that's Marcel Jazy... friend of wine, women, and Somoza. They say he's a businessman... \nCLAIRE (interrupting) He's a businessman in search of a business... he doesn't try very hard to cover up his connections to the C.I.A... \nP.O.V. OF JAZY LIGHTING ISELA'S CIGARETTE \nCLAIRE But look at his moves -- can the C.I.A. light cigarettes like that? \nPRICE What's wrong with the Everly Brothers? \nTHE WAITER ARRIVES AT PRICE'S BOOTH and sets down three shrimp cocktails and more champagne, as: \nINT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE CLUB \nIt opens quickly, and three more MEN IN MASKS enter quickly. \nBACK TO THE BOOTH as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness. \nWAITER Please stay at your table, and you won't be hurt. \nA FACE IN A MASK MOVES QUICKLY PAST PRICE'S TABLE \nANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher waves a gun. \nTWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the entrance. \nTHREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air, moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down slowly. (Six Guerrillas total) \nA GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears. The name \"RAFAEL\" is written under the face, then other names and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place: \nA WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly and smoothly. \nONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas around the room are serious but nervous. \nGUERRILLA LEADER (in Spanish) We do not want to waste any ammunition on a head as empty as yours -- but we will. \nBUSINESSMAN (in Spanish) What is this?! \nGUERRILLA LEADER (in Spanish) Shut up! Get up! \nThe BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation, then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches away from the Businessman's face. \nThe Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the back door of the club. \nGUERRILLA LEADER (in Spanish) You are coming with us -- you will not be hurt -- we will trade you for the release of some Nicaraguans who care about Nicaragua. \nThe woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing him to move toward the kitchen door. \nPRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly -- Price is coolest in any crisis. \nCLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and a tiny red light comes on. \nTHE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper. \nMASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY \nTHE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes: \nTHE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and: \nTHE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything freezes, and: \nTHE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer, runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a crowded section of the club. \nA Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it up, and as he does: \nTHE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical instruments explode, and: \nTHE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The Businessman is soiled but unhurt. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT \nPrice bounces along, whistling, \"San Francisco.\" An occasional Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past. He strolls up the walkway of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow. \nINT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT \nBlue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief negotiation of the black market value. \nPRICE (in broken Spanish) Cuanto? \nOLD WOMAN Quince. \nPRICE Veinte. \nOLD WOMAN Diezysiete. \nShe shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the room to change the dollar into cordobas. Price idly studies the pictures on the wall: \nPICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN. \nPRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier. \nTHE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't heard them enter over the sounds of music and our preoccupation with the pictures. \nPRICE What is this? I'm a journalist! \nNo answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge. \nPRICE Journalista, journalista! \nThe officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it briefly and takes the passport. He nods. \nA rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away. \nAs the Guard hauls him outside, the OLD WOMAN appears in the doorway with a stack of local currency. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MILITARY HOLDING CELL - NIGHT \nPrice is led into a dark cell where another PRISONER, 50, lies in street clothes on the floor. The Prisoner is spat upon by the Guards and kicked awake. Price cringes. \nGUARD Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta... (in Spanish to Price) Here is a Priest for you to confess your sins. \nThe Guards laugh and leave. The Prisoner rises to his feet. Price keeps his distance. The Prisoner looks in bad shape. \nPRISONER PRIEST Cigarillo? \nPrice hands him a cigarette and lights it. A long, deep drag. \nPRICE Priest? (the man nods) (in broken Spanish) What are you doing here? \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) The government accused me of using the church to hide Rebels and guns. \nPRICE (in Spanish) Governments are always wrong, eh? \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) This time they're right. Who are you? \nPRICE (in Spanish) Un periodista. \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) Whose side are you on? \nPRICE (in Spanish) I don't take sides. I take pictures. \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) No sides? \nPRICE (in Spanish) No. \nThe Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain. \nPRISONER PRIEST Periodista Puta, todos periodistas son putas. (All journalists are whores) \nThe Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is surprised to be treated so despicably. \nPRISONER PRIEST (quietly) Go home. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM \nPrice is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans. The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes. \nFIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone. \nPRICE Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh? Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time magazine. \nThe soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion to Price's tone, shouting: \nMarcel Jazy stands, drink in hand, looking slightly rumpled in the daylight, slightly older, but more charming and self- effacing than his first impression indicated. His two story Mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair; the gardens are scraggly and overgrown. The pool is empty. Jazy addresses Price and Claire. \nPRICE ...are you a spy or aren't you, eh? \nJAZY (smiling) Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price... nobody is a... 'spy'... anymore. \nCLAIRE Russell prefers pictures to words... \nJAZY You don't have to apologize... you're journalists. \nCLAIRE And you're a businessman? \nJAZY A businessman? That sounds good. Okay, I'm a businessman. \nPRICE Why was I arrested, and why did you get me released, and who are you? \nAs he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a SPECTACULAR LOOKING WOMAN emerges from the shadows of the house into the light of the courtyard. She is tall, Latin, and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion swimsuit, cut high on the legs. \nPrice, Claire, and Jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to look into the empty pool. \nWOMAN IN SWIMSUIT No agua. \nJAZY (nodding) No agua. \nWOMAN IN SWIMSUIT (in Spanish) Oh, Marcel! You told me there would be water in the pool this week! \nJazy leans in very coolly to Price and Claire as he pours an extra glass of wine and speaks softly in English again. \nJAZY If she dove in, I assure you she wouldn't notice. \nHe carries the glass of wine to the woman, smiling warmly. \nJAZY (to Miss Panama in Spanish) Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked out the pumping station on the road to Masaya, and we must ration water for the time being. Next week maybe things will be better. \nWOMAN IN SWIMSUIT (in Spanish) Maybe I should go back to Panama. \nJAZY (in Spanish) Maybe you should. \nJazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass of wine. The woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in the sun. Very sexy. She reaches for and kisses Jazy's hand affectionately -- he kisses her forehead. She feels better now. \nJazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside. \nINT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall, nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn. \nJAZY You were arrested because the Guardia are clowns who specialize in excess. You were released because I told them to release you. \nCLAIRE These are not the normal duties of a businessman. \nHe looks at them directly. \nJAZY But they are the normal duties of a... spy, eh? You win, I'm a spy. (smiles) There, are you happy? I feel better. \nHe refills their glasses. \nJAZY Now we can relax. You can turn off your little thing. \nThe red light of her recorder is on. She smiles slightly, undisturbed, and turns it off. \nJAZY Oh, I trust you won't say anything to hurt me. In some ways I'm a terrible spy. I used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who I am. I have too many girlfriends. I like to be photographed. (beat) I talk too much. \nPrice and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to interrupt this strange performance. \nJAZY I always talk too much... but my girlfriends like that... No matter. (pointing to the swimsuited woman) You know who she is? \nCLAIRE AND PRICE No. \nJAZY That's Miss Panama. Do you know who that is? \nCLAIRE AND PRICE Oh, yeah, yes, etc. \nJAZY She's in love with me. I've got to get some water in the pool. (beat) And once a week I have lunch with President Somoza to discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, but all he wants to talk about is Miss Panama... he's worried about her. \nClaire interrupts with a smile. \nCLAIRE Because he thinks she's seeing another man? \nJazy smiles slightly before confirming. \nJAZY ...and he assigned me to find out who the man is. \nThey all smile at this complication. Price is impressed. Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease. \nJAZY We all know the Revolutionaries are going to win, don't we? \nSilence. They don't know how to respond. \nTHEIR P.O.V. AS MISS PANAMA STRETCHES LIKE AN ENORMOUS CAT They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief. \nCLAIRE Fast. \nAgain their glibness is interrupted by what they came to see. Even as they joke, they watch the landscape with concern. \nREFUGEES ARE STREAMING OUT OF LEON, mostly women and children, some old men, carrying their possessions. Soldiers stand around. \nCLAIRE I'm basically a coward, Russell, I hope you understand that. I hope we don't get shot. \nPRICE Me too. \nCUT TO: \nA GUARDIA ROADBLOCK ON A HILL OVERLOOKING THE CITY \nThe press car pulls up to a stop. Price and Claire get out quickly, hand their credentials to a soldier, and open the trunk and the hood. As the car is searched they look down at the city. \nP.O.V. LEON AS A PLANE CIRCLES FIRING ROCKETS AND SMOKE RISES from several places in the town. The sound of gunfire. \nCLAIRE (to soldier in Spanish) I thought it was quiet here. \nSOLDIER (in Spanish) Quiet? Are you sure you want to go down there? Not me. \nThe soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the credentials. \nSOLDIER (in Spanish) You must leave the car here. \nPrice speaks in English knowing he can't be understood. \nPRICE (to soldier) You thinking of scoring a Toyota? \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) No problem -- we leave the car. \nPrice and Claire remove their things from the car, and Price takes the distributor cap as well as the keys. They walk over and look down the road leading into the city under seige. \nMORE REFUGEES EVACUATE THE TOWN -- it is a most uninviting sight. The plane passes over the town in the distance firing rockets. \nCLAIRE Now what? \nPrice responds by flashing his light meter in the air, taking a quick, nervous reading. \nPRICE C'mon. Be careful. \nCLAIRE Be careful?! Where the fuck we going? Better light? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET INTO LEON - DAY \nPRICE AND CLAIRE WALK SLOWLY INTO LEON \nLooking around warily as they go, they are the only people entering the town. Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing. \nCLAIRE ...June tenth... the evacuation of Leon... a woman carries a pig... signs for the F.S.L.N. are everywhere... a body... \nTHE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN lies ignored on the sidewalk. They continue walking and soon come to: \nAN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for. \nA YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away, holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops: \nTHE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him instantly. \nCLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch. \nPRICE RECORDS THE EVENT WITH HIS CAMERA \nTHE GUARDIA FOLLOW THE TANQUETTA SLOWLY down the street toward the Rebel youth's house. Suddenly the intersection is empty. \nPRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as: \nSEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price. \nTHE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price to record them. They pose instantly in \"tough-guy\" posture. \nPRICE TAKES THEIR PICTURE and just as quickly they dart away through a bombed out building. \nTHREE SANDINISTAS LEAP OFF A ROOFTOP and race toward Claire and Price who freeze: \nCLAIRE Russell?! \nFor a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists, pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment Price and Claire are alone on the street. \nTHE DOOR OPENS AGAIN SLOWLY and a middle-aged WOMAN appears, motioning for them to come inside. \nINT. PEDRO'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled disco, are pleading with a young man, PEDRO, 15. \nSANDINISTA #1 (in Spanish) You must come and help us... one more time. \nTHE OTHER TWO SANDINISTAS OPEN HEAVY FIRE and briefly draw heavier fire from the belltower, as: \nPEDRO PICKS UP A MUFFIN weighing it briefly in his hand, like a pitcher. He studies the surroundings -- runners on first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching hand) and rubs it in casually. \nPedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower window, exposing himself as he does. \nAN EXPLOSION IN THE TOWER \nPEDRO THROWS ANOTHER INTO THE TOWER -- another explosion. \nA GUARDIA SOLDIER STAGGERS INTO THE WINDOW and a Sandinista drops him with a shot. \nAll is quiet. \nTHE THREE SANDINISTAS CAREFULLY RUSH THE TOWER, looking in and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they do: \nANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT -- they whirl around -- Pedro and Price drop again. A lone Guardia soldier fires at them from the other tower. \nA THIRD SANDINISTA DROPS HIM WITH A VOLLEY OF FIRE Again all is quiet. \nPRICE FOLLOWS THE SANDINISTAS TO THE FIRST BELLTOWER and looks in. \nFIVE BODIES LIE SCATTERED AND BLOODIED One of the Guerrillas kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. In the corner, one body lies on top of another. Satisfied, the Sandinistas head for the other tower. \nPRICE STAYS BEHIND TO TAKE A FEW PICTURES and the ever-present light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the bodies. Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows. He looks out over the city. \nP.O.V. OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble. The town is littered with bodies. \nP.O.V. THE RED CROSS WAGON MOVING THROUGH THE STREET \nA man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically: \nRED CROSS MAN Hay heridas o muertes aqui? Hay heridas o muertes aqui? (Are there wounded or dead here?) \nWe see a woman drag a body out into the street. The Red Cross man makes small stacks of bodies. He douses the bodies with gasoline and sets the pile aflame. Then continues. \nRED CROSS MAN Hay heridas o muertes aqui? \nPrice watches. He thinks he hears something, then dismisses it. Something else. A voice, almost a whisper. \nVOICE Price. You motherfucker, Price, I'm talking to you. \nHe turns. One of the bodies speaks. \nVOICE Where are those bastards... are they away? \nPrice looks out -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. This war gets stranger. \nPRICE They're away. \nA body rolls out from under another body. Blood-splattered, smiling, wiping the blood from his face. It is Oates, the mercenary from Africa. He peeks out the window -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. He whispers. \nOATES What the fuck are you doing here? \nPRICE What the fuck are you doing here? \nFor a moment they understand that they are there for the same reason -- they make their livings off war. Oates peeks out the window nervously and repeatedly. \nOATES Awright, awright -- you're lookin' good... how ya like Nicaragua? \nOATES readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed -- routine. Price doesn't know how to answer. \nPRICE It's beautiful. \nOates laughs quickly and softly -- he is tuned into the strangeness of Price's answer. \nOATES Shitload o' greasers though, eh? \nP.O.V. THE SANDINISTAS HEADING BACK TOWARD US \nOATES AND PRICE SEE THEM, and Oates crawls back under the pile of bodies. \nTHE SANDINISTAS LOOK INTO THE BELLTOWER, all looks quiet, and they motion to Price. \nSANDINISTA #1 (in Spanish) It's getting late -- come on. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK \nThe Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the shadows of the main church entrance. The Sandinistas are carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza. It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out. For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas. They see each other and embrace briefly. \nCLAIRE You're okay? \nThe Sandinistas seem to relax. The Sandinistas take pride in Pedro and pat his left arm for Price and Claire. \nSANDINISTA #1 San-dee Koufax, no? \nSANDINISTA #2 Si, Koufax. \nCLAIRE Yes. \nSilence. They lie for a long time in the dark. A light in the house is turned off. Finally: \nPRICE Are you asleep? \nCLAIRE No. \nPrice gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her. They don't speak. They kiss. She unbuttons his shirt. He unbuttons her blouse. They undress just enough to begin making love softly, quietly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAWN \nThe first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso. \nPRICE'S LIGHT METER APPEARS AT HER BACK Price takes a reading, then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. He moves it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light, partially covered with a blanket. \nHe scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera. Price begins photographing her. \nHe moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the rest of her body. His actions are quiet and easy. He stops frequently to admire her. \nClaire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. Price moves around the room -- picture, picture, picture. \nCLAIRE WAKES UP SLOWLY and pulls the blanket back over her. She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several feet away with his camera. \nPRICE G'morning. \nCLAIRE What are you doing? \nPRICE You look beautiful. \nShe realizes what he's been doing. \nCLAIRE How long have you been doing this? \nPRICE 'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see the pictures -- you look great. \nHer sense of violation is balanced by this notion. For a moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. She chooses the latter. \nCLAIRE I'll bet I look great -- give me the film. \nPRICE After they're printed. \nCLAIRE I'll develop them myself -- give it to me or I'll start taping what you say in your sleep. \nPrice hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket with her. \nPRICE I talk in my sleep? \nCLAIRE Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible. \nThey curl up together, holding onto each other. A small child crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. A rooster crows. \nPRICE Call the office. I don't want to go to work today. \nThe peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close by. \nA HELICOPTER GUNSHIP PASSES OVER THE COURTYARD They look up, jolted out of the moment. The war is back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEON - MORNING \nPrice's rental car is a smoking wreck. He and Claire arrive and she removes a single, feeble white flag that remains. They study the car briefly and then turn as: \nA GUARDIA TROOP CARRIER LUMBERS past with a truckload of refugees behind. They wave the flag and catch a ride with the refugees. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FIFTH FLOOR OF INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - DAY \nAlex comes out a door chatting with somebody, and passes a mini-cam crew, old friends. \nALEX How was Matagalpa? \nMINI-CAM CREW #1 No bang-bang, Alex... none at all. \nALEX You find anything? \nMINI-CAM CREW #2 Half the press corps. \nA small laugh. They continue on. Alex enters Claire's room. \nINT. CLAIRE'S ROOM \nAlex enters. Nobody there. As he turns to leave he sees some pictures in a stack of papers on her desk. He picks one up. \nCLOSE UP: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It's all over and he knows it. He stares at, even admires, the image. He puts it down and turns to leave as: \nThe soldier stops at Tacho's name. Price turns. \nP.O.V. ALEX AND CLAIRE KISSING GOODBYE \nPRICE TURNS AGAIN, embarrassed, faces the soldier. \nPRICE Don't look, huh? (beat) No mire! \nThe soldier, confused, turns away, and as he does: \nALEX SLAPS PRICE ON THE SHOULDER, AND THEY TOO EMBRACE \nALEX Don't get hurt. \nPRICE Ahh, I'm a chicken, don't worry. (beat) Alex, listen to me... \nALEX Yeah? \nPRICE Within a year you're gonna be one of the \"Ten Most Admired Men in America.\" \nAlex is amused, Price is serious. The cabbie comes out and Alex heads into the airport. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOMOZA'S COMPOUND - A PRESS LUNCHEON - DAY \nDaisy and her combo from the Viking Club perform \"The Girl From Ipanema\" as ONE HUNDRED PRESS MEMBERS and V.I.P.'s sit at long tables in the garden. The pleasantness of the surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of SOLDIERS in the background, guarding the house, etc. Visible at the head table are: TWO GENERALS AND THEIR WIVES, MRS. SOMOZA, TWO WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN, MISS PANAMA IN A FLOPPY HAT. Elsewhere mingling are: JAZY, ISELA, PRICE, REGIS. An elaborate array of food sits on the table. \nINT. SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY \nOverlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza grants Claire her interview. He close the window to muffle the singing. \nCLAIRE You're late to your own luncheon, Mr. President -- we can schedule this for another time. \nSOMOZA Nonsense -- let them wait. We are a stunning couple, eh? My stomach is very flat -- I've been working out. \nCLAIRE We are a stunning couple. Mr. President, you own one fifth of all the land in Nicaragua, you own the shipping port, the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership... \nSOMOZA I am on a salt free diet... \nHe takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging on a wall -- his parents. \nCLAIRE Do you always hold hands with reporters? \nSOMOZA (ignores her) This is my mother and father. They were very special to me. Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave. I think people should know that. \nCLAIRE Would you care to comment on the fall of Leon to the rebels? \nSomoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows the game is undaunted. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE LUNCHEON TABLES - DAY \nHub Kittle is bending Price's ear in the crowd. Price seems ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food. \nHUB Listen, Russell, let's grow up. It's very easy to fall in love with the underdog, eh? But there's an upside and downside to this thing -- just wanta remind you... this stuff about a \"Revolution of Poets\" is crap. \nPRICE But it's great P.R. So what's the upside? \nHUB Simple. And it could happen. Somoza destroys the terrorist insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors of excess, stabilizes the cordoba, and is finally beloved as the savior of Nicaragua. (beat) Our pal. Got a smoke? \nPrice gives him a cigaret. \nPRICE What's the downside? \nHUB The Commies take over the world. \nIt's simple, and Hub is pleased with his presentation. A SOLDIER moves through the crowd looking quite out of place, finds Hub and hands him a note. Hub reads it, seems delighted, and excuses himself from the table. \nHUB Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war may be over. \nPrice and Regis look at each other strangely -- what's he talking about? They shrug, Regis bites into a papaya, and Hub hurries inside. Price and Regis watch the singer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECOND FLOOR OF SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY \nSOMOZA My people love me. My stomach is flat. Did I say that already? No matter. It is flat. \nCLAIRE There are reports that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe. \nSomoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding the room with the Tony Bennett classic. \nSOMOZA I like this song. \nCLAIRE Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built. It is said that the money has gone into your pocket. \nSOMOZA I love the press, I really do. Some of my best friends are journalists. \nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD IS TOTALLY SANDINISTA and several guerillas are at the door. The boy speaks to one of the guards, and they are admitted. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE HOUSE - DAY \nTHEY ARE SEARCHED IMMEDIATELY, asked to put down their gear, asked for credentials, and led down the hallway of a house that is very American middle class. \nANOTHER SOLDIER WITH RIFLE detains them momentarily before showing them into a room used as a Revolutionary Command office. \nISELA STANDS IN MILITARY FATIGUES talking to her Sandinista colleagues. Clearly she commands respect and makes decisions. She finishes and turns to Claire and Price in a very businesslike way, never acknowledging directly that they have met before. \nISELA You are looking for Rafael? \nThey are somewhat taken aback at her directness and information. \nPRICE Yeah. If it's possible. \nCLAIRE Do you know why we're here... exactly? \nISELA Mr. Price doesn't do anything before announcing it first in the bar. (beat) It's a good story. You'll be more famous. \nEXT. A MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATER - DAY \nAn old truck chugs up a series of cutbacks through rough terrain. The truck has no hood, and a BOY sits on the fender pouring oil from a series of Folgers cans into a funnel stuck permanently into the engine. Underneath, dangling cans catch the oil as it flows through. Price, Claire and FOUR ARMED SANDINISTAS sit in the back. ISELA rides in front. \nTHE TRUCK PASSES THROUGH A FRIENDLY GUERILLA ROADBLOCK \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOBACCO FIELDS IN REMOTE TERRAIN - DAY \nISELA, CLAIRE, PRICE AND THE FOUR HIKE into increasingly inaccessible terrain. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RAFAEL'S CAMP - DUSK \nHeavily guarded but very mobile, the camp consists of perhaps 100 Soldiers, women preparing food, several tents. Price and Claire attract attention as they enter. \nPRICE STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP CLOSELY seeming to take it all in. He's been in many similar camps, countries, wars. \nP.O.V. TWO SOLDIERS GUARDING THE ENTRANCE TO ONE TENT \nCLAIRE Rafael's tent? \nPrice doesn't answer but continues taking it all in, and ISELA shouts to them to continue. \nISELA Venga, companeros. (Come, comrades.) \nTHEY CONTINUE INTO THE CAMP, BUT PRICE STOPS AGAIN Something has caught him, his sixth sense, a feeling -- he refuses to walk further for the moment. No glibness, just coolness. \nCLAIRE What is it? \nPrice looks around, speaks quietly. \nPRICE Rafael is dead. \nClaire looks around quickly. There is no evidence to her. \nPRICE I can smell it. \nCLAIRE I don't know. \nISELA (slightly exasperated) Venga por favor! Alli! \nThey continue into the camp -- now Claire looks around nervously. Price mutters a half laugh, softly and strangely, as they are led to a makeshift table and offered food. In the b.g. Isela enters one of the tents. \nPRICE AND CLAIRE SIT DOWN TO EAT and Price continues scanning the camp as they talk. \nCLAIRE What're you talking about? \nPRICE He's dead. I know it. \nCLAIRE Then why did they bring us all the way here to see him? \nHe doesn't know. \nP.O.V. FOUR FIGURES/CONFERRING IN FRONT OF A TENT Isela emerges and joins them. The others are: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, A BUSINESSMAN WHOM WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE FROM EARLIER SCENES, AND COMMANDANTE CINCO, dressed in camouflaged khaki. \nISELA WALKS OVER TO CLAIRE AND PRICE after talking with the others. She brings COMMANDANTE CINCO with her. They sit down. \nISELA This is Commandante Cinco. \nThey all shake hands. \nIsela begins at once. \nISELA Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is about to fall, and Masaya. And next week we could be in Managua but it is still possible to lose. (beat) In the last days of our final offensive the people of Nicaragua must know that Rafael is alive and well. \nPRICE Don't think so much. \nHe gets on the cot with her. They kiss deeply, passionately, and begin making love. \nEXT. THE CAMP - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN \nTHE CAMP IS COMING TO LIFE as the flap opens on Price's tent and he looks out. He raises his camera and starts taking pictures of: \nA WOMAN COOKING OVER A FIRE AS A BUSINESSMAN LOOKS ON, a face we recognize from earlier in Managua -- FREEZE FRAME \nTHREE YOUNG GUERRILLAS PLAYING WITH A DOG -- FREEZE FRAME \nTHE PRIEST FROM LEON DRINKING FROM A GOURD -- FREEZE FRAME \nTWO CHILDREN PLAYING WITH HANDMADE TOYS -- FREEZE FRAME \nISELA COMING OUT OF ANOTHER TENT -- FREEZE FRAME \nPRICE RISES AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP, wandering over to a large can where he drinks some water. \nCLAIRE EMERGES FROM THE TENT and watches Price head over to a shaded area with his cameras. \nCLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE AS HE MOVES THROUGH A GROUP OF SANDINISTAS GATHERED AROUND A TABLE \nTheir backs are toward us as he adjusts seating positions and rearranges items that have been provided for the table. \nHe takes a light reading and moves quickly into position. Price raises his camera. \nCUT TO: \nPRICE'S P.O.V. OF A TABLEAU OF RAFAEL, CINCO, AND SOLDIERS They sit at a table studying a map, a copy of La Prensa is displayed -- the headlines declare that RAFAEL IS DEAD and featuring a photo of Somoza at the luncheon as he points to a map of the country. For an instant Rafael looks alive -- FREEZE FRAME. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE ROAD BLOCK TO MANAGUA - LATER \nPrice and Claire are sitting on top of a Red Cross truck as it heads through Sebaco. Soldiers from La Guardia are everywhere. As the truck moves through the village, something catches Price's eyes: \nOATES STANDS AGAINST A WALL IN COMMAND OF A SQUADRON Two whores and several troops sit against a wall. As the truck passes, Oates waves casually, with emotion. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM IN MANAGUA - DAY \nRed light in the bathroom as Price pulls several photo prints from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror. \nPHOTO OF RAFAEL IN THE CAMP, and he looks very much alive. He pulls more shots from the bath: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, THE BUSINESSMAN, COMMANDANTE CINCO AND ISELA. He dries them off and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment. \nHe picks up the shot of Rafael and leaves. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN MANAGUA \nA group of muchachos in masks, baseball caps, and bandanas race through the streets carrying a photo blow-up of Rafael. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAZY'S HOUSE \nThe newspaper headline sits on Jazy's desk as Jazy studies it unemotionally. We hear Miss Panama's voice: \nMISS PANAMA Marcel! \nHe spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress. She spins magically for him -- he blows her a kiss. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LUSH RIVER VALLEY OF NICARAGUA - DAY \nA small private plane flies through a canyon, dwarfed by the spectacular landscape. Hub Kittle works the room. \nINT. THE PLANE - DAY \nTwo MASKED GUERILLAS hold a gun to the head of a pilot. A large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them. \nEXT. A SMALL MOUNTAIN TOWN IN NICARAGUA - DAY \nThe plane flies in low over the town and suddenly: \nTHE SKY IS FILLED WITH LEAFLETS that flutter to the ground. Townspeople, bewildered at first, pick up the papers to see: \nCLOSE UP -- PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF RAFAEL ALIVE \nLOCAL RESIDENTS RAISE THEIR FISTS IN SALUTE to the plane as it disappears into the mountains. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE ROOFTOP GARDEN OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL - DAY \nPRICE We don't owe him anything! \nCLAIRE We owe him that! (beat) He got you started in this business... he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures... (beat) Before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like Price! (beat) He took care of you before you were hot! \nSilence. She's hitting home but he doesn't want to acknowledge it. \nPRICE He wouldn't understand. \nCLAIRE Before Nicaragua you wouldn't understand. I'm not sure I exactly understand. (beat) What are we going to do? \nThere is something calculating in Price's tone, this is not the fearless, boyish innocent anymore. \nPRICE I'll take Alex to find Rafael -- we'll go to Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily control the area and they're scared right now -- they'll never let us through. We won't be able to get near Rafael. Alex will understand -- and we'll turn around and drive back without a story. \nClaire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie. \nCLAIRE That's a lie! \nPRICE Tell me about lies! \nSilence. They are co-conspirators and they know it. \nCLAIRE I don't want to tell him either. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD TO MATAGALPA - NEXT DAY \nPrice's white flagged newly rented press car streaks along, overtaking an ox cart. A guardia convoy is going the opposite direction, back toward Managua. Alex looks out of the car with interest--he hasn't been to the front line for several wars. \nPRICE We may not be able to find him, y'know... \nALEX I've got supreme confidence in you. \nA car is on fire by the side of the road. Price flies past; Alex watches curiously. Several people stand around the car. \nALEX Claire looks good, eh? \nPRICE Everybody looks good in the tropics. \nAlex isn't sure how to respond to this curious reply. \nALEX Since I haven't been able to find Isela since coming back, you're going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean? \nPrice is nervous, wired, on edge. \nPRICE Alex... I love her. \nAlex takes this calmly -- it's not exactly new information. \nALEX And she 'thinks' she loves you. \nPRICE It's past the thinking stage. \nAlex looks at the passing scenery -- he's in no hurry. \nALEX I'd like to know something -- it probably doesn't matter in the great final scheme of things... but I'm interested... (beat) Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me? \nPRICE No! \nALEX That's the truth? \nPRICE Yes! (beat) Alex -- we're friends! \nThere is something desperate in his voice. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A ROADBLOCK ON THE EDGE OF SEBACO - DAY \nPrice and Alex are ordered out of their car by a very unfriendly Guardia soldier. He is ordered to put down his camera bag. The hood and trunk are opened. \nSOLDIER Venga. \nThey are led to a shed by the roadside, A TIRE REPAIR SHOP, where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. They watch the soldiers: \nP.O.V. THE SOLDIERS TEARING UP THE RENTAL CAR, pulling off door panels, looking for weapons. \nALEX I bet you go through a few rental cars. \nPRICE Don't worry. I put this in your name. \nPRICE AND ALEX JERK TO LIFE at the sound of screaming in the distance. A volley of gunfire follows. Price moves quickly into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall: \nP.O.V. AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN A FIELD as several bodies are being hauled away. Two soldiers reload their guns. PAN to a figure moving behind a wall -- OATES. \nPRICE HURRIES THROUGH THE SHACKS TOWARD THE EXECUTION WALL as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single- minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see: \nTWO TRUCKS BEING LOADED WITH BODIES AS OATES SUPERVISES. PRICE STEPS INTO THE CLEARING -- FACE-TO-FACE WITH OATES. \nALEX Didn't you ship the film to New York? \nPRICE I developed it in my room. (pleads) Jesus Christ, Alex?! \nSilence. The car races. \nALEX Slow down. (compassionately) It wasn't your fault if somebody stole your stuff... \nPRICE It was. \nAlex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it entirely. \nALEX What about Rafael? \nNo answer -- the car races back to Managua. Alex stares at Price trying to figure out what is wrong. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRICE'S ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER \nA MAID IS CLEANING HIS ROOM which is the usual disaster. Price enters, just returned, and quickly looks for his negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them. \nPRICE Algo no esta aqui. Fotografias. (Something is not here. Photographs.) \nMAID (in Spanish) Everything's always a mess here. You should be neater. \nPRICE Negativos, negativos! \nThe maid shrugs -- Price is crazy anyway, and: \nCLAIRE WALKS INTO THE ROOM She too looks shaken. He looks up. \nCLAIRE Commandante Cinco's body was just found on the road to Matagalpa. \nThe maid starts crying. They look at her helplessly as she sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco...' \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY \nA cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. La Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more hurried. A hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap. They get out and knock on Jazy's door. \nGUARDIA SOLDIERS WATCH THEM FROM A DISTANCE, a development that Price and Claire are aware of. \nCLAIRE I don't think it's Jazy. \nStill no answer. \nPRICE Oates said it was a Frog. How many Frenchmen you know around here? Jazy ain't 'facilitating' shit. \nPrice is impatient. He looks around nervously -- the Guards are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch, jimmying the lock. The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes off. \nPrice and Claire duck inside quickly. \nCLAIRE Christ! \nPrice, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb. \nLA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward Jazy's. \nINSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops. \nImmediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards. She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces them. \nCLAIRE Are we looking for negs or prints? \nPRICE Anything. \nThey find nothing downstairs. The look up at the sound of distant gunfire. \nSuddenly: Loud banging at the front door -- La Guardia. \nEXT. TWO GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND A THIRD ARRIVING - DAY \nThey look around warily, hungrily -- they know something is wrong. \nBACK INSIDE THE HOUSE we hear the shouting soldiers, banging. Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag. Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself. Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs. Claire goes to the front door, shaking nervously. \nCLAIRE OPENS THE DOOR AND FACES THE SOLDIERS \nCLAIRE Que quiere? (What do you want?) \nSOLDIER Donde esta senor Jazy? \nCLAIRE No esta aqui. \nSOLDIER Que quienes? (Who are you?) \nCLAIRE (smiles) Una novia suya. (A girlfriend of his.) \nPRICE Alex... I think I finally saw one too many bodies. (beat) Somoza is a killer. (beat) I thought the war would end sooner. (beat) How many reasons do you want? \nALEX You saw too many bodies? That's a lot of bodies. (beat; to Price) You stupid son of a bitch. (to Claire) Did he talk you into it? \nCLAIRE No! I wanted Rafael to be alive. \nALEX In some way I understand him doing it, I don't like it but I understand... but you? \nCLAIRE I'd do it again. \nAlex lets it all sink in. These two people about whom he has such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to him. \nALEX You two have, of course, just served me up your balls -- if that's what they're called -- on a platter. (several beats) I can bury you both. You're handing me your careers. \nThey don't respond -- he's right. \nALEX Well, Jesus Christ... this is a motherfucking story, Russell... (long silence) What am I supposed to do with it? \nCLAIRE Anything you want. \nSmall, tired gallows laughter from Alex. There is a long silence before Alex speaks, aware of the irony. \nALEX They're holding the lead in the World section for Rafael. \nPRICE It's great stuff, isn't it? We'd go down in a blaze of glory. \nALEX Oh yeah... (distraught) I don't know what to do. (beat) I've gotta take some kind of a story back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh? \nCLAIRE Oh Jesus. \nPRICE It's a little dangerous looking for Jazy at the moment. \nALEX (mock heroic) Ah, danger -- I love it. You could ask the pointy-shoed little bastard about your pictures... and I could ask him whatever happened to Isela. \nCLAIRE She's an officer in the Rafael army -- we saw her in Matagalpa. \nAlex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing it. \nALEX You mean I slept with a Sandinista? \nPrice and Claire exchange glances. Alex is dead serious. \nALEX I guess Rafael is alive, eh? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nPRICE AND CLAIRE LIE IN BED sweating. A siren and distant mortar can be heard outside. Price goes to the window and shuts it -- the room is quieter and hotter. He pounds a broken air conditioning duct. \nPRICE Damn air conditioning. \nHe looks out the window -- it never used to be this complicated. \nCLAIRE I wish I was home. \nSilence. \nPRICE C'mere. \nShe goes to him, lies down, and they embrace. \nCLAIRE Do you think it's almost over? \nA loud, long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard somewhere outside. Their eyes are open as they hold onto each other. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - NEXT MORNING \nA sense of foreboding. Heavy road equipment prowls the street looking for Rebel barricades to destroy. Tanquettas and Guardia everywhere. \nThe flag draped press car of Price and Alex drives slowly. \nP.O.V. OUT OF THE CAR AS THEY LOOK CAREFULLY Things feel wrong. Guardia barricades are everywhere, forcing them to follow a route they might not choose. The Guardia soldiers at the barricades seem on edge. When Jazy's house is visible in the distance, barricades force them another direction. \nGUARDIA SOLDIERS RACE DOWN A STREET TOWARD GUNFIRE and the car stops. When the road is clear it creeps into an intersection. They check their position. \nTHE CAR CREEPS TO A STOP and they look around further. \nA PIG CROSSES THE STREET 100 YARDS AWAY AND IS SHOT BY A SOLDIER. \nEverything is wrong. Price looks around restlessly. \nPRICE Alex... let's go back. \nALEX Jazy's probably sitting in the bar laughing at us. Which way's the hotel? \nPRICE I don't know. \nJournalists are everywhere -- suitcases packed -- trying to get out of the country. The registration desk is chaos. Regis tries to get the attention of the clerk -- so does everyone else. \nREGIS Get my bill and get me a cab, hey, amigo! \nThe clerk is under attack. \nCLERK No cabs. \nREGIS Cabs! \nCLERK No cabs! \nCLAIRE GETS OFF THE ELEVATOR AND MOVES THROUGH THIS CHAOS Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort -- she's beyond that. She wears a jacket and carries her bag -- she's going somewhere. \nREGIS I'm sorry, Claire... \nShe pushes him away politely; she is single-minded now. \nCLAIRE Heard from Russell? \nREGIS Nobody has. \nCLAIRE Wanta help me find him? \nRegis looks at her like she's crazy. \nREGIS Claire... it's on the weird side out there... \nHub Kittle enters the lobby, sees Claire and volunteers: \nHUB Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy, what can I say? \nClaire is nearly in tears, but resists. \nCLAIRE Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way. \nCLAIRE EXITS THE HOTEL AND GETS INTO HER PRESS CAR \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - LONG SHOT OF JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY \nClaire stays in her car and watches the house -- no way to get close -- and she continues driving, her route dictated by the same barricades that directed Alex and Price. \nShe passes the dead pig in the street, and TWO RED CROSS WORKERS make their way slowly around a corner, frightened. Claire gets out of her car and approaches them. \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) Do you know where the American journalist was killed? \nThey all point down a street. She shows them the polaroid of Price and her. \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) Have you seen him? \nThey haven't and continue on their way. Claire walks in the direction they pointed -- no street fighting but many Guardia. \nP.O.V. PRICE'S CAR FAR DOWN THE STREET SURROUNDED BY GUARDIA \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHANTYTOWN - DAY \nPRICE HUNCHES DOWN AND CRAWLS BEHIND THE STALLS as soldiers move through the yards looking for him. \nA WOMAN IN A DOORWAY WATCHES PRICE HIDE \nTHE WOMAN APPEARS IN A DOORWAY AND MOTIONS WITH HER HEAD for Price to dart inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE HOUSE - DAY \nNothing is said. Price is led into a room, one of many -- but this room is boarded over. There is no escape. Price is in pain, his arm bleeds, he's tiring. \nWOMAN (in Spanish) This is the best I can offer. \nPRICE Gracias. \nPRICE STANDS IN THE TINY ROOM WAITING \nHe leans against the wall behind the door. He shuts his eyes -- a noise at the door. When he opens them: \nTHE WOMAN IS STANDING THERE WITH A GUN \nShe hands it to him and leaves, bolting the door. \nPRICE LEANS AGAINST THE WALL HOLDING A REVOLVER and he waits -- cameras around his neck, gun in hand, bloody, slightly ridiculous, and scared. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY \nCLAIRE SHOWS A PICTURE OF PRICE AND HER to a woman who comes out of the house next to Jazy's, but the woman shakes her head, not recognizing Price. \nA PUSH-PULL PLANE DIVES IN LOW FIRING ROCKETS at the homes. \nTHE CROWD GROWS and chaotically flees the destruction, gradually finding a direction out of the city. Claire is swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then finally fleeing for her life with the rest of Managua. As she moves with the crowd, she looks for Price everywhere, without success. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A TEMPORARY REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT \nSEVERAL CAMPFIRES burn near the edge of the city where dozens have taken temporary refuge. Claire arrives to see: A BODY ON A STRETCHER BEING CARRIED up outside stairs to a rooftop from which glow several bare bulbs. She goes up the stairs to the rooftop. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A ROOFTOP HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nA MAKESHIFT MOBILE HOSPITAL under awnings and palm fronds, capable of moving location in minutes. A WOMAN DOCTOR and two temporary orderlies tend to wounded. A small black and white television sits on a table and those who are able watch the seige of Managua on television while it goes on around them. Claire looks for Price among the dead or wounded. \nP.O.V. -- THE CITY UNDER ATTACK \nClaire watches for several moments -- smoke, flame, the buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds. She then notices the television. \nPRICE'S FOOTAGE OF ALEX'S DEATH comes on the TV screen, and she pushes closer to see the grim sequence. The NEWS COMMENTATOR explains in Spanish what we see CLAIRE IS SO DISTURBED AT THE IMAGES that she turns away, sickened, hurt, guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. She closes her eyes -- her face is covered with tears. The Doctor notices this and speaks softly to her. \nDOCTOR Journalist? (Claire nods) You knew the man who was killed? (she nods again) Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died... and now one Yankee. (beat) Perhaps now Americans will be outraged at what is happening here, eh? \nIt takes a while for Claire to respond. \nCLAIRE Yes... perhaps they will. \nNoise in the distance from mortars. The Doctor speaks calmly, without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction. \nDOCTOR Maybe we should have killed an American journalist fifty years ago. \nClaire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a slight nod, and walks to the railing as: \nALEX'S DEATH IS REPEATED IN FREEZE FRAME SEQUENCE over and over again as the Orderlies, Doctor, and patients gather to watch with fascination. \nCLAIRE STARES OUT AT THE CITY ON FIRE, when her eye catches something -- a light in the sky. She watches: \nP.O.V. -- A HELICOPTER WITH SEARCHLIGHT PASSES OVERHEAD, momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on, curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity. The chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to earth. \nCLAIRE WATCHES with interest then descends the stairs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CEMETERY - NIGHT \nSOMOZA WATCHES AS A BACK HOE DIGS UP THE COFFINS of his parents. An Army helicopter lands, lighting the scene, and Miss Panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his hair. Soldiers place the dirt-covered caskets on the roofs of Somoza's two Mercedes, hastily tie them down, and the strange motorcade, flanked by two heavily armed jeeps, drives off into the dark. \nCLAIRE WATCHES IT ALL from a safe distance, not far from the refugee camp. She turns and walks slowly back to the camp. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - LATE AT NIGHT \nClaire sits down against the remains of a wall. The war has overtaken her -- she doesn't know if Price is alive -- and though totally involved, she is at last an observer once again. Claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is still on. She turns it off, and as the sounds of battle gradually die down, Claire falls asleep -- exhausted. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - DAWN \nCLAIRE SLEEPS AGAINST THE WALL as a dog sniffs and licks her face. She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away. Claire rises and looks around. \nA LOCAL WOMAN PUSHES A CART carrying the wrapped body of her husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua. \nCLAIRE MOVES THROUGH THE CAMP just coming to life, and looks around trying to interpret the eerie silence. A WOMAN tends to her TWO SMALL CHILDREN. \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) Have you seen La Guardia? \nWOMAN WITH CHILDREN (in Spanish) No. Is the war over? \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) I don't know. \nA DISTANT, DRONING NOISE GETS STEADILY LOUDER. Claire looks around nervously. \nA CHILD RUNS DOWN THE STREET SHOUTING \nCHILD Tanquettas! Tanquettas! \nP.O.V. -- SEVERAL TANQUETTAS AND EARTH MOVERS coming over the hill in the distance. The Refugees look up fearfully and some hide. As the war machinery gets closer, we see that: \nSANDINISTAS ARE DRIVING THE MACHINES draped with red and black (F.S.L.N.), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow and white (the Vatican) flags. Graffiti of victory covers the tanquettas. \nPEOPLE COME INTO THE STREET CHEERING, embracing, only gradually realizing what has happened. \nWOMAN WITH CHILDREN (in Spanish) Is the war over? \nCLAIRE Yes. \n", "test1_input": "Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble. They look around at the devastation. \nOATES Well, I guess we know where the Guvmint is. \nPRICE (cynically) You can walk to work from here. \nOATES Convenient, ain't it? \nOates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly, as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist. \nOATES My brother just got married. \nPRICE I don't know your brother. \nSuddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren goes off. \nA JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER \nJET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it drops something else: \nTHE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield. \nOut of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper. \nPrice grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is: \nA PICTURE OF A SWIMMING POOL IN FRONT OF A CALIFORNIA HOUSE \nHE STARES AT THE IMAGE and turns it over. There is writing on the backside in Spanish and Russian. He looks around. \nOATES WANDERS OVER with a handful of the leaflets. \nPRICE What's this? \nOATES Great shit, eh? \nPrice tries to read the writing on the back as Oates looks at a leaflet familiarly. \nOATES U.S. Gummint offers this house to any Cuban pilot flying Migs for the Rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet. We know they ain't gonna run off with no planes -- but the Rebs don't -- They're scared. They start thinking about that swimming pool. Damn near smell that chlorine. Starts workin' on 'em, and pretty soon they don't let the Cubies near a Mig. Use their own spook pilots and destroy their own air force in a week. Guaran-fuckin- teed. \nPRICE C.I.A.? \nOATES (proudly) Smartest guys in the world. (afterthought) Hey, you gotta scoop here, eh? You'll be famous. \nOATES shakes hands with Price who looks at the picture. \nPRICE (dispassionately) Maybe. \nOATES (looking around) I gotta run... have a good one. \nOates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing down out of the sky; Price looks up and speaks to himself. \nPRICE I love Africa. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOMS AT THE NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL - NIGHT \nCLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser. \nALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes, pictures. \nTheir love affairs of three years is ending. \nCLAIRE (on the phone) \"...and so this strange war that features two provincial governments, three rival liberation fronts, and at least twenty-five tribal associations, grinds into its seventh year...\" \nAlex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and tries to court her with \"Caravan\" as she files her story. Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond. \nCLAIRE \"...The Battle for the Airfield at Abou Deia is just another chapter in this endless story. From Ndjamena, Chad, this is Claire Stryder.\" (beat) No -- you didn't hear any music -- must be the connection. Okay? So long. \nShe hangs up and rises more irritated than angered. \nCLAIRE Alex, don't play that God damn thing when I'm filing. (beat) We're late. \nQuickly expressed, her anger passes. \nALEX It's my party -- we'll be late. You called it a \"strange war\" and an \"endless story.\" If you filed that story for me, I'd say you were editorialishing. \nCLAIRE I like to editorialize. You drunk? \nAlex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with her. \nALEX Drunk? Only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of Fianga as the first Army of Liberation marched in and opened fire. \nCLAIRE And freed the Proletariat. \nAlex raises a drink. \nALEX Right. \n", "test1_true": "She leaves -- he quickly puts on his coat and follows her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN - NIGHT \nALEX Christ, I don't want to go to this stupid party. I'm bad at false modesty. \nCLAIRE You're great at it. \nShe straightens his half-tied tie in an act of familiar affection rather than motherliness. Nervousness. She speaks calmly -- this is ground they have already covered. \nCLAIRE Alex, you're going to make a great anchorman in New York and undoubtedly I could be a Pulitzer Prize winning hostess -- but I'm not going with you. \nALEX You can work out of the East Coast. We'll get a place on Long Island and burn our suitcases. \nCLAIRE I still like suitcases. \nALEX Every Saturday night we'll have a party... invite all our friends, sit out on the veranda and interview each other. \nCLAIRE I've done all that. \nALEX I haven't. (beat; changes tack) Well, God dammit, I'm getting tired of memorizing who's the president of the... Republic of Maldives. \nCLAIRE Mamoon Abdul Gayoom. \nALEX Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul Gayeem. \nThey both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop. The door doesn't open, and the light flickers. \nALEX And I'm tired of Third World elevators. \nHe bangs the door with his fist. It opens, and they enter a dismal hallway. The sounds of a party come from beyond. \nALEX Don't leave me. \nCLAIRE I already have. \nAs they approach the door to the party, he speaks with new toughness. \nALEX Fuck Abou Deia and New York. I'm going to Nicaragua with you. \nCLAIRE No. \nALEX I've heard it's a neat little war with a nice hotel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE ROOM WITH THE PARTY - NIGHT \nA cheer goes up for Alex as he and Claire enter. Party hats, booze, hand-made signs reading \"Bon Voyage,\" etc. Fifteen journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater war. \nThough both upset, they act as if everything is normal. \nPRICE STANDS ON A CHAIR AT THE CENTER summoning Alex who moves through the group with ease, instantly at home. Price holds up a bottle of champagne in toast. \nPRICE Alex, get up here! \nAlex climbs on a chair next to Price who puts his arm around him. \nPRICE To the man who gave me my first job, and fired me from my first job... and gave me my second job... \nVOICE FROM CROWD And fired you from your second job... \nPRICE Just a few words, Alex. \nVOICES FROM CROWD Impossible! Can't be done! etc. \nHowever miserable, Alex shines in these situations. He raises his hand -- silence. \nALEX You may be asking yourself what exactly are you doing here in this \"strange war, just another chapter in an endless story... that grinds into its seventh year...\" \nClaire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink, watching Alex and shaking her head with some affection. \nJIMMY, THE CAB DRIVER, ENTERS WITH A CAKE covered with candles. The crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country of Chad. The crowd begins singing \"Caravan\" in a half-drunken tribute to a man they like and respect. \nPRICE MOVES AROUND THE ROOM TAKING PICTURES of the party; it is all casual, silly, fun. \nTHROUGH CAMERA P.O.V.'S OF ALEX IN A PARTY HAT, whip pan to CABBY WITH THE CAKE, whip pan to DRUNKEN JOURNALISTS. \nTHROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF CLAIRE -- FREEZE FRAME, pan follows her as she moves through the room -- FREEZE FRAME, she picks up another drink and leaves through a side door -- FREEZE FRAME. \nALEX GIVES IN AND JOINS THE SINGING, enjoying his own tribute once he has managed to give in to it. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

A part of her life is ending -- life with Alex -- but it's not ending neatly. \n", "test1_id": 2994, "test2_input": "JAZY What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a victory very badly... he needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning. He thinks Rafael's death is the proof he needs. \nPRICE Carter don't need proof. He just sent twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho. (to posers) I'm sorry... almost got it here. \nJAZY No, no... the arms shipment has been delayed in New Orleans because Jimmy is getting nervous. \nPRICE The State Department's gonna pull the plug on Tacho?! Pardon my French -- but whose fucking side are you on? \nJazy and Price motion for the posers to move a step over. \nJAZY ...I work for everybody. If there is a transition of power, I facilitate a relationship with the new people. If there is not, I facilitate the status quo. (beat) Either way, I facilitate. \nPRICE Great job. \nJAZY I send messages to Jimmy and I tell him that the Revolution is a flood that cannot be stopped but it can be controlled... nobody listens... I can't even get a little water in my pool. \nPRICE Rough ain't it. Thank you everybody, very nice. \nPrice smiles to Somoza, Mrs. Somoza, and Miss Panama. Somoza hurries off from his uncomfortable position at last. \nPRICE I don't think Rafael is dead. I'm gonna find him. \nJAZY They say he's very handsome.

Inside the car are the British crew -- Regis drives -- and Price and Claire. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MATAGALPA - DAY \nA city of about 50,000 located on the side of a hill. The car pulls slowly into the base of the town into a clearing with assorted vehicles -- Red Cross, La Guardia, Press. The car moves slowly as its occupants survey the town, until it pulls alongside a Red Cross truck that has broken down. Price sticks his head out the window to ask instructions of a R.C. WORKER. \nPRICE Con permiso -- who controls what today? \nRED CROSS WORKER (in Spanish) The Sandinistas hold the hills, the Guardia has everything else. \nCLAIRE How do we find the guerillas? \nRED CROSS WORKER (points) Va alli, dos o tres cuartos, doble la esquina al francotirador. \nREGIS What'd he say? \nCLAIRE Go two or three blocks and turn right at the sniper. \nRegis and his crew don't like this at all. Price points. \nP.O.V. A TOWER FULL OF GUARDIA SNIPERS \nPRICE You can drop us off. \nMAIN ROAD INTO MATAGALPA \nA gradual uphill grade -- the press car moves slowly. Guardia are on both sides of the street, as the car stops at the corner, directly beneath the sniper tower. They all look up. \nP.O.V. THE SNIPERS LOOKING BACK DOWN AT THEM \nTHE CAR SLOWLY TURNS LEFT \nPRICE Wrong way! \nREGIS We're not looking for the guerillas. \nCLAIRE Then let us out. \nThe car stops, the door opens, and: \nA WALL NEARBY IS RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES AS THEY CLIMB OUT, so they climb back in quickly. \nP.O.V. A SOLDIER HOLDS OUT HIS ARMS AS IF TO SAY, \"accident.\" \nSOLDIER Lo siento! (I'm sorry!) \nThe soldier seems sincere, but they don't want to take a chance. \nPRICE Go one more block. \nTHE CAR MOVES DEEPER INTO MATAGALPA, gradually moving among tanquettas patrolling the streets, coming to a barricade which they manuever past as Guardia soldiers look at them strangely. The car turns around -- it has come too far. \nA GUARDIA OFFICER SIGNALS FOR THEM TO GET OUT but the idea doesn't appeal to Regis and he whirls around, panicking slightly, and heads off in the other direction. \nCLAIRE He just wanted to see credentials, for crissakes, what're doing? \nREGIS You want to drive? \n", "test2_true": "THE BARRICADE OFFICER SPEAKS IN A WALKIE TALKIE to a squadron leader a couple of blocks away as the car approaches. \nTHE SECOND OFFICER WHISTLES FOR THE CAR TO STOP but it speeds up. \nTHE OFFICER FIRES A PISTOL SHOT AT THE CAR SHATTERING THE WINDSHIELD \nINSIDE THE CAR -- VISION IS BADLY IMPAIRED BY THE SHATTERED GLASS and Regis panics, hitting the floorboard and the car suddenly screeches around a corner, racing through Matagalpa. The car squeals around corner after corner blindly, into: \nA GUARDIA BARRICADE AS A FUSILADE OF SMALL ARMS FIRE RINGS OUT The windshield is totally destroyed now, and: \nTHE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR CROUCH LOW as the car races. Price and Claire scream at Regis to stop, but it's too late. \nTHE CAR SCREECHES INTO REVERSE as Regis tries to see out the back window and Price, out of necessity operates the foot pedal with his hand. The car smokes into an intersection and sees: \nAN OPEN BLOCK AHEAD -- no Guardia are visible, so the car races down the open block and as it comes to an intersection: \nA SHERMAN TANK COMES AROUND THE CORNER FACING US \nSeveral times larger than a tanquetta -- it dwarfs us and everything around it. Its giant gun faces us head on. \nTHE PRESS CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT, and everyone scrambles out. \nPRICE Periodista, periodista, periodista! \nThe mini-cam equipment is dropped as the British crew scrambles to safety against a building. Price and Claire end up on opposite sides of the street. \nSilence -- the huge and silent tank is deciding what to do. \nTHE TURRET SWINGS SEVERAL DEGREES TO ONE SIDE and lowers as the scattered journalists freeze. \nA THUNDEROUS ROAR -- THE TANK DESTROYS THE CAMERA EQUIPMENT leaving a huge crater and not a trace of the expensive qear. \nCLAIRE STARTS LAUGHING, FRIGHTENED, nervous and amused. \nPRICE TAKES PICTURES \nA WOMAN THROWS A CONTACT BOMB FROM A WINDOW AT THE TANK The tiny bomb makes a pitiful explosion, hopelessly ineffective. \nTHE TANK SWINGS ITS TURRET TOWARD THE HOUSE AND OPENS FIRE and the wall of the house crumbles quickly as a family scrambles to the rooftop of a neighboring house. Their house is destroyed in a second. \nLA GUARDIA TROOPS APPEAR AND BEGIN FIRING TOWARDS Claire and Price, who turn to see: \nSANDINISTA ARMY REGULARS RUNNING DOWN THE HILL alongside the homemade local guerillas. This is the first time we've seen the F.S.L.N. regular army in their camouflaged khaki dress. \nTHE GUARD TAKES A POSITION TO FIGHT IT OUT and Claire and Price are caught in a cross-fire, pinned to walls on each street side. \nPRICE PUSHES THROUGH A DOOR TO SAFETY and looks back: \nCLAIRE IS TRAPPED OUTSIDE pounding on a door that doesn't open. She tries another -- no luck. She curls up in a doorway making herself as small as possible as bullets rip the wall around her. \nAT THE TOP OF THE HILL, AN OLD BUS MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE STREET \nSeveral youthful guerillas are pushing it. \nTHE BUS COMES FLYING DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE TANK Several hundred feet away, it gathers speed toward us. \nINT. THE SPEEDING BUS \nA YOUTH at the wheel props a board under the steering wheel and races to the back as ANOTHER YOUTH opens the door as the bus races past Claire toward the tank. \nTHE TWO YOUTHS LEAP OUT THE BACK DOOR where they tumble into the dirt just before: \nTHE BUS SMASHES INTO THE TANK AND EXPLODES \nGUARDIA SOLDIERS SHOOT THE TWO YOUTHS before they get away, as: \nGUERILLAS APPEAR ON EVERY ROOFTOP opening heavy fire on La Guardia. \nGUARDIA TROOPS RETREAT QUICKLY ON FOOT AND IN TANQUETTAS \nTHE SHERMAN TANK TRIES TO DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE BUS but cannot, and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill. \nPRICE RUNS OUT TO CLAIRE and huddles with her. She is shaken but unhurt. \nSANDINISTAS ARE EVERYWHERE, moving into Matagalpa as Price and Claire move past several bodies to higher ground. \nSANDINISTA BARRICADES ARE ON EVERY CORNER where women serve food to their men. Claire and Price wander through, momentarily disoriented. A small boy runs through the street kicking a soccer ball, occasionally avoiding a body. He runs right up to them and speaks. \nBOY Busca triquitraques? \nCLAIRE Si. \nBOY Venga. \nThey follow him up a hill. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

JAZY'S COURTYARD - LATE IN DAY \nJAZY STANDS WITH A THIRD GUN AT HIS HEAD, being held by the most forceful and crazed of three young Muchachos. With guns on Jazy, Price, and Claire, there is much confusion as to who's in charge and what exactly they're doing. \nMUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Who are you? \nJAZY They are my friends. \nMUCHACHO #2 (in Spanish) Shut up. We kill them all. \nMUCHACHO #3 (in Spanish) No. Only him. \nThe guns are aimed back and forth in confusion -- Price and Claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure what to say. \nMUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Him or him or her? \nThe Muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as they do, Jazy addresses Price and Claire coolly. \nJAZY Well, here we are, eh? \nMUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Assassin! Shut up! \nJAZY The boys are confused -- they think I had their family killed. \nPRICE You murder people. \nJAZY \"Murder\" is a word for criminals. I have a job to protect the stability of a continent. \nMUCHACHO #3 Pig! Hijo de puta! \nJAZY Please... \nHe is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm down. \nCLAIRE You got caught by some boys? \nJAZY Yes. Poets too, I imagine. (beat) Is your recorder on? \nCLAIRE (hesitates) Yes. \nJAZY Good. I have a speech to make. \nThe Muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they stop to listen to his style. The guns remained trained on all three. \nJAZY I like you people, but you are sentimental shits. You fall in love with the poets, the poets fall in love with the Marxists, the Marxists fall in love with themselves. The country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants. \nMUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Shut up! \nJazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and speaks with tired authority. \nJAZY Un minuto, por favor. \nMUCHACHO #2 (to Price and Claire, more calmly) Who are you? \nJAZY (in Spanish) They are journalists. \nThe Muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and one of them speaks in excited, broken English. \nMUCHACHO #1 Periodistas! Take this picture! I'm going to blow his head off. \nThe Muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from Price and Claire and aim them all at Jazy's head. \nJAZY Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course. A butcher. (beat) But finally that is not the point, you see. If we wish to survive -- we have a choice of tyrants, and for all the right reasons, your poets choose the wrong side. \nMUCHACHO #1 (impatiently) Fotografia! \nPRICE No. \nJAZY Yes. (beat) Your picture of Rafael was brilliant... but I am alive, and better looking. A good looking Frenchman with a sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of Europe and America. (beat) You will have another magazine cover! (smiles) Muy complicado, no? \nMUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Ready! Now! \nCLAIRE You picked the wrong side. \nJAZY In fifty years we will know who's right. (beat) Are you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it comes out? This wall's a nice color, eh? I can move into the sunlight. \nCLAIRE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY, her back to the scene. \nJAZY (to Claire) It's just a story! \nPRICE REMAINS AND STARES AT JAZY as the Muchachos grow increasingly impatient.

(he nods) Russell... what did Alex do? \nPRICE Nothing. He asked for directions. \nShe shakes her head and leans it against Price's shoulder but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a moment of mourning. Their heads pop up nervously. \nPRICE We gotta get outta sight -- half the fucking army's looking for me... \nCLAIRE They're not looking for me. \nSilence. \nCLAIRE Let me have the film... (beat; unsure) ...if I can't get to the hotel I'll come back here... \nPrice doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited about hiding out in the middle of the city either. \nPRICE Aw, Christ... (frustrated) I've wrecked everything else, at least let me take care of you here. \nCLAIRE Russell... it's more dangerous being with you than being alone. \nHe knows she's right. He loves her, and he's made enough disastrous decisions lately. He hesitates, then pops open his camera and removes the film. Price ties the film into the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt. \nPRICE AND CLAIRE EMBRACE AND KISS BRIEFLY \nPRICE Don't get hurt. \nCLAIRE (affectionately) That's great advice. \nThey kiss, and Claire runs out after a Red Cross truck. Price watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight, then goes back inside Jazy's courtyard. PRICE NEARLY STUMBLES OVER JAZY'S BODY, stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already. The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds a sheet and covers Jazy. Price then sits down and waits nervously, sharing the courtyard with Jazy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

{"test1_input": "CUT TO: \nEXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT \nPrice bounces along, whistling, \"San Francisco.\" An occasional Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past. He strolls up the walkway of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow. \nINT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT \nBlue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief negotiation of the black market value. \nPRICE (in broken Spanish) Cuanto? \nOLD WOMAN Quince. \nPRICE Veinte. \nOLD WOMAN Diezysiete. \nShe shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the room to change the dollar into cordobas. Price idly studies the pictures on the wall: \nPICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN. \nPRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier. \nTHE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't heard them enter over the sounds of music and our preoccupation with the pictures. \nPRICE What is this? I'm a journalist! \nNo answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge. \nPRICE Journalista, journalista! \nThe officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it briefly and takes the passport. He nods. \nA rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away. \nAs the Guard hauls him outside, the OLD WOMAN appears in the doorway with a stack of local currency. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MILITARY HOLDING CELL - NIGHT \nPrice is led into a dark cell where another PRISONER, 50, lies in street clothes on the floor. The Prisoner is spat upon by the Guards and kicked awake. Price cringes. \nGUARD Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta... (in Spanish to Price) Here is a Priest for you to confess your sins. \nThe Guards laugh and leave. The Prisoner rises to his feet. Price keeps his distance. The Prisoner looks in bad shape. \nPRISONER PRIEST Cigarillo? \nPrice hands him a cigarette and lights it. A long, deep drag. \nPRICE Priest? (the man nods) (in broken Spanish) What are you doing here? \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) The government accused me of using the church to hide Rebels and guns. \nPRICE (in Spanish) Governments are always wrong, eh? \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) This time they're right. Who are you? \nPRICE (in Spanish) Un periodista. \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) Whose side are you on? \nPRICE (in Spanish) I don't take sides. I take pictures. \nPRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) No sides? \nPRICE (in Spanish) No. \nThe Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain. \nPRISONER PRIEST Periodista Puta, todos periodistas son putas. (All journalists are whores) \nThe Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is surprised to be treated so despicably. \nPRISONER PRIEST (quietly) Go home. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM \nPrice is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans. The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes. \nFIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone. \nPRICE Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh? Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time magazine. \nThe soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion to Price's tone, shouting: \n", "test1_true": "Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak. \nThe soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is frightened. \nThrough the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian in a hat. The civilian points to a door. \nTHE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives at price. \nTHE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE \nPRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display rack into a room. \nTHROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly shown into a bare office. \nINT. THE BARE ROOM \nPictures on the wall of Somoza and the FLAG RAISING AT IWO JIMA. Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk. \nP.O.V. THE CIVILIAN THROUGH A DOOR -- IT IS MARCEL JAZY His rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings. The door closes. \nA SENIOR OFFICER ENTERS THE BARE ROOM, and Price addresses him at once. \nPRICE Soy un periodista. \nSENIOR GUARD OFFICER (in excellent English) Mr. Price... you must accept our deepest apologies for the misunderstanding. Somebody saw you taking photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub -- our young officers get carried away... they're always looking for traitors. \nPRICE That film is half way to New York by now. \nSENIOR GUARD OFFICER I know, I know... It was all a misunderstanding... una mala interpretacion. Your cameras. \nThe Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it to him, but as he does: \nTHE CAMERA DROPS TO THE GROUND AND BREAKS -- SILENCE The Officer would love for Price to get angry. \nSENIOR GUARD OFFICER I'm sorry. \nPrice smiles barely, and refuses to pop off. \nPRICE Forget it. \nPrice puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from the room he notices a copy of the TIME MAGAZINE WITH ELEPHANT sitting on the desk. \nSENIOR GUARD OFFICER This way. \nPrice is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led outside into the night. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MILITARY PRISON - DAWN \nClaire stands at the main doorway surrounded by GUARDS, an OFFICER, and an unidentified CIVILIAN -- she is arguing with them in rapid Spanish, not allowing them to get in a word. \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) You throw a journalist in jail -- it gets in the papers. You walk all over the same press credentials you pass out. I demand to speak to someone in authority or I'll go to Tacho myself... I don't understand you -- you're big and strong and handsome but you're not so smart! (beat) You should be trying to seduce us! \nOFFICER Senora... \nPRICE IS SHOWN OUT A DOOR IN THE BACKGROUND and sees her. \nPRICE Claire! \nThey hurry toward each other and embrace briefly. The Guards watch it all curiously. \nCLAIRE You're okay? \nPRICE I'm fine -- what're you doing here? These guys are goons. \nCLAIRE They love being beaten up by a woman (beat) I've been looking for you all night -- why'd they lock you up? \nThey walk away together. \nPRICE I don't know. Taking pictures. The usual. Jazy got me released. \nCLAIRE Jazy?! You think there's a story there? \nPRICE Ahh... C.I.A. stories are all alike. I wanta find Rafael. \nCLAIRE You need help? \nPRICE No. You? \nCLAIRE No. (beat) When should we start. \nPRICE I figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of Marcel Jazy's business connections in the third world countries with C.I.A. influence... \nCLAIRE Oh. I assumed you'd just look him in the eye and say \"Gimme a break, for crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or aren't you?\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GARDEN COURTYARD OF MARCEL JAZY - DAY LATER \n", "test1_id": 2994, "test2_input": "CLAIRE Fast. \nAgain their glibness is interrupted by what they came to see. Even as they joke, they watch the landscape with concern. \nREFUGEES ARE STREAMING OUT OF LEON, mostly women and children, some old men, carrying their possessions. Soldiers stand around. \nCLAIRE I'm basically a coward, Russell, I hope you understand that. I hope we don't get shot. \nPRICE Me too. \nCUT TO: \nA GUARDIA ROADBLOCK ON A HILL OVERLOOKING THE CITY \nThe press car pulls up to a stop. Price and Claire get out quickly, hand their credentials to a soldier, and open the trunk and the hood. As the car is searched they look down at the city. \nP.O.V. LEON AS A PLANE CIRCLES FIRING ROCKETS AND SMOKE RISES from several places in the town. The sound of gunfire. \nCLAIRE (to soldier in Spanish) I thought it was quiet here. \nSOLDIER (in Spanish) Quiet? Are you sure you want to go down there? Not me. \nThe soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the credentials. \nSOLDIER (in Spanish) You must leave the car here. \nPrice speaks in English knowing he can't be understood. \nPRICE (to soldier) You thinking of scoring a Toyota? \nCLAIRE (in Spanish) No problem -- we leave the car. \nPrice and Claire remove their things from the car, and Price takes the distributor cap as well as the keys. They walk over and look down the road leading into the city under seige. \nMORE REFUGEES EVACUATE THE TOWN -- it is a most uninviting sight. The plane passes over the town in the distance firing rockets. \nCLAIRE Now what? \nPrice responds by flashing his light meter in the air, taking a quick, nervous reading. \nPRICE C'mon. Be careful. \nCLAIRE Be careful?! Where the fuck we going? Better light? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET INTO LEON - DAY \nPRICE AND CLAIRE WALK SLOWLY INTO LEON \nLooking around warily as they go, they are the only people entering the town. Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing. \nCLAIRE ...June tenth... the evacuation of Leon... a woman carries a pig... signs for the F.S.L.N. are everywhere... a body... \nTHE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN lies ignored on the sidewalk. They continue walking and soon come to: \nAN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for. \nA YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away, holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops: \nTHE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him instantly. \nCLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch. \nPRICE RECORDS THE EVENT WITH HIS CAMERA \nTHE GUARDIA FOLLOW THE TANQUETTA SLOWLY down the street toward the Rebel youth's house. Suddenly the intersection is empty. \nPRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as: \nSEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price. \nTHE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price to record them. They pose instantly in \"tough-guy\" posture. \nPRICE TAKES THEIR PICTURE and just as quickly they dart away through a bombed out building. \nTHREE SANDINISTAS LEAP OFF A ROOFTOP and race toward Claire and Price who freeze: \nCLAIRE Russell?! \nFor a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists, pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment Price and Claire are alone on the street. \nTHE DOOR OPENS AGAIN SLOWLY and a middle-aged WOMAN appears, motioning for them to come inside. \nINT. PEDRO'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled disco, are pleading with a young man, PEDRO, 15. \nSANDINISTA #1 (in Spanish) You must come and help us... one more time. \n", "test2_true": "One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled baseball jersey from another room. \nSANDINISTA #2 (in Spanish) For Leon... for Nicaragua! \nPedro sees Price and Claire and is more interested in them. He speaks in broken but understandable English. \nPEDRO Americans? Journalists? \nCLAIRE AND PRICE Yes. \nPedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a baseball he is signing. \nPEDRO Ah! I put my autograph on this ball. \nSANDINISTA #1 (in Spanish) Pedro! There is no time to waste. \nPedro is more interested in the two Americans. \nPEDRO When you get back to the United States, I want you to give this ball to Tippy Martinez for me. He is from Nicaragua. \nPedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas plead with Pedro for his help. He is more interested in getting the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez. Claire accepts the ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with Price, and puts it in her shoulder bag. \nSANDINISTA #1 (in Spanish) Enrique is dead! Roberto has disappeared! The Guardia has the church, and we need you! \nPEDRO (to Claire and Price) You come, eh? (to the Sandinistas) Can they come with us? \nSANDINISTA #2 Come! Everybody come! \nThey go to the door and open it a crack to look out. \nP.O.V. THE TANQUETTA PASSES as Soldiers kick open doors across the street. \nThe Sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book shelf out of the way. A large hole has been broken in the wall. They climb through the hole into the living room of the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the hole with great effort. \nINT. THE NEXT HOUSE - DAY \nA family huddles in the corner as the MAN OF THE HOUSE pulls back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole knocked in the wall. The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price scramble through. \nP.O.V. THROUGH A SERIES OF DOOR-SIZED HOLES IN THE WALLS of all the houses on the block, connecting the homes with a secret passageway. The six of them race through the houses, each hole opening and then closing magically. \nINT. THE KITCHEN OF A TINY SIDEWALK RESTAURANT - DAY \nThe Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge. A WOMAN, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. The SIX crawl so as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to survey the plaza. \nP.O.V. THE CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEON DOMINATED BY A HUGE CATHEDRAL Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. Otherwise, it is empty. \nP.O.V. SIX GUARDIA SNIPERS IN THE CHURCH TOWER control the plaza. As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza. \nTHE WOMAN PULLS A TRAY OF \"CONTACT BOMBS\" from the oven, home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. Pedro grabs one and pretends to bite into it. The Sandinistas start to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns. Claire and Price aren't sure what the \"muffins\" are and don't respond; mostly they are on edge. The contact bombs are put in a sack. \nThe woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of them climb down a ladder into a tunnel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - DAY \nPedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under the street. Overhead we hear gunfire. Rats scurry, and water runs through an open sewer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CATHEDRAL - DAY \nA tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears. He climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. A PRIEST leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. European interior of ornate altars and burning candles. The small party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long, rickety ladder leads up to the roof. \nTHE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways. Pedro follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up as the Priest holds the ladder. The American is much larger than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and when he is nearly at the top: \nTHE LADDER CRACKS as Price reaches the top and is helped to safety. The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof. \nPRIEST (in Spanish) No, please... it's not safe. You must come with me. \nClaire looks at Price -- she wants to go on the roof but the sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma. Claire hurries off to safety with the Priest. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LEON - LATE IN DAY \nTHREE SANDINISTAS, PEDRO, AND PRICE EMERGE FROM A TUNNEL onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body lies. They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons fire opens up on them -- the Sandinistas flatten against a wall, quickly becoming separated from Price and Pedro. \nTWO SANDINISTAS RACE FOR COVER BEHIND A CUPOLA in a move that is equally daring and foolish. The diversion draws fire from the two soldiers. \nPRICE'S LIGHT METER IS INSTANTLY OUT TAKING READINGS as Pedro huddles with him, curious at this strange act. \nTWO GUARDIA MOVE INTO POSITION TO FLUSH OUT THE SANDINISTAS as they hide behind the cupolas. The hidden Third Guerrilla opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier races for the belltower. As he does: \nTHE SANDINISTAS SEIZE THE MOMENT TO RUSH CLOSER, waving to Pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs. \nPRICE STARTS TO FOLLOW BUT IS PINNED DOWN BY FIRE and chooses to take refuge halfway in an alcove. As fire from both sides ricochets all over the rooftop, Price switches camera lenses seemingly oblivious to the action. \nPEDRO MEETS ONE OF THE SANDINISTAS in a protected niche and quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the \"muffin bombs\" out on the rooftop. \n", "test2_id": 2995, "test3_input": "ALEX Didn't you ship the film to New York? \nPRICE I developed it in my room. (pleads) Jesus Christ, Alex?! \nSilence. The car races. \nALEX Slow down. (compassionately) It wasn't your fault if somebody stole your stuff... \nPRICE It was. \nAlex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it entirely. \nALEX What about Rafael? \nNo answer -- the car races back to Managua. Alex stares at Price trying to figure out what is wrong. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRICE'S ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER \nA MAID IS CLEANING HIS ROOM which is the usual disaster. Price enters, just returned, and quickly looks for his negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them. \nPRICE Algo no esta aqui. Fotografias. (Something is not here. Photographs.) \nMAID (in Spanish) Everything's always a mess here. You should be neater. \nPRICE Negativos, negativos! \nThe maid shrugs -- Price is crazy anyway, and: \nCLAIRE WALKS INTO THE ROOM She too looks shaken. He looks up. \nCLAIRE Commandante Cinco's body was just found on the road to Matagalpa. \nThe maid starts crying. They look at her helplessly as she sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco...' \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY \nA cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. La Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more hurried. A hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap. They get out and knock on Jazy's door. \nGUARDIA SOLDIERS WATCH THEM FROM A DISTANCE, a development that Price and Claire are aware of. \nCLAIRE I don't think it's Jazy. \nStill no answer. \nPRICE Oates said it was a Frog. How many Frenchmen you know around here? Jazy ain't 'facilitating' shit. \nPrice is impatient. He looks around nervously -- the Guards are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch, jimmying the lock. The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes off. \nPrice and Claire duck inside quickly. \nCLAIRE Christ! \nPrice, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb. \nLA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward Jazy's. \nINSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops. \nImmediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards. She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces them. \nCLAIRE Are we looking for negs or prints? \nPRICE Anything. \nThey find nothing downstairs. The look up at the sound of distant gunfire. \nSuddenly: Loud banging at the front door -- La Guardia. \nEXT. TWO GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND A THIRD ARRIVING - DAY \nThey look around warily, hungrily -- they know something is wrong. \nBACK INSIDE THE HOUSE we hear the shouting soldiers, banging. Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag. Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself. Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs. Claire goes to the front door, shaking nervously. \nCLAIRE OPENS THE DOOR AND FACES THE SOLDIERS \nCLAIRE Que quiere? (What do you want?) \nSOLDIER Donde esta senor Jazy? \nCLAIRE No esta aqui. \nSOLDIER Que quienes? (Who are you?) \nCLAIRE (smiles) Una novia suya. (A girlfriend of his.) \n", "test3_true": "SOLDIER #2 El hombre tiene muchas novias, eh? (The man has many girlfriends, no?) \nThe soldiers laugh and peer into the room. Claire forces the door closed on them, teasing slightly. \nCLAIRE No, no, no... \nAfraid to make a mistake with one of Jazy's sweethearts, they don't press the issue. The door closes shut. \nINT. THE HOUSE \nCLAIRE sighs with frightened relief and hurries upstairs to join Price. \nJAZY'S BEDROOM as she enters. A rumpled bed, a spilled wine glass -- a pleasant mess. \nCLAIRE Russell? (no answer) Russell? \nA door off the bedroom is open -- light spills out. Claire stops cold at what she sees: \nPRICE STANDS IN A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS Hundreds of pictures of all sizes, photographic equipment, an enlarger, cameras and lenses, etc. Pictures of Sandino, newspaper photos, snapshots. \nP.O.V. OF RUSSELL'S PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RAFAEL'S CAMP cropped and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the Businessman, Isela. Photographs of other slain rebel leaders. The pictures include faces that have been circled with names written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed. \nThey are both stunned. \nPRICE Let's get out of here. \nTHEY HURRY DOWNSTAIRS and as they get to the front door -- the sound of somebody opening it. They freeze. \nTHE DOOR OPENS AND MISS PANAMA ENTERS She smiles and greets them in a friendly, aloof manner, and continues toward the waterless pool. \nMISS PANAMA Hola. \nPrice and Claire return the greeting and continue out the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JAZY'S HOUSE - THE SOUND OF MORTAR IN THE DISTANCE \nAs they emerge, Claire tears a white cloth in half and ties it to a stick, handing half to Price who does likewise. \nAn earth mover goes past, a Guardia soldier at the wheel. More soldiers cling to the machine, their guns at the ready. \nPRICE We've got to talk to Alex. \nThey start walking. \nCLAIRE You think our flags are big enough? \nFlags held high, they move nervously down the street into the ominous silence of the city. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - NIGHT \nAlex, Price, and Claire get out of a cab and approach a large statue of Somoza on horseback, surreally lit by floodlights in the center of a traffic circle. Four Guardia Soldiers are visible on the sidewalk in the b.g. drinking with two women. \nPRICE This is what I want to show you. \nALEX We drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of Tacho. \nPRICE It's not Tacho. It's Mussolini. Tacho went to Italy to commission a statue of himself, he found a warehouse full of Il Duces on horseback, got a great deal on one of 'em -- brought it back and switched heads. (beat) Ya can't tell, can ya? \nSilence. Alex knows Price too well -- it's a great story but that's not why they're here. \nALEX What the hell are you talking about? \nCLAIRE I think what he's trying to say -- what we're trying to say -- is that things aren't exactly what they seem to be. \nALEX Well, they don't \"seem\" to be that great so I can't wait for this one... (mocks silliness) Hey, here we are! Two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame... bullets flying! \nCLAIRE Alex! That's not why we're here. \nALEX Oh yeah? I left the country because of him... (points to Price) ...and I came back because of him... (beat) And now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse's ass on a midnight tour of Managua. (points up the statue's ass) What are we doing here? \nSilence. Claire addresses Alex calmly. \nCLAIRE Rafael is dead. \nSilence. Alex isn't quite sure he understood. \nALEX In the picture he's dead? \nPRICE (shouts) Dead! \nALEX How the hell... \nCLAIRE (interrupts quickly) Who cares how?! \nSilence. A bit of gallows laughter from Alex as he circles the statue. Price calms and tries to explain. \n", "test3_id": 2996}

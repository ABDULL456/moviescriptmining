JACK You don't want to be like Evan. Evan's an asshole. BRUCE I can be an asshole. 
JACK No, Bruce.     You can't. Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other for a beat. JACK Are you going to pick that up? BRUCE Yeah, I'm sorry. Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food. BRUCE It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts... He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA saunters by. JACK                               BRUCE Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan. SUSAN ORTEGA Hi, Jack. Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing. JACK Look, Bruce. You're a good reporter. You make people laugh. God knows today we can use it. Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              * JACK                                    * (beat) Alright, tell you what. It's the                   * 23rd anniversary of the Maid of the Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour. BRUCE Maid of the Mist. That's always live. JACK Yep. BRUCE Evan gets the live feeds. 
JACK Well now you and Evan get the live feeds. BRUCE I'm going live. In sweeps. JACK Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce. I've seen your outtakes. Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest. BRUCE Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack. (releases Jack) I will not forget you when I go national. Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS... INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY 
A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS playing at Grace's self-starter business, a one room day care center filled with children and toys. Grace turns, reacts. GRACE Martin, are you eating the glitter again? ON MARTIN - AN ADORABLE HISPANIC BOY He shakes his head "no." 
GRACE Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su boca. He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter. GRACE Oh, you're not huh? Well, then you've got a bad case of Liberace. Grace's sister, Debbie, enters. She's wearing a nurse's outfit. Her youngest, ZOE, 3, runs over to greet her. ZOE Mommy1 
GRACE They didn't teach you Spanish in nursing school, did they? DEBBIE Well, it seemed like they were speaking a foreign language sometimes, but no. Problemo? GRACE Martin has decided to explore new food groups. (back to Martin) Martin, this is for art. Like this. She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter. DEBBIE Is it so wrong to tie them up? GRACE D eb -- Ma rt i n! Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth. Grace snatches it. GRACE Okay, go rinse your mouth with water. Lave su boca. Go. (to Debbie) I swear that kid is going to poop an ornament. DEBBIE (laughs) You're good with them, you know. You should have some of your own. GRACE Don't start... DEBBIE Free milk cow. GRACE Debbie, don't call me that. DEBBIE If the moo fits. The phone RINGS.

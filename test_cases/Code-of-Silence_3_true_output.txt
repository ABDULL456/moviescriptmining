INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Eddie leans down to the open drivers window. 
EDDIE Hold here a second. 
Eddie goes to the back of the car, and Kosalas follows him in the rearview mirror, losing sight when Eddie pops open the trunk. 
Kosalas watches the party goers enter the building. 
There is a tapping at the window. 
Eddie has donned a baseball uniform, matching cap, and now carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from it. 
EDDIE Keep with Gamiani. 
Eddie tosses the keys back to Kosalas, and heads to the building. Kosalas calls to him. 
KOSALAS Bang a few for me. 
INT. PARTY STAIRS - NIGHT 
In the darkened stairway Eddie joins a group of outrageously dressed characters. The door at the top of the stairs bursts open on a punk-funk art student Halloween party. 
INT. PARTY - NIGHT 
A hundred people are jammed into the studio. It feels like the Star Wars Saloon. The LIVE MUSICIANS match the look of the party. The costumes are outrageous. Everyone is dancing. 
Eddie looks the place over. He spots Diana. 
Eddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. He sidles up to Diana. 
EDDIE Wanna play ball? 
She looks him over taking in the outfit, the bat. 
DIANA Are you pitching? 
EDDIE Some people say I've got a pretty good inside curve. 
DIANA I don't know. You look strictly minor league. 
She smiles. 
EDDIE I'm Eddie. 
DIANA I make it Eddie-The-Cop. 
EDDIE You've had a lot of experience with cops? 
DIANA All bad. 
She is angry now, and walks away from him. 
Eddie watches her go, and is about to follow. He sets his drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, dressed like a Frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. She takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick. 
EDDIE You'll get slivers. 
He walks by her. 
INT. PARTY BACK ROOM - NIGHT 
Eddie steps over and around an assortment of wasted witches and gooned out goblins snorting lines on the coffee table to get to Diana who is tensely by herself. 
He grabs her purse.

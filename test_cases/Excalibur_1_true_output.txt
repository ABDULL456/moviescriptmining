Knights look up; those who meet Arthur's reddened eyes shake their heads. 
Arthur leaves. A knight whispers to another. 
KNIGHT Did you see? The King was without Excalibur... 
INT. PASSAGEWAYS, CAMELOT - DAY 
Echoing in the vaulted corridors outside the hall, the knight's whisper stabs Arthur. 
The words now seem borne on the whistling wind and follow the King wherever he goes in search of Merlin. He comes upon a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, his hand under her gown. Arthur notes the sacrilege in silence, and continues on his way. 
INT. BEDCHAMBER - DAY 
The wind keens. Thunder rolls overhead. Arthur enters his bedchamber. He sits by the empty fireplace, a broken man. Feminine hands light on his shoulders. He starts. He looks up. It is Morgana. He smiles and grasps her hand. 
MORGANA I'll weep for you, brother, for a King must not weep. 
She comes around and she kneels in front of him. Before he can talk she silences him with a tender caress. 
MORGANA Do you know what Guenevere's maids have whispered? 
He shakes his head. 
MORGANA That when the King returned from battle... 
She begins untying the laces of his metal thigh and shin guards. 
MORGANA ...Guenevere would unlace his armor and massage the burns where metal rubbed on flesh... 
She is stripping his legs naked, gently touching the flesh with her fingertips. He stares off, remembering. 
MORGANA ...She would prepare a bath for you, mixing special ointment in the water... 
Arthur's eyes brim with tears. Morgana weeps, embracing his knees. He rests his hand gently upon her head, choked with remembrance, soothing her. But as she weeps, she incants a charm. 
Arthur looks down upon her, and the woman who looks up at him is Guenevere, a Guenevere with cold ice eyes. He is made weak by desire and weakened further by magic. He holds her face adoringly. 
ARTHUR Guenevere! You are-- 
"GUENEVERE" --Don't speak. A thousand words, a hundred thousand words, would only be prologue to the truth that must be. That you, King, and I, your Queen, beget a son to bond our love and to strengthen our weak kingdom with a successor. Come, my lord... 
She draws him to the floor and upon her body, holding him tightly to himself. Arthur trembles with excitement, pathetic in his desperate passion. 
As he takes her, she shudders, losing control of the charm, and her features change till once again "Guenevere" is Morgana. She holds him in a tight embrace so that he may not see her. She whispers in his ear. 
MORGANA The moon flows in my blood to meet your seed. And already I bear him who will be King. 
Arthur wrenches himself away so he can see her, her arms still around his neck. He looks down upon her, aghast, incredulous. 
MORGANA I could easily kill you, brother. But I want you to live to see our son be King. In me, the blood of Cornwall will have its revenge; in me, the blood of Uther will show its dark side. 
She presses her thumbs into his neck and he faints. 
EXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY 
Morgana, with a small party, rides away from the castle through the lashing storm, till they are taken from sight in the folds of the forest... 
INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT 
Lightening forks across the sky, illuminating the interior. The chapel has been transformed into a place of satanic worship. Held up and surrounded by hooded figures, Morgana lies on the altar, her pregnant belly huge; and her features are fierce with passionate intensity. She writhes in the pangs of childbirth. 
MORGANA Stand back, all of you. Through my own body I have nurtured him with my potions. I made him. I alone can give him life. 
INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT 
Arthur enters, pale and haunted. Mass is being celebrated, and some knights are present. Those not asleep whisper to each other about the King. The sound of an approaching storm is heard. 
As the priest raises the chalice to consecrate the wine. Arthur comes down the aisle and steps onto the altar. He reaches out to grasp the chalice from the priest's hands. 
INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT 
Morgana holds aloft her beautiful newborn baby, his body glistening in a flash of lightening. She is triumphant.

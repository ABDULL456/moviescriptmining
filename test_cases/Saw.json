{"train": "SAW \nWritten by \nJames Wan & Leigh Whannell \nDarkness. \nThe soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way downwards across the screen. As it passes, we see just under the water part of a young man\u0092s face. His eyes are closed. The light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S A W. The title fades away. \nThe tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the end of a tub of water, just near someone\u0092s bare foot. The camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, and a bit hysterical. \nADAM Help! Someone help me! (He stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room. He looks out into the darkness and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey! (He turns back to the corner to which he is chained, says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice) Shit, I\u0092m probably dead. \nSuddenly, from out within the darkness comes a man\u0092s low, raspy voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs to LAWRENCE. \nLAWRENCE You\u0092re not dead. \nAdam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking, but still cannot see a thing. \nADAM Who\u0092s that? Who\u0092s that?! \nLAWRENCE (his voice strangely a bit on the calm side, and almost irritated with Adam\u0092s reaction to the situation. This shall be his tone for many scenes to come.) There\u0092s no point in yelling, I already tried it. \nADAM Turn on the lights! \nLAWRENCE Would if I could. \nADAM What the fuck is going on? Where am I? (He turns into his corner, touching the wall.) \nLAWRENCE I don\u0092t know yet. \nADAM (smelling something; in disgust) What is that smell? \nLAWRENCE Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something. \nWith a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, starting from Lawrence\u0092s end and moving towards Adam. As they come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men are barefoot. \nAdam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look at the body, just shakes his head. \nADAM (sharply) No. \nLAWRENCE (trying to get SOMETHING out of this kid) Well, do you have any idea how you got here? \nADAM No. \nLAWRENCE What\u0092s the last thing you remember? \nADAM Nothing. (he sits back onto the floor, stops pulling at his chains for a moment.) I went to bed in my shithole apartment, and woke up in an actual shithole. (He raises his left leg slightly, starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has moved over to the wall to his left, bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe.) So what about you, huh? \nLAWRENCE (He shrugs slightly, shaking his head.) Well there\u0092s...there\u0092s not much to tell, really. (Across the room, Adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.) I was on my way home from work and uh, I don\u0092t remember anything else. \nAdam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing on it much more. The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock. His voice is a bit softer. \nADAM First dead body I\u0092ve ever seen. Look different in real life. They don\u0092t move. \nLawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall. He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot. \nLAWRENCE From the looks of these chains, someone didn\u0092t want us to go very far either. \nSuddenly, Adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his abdomen. His panic is back, but not at full force like before. He studies himself then glances to Lawrence. \nADAM Can you see any scars? \nLAWRENCE (looking at him strangely) What? \nADAM Huh? This is what they do man, (he gestures to his stomach, where there are in fact no scars.) They kidnap you and drug you and before you know it, you\u0092re in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay. (A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence, but Adam states it with conviction.) \nLAWRENCE (a scoffing tone in his voice) No one has taken your kidneys. \nADAM (disbelief) How can you tell from way over there? \nLAWRENCE (matter of fact) Because you\u0092d either be in terrible agony, or you\u0092d be dead by now. Trust me. \nADAM What are you, a surgeon? (He lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to prod at the chain around the pipe again.) \nADAM Fuck. (He leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesn\u0092t work. He tries the lock on the chains around the pipe. It isn\u0092t working there either.) \nLAWRENCE (watching him) No? \nAdam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head. That\u0092s when he looks over to the body again, and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small loop handle juts out of the hand\u0092s grip. Adam stands up, then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body. \nLAWRENCE Use your shirt. \nADAM (gets back up to his knees) What? \nLAWRENCE Your shirt. \nAdam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue shirt. He lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. It misses. He tries a second time; same result. \nLAWRENCE Come on... \nAdam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated. \nADAM It won\u0092t work. \nLAWRENCE (trying to get him to not give up yet) Well, look around, there must be something else you can use. \nADAM (stands, ready to give up, skeptical) There\u0092s nothing. \nLAWRENCE (insistent) Well there must be something! \nAdam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. He sees something, bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long cord. He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. He kneels down, holding out the shirt, aiming. \nLAWRENCE Come on, you can do it. \nAdam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder. He misses. \nLAWRENCE Come on, come on, again. \nHe tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adam\u0092s expression is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected. \nJIGSAW (on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. You\u0092re probably wondering where you are. I\u0092ll tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? Now, I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam? Or do something about it? (end) \nLawrence stops the tape. \nADAM What the hell does Follow your heart mean? \nLawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart. He spots a small one drawn in brown on the toilet next to Adam and points. \nLAWRENCE There! Right next to you, on the toilet. \nAdam looks, sees the toilet. Slowly, he bends down, resting his hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, not really sure what he\u0092s looking for. \nLAWRENCE (impatient, gesturing) Come on, come on. \nAdam glances up at Lawrence with a look of You\u0092ve got to be kidding me, but Lawrence watches him expectantly. Adam sighs, then reaches in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess. \nADAM Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. He coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting. \nLAWRENCE (expectantly) Anything? \nADAM (disgusted) No solids. \nLAWRENCE Take off the lid. (He points to the lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no patience.) Come on! \nAdam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. The water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something wrapped up in a black garbage bag. He holds it up for Lawrence to see, turns to him. \nADAM I really wish I had checked in there first. \nLAWRENCE Huh. (he smiles slightly) What is it? \nAdam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. He drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain with it. Lawrence watches him for a moment. \nLAWRENCE Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing me the other one? \nAdam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully throws it across the room. It hits the pipe to Lawrence\u0092s left. Lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the floor. Quick shot back to Adam, who, while Lawrence is preoccupied with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag and tosses it into the bathtub. Both men start to saw away at their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. Suddenly, Adam\u0092s saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares. \nADAM (enraged) Fuck! Fuck! (He reacts violently, hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into a mirror. A small piece of the mirror breaks off and flies to the floor.) \nLawrence glances over at what Adam has done, then goes back to sawing for another moment. Adam sits back down, breathing heavily, leaning against the pipe in his corner. Finally, Lawrence gives up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also breathing heavily for a moment. He sits there, when a look of realization comes across his face. He holds up the saw, looking at it, understanding. He lowers it to the floor, shaking his head slightly. \nLAWRENCE (VO) He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. \nCut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaw\u0092s voice from a tape recorder play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the flashback shots. \nJIGSAW (VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If you\u0092re so sick, then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? (there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of Mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car.) Let\u0092s put your so-called illness to the test. (Flashback image of Mark waking up. He is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains. On the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches. He gets up, looking around confusedly and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is in the safe. (Black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of Mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaw\u0092s voice, as with Paul.) The combination to the safe (quick montage of several black and white crime-scene photos of numbers written all over the walls) is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step (Mark\u0092s bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor). And by the way, that\u0092s a flammable substance smeared on your body (shot of Mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere), so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you... \nMARK (huddled over the safe; screams, but it is still distant sounding) Help!!!!! \nJIGSAW (VO ct\u0092d)....or all the people you\u0092ve burned with your act (Mark starts to turn the lock on the safe) just might have their revenge. \nWe see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. The camera goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the combination into the safe. He moves in a circle, clockwise to us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up crime scene photo of Mark\u0092s charred face. \nThe shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding the tape recorder. \nKERRY I found something else. Well, two things, actually. (She moves past them and we go with her over to a wall where there is a small hole cut, about an inch or two in diameter. The light from the outside shines in.) There was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole. Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games. He was there at the last one as well. (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only this time, he left us his penlight. (She holds up the penlight in an evidence baggie, clicking it twice then handing it to Tapp.) \nTAPP (taking the baggie, studying it) Get a rush on the prints. (He hands it back to her.) \nKERRY (taking the baggie, moving out of the room) Copy that. \nCUT TO Hospital room. Lawrence in his white doctor\u0091s coat along with three blue-scrub clad medical students. A nurse in white stands off to the side. Lawrence is going over the patient\u0092s charts. He goes over to the x-ray display, pushing the light on to view two x-rays of someone\u0092s skull. He points to it with his pen as he speaks. \nLAWRENCE Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer. (He turns back to the three young medical students. One of them, a pretty Asian girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated with him.) The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining. \nIn the doorway, an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the medical students in the room, listening to what Lawrence is saying. This is Zep. He\u0092s a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking. Kindness, and something else below the surface. He glances down at John sleeping, then up at Lawrence. \nLAWRENCE The patient had... \nZEP (cutting him off) His name is John, Dr. Gordon. (He looks down at the patient, who we see is a man in his late forties-early fifties, hairless except for a small white goatee. His head is to the side and he is sleeping. On the tray table in front of him is a notebook and some colored pencils. As Zep looks at him and speaks of him, there is caring in his voice, something Dr. Gordon has yet to display regarding this patient.) He\u0092s a very interesting person. \nLawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed, not for himself but maybe for Zep. A condescending, smug smile plays across his face and he nods. His tone matches his look. \nLAWRENCE Thank you for that information, Zep. (he looks to the students, who all share his smug smile) As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, his expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface. The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, then turns away, and continues down the hall with his cart.) Continuing on, the patient.... \nBut he is cut off by a voice on the intercom. \nINTERCOM Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please page the operator. \nDIANA He talked to me. \nALISON (sighs) Okay, I\u0092ll come and check your room. (She smiles a small, assuring smile) \nDIANA I want Daddy. He\u0092ll get the scary man. \nALISON (her smile fading a bit) Alright, if you want. Come on. \nShe stands and leads Diana out of the room. Cut to Lawrence\u0092s office. Lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop computer, focused on some paper he\u0092s writing. Diana and Alison appear in the doorway to his left. He doesn\u0092t even look up, just keeps typing. Alison\u0092s tone when she speaks indicates that she knows he\u0092ll probably say no, or put it off on her. \nALISON Larry, sorry to bother you, but your daughter had a bad dream again. \nLAWRENCE (his eyes never leaving the screen; raises his finger to pause them) Just a minute. \nALISON She wants you to check her room. \nLAWRENCE (keeps typing, never looks up) Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph. \nAlison waits a moment, then turns to Diana. \nALISON (softly) You know what sweetie? I\u0092ll go check with you. \nThey turn, slowly start to walk away as Lawrence quickly finishes typing, then closes the laptop. \nLAWRENCE Nope! I\u0092m done. (he smiles, turning to look at them.) \nCut to Diana\u0092s room. Lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp on Diana\u0092s side table. Diana lies in bed, slightly propped up against her pillows and stuffed animals. Lawrence sits on the side of her bed. \nLAWRENCE (very reassuringly) See? (he pulls the covers up over her, up to her chest.) There\u0092s no one in your room. There\u0092s no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep? \nDIANA I\u0092m still scared. \nLAWRENCE You are? Give me your tootsie. (He pulls back the covers and she pulls out her foot. He takes it in his hand.) Oh, what a big tootsie. (He turns to her, raising his eyebrows up) Remember this one? (He counts on her toes as he says the following) This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, and this little piggy went \u0091Weeee!\u0092 (he tickles up her leg to her tummy and she giggles) all the way home! \nJust then, Lawrence\u0092s beeper goes off. He leans back, takes it out and looks at it. \nDIANA I hate that thing. \nTAPP I never should have let you go... \nCamera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the Jigsaw killings. It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. Jigsaw hunt brings D.A. before Judge, Missing Man discovered at Bizarre Crime Scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of Paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging dead in his cage Killer \u0091Preaching\u0092 Says Top Cop, Psychopath Teaches Sick Life Lessons, quick shot of Mark going around looking for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over the shot, Escape, Victim Survives Maniac\u0092s Game quick flashback footage of Amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with her mask, and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening to her testimony, Doctor Questioned in Case flash of shots of Lawrence being questioned by the Tapp and Sing and then his Lawyer. It ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at Lawrence through the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story, and the shot slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building. \nTAPP (VO, fading, hushed against soundtrack) I never should\u0092ve let you go... \nThe car pulls up alongside a building, with Lawrence in the passenger seat, and Tapp driving. Lawrence\u0092s awkwardness, Tapp\u0092s distrust, and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between them. \nLAWRENCE (Pretending like he\u0092s trying to be helpful, really just glad to be out of Tapp\u0092s company) Here we are. That was uh, quite an amazing story that poor woman told. (Tapp just nods, says nothing. Lawrence smiles very uncomfortably, gets out of the car.) \nLAWRENCE (leaning down and looking back into the car window.) Look, I\u0092m sorry I can\u0092t be of more help to your investigation. \nTAPP (nods very slightly) You know, we arrested a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much. He lived two blocks from here. The sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, Doctor. (hint hint) \nLawrence stands straight up, walks away. Tapp wait\u0092s a moment, then drives off. \nBAM into static and then the video from Amanda\u0092s cell. We are not at Tapp\u0092s desk in the police station, watching him obsessively watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective. \nJIGSAW (from the video) Hello Amanda. You don\u0092t know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Here\u0092s what happens if you lose. There\u0092s a timer at the back of the device you\u0092re wearing. When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. \nIn the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives talking, then Sing walks in behind Tapp, over to his own desk. He turns, watching Tapp watch the screen. Tapp stops and rewinds the tape. \nSING (to the other detectives leaving) I\u0092ll catch you guys down there. (he reaches over and gets something off of his desk) \nJIGSAW (from video) Think of it like a reverse bear trap. \nTapp fast forwards a bit, hits play. \nJIGSAW (from video) I\u0092ll show you... \nTapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the device going off and exploding. Sing watches too, not paying as close attention. As soon as it explodes, Sing speaks. The look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing concern for his partner\u0092s obsession over this case. \nSING Hey Tapp? \nTapp doesn\u0092t look up, resembles Lawrence in the earlier scene when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room while he was working on his paper. \nTAPP Mmm? \nTAPP Now listen to this. \nThey listen with the volume up high. Over the static, the sound of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. They look at each other. Tapp hits stop. \nTAPP (looking up at Sing) We gotta check the records from all the fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. Go, right now! Mmm! \nSing turns and quickly walks off. \nCUT TO Close up of a map, with Sing speaking in a voiceover. As he speaks, there\u0092s a brief shot of the two of them sitting over the map, then quick shots of a few black and white photographs of a warehouse, including a close up of a street sign Stygian St. \nSING (VO) On the night of Tuesday, the 17th, we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. It\u0092s an old listing. Used to be a mannequin factory. (cut back to view of the two detectives) You think we have enough for a warrant, though? \nTAPP Who said anything about a warrant? (He grins, gets up and grabs his jacket.) \nSING (are you serious?) Right now? \nTAPP Why not? \nSING Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, and quickly follows Tapp. \nBrief shot of K2K graffiti on the video and then loud static, which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old warehouse building and a car speeding by. Our view is from inside the car as it pulls up alongside the building. A police radio can be heard in the background. So can the sound of a gun being loaded and cocked. \nTAPP (VO) At least we\u0092ll have the cover of darkness. \nSING (VO) Yeah, well, so will anybody else. \nA shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled up on one another. No signs of life...yet. A bang from the outside of the door is heard. A couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, sliding wooden door as it slides open, and Sing steps in, holding out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. Cut up to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Paul\u0091s razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them. They come up another level, one that has been recently used we see as Tapp points over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous items. Then, right next to the desk, we see the K2K graffiti from the video. \nTAPP I got you... \nThey continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, dolls representing each of them. \nTAPP What the hell is this?.......(his voice almost a whisper) Oh shit... \nThey move onto the next table, and Tapp pulls back the cloth covering that one, revealing the leering Puppet from Amanda\u0092s video. Tapp stares at it wide-eyed. Next to the puppet is a strange, boar-like mask with long dark hair. The camera pans back so we have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that Tapp and Sing had passed by. Tapp leans in closer to look at the puppet, when suddenly the still-covered form starts to move and muffled moaning sounds are heard. It startles the detectives. \nSING Oh fuck! \nTAPP Hold it right there! Don\u0092t move! \nSING Put your fucking hands in the air! \nJigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and the drill trap on Jeff\u0092s chair comes to life. He remains with his back mostly to them, hands still raised. \nJIGSAW Now you\u0092ll make a choice. (Sing runs up the steps to try to where Jigsaw is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where he stands.) In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended. \nTAPP Shut up and get down here! \nSING (keeping his gun steadily aimed) What did you do? Turn it off! \nJeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the drills come closer. \nTAPP Sing, stop that thing! I\u0092m taking this bastard down. (Sing tosses Tapp the shotgun.) Move! \nSING (to Jigsaw) How do you turn it off?! \nTAPP Tell him how to stop it! \nJigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs. \nJIGSAW One key will unlock it. \nSING (frantic) Where is it?! \nJIGSAW It\u0092s in the box. \nSING Box! (He sees a box on the side of the chair and opens it. Inside he pulls out a ring of at least 30 keys, and goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock the device. He tries a couple of keys, none working.) Fuck! Which key, which key?! \nTAPP Tell him which key it is! \nJIGSAW (now facing Tapp, moving closer to him. His back is to us, we still don\u0092t see his face.) Time is running out. \nTAPP Shut up and get down here right now, asshole! \nJigsaw slowly moves down towards him more. \nOn his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further down the hall. Sing\u0092s body finally falls forward onto the floor, spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end of the hall and starts sliding a large door open. \nAt that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sing\u0092s body, including a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now missing. \nAt the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck. \nTAPP (weak, desperate) Had you...had you on your knees. (He sits forward, getting some things off the coffee table) You\u0092re running. You\u0092re running...(He gets up and goes over to the desk in the corner with the audio recording device and dozens of photos pinned to the wall, takes a seat) You\u0092re running scared because we had you. I\u0092m going to close this case. Ram close it. (He picks up a small framed photograph, which we can\u0092t see, but likely, it\u0092s of Sing.) Right, Sing? Right? We\u0092re gonna close it, Sing. \nLAWRENCE X Marks the spot...(He stands, touching the pipe and looking up and around a bit.) X marks the spot...we need to search this room again. (He turns and looks over at Adam.) What are you doing over there? \nCut back into regular view in the bathroom, with a shot of Adam sitting on the tub, holding the photograph of Alison and Diana just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub, looking down at it. He ignores Lawrence, flipping the photo over. \nLAWRENCE (irritated) Excuse me? \nADAM (glancing up; calm irritation) Just because I\u0092m stuck in this room with you doesn\u0092t mean I have to report to you every ten seconds. \nLAWRENCE (sighs) I really don\u0092t see the point in us not helping one another. \nADAM well what do you want me to do? I\u0092m on a leash. \nLAWRENCE That\u0092s exactly why we need to talk. We need to think! \nADAM I am thinking! \nLAWRENCE (snapping at him) Well then don\u0092t keep me in the dark about what you\u0092re thinking! \nThere is a pause as something about that statement strikes Adam. \nADAM Turn off the lights. \nLAWRENCE What? \nADAM (letting the photo fall into the tub as he stands) Turn them off now, please! \nLAWRENCE (doesn\u0092t get it) Why? \nADAM (impatiently) Just turn them off for a second! \nLAWRENCE (VO) Last night, after I finished at the hospital. (fade into another closer shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking down the corridor, carrying his briefcase.) I was walking back to my car. (He stops a moment) I thought I was alone, but I\u0092m sure someone else was there. (He squints, bringing his hand up over his eyes. There is a flash from the side. He looks up, startled, looking in the direction in which he thinks it came from, but sees nothing. He looks around him for another moment, then continues forward to his car.) \nCut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of Lawrence\u0092s car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station. He gets out of the car, shutting the door and going over to a phone on the wall to dial security to let him out. When he dials, though, it gives him a busy signal. As it beeps, we cut to another shot of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaw\u0092s workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as he\u0092s distracted with his phone and grabs him. \nCut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom, still holding the phone. \nLAWRENCE (His eyes distant, off in his memory) That...thing. It was waiting for me. (He exhales sharply, then looks back up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses him.) How did you know to turn off the lights? \nADAM Who cares? It worked. \nLAWRENCE Yeah, but how did you know? \nADAM (a slight pause) Instinct. (His tone is far from believable.) \nLAWRENCE (doesn\u0092t believe a word of it) Instinct? \nADAM Yeah. \nLAWRENCE You know what? (he looks down, then back up at Adam.) You\u0092re a terrible liar. \nADAM (quiet offense) You say that like you know me. \nLAWRENCE (speaks calmly, but anger lies underneath the surface) What else aren\u0092t you telling me? \nADAM (cocky and sarcastic) Well, um, let\u0092s see. On my sixth birthday, my best friend at that time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me with a rusty nail. I didn\u0092t tell you about that. I didn\u0092t\u0092 tell you that my last girlfriend, (Lawrence lowers his head into his hands. Un-FUCKING-believable) who was a feminist vegan punk, broke up with me because she thought I was too angry. Uh, I haven\u0092t told you that one of my toenails is slightly... \nLAWRENCE (snaps at him, fed up) Just stop it. You knew to turn off these lights. \nADAM (turning away from Lawrence) What-ever. \nLAWRENCE (stands up, frustrated.) I\u0092m dealing with a juvenile. \nADAM (has had it, looks right at him) You wanna know? \nLAWRENCE (exasperated) Yeah! \nAdam leans down and reaches into the bathtub, pulls out and holds up the picture of Alison and Diana. \nADAM (he shrieks in pain and shock) Jesus Christ!! \nLawrence\u0092s reaction is not one of concern; he simply can\u0092t believe that Adam just screwed up the plan. \nLAWRENCE (disbelief) What? \nADAM (wide eyed) I just got electrocuted! \nLAWRENCE What? (he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. He speaks in a hushed tone.) That was our way out! \nAdam looks at him in shock, cannot believe Lawrence would think he\u0092d make something like that up. \nADAM (yelling at him) Did you hear what I said? (he desperately grabs at the manacle around his ankle, pulling at it and shrieking) Get this thing off me! Get it off! \nLAWRENCE (pissed off) Stop acting! \nADAM (stops pulling at the manacle and chains; now he\u0092s pissed at Lawrence for his disbelief) You think I would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade? \nLAWRENCE (gives up on Adam, frustrated once more) All right, that\u0092s it! (He leans over and picks up his saw, sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, just sits back against the wall, breathing heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues to franticly saw, but it doesn\u0092t work. He gets pissed off and throws the blade down.) Ah, Damn it!! \nBack to Adam, still looking dazed. Suddenly, a look of realization dawns upon his face. The electrocution has jogged his memory. \nADAM (wide-eyed) I remember everything now. (Lawrence glances over at him.) I remember how I got here. \nFlashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty. \nAdam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the parking garage with his hand over his eyes. \nThe camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to black, industrial music playing over the shot. \nCut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadn\u0092t meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter, presses the on button but it doesn\u0092t work. Pissed, he shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesn\u0092t work. He looks at it, scoffs. \nADAM Great. \nSuddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but trying to be brave. \nADAM Is someone there? (he takes a picture, the flash lighting up the area in front of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another picture, the flash lighting up a living room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping away for light.) \nZep puts the phone up to Alison\u0092s ear. \nALISON Larry? \nLAWRENCE Ally? Is that you? (We see a shot of Alison giving a threatening look through her tears to Zep.) \nALISON Is Adam there? \nLAWRENCE (surprised, looks to Adam, who continues to watch him worriedly) How do you know? Ally, what is going on? \nALISON (through her sobs, trying to calm them and get this message to him) Don\u0092t believe Adam\u0092s lies. He knows you. He knew all about you before today. (Zep quickly takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the phone.) \nLAWRENCE (a dial tone is heard from the other end hanging up. Lawrence is desperate) Hello? Ally? Ally? (No answer, just the dial tone. He stands up.) Hello? (He looks to the surveillance camera, screaming) God damn you! If you so much as lay a finger on them, I\u0092ll kill you! You hear me? You son of a bitch! I\u0092ll kill you! (He sits down, leaning forward over the floor, crying a bit. He slams his fist fiercely against the floor.) \nADAM (quietly, as though cautiously approaching a dangerous animal) Are they okay? \nLAWRENCE (sits up. His voice is calmer, but rage is clearly underneath the surface) My wife, she uh, she mentioned your name. \nADAM (a brief Oh shit look appears in his eyes, but he acts surprised) What did she say? \nLAWRENCE (not looking at him yet. Speaks very firmly, trying to suppress his rage.) She told me...not to believe you. \nADAM (cannot even look at Lawrence.) Believe me about what? (There is no doubt he\u0092s hiding something) \nLAWRENCE (Finally turns to look at him, the look of 1000 deaths) She told me you knew me. (He stands, looming menacingly, the look stronger on his face) Who are you? \nADAM (still trying to cover up and losing, still not making eye contact) You know who I am. \nLAWRENCE (snaps, shouting at him) Stop the lies! You\u0092re a liar! I need to know the truth! \nADAM (His tone changes, he\u0092s had it with hiding, had it with Lawrence) I\u0092m a liar? (Finally, he looks up, right at Lawrence. His voice is firm and accusing.) What did you do last night, Lawrence? Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital. \nLAWRENCE (defensively) That\u0092s because it\u0092s the truth. \nADAM (almost deadly) No it\u0092s not. Your wife is right, Larry. (Lawrence is now the one wearing the Oh shit look.) You don\u0092t recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot? \nBrief flashback shot of Lawrence in the parking garage, pausing and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera flashed. We see a shot of Adam holding the camera and taking the shot from around a corner, ducking back behind the column. Lawrence looks up at the flash, startled. \nThe voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy. It is unidentifiable; it could be either Tapp or Zep, or someone else. It is very accusing. \nVOICE I know what you\u0092re doing...Doctor. \nLAWRENCE I- (but the other person hangs up, and a dial tone is heard) \nLawrence hangs up the phone, turns and moves to the door. Carla moves with him, watching, waiting for him to say who it was. \nLAWRENCE (nervous) I have to go. \nCARLA What happened? \nLAWRENCE I\u0092ve got to go. (He picks up his briefcase from the chair, and heads out the door. \nCut to the underground parking lot, the same shot as where Adam took Lawrence\u0092s picture. He walks along, pauses to wince and cover his eyes, then the flash. He looks up startled. \nThe shot cuts back to Lawrence leaning forward against the wall in his corner, hand against a pipe. He slowly looks up at Adam, thinking of something. \nLAWRENCE Who was it? \nADAM Who was what? \nLAWRENCE The person who paid you to follow me, who was it? \nADAM (internal shrug) He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money up front. Two hundred bucks a night. If I\u0092d have known I was gonna end up here, I would\u0092ve asked for a hell of a lot more. \nLAWRENCE (pissy) What does that mean? Does that mean you saw what happened to me? \nADAM (internal eye roll; speaks as though he\u0092s been over this 100 times before) What I saw was you get into your car. That\u0092s it. I didn\u0092t ask your name. I didn\u0092t know who you were. I don\u0092t know how I got here, I don\u0092t know how you got here. I just took the shots (As he speaks, a quick flashback of Adam taking a picture, going up apartment stairs, then in the darkroom) and went straight home to develop the. Next thing I know I\u0092m chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at the guy I\u0092ve been taking shots of all night. \nLAWRENCE (seeing a major break in this mystery) Clearly, whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here. \nADAM (they don\u0092t know that for sure) Maybe. \nLAWRENCE Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course it is! What did he look like? \nADAM (internal shrug) I don\u0092t know, he was just a guy. (Shot of inside Adam\u0092s apartment and an unidentifiable figure towards the back of the room, the image darkened so we can\u0092t make him out. The figure slowly takes a step towards us/Adam) \nA pause, then Lawrence collapses onto the floor. He\u0092s lost the last of any strength, level headedness or control he had before. \nLAWRENCE (weakly) How did I get here? (Adam sits down on the pipe in his corner, leaning forward a bit.) I had...I had everything in order. (he lays down on his side, facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy) My whole life was in perfect order. (He holds up and looks at the picture of Alison and Diana gagged.) \nCut to the Gordons\u0092 Bedroom. Zep puts Alison\u0092s gag back on her, then leaves the room. Alison moves her head around to loosen the gag then spits it out. She tries to fight her sobs as she speaks softly to Diana. \nALISON Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes her head no) Mommy just needs you to be really, really, really strong right now. I\u0092m not gonna let anybody hurt you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, that\u0092s my good girl. (She starts crying as her hands work behind her to loosen the rope around them.) \nCut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance camera, sitting on the floor. Adam\u0092s next line is a voice over over this shot. \nADAM Hey, was there someone else at your house last night besides your wife and daughter? \nLAWRENCE (on camera) No. \nADAM (still on camera) Well, there\u0092s someone here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, whosits up, picks it up and looks at it. After a moment, the shot cuts back to a regular view of them, in the room.) \nLAWRENCE (realization) I know him. (We see the photo as well. It is a shot looking up into Lawrence\u0092s window, with Zep standing there, looking out, completely unaware of his picture being taken.) Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. The shot goes back and forth between him as his eyes widen while Lawrence makes his threats.) His name is Zep. He\u0092s an orderly at my hospital. (his voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. You perverted little psychopath. I\u0092m gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck! \nSuddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with a very worried look. He points up to it. \nADAM Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads at 6:00.) We\u0092re out of time. \nDIANA (crying) Mommy help me! \nAlison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly replaces Diana\u0092s gag and then her own, and resumes her position with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes his head sadly. He speaks calmly. \nZEP Dr. Gordon\u0092s time is up. Now I\u0092ve gotta do what I\u0092ve gotta do, and...I\u0092m afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed. (He undoes her gag, holds the phone to her head and his gun in front of her chest.) \nQuick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it. \nLAWRENCE (speaking quickly, the growling voice) Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam gets up from his corner, moves forward slightly) I know its you, you son of a bitch! \nALISON Larry? \nLAWRENCE (his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced with worry) Ally? \nCut into the bedroom. \nThe struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming. \nTAPP Freeze! \nZep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesn\u0092t hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zep\u0092s head. Zep clutches the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can only imagine what he\u0092s hearing. \nBack to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more. \nTAPP (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck? \nZep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand. \nBack to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapp\u0092s head. The blow stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen. \nZEP Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! (His breathing is fast, desperate. He clutches the wound on his leg.) I\u0092m gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming. \nBack to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. He\u0092s just a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adam\u0092s eyes widen and he starts to panic. \nADAM Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes out of Lawrence\u0092s mouth as the electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence is out.) Lawrence, get up! \nCUT TO Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they can. \nCut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what to do, panicking. Lawrence can\u0092t be dead, he can\u0092t be alone in here. He can\u0092t handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him. \nADAM (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! Get up! I need you! (He leans down and finds a piece of debris on the floor, throws it at Lawrence. It doesn\u0092t hit him. He leans down, picks up another, throws it. This one bounces onto the floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence starts to move more, reaching for his head and sitting up. Adam cries out in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead! \nLAWRENCE (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he electrocuted me... \nADAM I told you! The same thing happened to me, see? I wasn\u0092t lying, see? \nLawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. Suddenly, he snaps. \nLAWRENCE (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!! \nBack in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it. \nIn the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall. \nBack to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former detective. \nBack in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks at it. Adam watches him in terror. \nADAM (screaming/crying) What are you doing?! (Lawrence crawls on farther, towards the body.) \nCut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapp\u0092s chest. Tapp remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down backwards onto the floor. Zep is still on his knees, holding the gun up at a diagonal. Tapp\u0092s eyes flutter, then finally close. Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down another hall. \nBack in the bathroom, Lawrence reaches the body. He takes the gun, opens the chamber. \nADAM What are you...(He suddenly realizes Lawrence\u0092s intentions. His eyes go wide, and he starts to cry out and beg.) \nADAM Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence don\u0092t! (Lawrence puts the bullet in, then closes the chamber) No! Lawrence, please, I\u0092m begging you! (Lawrence aims the gun at Adam) Lawrence, it\u0092s not me who did this to you! \nLAWRENCE (looking like Death, his voice hoarse) You have to die. \nADAM (His hands up in front of him defensively, moving side to side to try to throw off Lawrence\u0092s aim) No, I want to live! \nLAWRENCE (moving the gun along with Adam\u0092s movements) I\u0092m sorry... \nADAM I want to live! \nLAWRENCE My family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, hitting Adam in the upper chest area. Adam falls down forward onto the floor, his screams stop.) \nLawrence collapses, sobbing. Then he sits up a bit, turning to the surveillance camera and screaming. \nLAWRENCE I\u0092ve done it! Now show them to me! (he continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down with his forehead to the floor.) \nCut to the Gordon\u0092s neighbors\u0092 living room. Alison paces back and forth, holding a cell phone to her ear. Two neighbors sit off to the side on a couch with Diana. \nNEIGHBOR (OS, on phone) Thank you very much, Officer. \nALISON (on cell phone) Larry? \nNEIGHBOR (hanging up the phone and going over to Alison) Did you get through to him? \nALISON There\u0092s still no answer. \n", "test1_input": "LAWYER I have to ask. What were you doing last night. \nLAWRENCE (a slight hesitation, a bit of guilt in his voice. As much as he would allow.) I was seeing someone. \nLAWYER (a slight pause) Who? (Lawrence doesn\u0092t answer, just continues his pacing. The lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts down his pen.) Look, if you can\u0092t be honest with me... \nLAWRENCE (His tone quick, almost blurting) I was visiting someone. It wasn\u0092t a patient. Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. He\u0092s fucked, either way.) What am I gonna do? \nLAWYER Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later. \nCut back to the Bathroom. Lawrence, still sitting against the wall, throws down his hacksaw next to him, resting his hand against his knee. \nLAWRENCE (sighs) That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder. \nCut back to the Interrogation room, some time Later. Lawrence is sitting alone at the table. Sing comes through the door, shuts it behind him. \nSING Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up. (His voice indicates that he still believes there\u0092s more to it; he does not and will not trust Lawrence.) \nLAWRENCE Good! Can I go home now? \nSING (continuing) We have one of the victims who managed to escape. (As he speaks, we see a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass being led carefully into the room next to them and sat at a table. This is AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her clearly; she cannot see them.) Want to know if you wouldn\u0092t mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? Maybe it\u0092ll trigger something. (Tapp and an unidentified bald black man in a suit enter the room. The man guides Amanda into her chair, stands behind her against the wall. Tapp sits in a chair to her left.) \nLAWRENCE (doesn\u0092t really care) I\u0092d like to help, really, but... \nSING (cutting him off quickly, won\u0092t let him out of this that easily) Well, we\u0092d really appreciate it. She\u0092s the only one who made it. \nLAWRENCE (quietly, giving in.) Okay. \nCamera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare. \nTAPP (speaking slowly, gently) Amanda...in your own time, tell me the first thing you remember. \nWe move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting as Paul\u0092s cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up. \nAMANDA (VO) I woke up. All I could taste was blood. (The camera moves back quickly, and we see her tied to the chair, her wrists bound to the arms of the chair. She pulls against her bonds, moaning loudly, trying to speak or cry out but cannot.) And metal. \nShe continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen. \n", "test1_true": "JIGSAW (from the TV) Hello Amanda. You don\u0092t know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Here\u0092s what happens if you lose. (The video moves next to the doll, to a device like the one she\u0092s wearing attached to a mannequin head. As he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more.) The device you\u0092re wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I\u0092ll show you. \nThe video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The doll\u0092s head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to a close up of the doll. \nJIGSAW (from the TV) There is only one key to open the device. It\u0092s in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that I\u0092m not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice. \nThe video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the other and stands up quickly. That\u0092s when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her. \nThe camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda. \nAMANDA And then I saw the body. \nWe switch back into Amanda\u0092s cell. Over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. She sobs harder, hunched over him. \nQuick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of the shot. \nAMANDA There was a knife. \nBack to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. The camera moves to a shot of the man\u0092s face, when... \nHE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what she\u0092s about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands. \nA quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table in Lawrence\u0092s interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence baggie with a used syringe in it. \nSING (VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) He\u0092d been injected with an opiate overdose. He couldn\u0092t move or feel much of anything. \nLAWRENCE You mean....he was alive? \nSING (staring, nods slightly) Was. \nBack to Amanda\u0092s Interrogation room, her head still hung, still sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks \nTAPP What happened after you took it off? \nCut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell. \nAmanda\u0092 s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ she\u0092s holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth. \n", "test1_id": 837, "test2_input": "Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering at her, then speaks. \nJIGSAW Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore. \nCut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp. \nTAPP You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isn\u0092t that right, Mandy? (she nods, but doesn\u0092t look up.) Do you think that is why he picked you? (She lets out a sob, briefly nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy? \nShe finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first time. \nAMANDA (softly) He...helped me. \nAs she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks over his shoulder into Lawrence\u0092s room, right in his direction. He may not see him, but he knows he\u0092s there. The camera then cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are. \nAdam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has been listening to Lawrence\u0092s story. He looks up across to Lawrence. \nADAM (softly) Are you sure it\u0092s him? \nLAWRENCE (nods slightly) Yeah, I\u0092m sure. \nADAM (becoming a little hysterical again. He speaks accusingly) How do I know you\u0092re telling the truth? You can be the one who put me in this room! (he gesticulates as he speaks, pointing to Lawrence and himself.) \nLAWRENCE (internal eye roll, speaks slowly, as to a simpleton) I\u0092m in exactly the same situation you\u0092re in. \nADAM Wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained foot out. Shouts.) Wrong! You\u0092ve got one thing I don\u0092t: Information! (He hovers as close as he can in a threatening pose, pointing) You know who did this! (He picks up a glass shard that fell when he broke the mirror, holds it up threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either tell me what is really going on (Lawrence rolls his eyes, turns his head over to his left, away from Adam) or I\u0092ll cut you with this, you hear me? I\u0092ll cut- (But he stops short as he sees something in the glass. He flips it over, studying it, flips it back. He looks over to the mirror on the wall, studying it, thinking.) \nLawrence notices that Adam\u0092s ranting has ended, glances over at him. \nLAWRENCE What? \nADAM (looks over at Lawrence, then back at the mirror.) It\u0092s a two-way mirror. \nAdam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it as well. \nSuddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A man\u0092s voice speaks, though it doesn\u0092t sound quite the same as on the Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen. \nMAN (OS, Taunting) I can see you... \n", "test2_true": "MAN (OS. Still taunting, sounds as though on a power trip) Don\u0092t look at me. I can\u0092t help you. \nThe shot transitions from the video view of Adam back into regular view in the bathroom. Adam stands in a threatening pose to the camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \nADAM Can you hear me in there? Huh? I\u0092m having a blast. (he bends down and picks up another piece of debris from the floor) This is the most fun I\u0092ve had without lubricant. (Hums the piece of debris at the window. It makes a thwacking sound, but doesn\u0092t break. Not even a crack.) Make sure you\u0092re getting everything. (Bends down, throws picks up and throws another piece of debris. It hits, but no breakage. Leans down for another piece.) \nLAWRENCE (Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying to break the glass) That\u0092s not going to do anything. \nADAM (pauses, looks to Lawrence) You just want to leave it running on us? (the shot switches to surveillance view) \nLAWRENCE (very matter-of-fact) Well, you won\u0092t stop it. (shot switches to regular view) That\u0092s why we can\u0092t cut through these chains. It\u0092s why you won\u0092t break that glass. (he gestures to the pipe then the glass) Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him. (He appears deep in thought, starting to understand the set-up more so, figuring out the way this guy thinks. Almost admiring him. The situation may be bad, but it\u0092s a brilliant design.) \nADAM You sound like you admire this prick. \nLAWRENCE (explaining) To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is. That\u0092s how you fight disease. (He looks up at the ceiling, at the walls, around the room) Now the tape told us to find an X. That X has to be somewhere in this room. (determined) Help me find it. \nAdam does not help him look. He simply cannot believe Lawrence\u0092s calm demeanor in this situation anymore. It seems that he is almost becoming as sick of Lawrence\u0092s attitude as Lawrence is of his. He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly. \nADAM How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when your wife and kid are out there. (Shot of Lawrence looking around the room) He\u0092s got them, too. (Shot of the clock; it\u0092s now 12:05.) He could be doing anything to them right now. Are you thinking about that? \nLAWRENCE (Suddenly looks right at him, snaps angrily) I AM thinking about that. (Adam backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, his voice changes to calm but sad.) I\u0092ve been the last thing I said to my daughter. \nLawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot of a little girl\u0092s bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl is Diana. She\u0092s about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of the Gordon Household. \nThe shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. Alison\u0092s eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern. \nALISON Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes back the covers and gets up, crouching down in front of her daughter. Looking up at her, she places her hands on her daughter\u0092s arms.) Diana, Honey, can you hear me? \nDIANA (very softly, but showing almost no fear) Mommy? \nAlison reaches up and touches Diana\u0092s hair, bringing her hand down in a soft caress on Diana\u0092s cheek. \nALISON Oh, what is it, sweet pea? \nDIANA (very calmly) There\u0092s a man in my room. \nALISON (sighing, but not rudely. This is not the first time this has happened) Oh Honey, are you sure he\u0092s not just hiding in your imagination? \n", "test2_id": 838, "test3_input": "ALISON (confrontational) That is complete bullshit. (cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her side in her darkened room, clutching her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes are open, she can hear everything. We stay with her for the rest of Alison\u0092s line, her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible) I\u0092d rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least there\u0092d be some passion in it. \nLAWRENCE Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere. \nADAM She\u0092s beautiful. \nLAWRENCE Thank you. \nADAM (sighs, then looks up at Lawrence) You gonna have any more kids? \nLAWRENCE (a bit wearily, but not snobby) We\u0092ve talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, it\u0092s difficult enough to concentrate on one. (The tone of his voice indicates that maybe he\u0092s starting to realize that he should\u0092ve spent more time and attention to his daughter.) \nADAM (referring to the wallet) So where\u0092s the lucky wife? (a small smile) \nLAWRENCE There\u0092s another picture behind the one you\u0092re looking at. (Adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks) It\u0092s my favourite one because we\u0092re all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means I\u0092m always missing from the photos. \nCut to Adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. His face is blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. Cut to a shot of the photo he is holding. It is not the one Lawrence described, but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and gagged, and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. He turns the photo over, and there is a message. As he reads it, Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover. \nJIGSAW (VO) X Marks the spot. Sometimes you see more with your eyes shut. \nAdam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence. \nADAM It\u0092s uh, it\u0092s not here. \nLAWRENCE (a slight disturbance from his momentary nostalgic bliss) What? \nADAM Uh, this photo you\u0092re talking about...it\u0092s not here. \nLAWRENCE (slightly surprised, reaching out his hand for Adam to toss the wallet.) Really? Are you sure? \nADAM Yeah. (Tucking the picture in his right hand, he shifts slightly by lifting himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily putting the photograph down and tossing the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence picks up the wallet and starts looking for it, creasing his brow in concern, while Adam backs up against his wall, holding the photograph out of Lawrence\u0092s sight against a pipe he rests his arm on as he looks at the photograph.) \nLAWRENCE (disbelief, shaking his head) He...he must\u0092ve taken it. I... \nAlison\u0092s voice over is heard as he says this and continues to look through the wallet, and we hear Alison\u0092s voiceover from the scene in the main hall. \nALISON (VO) How can you walk through life pretending that you\u0092re happy? \n", "test3_true": "LAWRENCE I am happy. (He walks over to a chair, leaning over it as he puts something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. Alison stands a few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react, to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.) \nALISON (pissed) That is complete bullshit. I\u0092d rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least there\u0092d be some passion in it. \nLAWRENCE (tired of this, brushing it off as not that important, like there really is nothing wrong) We can talk about this alter, okay? (He leans in to kiss her, but she shakes her head. He pauses there.) \nALISON (firmly) Just leave. \nHe looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away and heads out the door. \nVOICE Goodnight, little girl. (camera pans up closer into the closet, and we a widened blue eye and part of a face (yet unidentifiable) watching her.) \nThe closet doors burst open and Diana screams. Cut back to the main hall where Alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. As soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her daughter\u0092s room. \nALISON Diana!? \nAlison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom. \nALISON Diana! (opens the door and flips on the light, gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over Diana\u0092s bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana and she screams, struggling against him. Alison goes for them. \nQuick cut to NOW, in Alison and Lawrence\u0092s bedroom. Waistline shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. A gun is tucked into his belt and Diana\u0092s teddy bear tucked under his arm. He saunters over to the gagged and bound Diana and Alison, on the floor and tied to a corner end of the bed. Alison, her eyes streaming tears, struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails. Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing. \nThe figure crouches down beside Diana, dropping the teddy bear behind her, his face still unseen. He takes the stethoscope and holds the end to Diana\u0092s chest. The sound of a loud, steady heartbeat is heard. Alison screams at him through her gag. \nALISON Don\u0092t do that! Leave her! Get away from her! \nHe pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. He reaches with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. Diana\u0092s screams become more desperate, Alison\u0092s more frantic, more angry. He puts the stethoscope back against Diana\u0092s chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her mother\u0092s head. We hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed. \nALISON (through her gag) Keep your motherfucking hands off of my daughter! \nHe pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back into his belt. He reaches down behind Diana and picks up the teddy bear. As he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. He holds the teddy bear out in front of Diana for a moment then tucks it in front of her. He pats her on the head and stands up, moving over to the window. He parts the curtains slightly and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. It is Zep, the orderly from the hospital. \nCut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior of the Gordon home, of the window where Zep is standing. The camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking. \nVOICE (VO as we view shot of Zep) Who are you little man...I see you...(cut to a television screen with the video of Zep in the window. Fade back and to the right as we get a view of someone\u0092s apartment. Plastered on the walls are various photographs, which we can barely make out, and a desk in the corner with some recording equipment. As we move further right and hit the window we see Detective Tapp, leaning over the camera shooting the Gordon\u0092s window, adjusting the view. Something about him seems just not right. We cut back to his view from the camera.) Does Dr. Gordon know you\u0092re at home with his wife? I know you know something. (his voice goes up a bit louder) What are you doing in there? Waiting for the doctor? I\u0092m waiting for the doctor, too. Hmm. \nCut to a view over Tapp\u0092s couch of the television with Zep on video on the screen. Tapp walks over and sits down in front of the television, his back to us. \n", "test3_id": 839}

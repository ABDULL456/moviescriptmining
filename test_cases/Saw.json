{"test1_input": "LAWRENCE (VO) He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. \nCut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaw\u0092s voice from a tape recorder play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the flashback shots. \nJIGSAW (VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If you\u0092re so sick, then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? (there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of Mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car.) Let\u0092s put your so-called illness to the test. (Flashback image of Mark waking up. He is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains. On the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches. He gets up, looking around confusedly and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is in the safe. (Black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of Mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaw\u0092s voice, as with Paul.) The combination to the safe (quick montage of several black and white crime-scene photos of numbers written all over the walls) is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step (Mark\u0092s bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor). And by the way, that\u0092s a flammable substance smeared on your body (shot of Mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere), so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you... \nMARK (huddled over the safe; screams, but it is still distant sounding) Help!!!!! \nJIGSAW (VO ct\u0092d)....or all the people you\u0092ve burned with your act (Mark starts to turn the lock on the safe) just might have their revenge. \nWe see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. The camera goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the combination into the safe. He moves in a circle, clockwise to us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up crime scene photo of Mark\u0092s charred face. \nThe shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding the tape recorder. \nKERRY I found something else. Well, two things, actually. (She moves past them and we go with her over to a wall where there is a small hole cut, about an inch or two in diameter. The light from the outside shines in.) There was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole. Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games. He was there at the last one as well. (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only this time, he left us his penlight. (She holds up the penlight in an evidence baggie, clicking it twice then handing it to Tapp.) \nTAPP (taking the baggie, studying it) Get a rush on the prints. (He hands it back to her.) \nKERRY (taking the baggie, moving out of the room) Copy that. \nCUT TO Hospital room. Lawrence in his white doctor\u0091s coat along with three blue-scrub clad medical students. A nurse in white stands off to the side. Lawrence is going over the patient\u0092s charts. He goes over to the x-ray display, pushing the light on to view two x-rays of someone\u0092s skull. He points to it with his pen as he speaks. \nLAWRENCE Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer. (He turns back to the three young medical students. One of them, a pretty Asian girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated with him.) The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining. \nIn the doorway, an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the medical students in the room, listening to what Lawrence is saying. This is Zep. He\u0092s a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking. Kindness, and something else below the surface. He glances down at John sleeping, then up at Lawrence. \nLAWRENCE The patient had... \nZEP (cutting him off) His name is John, Dr. Gordon. (He looks down at the patient, who we see is a man in his late forties-early fifties, hairless except for a small white goatee. His head is to the side and he is sleeping. On the tray table in front of him is a notebook and some colored pencils. As Zep looks at him and speaks of him, there is caring in his voice, something Dr. Gordon has yet to display regarding this patient.) He\u0092s a very interesting person. \nLawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed, not for himself but maybe for Zep. A condescending, smug smile plays across his face and he nods. His tone matches his look. \nLAWRENCE Thank you for that information, Zep. (he looks to the students, who all share his smug smile) As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, his expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface. The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, then turns away, and continues down the hall with his cart.) Continuing on, the patient.... \nBut he is cut off by a voice on the intercom. \nINTERCOM Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please page the operator. \n", "test1_true": "Cut to Lawrence\u0092s office at the hospital . Inside, Tapp is leaning against Dr. Gordon\u0092s chair, studying the various framed degrees on the wall. Sing is sitting in one of the two chairs across from the desk, twisted around in his seat to look at a couple of small picture frames on the bookshelf behind him. Lawrence opens the door and enters, and the two detectives turn to look at him. He removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the door. Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching. \nTAPP Dr. Gordon, I\u0092m Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing, City Homicide. (he gestures to the degrees on the wall.) Very impressive. \nLawrence smiles, pretending to care about what they think, truly just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste any more of his time. As he speaks, he walks over to the chair behind his desk. \nLAWRENCE Oh. Thank you, I do my best. (He sits in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next to Sing across from him. Sing studies him silently, chewing gum.) \nTAPP Sorry to interrupt you while you\u0092re working. \nLAWRENCE That\u0092s fine. Now, how can I help you gentlemen? \nTapp\u0092s tone turns a bit more serious, but still amiable enough. \nTAPP Are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor? \nLAWRENCE (his tone just barely masking his concern) Why is it that you\u0092re interested? \nTAPP We\u0092d like to ask you a few questions about it. For your sake, I think it\u0092s best if we do it down at the station. Would you like to follow us there? \nLAWRENCE (Shaking his head, this is unbelievable) No, I\u0092m afraid that\u0092s...that\u0092s quite out of the question. I can\u0092t just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today, so... \nSING (amiable but hinting that he knows something) Oh, that\u0092s okay, you can ride with us. Doc. \nLAWRENCE (chuckles uncomfortably) I\u0092m sorry, you\u0092ll have to tell me again. What is this all about? \nTapp produces the penlight from his pocket, holds it up for Dr. Gordon. \nTAPP Is this yours, Doctor? \nHe puts the penlight down on the desk. Lawrence picks it up, a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly covered up. He looks at the pen strangely. The two detectives carefully study his reaction. Lawrence looks back up at them. \nCut to the Police Station. In an interrogation room, Lawrence paces back and forth nervously, now wearing his suit jacket. His lawyer sits at the table, taking notes. \nLAWYER So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene? \nLAWRENCE Of course not! \n", "test1_id": 837, "test2_input": "LAWYER I have to ask. What were you doing last night. \nLAWRENCE (a slight hesitation, a bit of guilt in his voice. As much as he would allow.) I was seeing someone. \nLAWYER (a slight pause) Who? (Lawrence doesn\u0092t answer, just continues his pacing. The lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts down his pen.) Look, if you can\u0092t be honest with me... \nLAWRENCE (His tone quick, almost blurting) I was visiting someone. It wasn\u0092t a patient. Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. He\u0092s fucked, either way.) What am I gonna do? \nLAWYER Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later. \nCut back to the Bathroom. Lawrence, still sitting against the wall, throws down his hacksaw next to him, resting his hand against his knee. \nLAWRENCE (sighs) That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder. \nCut back to the Interrogation room, some time Later. Lawrence is sitting alone at the table. Sing comes through the door, shuts it behind him. \nSING Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up. (His voice indicates that he still believes there\u0092s more to it; he does not and will not trust Lawrence.) \nLAWRENCE Good! Can I go home now? \nSING (continuing) We have one of the victims who managed to escape. (As he speaks, we see a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass being led carefully into the room next to them and sat at a table. This is AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her clearly; she cannot see them.) Want to know if you wouldn\u0092t mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? Maybe it\u0092ll trigger something. (Tapp and an unidentified bald black man in a suit enter the room. The man guides Amanda into her chair, stands behind her against the wall. Tapp sits in a chair to her left.) \nLAWRENCE (doesn\u0092t really care) I\u0092d like to help, really, but... \nSING (cutting him off quickly, won\u0092t let him out of this that easily) Well, we\u0092d really appreciate it. She\u0092s the only one who made it. \nLAWRENCE (quietly, giving in.) Okay. \nCamera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare. \nTAPP (speaking slowly, gently) Amanda...in your own time, tell me the first thing you remember. \nWe move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting as Paul\u0092s cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up. \nAMANDA (VO) I woke up. All I could taste was blood. (The camera moves back quickly, and we see her tied to the chair, her wrists bound to the arms of the chair. She pulls against her bonds, moaning loudly, trying to speak or cry out but cannot.) And metal. \nShe continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen. \n", "test2_true": "JIGSAW (from the TV) Hello Amanda. You don\u0092t know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Here\u0092s what happens if you lose. (The video moves next to the doll, to a device like the one she\u0092s wearing attached to a mannequin head. As he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more.) The device you\u0092re wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I\u0092ll show you. \nThe video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The doll\u0092s head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to a close up of the doll. \nJIGSAW (from the TV) There is only one key to open the device. It\u0092s in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that I\u0092m not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice. \nThe video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the other and stands up quickly. That\u0092s when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her. \nThe camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda. \nAMANDA And then I saw the body. \nWe switch back into Amanda\u0092s cell. Over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. She sobs harder, hunched over him. \nQuick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of the shot. \nAMANDA There was a knife. \nBack to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. The camera moves to a shot of the man\u0092s face, when... \nHE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what she\u0092s about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands. \nA quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table in Lawrence\u0092s interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence baggie with a used syringe in it. \nSING (VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) He\u0092d been injected with an opiate overdose. He couldn\u0092t move or feel much of anything. \nLAWRENCE You mean....he was alive? \nSING (staring, nods slightly) Was. \nBack to Amanda\u0092s Interrogation room, her head still hung, still sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks \nTAPP What happened after you took it off? \nCut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell. \nAmanda\u0092 s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ she\u0092s holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth. \n", "test2_id": 838, "test3_input": "The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming. \nTAPP Freeze! \nZep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesn\u0092t hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zep\u0092s head. Zep clutches the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can only imagine what he\u0092s hearing. \nBack to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more. \nTAPP (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck? \nZep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand. \nBack to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapp\u0092s head. The blow stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen. \nZEP Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! (His breathing is fast, desperate. He clutches the wound on his leg.) I\u0092m gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming. \nBack to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. He\u0092s just a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adam\u0092s eyes widen and he starts to panic. \nADAM Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes out of Lawrence\u0092s mouth as the electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence is out.) Lawrence, get up! \nCUT TO Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they can. \nCut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what to do, panicking. Lawrence can\u0092t be dead, he can\u0092t be alone in here. He can\u0092t handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him. \nADAM (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! Get up! I need you! (He leans down and finds a piece of debris on the floor, throws it at Lawrence. It doesn\u0092t hit him. He leans down, picks up another, throws it. This one bounces onto the floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence starts to move more, reaching for his head and sitting up. Adam cries out in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead! \nLAWRENCE (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he electrocuted me... \nADAM I told you! The same thing happened to me, see? I wasn\u0092t lying, see? \nLawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. Suddenly, he snaps. \nLAWRENCE (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!! \nBack in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it. \nIn the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall. \n", "test3_true": "Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains standing. If he got hit, it isn\u0092t clear where. Zep then turns and quickly hobbles further down the hall. \nCut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing. \nLAWRENCE No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries loudly.) \nADAM (Frightened but trying to stay calm for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. There must be a way out of this! (It seems to be a complete role reversal for the two of them from the beginning, where Adam was the one freaking out and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, who has just lost it.) \nLAWRENCE (screaming) I can\u0092t be calm! My family needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, still can\u0092t get the phone. He quickly turns and sits up, grabbing the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage. Adam\u0092s hands are up clutching his head, trying to keep his cool but having a very hard time.) \nADAM (Loudly trying to speak over Lawrence\u0092s continued loud, primal screams.) Lawrence, I have a family too! I don\u0092t see them, that\u0092s my mistake. It\u0092s a mistake I\u0092d like to fix! \nCut to Zep hobbling down the hall. Tapp is there running after him. Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up. \nTAPP I\u0092m gonna kill you you sick asshole! \nBack in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more. \nADAM (desperate, losing his attempted calm stance) Lawrence, stop it! \nLawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too slow, however, so he starts to rip it open. \nADAM (sobs in his voice) Lawrence, please calm down! There\u0092s a way out of here, there\u0092s a way out! \nLawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely loses it and freaks out, screaming. \nADAM Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you doing?! \nLawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrence\u0092s shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming and wincing. \nBack to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall. \nBack to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck and shirt. \nBack to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of twisted glee is upon Tapp\u0092s face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, trying to take the gun. \nBack in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward a bit. \n", "test3_id": 839}

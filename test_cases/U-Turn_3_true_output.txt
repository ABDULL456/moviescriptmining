BLIND MAN You know I won't be seeing you. 
The Blind Man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if he sees. We don't really know. He reaches into the cup and pulls out the coin Bobby tossed in. 
BLIND MAN Cheap bastard. Gives me back my own money... Well, Jesse, time's up, let's go for a walk. 
The Blind Man now stands up and pulls the seeing-eye dog's harness. The DOG struggles to its feet and they walk off down the street together. 
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT 
GRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock. JAKE yells to her from another room. 
JAKE(O.C.) What the hell you doin', Grace?  Are you coming to bed, or aren't you? 
For a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock.  Suddenly, like a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt. Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the bedroom. 
EXT. YARD - MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT 
A LIGHT is on in the bedroom window.  After a moment it dims and the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight. BOBBY steps into frame, carrying an iron pipe. 
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 
We start close on GRACE -- a KEY slapping against her buttocks as bedsprings groan.  We reveal Grace copulating on all fours with JAKE from behind. 
JAKE Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best. 
GRACE Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please. 
JAKE You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl! 
GRACE Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa! 
JAKE You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone. 
GRACE No! No! Please! 
He hits her. Harder. 
In a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees Grace's MAMA beneath him, receiving his punishment. 
He stops, abruptly. He can't go on. Fear coming into his eyes. He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or forgiveness. 
JAKE Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... (he starts to cry) I didn't mean to hurt you so bad. It just...got away... 
He drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs. 
JAKE Forgive me, baby, forgive me! 
He hides there from the world that he has created, crying to himself. 
Grace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a new occurrence in their strange relationship. 
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BACKDOOR - NIGHT 
The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens.  BOBBY slips quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the door behind him.  It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no bearings.  He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only to catch it just before it crashes into the floor. 
INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 
JAKE hears the noise.  He raises his head and cocks an ear to the air. She knows who it is, and is concerned; he's too early. 
GRACE What's the matter? 
JAKE You didn't hear something? 
GRACE Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass. 
JAKE There's someone in the house. 
GRACE (nervous) Maybe...maybe the wind blew something over (encouraging him to continue). Come on baby, keep going. 
Jake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark metallic OBJECT. 
GRACE (realizing) What's that? Jake -- where's you get that? 
JAKE Relax baby. Stay here. 
He goes to the door. She follows, tries to block the door. 
GRACE Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff. 
JAKE Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...

He came to fuck an angel. (giggles at that) I'm his dirty angel. Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up. 
CHLOE 
He grabbed me by the hair while I sucked him and usually I love that, I just do -- maybe you can tell me why I love it so much -- but not this time, he was just too rough -- As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS.      A visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock. 
MIRANDA 
That's it until Monday. Try and get some sleep tonight, okay? 
CHLOE 
Sure, Doctor. (leans in) Crazy people hear messages from God. Not the Devil. You know that, right? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
I didn't say you were crazy. 
CHLOE 
You don't have to say it. She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this. Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the asylum. 
INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER 
Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches. 
PETE 
Dr. Grey. 
MIRANDA 
Dr. Graham. They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other.      A lot. 
PETE

MIRANDA 
(knows what's coming) Same here. 
PETE 
It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, you know? 
MIRANDA

PETE 
What am I afraid of? 
MIRANDA 
Yourself. At least you should be. What are you up to this weekend? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETE 
Write a little country music, decline invites to grand social events, drink myself to sleep -- the usual. You? 
MIRANDA 
Doug wants to look at some Real Estate up at Willow's Creek. 
PETE 
Again? 
MIRANDA 
He thinks it's fun. 
PETE 
So is golfing, I'm told.   Who was your six o'clock? 
MIRANDA 
Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying to empty the ocean with a tea cup. She's a mess. 
PETE 
I hear Manhattan's full of them. 
MIRANDA 
Don't start with that. I already turned down the job. We're staying. 
PETE 
Good girl. They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's, distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to exit when he covers the mouthpiece --

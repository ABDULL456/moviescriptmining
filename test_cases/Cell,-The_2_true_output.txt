NOVAK Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all... 
Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear something moving inside. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) How's the patient. 
MIRIAM Awaiting his arrival. 
NOVAK What about the cat? 
MIRIAM Completely unaware. 
Miriam's pager BEEPS and she hurries to her car. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) I've got to go.  Good luck. 
Novak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban. 
INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE 
As Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a KNOCK at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting. 
NOVAK Ready? 
Catherine cradles her cat. 
CATHERINE Ready. 
He opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the living room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides under the couch. 
NOVAK That went well. 
CATHERINE Give her a minute. (smiles at the dog) Hello, Valentine. 
Novak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine, licking her face, wagging his tail. 
NOVAK You sure about this? 
CATHERINE Absolutely. (calling for the cat) Abigail... 
Valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base of the sofa. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) I heard Julia and John got married. 
NOVAK Yep.  Eloped. 
CATHERINE Good for them. 
Valentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's nose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort. 
NOVAK Well look at that. 
CATHERINE I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them... 
NOVAK So you say. 
Amazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs. 
CATHERINE He's mine? 
NOVAK All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had. 
Catherine laughs.  She likes that.

{"train": "\"Cruel Intentions\", by Roger Kumble \nCRUEL INVENTIONS \nby Roger Kumble \nbased on the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses \nby Choderlos De Laclos \nFebruary 10, 1998 \n1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1 \nWe circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM into a window. \n2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2 \nA fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and Freud line the shelves. \nA young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient. \nThe therapist continues to write notes. \nDR. GREENBAUM Jesus. We've been at this for six months. \nSEBASTIAN I know. \nDR. GREENBAUM And you haven't made an ounce of progress. \nSEBASTIAN I know. \nSebastian takes out a cigarette. \nDR. GREENBAUM (not looking up) There's no smoking in my office. \nSebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr. Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking her head. \nSEBASTIAN What do you want me to say? That I'm supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do? The truth is I don't. \nDr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Look, I'm not like all the other kids in high school. I don't care about book reports and extra-credit. Teachers are idiots anyway. The only challenge out there for me is women. You see a girl you like. You pursue them. You conquer. You move on. It's exciting. \nDR. GREENBAUM But you said you have the worst reputation. \nSEBASTIAN I do. \nDR. GREENBAUM Don't you want to change that? \nSEBASTIAN Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to \"save me.\" The trick is to let them think it's true. \nDR. GREENBAUM I think that's all the time we have for today. \nSEBASTIAN Same time next week? \nDR. GREENBAUM No. This is going to be our last session. \nSEBASTIAN Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. \nDR. GREENBAUM This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. \nSEBASTIAN Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help. \nSebastian picks up a book of Freud. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) He was a coke addict, you know. \nDR. GREENBAUM You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian. \nSEBASTIAN It works a little. \nDR. GREENBAUM No it doesn't. I see right through you. \nSEBASTIAN You do? \nDR. GREENBAUM I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble. \nSEBASTIAN Well, you don't have to get nasty about it. \nSebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up. \nDR. GREENBAUM My daughter, Rachel. \nCLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish. \nCLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice roll. \n7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7 \nCLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi through several doors until we enter the final door leading into - \n8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8 \nA enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel. \nSOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi in front of - \nKATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her face and listens attentively as - \nBUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt with a Koala Bear on it. \nMRS. CALDWELL I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. \nKATHRYN I'll do my best. \nSook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese) Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be all. \nSook-Hee leaves. \nCECILE What was that? \nKATHRYN I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language. \nMRS. CALDWELL (cont'd) Kathryn is a straight A student at Oakwood as well as being President of the French Club. Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far. \nKATHRYN (in French) You're too kind. \nMRS. CALDWELL How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength? \nKATHRYN I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... (takes out her crucifix) turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works. \nMRS. CALDWELL That's beautiful. \nCECILE What are the boys like? \nMRS. CALDWELL Cecile, is that the best you can do? (to Kathryn) You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before. \nKATHRYN Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples. \nMRS. CALDWELL Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse. \nSEBASTIAN (O.S.) I hear she's recovering quite well. \nMrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the doorway. He walks over and takes a seat. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell. \nMRS. CALDWELL You remember my daughter, Cecile. \nSEBASTIAN My, what an adorable shirt you're wearing. \nCECILE My father just took me on a trip to Australia. \nSEBASTIAN How are things down under? Blossoming I hope. \nKATHRYN Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall. \nSEBASTIAN Outstanding. \nCECILE What year are you in? \nSEBASTIAN I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. \nCECILE But I thought high school is only four years. \nSEBASTIAN It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself. \nHe winks at Cecile. \nMRS. CALDWELL I think we'll be going now. (to Kathryn) Thanks for all your help. \nKathryn stands and approaches Cecile. \nKATHRYN I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum. \n12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12 \nKATHRYN In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent. \nSEBASTIAN You don't mean? \n13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13 \nCecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat. \nKATHRYN (V.O.) None other than Cecile Caldwell. \nShe takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone. She mouths the word \"shoot\" and stomps her feet \n14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14 \nSebastian snickers. \nKATHRYN I don't find this very funny, \nSEBASTIAN So that's what this is all about. (imitating Kathryn) We'll get together and plan your curriculum. \nKATHRYN Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered. \nSEBASTIAN Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court? \nKATHRYN Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way. \nSEBASTIAN I see your point... though why should I care? \nKATHRYN I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery. \nSEBASTIAN Sounds intriguing. \nKATHRYN She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie. \nSebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his lips. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Be her Captain Picard, Valmont. Boldly go where no man has gone before. \nSebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then: \nSEBASTIAN I can't. \nKathryn throws his hand off of hers. \nKATHRYN Why not? \nSEBASTIAN Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. \"But I thought high school was only four years.\" I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold. \nKATHRYN Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge? \nSEBASTIAN That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius. \nHe takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn picks it up. It's the latest issue of \"Seventeen.\" \nKATHRYN I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas. \nSEBASTIAN Shut up and turn to page 64. \nShe turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. \"Why I Plan To Wait Until Marriage,\" by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas City, Missouri. \nKATHRYN Jesus Christ, is she for real? \nSEBASTIAN Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue. \nKATHRYN B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. \nSEBASTIAN It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory. \nKATHRYN You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league. \nSEBASTIAN Care to make a wager on that? \nKATHRYN I'll think about it... \nSEBASTIAN Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art. \nHe holds up a leather bound JOURNAL. \nKATHRYN Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer? \nSEBASTIAN Could you be more desperate to read it? \nAunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette. \n17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17 \nSebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper, FRANKLIN stands by the trap. \nSEBASTIAN Pull! \nThe TARGET soars into the air, \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Die motherfucker! \nHe fires the gun, missing the target. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Shit, shit, shit. \nFranklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian perks up. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Kitty. Kitty. \nHe quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW again. Sebastian searches for the cat. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss. \nHe raises his rifle and takes aim. \nAUNT HELEN (O.S.) Sebastian! \nHe lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and Annette riding over to him. He waves. \nAunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) I've been looking all over for you. God, I've missed you. \nAUNT HELEN I've missed you too. How are your parents? \nSEBASTIAN They're coming back next week. I write them everyday. \nShe strokes his cheek, lovingly. \nAUNT HELEN Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison. She's going to be staying with me for a few weeks. \nSEBASTIAN I guess that makes two of us. Welcome. \nHe extends his hand and they shake. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) (to Aunt Helen) Why don't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours? We'll take care of the horses. \nAUNT HELEN Anything for you, my dear. \nSebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse. \nAUNT HELEN (cont'd) Stay out of trouble you two. \nSEBASTIAN & ANNETTE We will. \nHe smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow. \n18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18 \nSebastian and Annette put the riding gear away. \nSEBASTIAN So what year are you going into? \nANNETTE Junior. \nSEBASTIAN Got a boyfriend back home? \nANNETTE No. \nSEBASTIAN Why not? \nANNETTE I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies. \nSEBASTIAN You a lesbo? \nANNETTE (annoyed) No. \nShe bends over to pick up the saddle. \nSEBASTIAN Nice. \nShe sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him. \nRONALD (cont'd) You're concentrating too much on your bowing. Let it flow. \nHe stands and sits behind her. \nRONALD (cont'd) Here, let me help you. \nHe places his hand over hers. \nRONALD (cont'd) Now close your eyes and let's try again. \nShe closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's face. It's obvious he's smitten with her. \nON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses her face. \nRonald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual. \nON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground. \nRonald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray \nKATHRYN I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Your playing was beautiful. \nRonald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile \nCECILE Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's giving me music lessons over the summer. \nRonald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand. \nRONALD Pleased to meet you. \nKATHRYN Likewise I'm sure. \nCECILE Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera. \nRONALD It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King. \nCECILE Doctor King is my favorite. \nRonald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes. \nRONALD I guess our hour's up. Same time tomorrow? \nCecile nods. \n20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20 \nAnother nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside. \n21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21 \nA typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art. \nBLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds from his stash. \nSebastian paces behind him. \nSEBASTIAN Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense - \nBLAINE - none taken - \nSEBASTIAN - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me. \nBLAINE Any ideas who it could be? \nSEBASTIAN Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now. \nBLAINE Where did you say she's from? \nSEBASTIAN Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas? \nBLAINE Greg McConnell. \nSEBASTIAN The football stud? \nBLAINE He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat. \nSEBASTIAN It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year. \nBLAINE I don't think that bothered him. \nSEBASTIAN What do you mean? \nBLAINE Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. \nKATHRYN Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you. \nCECILE Is it that obvious? \nKathryn nods. \nCECILE (cont'd) He sends me letters you know. Love letters. \nKATHRYN That's so romantic. Have you responded? \nCECILE No. \nKATHRYN Well do you like him? \nCECILE I don't know. \nKATHRYN Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me. \nCECILE (beat) I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. \nCecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her. \nCECILE (cont'd) What am I going to do? If my mother found out about Ronald she would kill me. \nKathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye. \nKATHRYN Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. \nCECILE Okay. \nKATHRYN Did you hide the letters? \nCECILE Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. \nKATHRYN I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. \nCECILE Why? \nKATHRYN Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. \nCECILE You'd do that for me? \nKATHRYN Of course I would. We're friends, right? \nCECILE Best friends. \nCecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn. \n23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23 \nLittle touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother) adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony. \n24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24 \nAnnette steps onto the balcony. \nHER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and singing Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" in German. \nANNETTE (calling out) Excuse me. Excuse me! \nSEBASTIAN You talking to me? \nANNETTE Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read. \nSEBASTIAN What'cha reading? \nANNETTE The Fountainhead. \nSEBASTIAN Great book. \nANNETTE (skeptical) You've read The Fountainhead? \nSEBASTIAN Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. \nANNETTE Romantic? He rapes her. \nSEBASTIAN That's a matter of opinion. \nANNETTE You need help. \nSEBASTIAN Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it. \nANNETTE At this hour? I don't think so. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Have a nice sleep last night? \nANNETTE It was fine. \nSEBASTIAN I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night. \nANNETTE I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends. \nSEBASTIAN Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the \"on\" button to \"off.\" The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me. \nAnnette stops running and turns to him. \nANNETTE And that's a bad thing? \nSEBASTIAN I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away. \nANNETTE I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. \nSEBASTIAN Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you. \nANNETTE You don't even know me. \nSEBASTIAN Don't you believe in love at first sight? \nANNETTE Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual. \nSEBASTIAN Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning? \nANNETTE I can't. I'm seeing a friend. \nSEBASTIAN Who? \nANNETTE That's none of your business. \nSEBASTIAN How about tonight? \nANNETTE I'm busy. \nSEBASTIAN Doing what? \nANNETTE That's also none of your business. \nSEBASTIAN Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind. \nANNETTE You truly want to do something to make me happy? \nSEBASTIAN Yes. \nANNETTE And you promise to abide by it? \nSEBASTIAN Without question. \nANNETTE Alright. (beat) I want you to leave and go back to New York. \nSEBASTIAN What? \nANNETTE If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends. \nSebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed. \nSEBASTIAN I'll leave this afternoon. Happy? \nANNETTE It's not about being happy. You and I can't - \nHe shifts the cart into reverse and backs away. \n31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31 \nAnnette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the ocean. \nGREG He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before. \nANNETTE Really? I thought he said it all the time. \nGREG That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth. \nAnnette looks lost. \nGREG (cont'd) What's wrong? \nANNETTE Nothing. \nGREG Is there a mutual feeling between you two? \nSEBASTIAN Do you know what it's about? \nMORA Who cares. Books are for fags. \nSEBASTIAN Books are for fags. I weep for the future. \n39   EXT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        39 \nEstablishing shot. \n40   INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        40 \nA SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a beautiful dress. \nSALESWOMAN Here's something you might like. \nKathryn examines the label. \nKATHRYN Do you carry any real fur? \nSALESWOMAN No. All our fur is faux. \nKATHRYN Of course. The animals. How silly of me. \nThe saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers then looks over at a small child, staring at her. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) (mouthing the words) Fuck off. \nShe \"shoos\" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell approaches. \nMRS. CALDWELL I got your message and came as quick as I could. \nKATHRYN I hope I didn't keep you from something. \nMRS. CALDWELL Not at all. What's wrong? \nKATHRYN It's Cecile. \nMRS. CALDWELL What about her? \nKATHRYN Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and... \nMRS. CALDWELL Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it? \nKATHRYN It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher. \nMRS. CALDWELL Ronald? That's crazy. \nKATHRYN I know. She's so young and he's so - \nMRS. CALDWELL Black. \nKathryn reacts to her remark. \nKATHRYN He's been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house. I questioned whether or not to tell you, but something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and I don't want to see her get hurt. \nKathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales counter. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) I hope I did the right thing in telling you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things with Court. \nMRS. CALDWELL I can't thank you enough. \nKATHRYN You will be discreet about this? \nMRS. CALDWELL Absolutely. \nSALESWOMAN Will that be cash or charge? \nKathryn looks through her purse. \nKATHRYN Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home. \nMrs. Caldwell takes out her purse. \nMRS. CALDWELL Let me get that for you. \nKATHRYN Oh please. I can't have you do that. \nMRS. CALDWELL It's the least I can do. \nMrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman. Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell. \nKATHRYN Thank you. \nKATHRYN Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy. \nShe hands Ronald a pen and paper. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Now you just march yourself into the study and start writing. We'll be there to check on you in a minute. \nRonald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while Kathryn picks up the phone and dials. \nSEBASTIAN Who are you calling? \nKATHRYN Cecile. \nSebastian hangs up the phone. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) What are you doing? \nSEBASTIAN Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause. \nKATHRYN I'm aware. \nShe picks up the phone and he hangs it up again. \nSEBASTIAN Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that. \nKATHRYN What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience. \nShe reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on it. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Court Renolds is going down and if you're not going to help me, someone else will. \nSEBASTIAN You amaze me. \nKATHRYN Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a \"laaaady.\" Do you think I take great delight when I hear - \"Kathryn is so wonderful.\" \"Kathryn is a model child.\" \"Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day.\" (beat) I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? \nSebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and dials. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright, stop crying. I understand. Hold on for Sebastian. \nShe hands the phone to Sebastian. \nSEBASTIAN Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me very carefully. I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you. Now I can't exactly bring it to your house, since your mother despises me so here's what we're going to do. \n44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44 \nThe clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it, dressed in sweats. \n45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45 \nCecile exits a building and steps into a waiting taxi. \n46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46 \nCecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter while Sebastian fiddles with a camera. \nCECILE Finished. \nShe hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over. \nSEBASTIAN Excellent. \nCECILE You think he'll like it? \nSEBASTIAN He'll love it. \nHe points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo. \nCECILE What are you doing? \nSEBASTIAN Just taking your photo. \nCECILE I look terrible. \nSEBASTIAN Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off. \nCecile gasps. \nCECILE I'm getting out of here. \nShe stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path. \nSEBASTIAN I'm sorry that was out of line. \nCECILE (scared) I want to go home. \nMRS. CALDWELL I didn't know you'd be here, Sebastian. \nSEBASTIAN I wasn't planning on it, but being such a lovely day, why waste it in the city. Anyone for tennis? \nHe looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket. \nCecile stands and rushes into the house. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) What's wrong with her? \nNo one knows. \nMRS. CALDWELL (cont'd) Would you excuse me for a minute? \nMrs. Caldwell follows her into the house. \nSEBASTIAN (concerned) I hope she's alright. \nAUNT HELEN I better go check on them. \nAunt Helen stands and enters the house. \nSEBASTIAN Alone again. (beat) What are you up to today? \nANNETTE I'm doing some volunteer work. \nSEBASTIAN Need any company? \nANNETTE You? Volunteer? I don't think so. \nSEBASTIAN I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive. \nANNETTE (smiling) Okay. \nSEBASTIAN Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa. \nAnnette shakes her head and laughs. \n50   INT.

RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - DAY                       53 \nA NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall. \nNURSE It's really nice when the young people help out. Most of our patients don't have any family nearby. \nThey stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his hospital bed. \nNURSE (cont'd) Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for you. \nSebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops him. \nNURSE (cont'd) Actually Sebastian, you're going to be spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman. \nThe Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the hall. Annette waves \"bye bye\" to him. \n54   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MR. GOTTLIEB'S ROOM - DAY           54 \nAnnette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book of poetry. \n55   INT.

SUGERMAN Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me - \nSEBASTIAN Yes, you already did. \nShe nods. He points to her book. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Great book. What's the guy's name, Florentino... \nANNETTE Florentino Ariza. \nSebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles around. \nSEBASTIAN My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. \nANNETTE Who's Monsieur Philipe? \nSEBASTIAN You don't know Monsieur Philipe? \nSebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) (low voice) Bonjour mademoiselle. \nANNETTE (laughs) Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. \nSEBASTIAN (Monsieur Philipe voice) You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. \nThe puppet kisses her on the cheek. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) (Monsieur Philipe voice) Oooo, that felt good. \nANNETTE Thank you. \nHe kisses her on the cheek. \nSEBASTIAN (Monsieur Philipe voice) That felt good too. I will kiss you all over. \nThe puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian tickles her back. \nThey roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she pushes him off her. \nSebastian stands. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) I'm sorry about that. \nANNETTE I am too. \nHe paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger. \nSEBASTIAN You know what? I don't take it back. \nANNETTE Why are you doing this? \nSEBASTIAN Because I'm in love with you. \nANNETTE I thought you said we were going to be friends. \nSEBASTIAN I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me! \nANNETTE I have feelings for you. \nSEBASTIAN Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus. \nANNETTE That's not fair. \nSEBASTIAN Why can't we be together? \nAnnette's eyes well up with tears. \nANNETTE You really want to know? \nSEBASTIAN Yes. \nANNETTE It's because I don't trust myself with you. (beat) I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. \nShe hurries off. \n61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61 \nSebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him. \nSEBASTIAN (frustrated) Shit. \nHe hears the shower running from the bathroom. \n62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62 \nSebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out from the shower curtain. \nAnnette's eyes well up with tears. \nANNETTE How am I a hypocrite? \nSEBASTIAN Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite. \nSebastian heads to the door. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Have a nice life. \nAnnette races toward him and throws her arms around him. \nANNETTE (sobbing) Please don't go. \nSEBASTIAN Get off me. \nShe kisses him passionately. \nANNETTE I... I want you. \nSebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed. \nShe lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up as she continues to undress. \nSebastian stands, stunned and watches her. \nSEBASTIAN I'm sorry, I can't. \nA pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the room and closes the door. \n65   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     65 \nSebastian closes the door and leans against it. \nSEBASTIAN Shit. \nHe wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes over to a mirror at looks at himself. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Get it together you pussy. \nA stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks away. \n66   EXT. ESTATE - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY                         66 \nA cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into the cab.

ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       67 \nSebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him. \nKATHRYN Morning! \nSEBASTIAN (sarcastic) Morning. \nKATHRYN So? How'd it go last night? \nSEBASTIAN With who? \nKATHRYN Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus? \nSebastian sits up in bed. \nSEBASTIAN If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no. \nKATHRYN She shot you down. \nSEBASTIAN Exactly the opposite. \nKATHRYN So what went wrong? \nSEBASTIAN I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it. \nKATHRYN You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump. \nSEBASTIAN A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified. \nHe climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out the door, when - \nKATHRYN If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her. \nSEBASTIAN Where is she? \nKATHRYN You don't know? (big smile) She left thirty minutes ago. \nAnnette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her. \nANNETTE Hi. \nSEBASTIAN Hi. \nShe walks over to him and kisses him. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) You alright? \nANNETTE I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. (beat) Was it -- \nSEBASTIAN It was perfect. \nShe smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in his. \n75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75 \nAnnette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the hall passing a mirror on the wall.

He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises. \nKATHRYN (O.S.) Slower. \nSebastian leans against the door. \nKATHRYN (O.S.) A little to the left. Look, pretend like you're writing the alphabet. A... B... mmm, stay on B. \nSebastian knocks on the door. \nKATHRYN (O.S.) One second. \nSebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from inside the bedroom. \nKATHRYN (O.S.) Come in. \n78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78 \nSebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed, wearing only her bathrobe. \nSEBASTIAN Bad time? \nKATHRYN Kind of. \nSEBASTIAN Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in. \nSebastian walks toward the closet. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game? \nHe throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there covering his genitals with his hands. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Well, well, well. \nRONALD It's not what it seems like. \nRonald picks up his clothes. As he leaves: \nSEBASTIAN Say hi to Cecile. \nRonald's head drops as he closes the door behind him. \nKATHRYN (calling out) Call me. \nSebastian throws Kathryn a look. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) You can't have all the fun. \nSebastian sits on the bed. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) You seem to be in a good mood. \nSEBASTIAN I am. \nSEBASTIAN That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it. \nKATHRYN Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away. \nSebastian stares at her, lost in thought. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but now he's just another love-struck faggot. One of the many. \n80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80 \nA taxi drives down the street. \n81   INT.

Sebastian looks nervous. \nKATHRYN Why so nervous? \nSEBASTIAN I've never done this before. \nKATHRYN How have you dumped girls in the past? \nSEBASTIAN Screening calls. Any suggestions? \nKATHRYN I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, \"How do you breathe when she sits on your face?\" \"It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her.\" Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. \"I'm completely fucked up.\" \"I'm completely fucked up.\" \"I'm completely fucked up.\" (beat) Poor fatty never had a chance. \n82   EXT.

She smiles and kisses him. \nANNETTE (cont'd) You think we can be quiet? \nShe embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless. \nSEBASTIAN This isn't working out for me anymore. \nANNETTE (smiling) Yeah, me neither. \nShe looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking. \nANNETTE (cont'd) What's wrong? \nSEBASTIAN From Ronald. \nKathryn takes the letter. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) I haven't had a chance to read it, but I'm sure it goes something like \"yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\" You see, I expected your sort of bullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you, but I promised him I would see you through your crisis. \nKATHRYN Well done. \nSEBASTIAN Thank you. Now, where were we? \nPOP goes the champagne cork. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Oh yeah, the celebration. \nHe reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them and hands one to Kathryn. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) What shall we toast to? \nKATHRYN To my triumph, of course. \nSEBASTIAN Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. \nKathryn giggles. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) What's so funny? \nKATHRYN Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. \nSEBASTIAN Come again? \nKATHRYN You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. (smiles) Cheers. \nShe clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't drink. He looks ill. \nSEBASTIAN In any event, you still owe me my reward. \nKATHRYN I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers. \nSebastian slaps her across the face. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) You motherfucker! \nShe grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They fall to the ground. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Nobody hits me. \nSEBASTIAN Calm down. \nHe rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground. \nKATHRYN Get off me! \nSEBASTIAN Will you calm down? \nKATHRYN Fine! Get off me! \nHe stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their breaths. \nSEBASTIAN I'm very sorry about that. I apologize. \nKATHRYN I accept. Now get out. \nSEBASTIAN Get out? We had an arrangement. \nKATHRYN Didn't you hear what I said? \nSEBASTIAN I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy. \nKATHRYN (screaming) Get out! \nSEBASTIAN I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed. \nKATHRYN And if I don't? \nSEBASTIAN Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three. \nKATHRYN I think you have your answer. \nSEBASTIAN War it is. \nHe grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind him. \n89   INT.

For once in my life I'm at a loss for words. \n97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97 \nSebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter. \nSEBASTIAN (V.O.) The truth of the matter is that being with you was the only time I have ever been happy. My whole life has been a joke. I prided myself on taking joy in others' misery. \n98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98 \nSebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad and lonely. \nSEBASTIAN (V.O.) Well, it finally backfired.

O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99 \nAnnette continues to read the letter. \nSEBASTIAN (V.O.) Enclosed is my most prized possession... my journal.

Then when I said \"Well what about Ronald,\" he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... \nRONALD And this happened before you and I hooked up? \nKATHRYN It's been going on for a while. (beat) Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. \nRONALD Racist piece of shit. \nKATHRYN I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. \nRONALD He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in. \nKATHRYN Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- \nRONALD Don't worry about it. I'll stay. \nKathryn hugs him. \nKATHRYN Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend. \n102  EXT.

Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer. \nGREG (to Sebastian) Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything. Let's just forget the whole thing. \nSEBASTIAN Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you there. It's too good to pass up. \nGreg starts to cry. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) After all, it is you who's bad- mouthing me to Annette Harrison. \nGREG Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. \nSEBASTIAN Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you. \nGREG (sobbing) I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you. \nBLAINE I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter. \nSEBASTIAN Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me. \nGreg wipes his eyes. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) However, this whole incident's kind of turned me on. \nSebastian unzips his fly. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) You get my point. \nGreg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles. \nGreg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when - \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Jesus Christ, I was only kidding. What do you think, I'm gay? My God, haven't you had enough for tonight. \nBLAINE Our boy just can't get enough dick. \nGREG You sick son of a bitch. \nBlaine and Sebastian laugh. \nSEBASTIAN I'll leave you guys alone. (macho voice) Score one for the team, Greg. \nSebastian leaves the room, then re-enters. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Come to think of it, there is something you can do for me. \n30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30 \nAnnette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and lands on the road. Sebastian is driving. \nAnnette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to her. \nSEBASTIAN Need a lift? \nANNETTE No thank you. \nSEBASTIAN How are you today? \nANNETTE Give it up. \nSEBASTIAN Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology. \nANNETTE I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me. \nSEBASTIAN I said I was sorry. \nShe continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside. \n", "test1_id": 786, "test2_input": "KATHRYN Shhh. \nON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW. \nCECILE (ON VIDEO) That was beautiful. \nRONALD (ON VIDEO) Almost as beautiful as you. \nCecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch. \nRONALD (ON VIDEO) Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway. \nCECILE (ON VIDEO) I'll see you tomorrow. \nRONALD (ON VIDEO) Absolutely. \nHe approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand. \nKATHRYN (O.S.) Idiot! \nANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image. \nKATHRYN What's wrong with you? \nSEBASTIAN You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me. \nKATHRYN Interesting. \nSEBASTIAN I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? \nKATHRYN No. \nSEBASTIAN Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat. \nShe walks over to the \"freeze frame\" image of Ronald and Cecile on the television. \nKATHRYN The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher. \nSEBASTIAN Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that. \nKATHRYN Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder. \nSEBASTIAN What's your plan of attack? \nKATHRYN I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo. \nSEBASTIAN But who will they turn to for help? \nKathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap. \nKATHRYN Cecile is planning to go away with Court next week. I'll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings. \nSebastian rubs her shoulders. \nSEBASTIAN I'm at your service. \nKATHRYN Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good. \nSEBASTIAN Oh sis. You're so tense. \nSebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra. He's met with no resistance. \nKATHRYN I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny. \nSEBASTIAN I hate it too. \nHe takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her skirt. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) (baby talk) Oh baby, your soaking. \nKATHRYN I know. \nShe closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) (seductively) Any luck with your girl? \nSEBASTIAN Moving along quite well. \nKATHRYN Have you succeeded in your task? \nSEBASTIAN Any day now. \nKATHRYN Well, let me know when you do.

VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       36 \nSebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with an infrared scope. \nSEBASTIAN Goodbye Mister Bond. \nHe picks up the phone and dials. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Hi, it's Sebastian.

I'm alright. \nSEBASTIAN How was your date? \nANNETTE It wasn't a date. He's just a friend. \nThere's a moment of uncomfortable silence. \nSEBASTIAN Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go. \nANNETTE Wait, don't hang up. \nSEBASTIAN Okay? \nANNETTE What are you doing? \nSEBASTIAN Reading. \nHe crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad twins (GRETCHEN & MORA) are licking popsicles. \nANNETTE What are you reading? \nSEBASTIAN Of Human Bondage. \nANNETTE Somerset Maugham. \nSEBASTIAN Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation. \nANNETTE You're not gonna start that again. \nHe takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the girls' butts. \nSEBASTIAN No. I'm through with my childish games when it comes to you. Hold on, that's my other line. (to the girls) Rub. \nThey rub the oil on each other then turn to him and smile. He clicks the phone back on. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Annette that's my mom calling.

ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57 \nCecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door. \nCECILE Who is it? \nKATHRYN (O.S.) It's Kathryn. \nCecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands there with a worried look on her face. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) Are you okay? \nCECILE No. \nKathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is crying. \nKATHRYN Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. \nCECILE Something awful happened last night. \nKATHRYN What do you mean?! \nCECILE I... I don't think you want to know. \nKATHRYN Cecile, you have to tell me. \nCECILE It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me. \nKATHRYN Does your mother know? \nCECILE If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night. \nKATHRYN Why didn't you do something? \nCECILE I don't know. \nKATHRYN So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you. \nCECILE Well... not exactly. \nKATHRYN He made you give him a blow job. \nCECILE No. \nKATHRYN Well what then? \nCecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) He ate you out? \nCECILE If that's what you call it. \nKATHRYN Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did. \nCECILE What do I do then? \nKATHRYN Well did you like it? \nCECILE Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one. \nKathryn laughs. \nKATHRYN Cecile, you had an orgasm. \n", "test3_true": "KATHRYN I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman. \nCECILE I am? \nKathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy. \nKATHRYN Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you. \nCECILE I don't love him. I love Ronald. \nKATHRYN So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible. \nCECILE But that would make me a slut. (beat) Wouldn't it? \nKATHRYN Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it. \nCecile takes the information in. \nCECILE It's like a secret society. \nKATHRYN That's one way of looking at it. \nCECILE Cool. \n58   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 58 \nAnnette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera.

Kathryn enters his room. \nKATHRYN I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems. \nSEBASTIAN Yippy. \nKATHRYN Who are you spying on? \nSEBASTIAN Take a look for yourself. \nHe hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the window. \nKATHRYN That her? \nSEBASTIAN Yeah. \nKATHRYN Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. (sarcastic) Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book. \nSebastian grabs the binoculars from her. \nSEBASTIAN Shut up. \nKATHRYN What's your problem? \nSEBASTIAN Nothing. \nKATHRYN She's really getting to you, isn't she? \nSEBASTIAN If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. (beat) She made me laugh. \nKATHRYN And that's why you're losing your bet? \nSEBASTIAN I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected. \nKATHRYN Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride? \nSEBASTIAN Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do. \nHe storms out of the room. \n60   EXT.

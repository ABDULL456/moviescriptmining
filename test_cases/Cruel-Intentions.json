You can trust me. \nCECILE (beat) I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. \nCecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her. \nCECILE (cont'd) What am I going to do? If my mother found out about Ronald she would kill me. \nKathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye. \nKATHRYN Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. \nCECILE Okay. \nKATHRYN Did you hide the letters? \nCECILE Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. \nKATHRYN I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. \nCECILE Why? \nKATHRYN Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. \nCECILE You'd do that for me? \nKATHRYN Of course I would. We're friends, right? \nCECILE Best friends. \nCecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn. \n23   INT.

I'm trying to read. \nSEBASTIAN What'cha reading? \nANNETTE The Fountainhead. \nSEBASTIAN Great book. \nANNETTE (skeptical) You've read The Fountainhead? \nSEBASTIAN Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. \nANNETTE Romantic? He rapes her. \nSEBASTIAN That's a matter of opinion. \nANNETTE You need help. \nSEBASTIAN Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it. \nANNETTE At this hour?

Another letter from your friend? \nANNETTE This is my favorite part. (reading the letter) Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. \nSEBASTIAN You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her? \nANNETTE I sincerely doubt it. \nSEBASTIAN Give me the fucking letter. \nAnnette smiles and tears the letter up. \nSEBASTIAN (cont'd) Why did you do that? \nANNETTE The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. \nSEBASTIAN (mocking) Is that the last thing you need? My your clever. \nShe takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe.

She's so young and he's so - \nMRS. CALDWELL Black. \nKathryn reacts to her remark. \nKATHRYN He's been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house. I questioned whether or not to tell you, but something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and I don't want to see her get hurt. \nKathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales counter. \nKATHRYN (cont'd) I hope I did the right thing in telling you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things with Court. \nMRS. CALDWELL I can't thank you enough. \nKATHRYN You will be discreet about this? \nMRS. CALDWELL Absolutely. \nSALESWOMAN Will that be cash or charge? \nKathryn looks through her purse. \nKATHRYN Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home. \nMrs. Caldwell takes out her purse. \nMRS.

You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again.

I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked.

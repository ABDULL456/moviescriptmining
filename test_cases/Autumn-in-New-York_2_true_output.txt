Wills turns to exit. Simon, returning to his seat, murmurs seductively to Wills as he passes by -- 
SIMON Leaving so soon? 
Wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on. As Simon sits, he mutters to Charlotte -- 
SIMON Be still my beating heart. (beat) Or is that your heart? 
SHANNON (whisper to Charlotte) You're not really into him, are you? 
Charlotte turns to Dolores who has just sat down. 
CHARLOTTE Hey, Dolly, how do you know him? 
DOLLY (uneasily) From Newport. Old friend of your mom's. 
Dolores eats a sloppy forkful of birthday cake. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WINDOW -- ESTABLISHING -- MORNING 
A gentle breeze tickles a white lace curtain. A PHONE RINGS. 
INT. BROWNSTONE KITCHEN -- SAME 
Charlotte, standing in the small antiquated kitchen, wearing flannel pajamas, tenses when she hears the PHONE RINGING UPSTAIRS. She snatches an apple from a bowl and dashes out of the room. 
FOLLOW CHARLOTTE running through the DINING ROOM... into the LIVING ROOM... into the FOYER... and up a DARK STAIRCASE. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 
A startling clash of childhood, adolescence, and womanhood. Everything from stuffed animals to posters of pop icons to volumes of great literature. 
THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN 
Charlotte bangs in, flings herself on the bed, and grabs the phone -- 
CHARLOTTE Okay, bitch, I'm ready! 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. WILLS' ROOFTOP TERRACE -- MORNING 
Wills sits in his woolen robe, holding a portable phone. Amused, he smiles into the morning sun -- 
WILLS For what? 
CHARLOTTE Oh my God, I'm so sorry! Wait. Who is this? 
WILLS Wills Keane. 
Her heart stops. She sits up slowly, her body tensed. 
WILLS Who did you think it was? 
CHARLOTTE My friend Simon, actually. He always calls me the morning after to sort of... you know... sum everything up. 
WILLS And how would you sum it up, Charlotte? Turning twenty. 
CHARLOTTE Kinda cool, kinda creepy. Anyway, you wanna speak to my grandmother? 
WILLS (with a chuckle) I don't think so. 
OLIVIA, 30's, Wills' Jamaican cook and housekeeper, enters. Plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a New York Times. Wills mouths a greeting. She smiles back and sets the tray on a table. 
WILLS I called because I'm going to be attending a benefit... a black-and- white ball.... and I'd like you to design a hat... for my date. 
CHARLOTTE Really? Wow. Sounds fun. Okay. 
WILLS It's a gift. I don't have her measurements, but she's about your size. What're you, a six? 
CHARLOTTE Uh-huh. 
WILLS Good -- then let's assume your hat size is also the same. 
CHARLOTTE But that doesn't necessarily -- 
WILLS It's a risk we'll just have to take. 
Charlotte runs over to her sewing table, looking for a pen and paper. She finds paper, but no pen -- 
WILLS Her dress is a sheath... sleeveless, black. The hat must, of course, be black or white or both. 
She finds a pen but it doesn't work. She grabs an eyeliner and uses that -- 
CHARLOTTE Any particular style?

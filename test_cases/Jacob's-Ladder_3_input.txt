JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT. 
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN 
JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in the distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table. A WOMAN"s voice calls out. 
JEZZIE (V.O.) Jake, is that you? 
JACOB What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? 
JEZZIE (V.O.) Why didn't you turn on the light? 
JACOB I didn't want to wake you. 
JEZZIE (V.O.) (sleepy but pleasant) Gee, thanks a lot. 
JACOB Where is the lamp? 
JEZZIE (V.O.) Where are you? 
JACOB If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. 
JEZZIE (V.O.) I moved the couch. That's all. 
JACOB Where to? 
JACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL "JEZZIE" PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual. 
JEZZIE That help? 
JACOB (nearly sprawled over the couch) Thanks. 
He pushes himself up. 
JEZZIE What do you think? 
JACOB What do you mean? 
JEZZIE The room! 
JACOB Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow. 
JEZZIE It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late? 
JACOB Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time. 
JEZZIE (seeing the grease on his uniform) What happened to you? 
JACOB (unbuttoning his shirt as he walks to the BATHROOM) Don't ask. 
JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's nakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter the shower together. 
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT 
A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass. 
JACOB Help me. Someone. 
Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to see who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is lying and then bursts directly into his eyes. 
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY 
SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake. 
JACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus shelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters. 
JEZZIE You up? 
JACOB No. Have you seen my glasses? 
JEZZIE (shaking her head) Where'd you leave 'em? 
JACOB I don't know. 
JEZZIE Did you look around the headboard? 
JACOB (wearily) Jezzie, I can't see. 
JEZZIE (she scans the shelf) Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom. 
She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper bag. She tosses them both onto the bed. 
JACOB Thanks. (he puts on his glasses and notices the bag) What's that? 
JEZZIE Your kid dropped it off. 
JACOB Who? Jed? 
JEZZIE (stooping to pick up the phone) No. The little one.

A soldier approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him. \nThe airplane begins to move. \nThe soldier shoots. \nThe airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the soldier continues to fire! \nThe aircraft gains speed. \nThe soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky... \n", "test1_true": "Title card: Free Georgia forever!!! \nThe airplane flies away into the evening sky. \n8   EXT.

Behind him, the women is sleeping, the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and bursts into laughter. \nTitle card: We've arrived, welcome to France!!! \nAs the music picks up the tune of The Marseillaise, the airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks... \nThe words \"The End\" appear on the screen. \n9    INT. WINGS MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                   9 \nFrom the moment they parked the car onwards, we become absorbed by what's happening around the screening of end of this film. \nBehind the screen, we've seen the actor who plays the hero - his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions of the audience. He was standing close to his dog, motioning to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack. \nIn the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely the producer. \n10   INT.

There are mums with kids, guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. Peppy is among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is dressed in a highly stylized fashion. His job is obviously that of a butler. Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the newspaper. The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting the headline: Who's that girl ? \nPeppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but deep down she knows he's right. Nobody knows who she is. She puts the newspaper away. \nA man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes an announcement. \nTitle card: Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance! \nAll the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels, leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. The man says something to one girl, who begins to dance. He motions to her that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section. He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too. Then it's Peppy's turn. She puts a lot of energy into a few top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired. \nFull of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she pauses in front of the butler. \nTitle card: The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller! \nShe finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on, leaving behind the impassive butler. \n16A   INT.

He's not always fooled by these signs of respect, and apes a few smiles himself. \n18    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY        18 \nIn his dressing room, wearing a tailcoat and top hat, George is finishing putting his make up on. He has a white face and dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his dog. George says to him: \nTitle card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice piece, to make it up to her. \nThe chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George, picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it. As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph. He's written Woof Woof on it, and signed it with the paw print of a dog. \n19    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY          19 \nWe're on a film set, the crew is setting up a shot. The director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay window and he sends it off. \nTitle card: Remove that screen and bring me another one!    On the double! \nTwo hands pick up the screen and carry it away. George arrives on set, everyone smiles at him. He sits down on the chair which bears his name. The producer whom we saw the previous day at the premi\u00e8re arrives. His name is Zimmer, and he's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by - two secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The Hollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a halt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is visibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello and vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still pointing at the newspaper. \nTitle card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's nothing about the film before page 5! \nBehind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen of sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As they are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath. While the producer is talking to him, George's attention is drawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to stand behind the screen, the top half of the body being hidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and is about to bring his attention back to the on-going discussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a noise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making, presumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and responds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs instantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back, but with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their screen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a young woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of course it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who she is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable. \n", "test2_id": 1399, "test3_input": "He carries on as though it's normal until his shadow walks off with its head bowed.

George is becoming more and more frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of the reels. \nThere's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold. We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible. On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with the cans of reels. \n92   EXT.

He collapses, still holding on to the can. \n93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93 \nJack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but the cop just wants to be left in peace. \n(91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face. \n(93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively. Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin with. Little by little though, as though realizing the seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more, \n94   EXT.

Suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone. She takes the receiver with a smile and listens. Her expression tightens a little. She hangs up, pensive for a moment. On set,the director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and they are good to go.

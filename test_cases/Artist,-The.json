{"train": "THE ARTIST \nWritten by \nMichel Hazanavicius \nSilent film, illustrated musically, with some title cards to indicate the dialogues, with actors whose lips move when they speak although we never hear their voices. The images are in black and white, in format 1.33. \n1   TITLES                                                       1 \nThe letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of the 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and, in the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent of the light beams of a film premi\u00e8re. Behind is a stylized town. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date appears on the screen: 1927 \n2   INT. LABORATORY - DAY                                        2 \nIn a \"futuristic\" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and bow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his ears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming. \nTitle card: I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!! \nHis torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually increase the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume reaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out! \n3   INT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY                                 3 \nGuards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a cell! \n5   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                   5 \nThe car speeds along the road. Its occupants turn round to check they aren't being followed. \n6   INT. HOUSE/LAB - DAY                                           6 \nThe guard who got knocked out picks himself up, realizes what's happened and dashes over to his office. He grabs a radio emitter and begins sending a message. \n7   EXT. AIR FIELD - DAY                                           7 \nThe hero, the young woman and the dog come to a halt in the Bugatti on the air field, by a telegraph pole whose wires lead...to a watch tower. \nIn the watch tower, a radio receptor is vibrating. A soldier approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him. \nThe airplane begins to move. \nThe soldier shoots. \nThe airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the soldier continues to fire! \nThe aircraft gains speed. \nThe soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky... \nIn the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited, immobile and often wide-eyed. \nIn the pit, a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film. \n(9) Now that the film is ending, and the last note is sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict, which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the people around him, especially the actress and the producer, who kiss each other on the lips. \nTwo theater hands bring down the curtain. \n(10) The lights come on. George Valentin comes onto the stage and acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. He is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to someone in the wings to join him. Jack the dog trots over in response. The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people are loving it! \nIn the wings, Constance is fuming with rage, but on stage, George is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who fakes death. Thunderous applause again. \nBehind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and this enrages the actress still more. \nSuddenly, George, hamming it up, remembers something he'd forgotten, and asks someone from the other side of the wings to join him. It's Constance. She comes over, smiling to the audience, and says something to George with a smile. \nTitle card: I'll get you for that. \nShe waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her teeth. She isn't feeling comfortable. George motions firing a gun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely casts him a \"very funny\" glance. George looks at his fingers, not understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes throwing them away behind him, as though they've become useless. Constance stalks back off into the wings in annoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. Once in the wings, the actress sticks up her middle finger at George, and exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: \"Put this up your ass.\" George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few more dance steps as he does so. The audience is delighted. \nAs he comes off stage, George gets soundly told off by Constance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the audience who are still asking for more. The producer, although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak attempt to calm the actress down. As for George, he returns to the stage, the audience roars. He pretends to want to leave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall just as he's leaving the stage. George holds his nose, the audience goes wild, Constance gets even madder, and while George carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks into a beaming smile. He's probably realized that George has the audience on his side... Constance, furious, storms off. She is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her, although it looks like he's got his work cut out for him. \n11   EXT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                      11 \nShe goes through the main gates of Kinograph Studios, and heads towards where they hire extras. \nIn a courtyard, fifty-odd people are waiting, some sitting on wooden crates, others standing. There are mums with kids, guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. Peppy is among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is dressed in a highly stylized fashion. His job is obviously that of a butler. Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the newspaper. The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting the headline: Who's that girl ? \nPeppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but deep down she knows he's right. Nobody knows who she is. She puts the newspaper away. \nA man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes an announcement. \nTitle card: Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance! \nAll the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels, leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. The man says something to one girl, who begins to dance. He motions to her that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section. He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too. Then it's Peppy's turn. She puts a lot of energy into a few top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired. \nFull of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she pauses in front of the butler. \nTitle card: The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller! \nShe finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on, leaving behind the impassive butler. \n16A   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                            16A \nIn the lobby, George is preparing to leave the house. He waves at the huge, full-length portrait of himself waving and smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo. He looks great in the painting, and George is delighted to see and to wave to himself. \n16    EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 16 \n36   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT               36 \nGeorge awakes with a start! He's in bed and is having trouble shaking off his nightmare. \nThe film continues as normal: in other words, silent. \nHis wife is sleeping by his side. He gets up, taking care not to make a sound. \n37   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            37 \nGeorge calms down as he sits in the living room, alone in the darkness. Jack, still sleepy, has just curled into a ball next to him to fall back to sleep. George smiles and gives him a pat. \n38   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY     38 \nDriven by his chauffeur, George crosses town heading for the studios. \nEXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY \nThe car goes through the studio gates. There's nobody there. George gets out. He goes into the courtyard. There's nobody there either. \n40   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR SET - DAY             40 \nHe goes into the studio and heads for the set. There is still no one about. He doesn't understand and goes back outside. \nTitle card: I'm sorry. The public wants fresh blood. And the public is never wrong. \nGeorge gets to his feet. \nTitle card: It's me the people want and it's my films they want to see. And I'm going to give them to them. \nZimmer nods with another pursing of the lips, as though he can't wait to see that. George seems very sure of himself. \nTitle card: I don't need you. Go make your talking movies. I'm going to make them a beautiful film! \nAs George leaves in disgust, his eyes are drawn to an advertising feature representing the \"new faces of Kinograph Studios\". Among the medallion framed young portraits, George recognizes that of Peppy Miller. He glances up at Zimmer. \nTitle card: Fresh blood... \nThe two men exchange a last glance, then George exits. \n44   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS, SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY            44 \nOutside he feels a few seconds of discouragement but, as he meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretary's antechamber, he puffs up his chest and walks tall out of the office. \n45   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - STAIRS - DAY                       45 \nGoing down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect specimens of America's golden youth. She is coming up, he is going down. When she notices him, she stops, already one step above of him. She has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to see him. He is delighted too, although his mood is very different. \nGeorge smiles. \nTitle card: Or not. \nShe insists but he doesn't listen. He's with his dog. She gets annoyed, he doesn't answer, she ends up throwing Jack. George cannot forgive her for doing so, he looks at her in disgust. She starts to cry. \nTitle card: I'm unhappy, George. \nHe answers without looking at her. \nTitle card: So are millions of other people, me for instance. \n49   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              49 \nThanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings, we see George begin making his film, the first clap of the board that shows he's both the film's producer and director. The film is called Tears of love, and it tells the tale of an English adventurer - played by himself - accompanied by a young woman, an old man who looks like a professor and who is probably the father of the young woman and, lastly, an African tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be proven. \nWe see George in the various stages of preparation: writing, re- writing, directing, acting, signing a lot of checks, but also leaving very early in the morning to set up shots with his collaborators, etc. He looks fulfilled, like he truly believes in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling. His dog has a role in the film too, doing tricks. George looks very happy, very committed. He takes a supple branch, feeds it through the sleeves of a woman's blouse and, by holding the two ends of the branch out in front of him, dances with the imaginary woman. Everyone around him is happy and laughing. He's not shooting a comedy, however, it's obviously a drama of some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors play their role. \nThen appear on screen the mock ups of posters, they are shown on the set to George. \nHe chooses the one in which he is most prominent, it's a poster depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date October 25th. \nOMITTED \nInside the car, behind the implacable chauffeur, George is talking to himself, as though he's re-running the story in his head and searching for what he might have done better, or differently. \n62   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              62 \nOnce home, he finds a photo of himself on the floor. It has been defaced with a scribbled moustache, spectacles and a big nose. There's a note to him scribbled on the back. We read it at the same time as him. \nIt's over, George. You've got a fortnight to collect your souvenirs together and get out of the house. \nDoris P.S.: You should go see Beauty Spot, it's incredible. \nGeorge takes it on the chin and leaves, revealing behind him the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo, smiling and waving. \n63   INT. MOVIE THEATER - \"TEARS OF LOVE\" SCREENING - DAY          63 \nAs for Peppy, she's in the theater, watching Tears of love. She's with a handsome young man who seems bored. \n64   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                             64 \nGeorge is wearing shorts and an explorer's hat. He is sinking in sinking sand. The young woman is screaming and the dog barking. \nThe Africans are panicking but there's nothing anyone can do. George stops struggling, and looks deep into the eyes of the young woman. He says gently: \nTitle card: Farewell, Norma.    I never loved you... \n67   EXT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - TOP STEP - NIGHT                 67 \nHe opens the door. It's Peppy. She immediately notices that George is drunk. Her smile tenses a little. \nTitle card: I wanted to talk, I... \nGeorge looks at her. She continues. \nTitle card: I saw Tears of Love. \nGeorge nods, and answers. \nTitle card: And so you've come to get your money back? \nShe smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.   He continues. \nTitle card: Too much face-pulling? \nShe stops smiling because it's not funny at all. It's bitter, even. There's an embarrassed silence. Softly, she tries to explain. \nTitle card: About last night... \nShe stops because George is not looking at her anymore. He's watching the arrival of the young, smiling, handsome and wholesome man who is with Peppy. George bears a melancholy smile. \n69   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          69 \nPeppy is facing her mirror and putting her make up on. She takes a break, looking a little sad. Someone (some kind of assistant) opens the door to her dressing room and says something like you need to hurry up. She nods and gets back to work. \n70   EXT. MOVIE POSTERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                        70 \nAlternate shots of three or four film posters and frames from them which illustrate Peppy's rising fame. Her name moves higher up the posters and into bigger letters. The films are called \"The Rookie\", \"The Brunette \", \"The Girl Next Door\" and, finally, \"On the Roof \". \nOMITTED \n72   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          72 \nWe catch up with her in a close up, applying her make up. The camera pulls back and we see that not only is she not putting the make up on herself - a make up artist is doing that - but there are in fact four pairs of hands getting busy around her; two make up girls, a hairdresser and a wardrobe assistant. Peppy, fortunately, has stayed completely natural and doesn't seem to take any of it seriously. As the last touch is put in place, Peppy gets to her feet and turns round. \nAt her feet lie a dozen pairs of shoes, each pair as magnificent as the next, and all in their swanky boxes. Peppy tries on a pair. Close up of her feet. \n73   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE (1931) - DAY                              73 \nCrossfade to a man's pair of shoes with used heels and uppers. George's dog comes to sit at his feet. The date is superimposed on the screen: 1931. \nThe camera climbs up his legs to reveal George lying fully dressed in his bed, obviously at home in view of his attitude. He's changed. And even if his suit is still pretty smart, he's become more \"common\", less unattainable. He seems to have lost whatever it was that made him so superb. Primarily he's a bit drunk, somewhat hesitant. George gets up and closes his Murphy bed, the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a closet. Then he walks across the living area. His home has changed too, it's fallen in class and is a lot more modest than the one we were used to seeing him in. We do however recognize some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling. He goes into the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment. There's nothing in the refrigerator. He looks for something to drink but there's only one bottle left in the rack. He lifts it up. It's empty. \nHe opens a closet. Inside, a tuxedo hangs among a number of bare hangers. \nIn the evening, George looks out between the curtains, the chauffeur is still there. George turns on his heels and gets into his Murphy bed. \n78   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         78 \nNight time. George is in bed with his eyes open. \n79   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   79 \nOutside, the chauffeur is still in the same position. \n80   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     80 \nThe next morning, George gets up and goes to look from the window. The chauffeur has gone. George is a little sad, but that's just the way it is... He looks around at his home. \nA little later, George looks at himself in a mirror. We pass from him to his reflection, which he hides by placing his drink against the mirror. \n81   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - DAY                                      81 \nA sign says that the effects of George Valentin are to be auctioned. Furniture, costumes, objets d'art and paintings on September 14th. There aren't many people in the room, just five or six. George is standing at the back, smoking a cigarette. \nHis position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching the screening of Tears of Love, from the back of the room with the verdict of failure in the air... \nHe's looking a little unsteady on his feet, probably due to the hip flask he's necking that seems to contain liquor. The objects go under the hammer one by one. We see the three monkeys go by, notably, hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil. Two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding against each other, a distinguished and reserved-looking man, and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe, to the point of bigotry. They don't seem perfectly comfortable, but they are the only two buying. \nLittle version runs off shot to get help, and he comes back with a tribe of African warriors, all bearing spears. They attack. \nBig version tries to defend himself, staggers as he gets to his feet, tries to gesture to the barman, but he is so drunk that he falls straight backwards without making the slightest attempt to stop his fall. The Africans leap about with joy. \nFADE TO BLACK. \n(84) George's chauffeur comes into the bar. He motions to the barman who jerks his head in one direction. The chauffeur follows the indication and finds George lying on the floor, totally smashed. He slaps him gently around the face a few times in a vain attempt to wake him, then lifts him over his shoulder, pays the check and leaves. \n86   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   86 \nAt George's house, his chauffeur puts him to bed and hangs his suit carefully before leaving the room. He sees the dog, goes over to it and strokes it. They look at each other. We can tell that the chauffeur is worried about George. \n87   EXT. \"GUARDIAN ANGEL\" THEATER - DAY                           87 \nPeppy Miller is \"The Guardian Angel\". It's a huge poster on the fa\u00e7ade of a movie theater. George goes inside. With Jack. \n88   INT. \"GUARDIAN ANGEL\" THEATER - DAY                           88 \nThe auditorium is full. George sits down in the first row. To watch the film he has to look upwards, and sees a huge and magnificent Peppy rising above him. She's playing a scene with a young actor we recognize, it's Humphrey Bogart. He's become a spectator: he laughs, is absorbed and cries along with the others. \n89   INT. \"GUARDIAN ANGEL\" THEATER - CORRIDOR & LOBBY - DAY       89 \nComing out of the theater several young people bump into him. They don't recognize him. There's a lot of people milling about, so he picks Jack up. A woman exclaims an Oh! of admiration as though she's recognized George. He smiles modestly but soon realizes that it's just because she thinks Jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any other dog. She is totally under Jack's charm, and says to George. \nHe carries on as though it's normal until his shadow walks off with its head bowed. He watches it go, trying to understand what's happening, but it's gone and he's still there. He begins to holler. \nTitle card: COME BACK! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!! \nTotally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels against the wall as he hollers. The cans split open and the film bursts out all over. George is becoming more and more frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of the reels. \nThere's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold. We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible. On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with the cans of reels. \n92   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    92 \nThe dog comes out of the house and makes a dash for the sidewalk as fast as he can. \n(91) In the room, among the flames and the smoke, George - now breathless - picks one of the reels and tries to turn round. He collapses, still holding on to the can. \n93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93 \nJack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but the cop just wants to be left in peace. \n(91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face. \n(93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively. Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin with. Little by little though, as though realizing the seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more, \n94   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    94 \nPeppy bursts into the lobby, talks to a woman at the desk who directs her with a raised hand that Peppy immediately follows. \nShe bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a corridor, \n101   INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR AND GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY            101 \nand then to a door through the window of which she sees George lying down. His dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep. George is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. A doctor is in the room with a nurse. \nPeppy enters. She's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring. \nTitle card: He's not in any danger now. He just needs to rest. \nPeppy goes up to George. She notices that his burnt hands seem to still be clutching something. She's intrigued. In response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in a corner of the room. \nTitle card: He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it away from him. \nPeppy picks up the can. The label is too damaged to be able to read the title of the film. She opens it and unrolls some of the film in front of the window. We see random photograms run by. It's the only sequence they ever shot together, years before. Peppy is moved. Without turning round, she asks the doctor: \nTitle card: Do you think he could come rest up at my place? \nThe doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye. \nTitle card: It's probably the very best he could have hoped for. \n106   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                        106 \nGeorge opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. He closes the door behind him. The room has a ghostly quality to it. Jack sniffs about everywhere. George too seems troubled by the strange pervading atmosphere. His curiosity is spurred by a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. A ray of light surges into the room. The door has opened and, standing against the daylight, is a maid. \nTitle card: You should go back to your room, Sir. \nGeorge nods with a smile. The maid leaves pretty swiftly, we haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange. George is intrigued but leaves the room. He has to call Jack to him. Jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master. \n107   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY             107 \nA screenplay lies on a table. Peppy and Zimmer are seated either side of the table and are talking animatedly. We're on the set we saw the previous day, and Peppy seems to be trying to convince Zimmer of something. She seems to be describing a film poster or the fa\u00e7ade of a movie theater she'd love to see. He doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to Peppy. She finally stops talking and gives him a determined look. Zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies. \nTitle card: George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the past. Today he's a nobody. \nAs Zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat. Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking. \nTitle card: What are you doing? \nShe looks him straight in the eyes, and answers: \nTitle card: I'm stopping work. It's him or me. \nShe looks determined. He's looking unsure of himself. He visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. She drives her point home. \nBefore he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual reserve for the first time and says to George: \nTitle card: She's been good to you. She's always looked out for you. \nThe chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt. \n110   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  110 \nFrom the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and drive off. We recognize the car as being the one that belonged to George. \n(109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition. \n111   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      111 \nGeorge goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up the sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the three monkeys \"hear no evil\", \"speak no evil\" and \"see no evil\". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to reveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the auction room. \nAfter taking off several other sheets, George realizes that she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture, paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his suits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room once more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid. \nGeorge walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets to them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale prices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks off, still shocked by what he's just realized. \n112   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY               112 \nHe finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room, and leaves. \nGeorge sits down in an armchair in the darkness. Jack sits down facing him. He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground. \n117   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      117 \nIn the room with all the sheets, Peppy is with the maid. The maid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he removed all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable expression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible thought, she rushes outside. \n118   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  118 \nShe runs out of the house and over to the car, but the chauffeur isn't there. She honks the horn to call him but there's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full speed - more or less successfully. Just as she passes through the gate, the chauffeur turns up. Too late. He sees her drive away. \n119   EXT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                          119 \nPeppy is driving as fast as she can through town, but she's pretty reckless and almost causes an accident. \n120   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           120 \nOutside George's house, the wind is slamming one of the shutters with the regularity of a metronome. George takes a gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of him. He picks up the glass for another gulp. Jack doesn't like what he sees. He barks. \n(119) As for Peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring even the most basic of road safety requirements. \n(120) George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol. Jack isn't happy at all. He barks and bites George's trouser leg, pulling on it. \n(119) Peppy speeding along. \n", "test1_input": "Her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject apology, but George is roaring with laughter. \nAfter a short pause, Zimmer makes the connection. He checks the front page of the paper, and recognizes her! \nThen he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower her head, unable to reply. He gestures that she's fired and for her to get out, and she starts to go, completely distraught. She's just made a couple of steps when George stops her and tells her to come back. Everyone is surprised, most of all him. Zimmer can't believe it, and so doesn't respond at first. \nThere's bad feeling between them, as though neither wanted this sudden conflict, but like it had always been there, tangible. Everyone on the set seems to be waiting for Zimmer to react, but to their surprise, after a long moment of hesitation, he walks away without saying a thing. Peppy looks at George gratefully, smiling, but seems a little preoccupied as though she might have made a mistake. \nEveryone on set gets back to work. \n20   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY        20 \nThey're about to start shooting. The director is showing George what he has to do. The scene is happening in a cabaret restaurant. George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to change dancing partner. George finds himself dancing with Peppy one moment, and in the arms of a very fat man the next, the director finds the gag hysterical. The scene is shot several times from three different angles. Each time, George dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing. It's probably love. \n21   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     21 \nLater on, in the dressing room corridor, Peppy, holding an envelope, goes up to George's door. She knocks, waits for a reply, then enters. There's nobody there. She hesitates, not sure whether to leave or stay... \n22   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      22 \nFinally, she goes into the room and places the envelope addressed to George Valentin on the dresser. Then she attentively looks around the dressing room. She looks at the objects and photos and notices, hanging from a coat stand, George's jacket on a hanger, and his hat which sits on a hook above it. The way the clothes are disposed looks like George's silhouette, except that the clothes are empty. She goes over, strokes the jacket and little by little brings George to life through his clothes. \nShe puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own waist. As it's George's sleeve, she makes it look like his arm has come to life, as though George has come to life. Even more so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though George were inside. She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without any rush. George sees her, they look at each other. He closes the door but doesn't go over to her, instead going over to the mirror. He looks at her, she at him... He motions to her to approach. She does. He stares at her face for a while before he speaks. \n", "test1_true": "He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her upper lip. She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. She likes it. She turns towards him and, quite naturally, folds into his arms. The dog watches them curiously with its head leaning to one side. They are probably about to kiss when George's chauffeur comes into the room and catches them. George swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of discomfort. The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a large and beautiful pearl necklace. George is intrigued by the necklace, and turns away from Peppy. She understands that George has his own life, that their embrace was just a stolen moment and slowly leaves, looking back at George as she does so. He does not look at her. She leaves the room. Once he has studied and necklace and is satisfied, George turns back towards Peppy but she is no longer there. The chauffeur exits the room. \nWhen he is alone, George looks at himself in the mirror. His expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in the world. He mimes shooting himself in the temple with his fingers, but it's the dog which collapses into its play-dead pose. \n23   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             23 \nThe next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife. The atmosphere is still dreadful but this time he's not making any effort either. He disdainfully watches Doris eat. She is cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork. George watches her, smiles and continues to watch. Except it's not Doris he's watching. Instead it's Peppy who's tucking into her food and talking and laughing vivaciously. George is with her with an expression of love on his face. He's laughing with her when, suddenly, reality bites. He's still sitting opposite Doris, and she's staring at him because she doesn't understand why he is laughing. She visibly finds him ridiculous. He stops laughing and breakfast carries on as normal. \n24   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              24 \nWe see several quick sequences which indicate time passing: \nBreakfasts with George and Doris where the atmosphere is increasingly dreadful. Doris scribbles on photos of George in the press, draws on moustaches, large spectacles, etc. \n25   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PIRATE/COWBOY/ETC. - DAY                 25 \nShort extracts of George in various films, in which he portrays a pirate, then a cowboy, then William Tell, etc. We also see him in \"Someday in July\" in the sequence he shot with Peppy and the fat male dancer. \n26   INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDIENCE, ETC. - DAY                       26 \nMovie-goers reacting to the films, but the way the images are edited - cut with breakfast images - could mean they are reacting to them too. \nAmong the audience is Peppy Miller. She's trying to concentrate fully on the film and is pushing away the handsome young man she's with, who is trying to kiss her. We see her later, at the movies again, but this time alone. \n", "test2_input": "27   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PEPPY AS A SERVANT/DANCER/ETC. - DAY     27 \nWe see her playing some bit parts, maid, dancer, etc. Her roles seem to get a little bigger. We notice that she now wears the beauty spot that she'll keep forever. \nHer name climbs up the ranks in the title sequences of films, until it appears on its own. \n28   INT. OFFICE - PEPPY/CONTRACT/1927 - DAY                       28 \nWe see her signing a contract in a small office, she seems happy. \nINT. OFFICE - GEORGE/ZIMMER/CONTRACT - DAY \nGeorge signs a big contract with Zimmer as photographers take pictures. He smiles broadly, whereas Zimmer looks like his smile is a little forced. \nThe date appears on the screen: 1929 \nINT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR - DAY \nGeorge, dressed as a musketeer, is sword-fighting with three middle-ages thugs in a tavern. He kills two of them, but unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third. But when the third man attacks, George merely dodges with a sleight of body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook! Calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape. The man stands up, throws aside his cape and reveals himself to be... Napoleon! He puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly thanks an astonished George. Napoleon says something to him and George respectfully bows, walks away from him still bowing then turns and runs. Once out of the decor, he bumps right into a worried-looking Zimmer who is followed by his loyal assistants. George is in a playful mood. Zimmer tells him: \nTitle Card: I want to show you something.     Right now. \nGeorge seems astonished that Zimmer is leaving the set and not filming, but agrees. Napoleon walks past them very imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him a chair. The technician doesn't miss the chance to remind the man that he is only an extra, and not Napoleon. \n", "test2_true": "Zimmer, his guards, and George - still dressed as a musketeer - come into a screening room in which a dozen or so very serious- looking people are waiting. They sit down and Zimmer, very proudly and self-confidently, gestures to an assistant who passes on the message to the projectionist. The room goes dark. The screening begins. \nINT. VOICE TEST STUDIO - DAY \nOn screen we see a card that indicates it's a sound shooting test for a talking scene. Then Constance appears, the actress from the spy film. She's standing in front of a mic and she tests it, delighted to be there. Cut. We see her again, the microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene. It's a monologue. Her acting is terrible, very theatrical, but the audience can hear her. It is however, awful. \n(31) In the screening room, the audience seems stunned by what they see/hear. They are fascinated. They then begin to congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back. Zimmer's pride seems to grow by the second. \nGeorge, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the actress earnestly ends her monologue. \nWhen the lights come up, George is laughing uncontrollably way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is obvious. The people present are embarrassed, and Zimmer is deeply put out. George, still laughing, leaves the room, waving an apology with his hands as he goes, but also pointing to the screen to explain why he's laughing. Zimmer feels even more humiliated. Fade to black on his face. \n33   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      33 \nWe're back with George in his dressing room. He's removing his make up. He moves some ordinary object and the object, as he moves it, makes a noise. We hear the noise it makes. Really hear it. It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes from within the film itself. One second later, George realizes that the object made a noise. He moves it again, the object makes a noise again. George is worried. He tries another object and obtains noise again. His dog barks and we hear it! He gets up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. He realizes this... Panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking again, but still no sound comes out. Not understanding what's happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his dressing room! \n34   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     34 \nNoisy, laughing dancers pass in the corridor, others are talking or shouting and even if we can't make out what they are saying, they are all making sound. George tries to talk to them but his voice remains silent. One dancer, seeing his fright, bursts into throaty laughter. George rushes through the milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly loud... \n35   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - COURTYARD - DAY                   35 \n...and bursts out into the courtyard of the studio that is now suddenly deserted and silent. In front of him a feather eddies slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze. It finally lands, making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion. George screams, but again his cry is silent. \n", "test3_input": "She continues talking with the casual arrogance of youth. Behind her, George's smile vanishes. \nTitle card: Anyway, it's normal for the young to take over from the old, that's life. Make way for youth! \nGeorge is hurt. He gets up and, before he leaves, gestures silently that if she wants his place all she has to do is take it. She watches him leave and immediately regrets what she's just said. \n55   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             55 \nIt's the day of the films' release, October 25th. \nIt's morning. George opens his front door. His chauffeur is outside. The man's expression announces bad news. He's holding the day's press. The huge headlines talk of a stock market crash, a black Thursday, a catastrophe. \nDressed in a robe, George is on the telephone in the living room. He nods. The atmosphere is stifling. He hangs up. His chauffeur looks at him inquisitively. George replies as though lost in thought: \nTitle card: It would seem that we're ruined. \nThe chauffeur takes it on the chin with as much reserve as he can muster, but George continues. \nTitle card: That's the best case scenario... \nHe almost laughs - not so the chauffeur. \n56   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           56 \n", "test3_true": "57   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                         57 \nPeppy awakes in bed with a start. She doesn't know what has woken her up. She looks around, looks at the phone, seems perplexed. Then a man's arm invites her to lie back down; she does. \n(56) Still at his desk, George gets up and goes to the window. He seems lost in thought. \n58   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              58 \nAn extract from \"Tears of Love\" in which we see George, holding the young woman in his arms, take part in a clich\u00e9-d African dance with shields, spears and all the African accoutrements attributed by Westerners at the time. George and the woman are complacently watching the dance, when George says to the young woman. \nTitle card: Let's go back, Norma. They've never seen a white woman before and I don't want to take any risks. \n59   INT. MOVIE THEATER - \"TEARS OF LOVE\" SCREENING - DAY       59 \nThere's hardly anyone in the theater. The people that are there look bored more than anything. At the back smoking a cigarette, George takes the failure on the chin. \nOne couple gets to their feet and leaves the theater. As the man reaches George, he recognizes him and casts him a glance that seems to say \"goodness old chap this one's not up to much...\" George doesn't know what to say in reply. \n60   EXT. MOVIE THEATERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                       60 \nOutside, George comes out still smoking his cigarette. On the sidewalk, people are cheerfully waiting in line. George walks up the line and comes to a movie house that's playing the \"Beauty Spot\" talking movie. A huge poster depicts Peppy and the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going to see the film. It's visibly a success. George takes it on the chin. \n61   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY       61 \n"}

INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - DAY                      1 \nA sign reads \"Bridge to Canada.\" \nA steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St. Lawrence River. \nCars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs officials inspect and question impatient drivers. \nBeyond them a smaller sign: \"THANK YOU FOR VISITING MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for you\". \n2   EXT. BELOW THE BRIDGE - DAY                                 2 \nThe river stretches for miles in either direction, frozen, and still with trees on either side. \n3   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD, MASSENA NEW YORK - DAY             3 \nRAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open, smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in the cold morning air. \nHer bare feet rest on the cold ground. \nHer 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE. \nAround her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride. \nBeyond the yard, flat, winterbare land. \nAfter a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR., leans out the trailer door. \nT.J. We're out of Capt'n Crunch. \nHis breath is visible in the cold. \nRAY Just give him toast. \nT.J. We got no butter, we got no jelly. \nRay is out of ideas. He expects her to move, but she stays still. He looks around the yard. \nT.J. (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nRAY Listening for the trucks. \nT.J. Are they really coming? \nRAY Yeah. \nT.J. Where's dad? \nShe is silent. \nT.J. (CONT'D) (says it slow) Where's dad? \nShe looks at him. \nRAY I don't know how he found it, T.J. \nT.J. Found what? \nRay takes a drag off her cigarette. T.J. walks over to the car. \nT.J. (CONT'D) The money? \nRAY I locked it in my glove compartment. \nT.J. looks in at the OPEN AND EMPTY GLOVE COMPARTMENT. \nT.J. That was stupid. \nRAY Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened. \nT.J. Did you tell him you had it? \nRAY Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out. \nT.J. Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That's the stupidest place you could have put it. \nRAY He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay! \nT.J. Did he leave anything? \nShe shakes her head. \nRAY (O.S.) (tentative, controlled) Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy? Troy? \n16   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    16 \nRay aims the gun and FIRES into the camper door. \n17   INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    17 \nThe shock of the blast throws Lila off the cot. She looks at the SMOKING HOLE. \nRAY (O.S.) I'm not kidding, honey, come on out. \n18   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                   18 \nKeeping behind the door for cover, Lila opens it. Ray looks inside: there is no sign of Troy. \nLILA (from behind the door) The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses. \nRay looks at her. \nRAY This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys! \nLila throws the keys out the door. Ray picks them up off the ground. Lila shuts the door with her foot. \n19   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                   19 \nRay gets in the Horizon and pulls it in behind the Acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope. \nShe ties one end to the Acclaim's back fender and the other to the Horizon's front fender. \nLila watches out the camper window. \nRay gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly TOWING the Horizon a few feet before the rope SNAPS. \nRay gets out and looks at the broken rope. She begins digging in the trunk for more rope. \nLila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole. \nLILA This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this. \nRAY (over her shoulder) Then you should quit stealing cars. \nLILA I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus. \nRay stops. \nRAY Did you see where the bus was headed? \nLILA New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure. \nRay RE-TIES the tow line with the remaining rope. \nThis time the Horizon goes an inch or two before the rope SNAPS. Ray gets out. \nRAY (under her breath) Shit! \nRay RIFLES through the trunk for more rope. \n\"Home on the Range\" plays on the cell phone in Ray's back pocket. \nLila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to Ray's conversation from the doorway. \nRay puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of the cars. \nRay gets back in the Acclaim and tries TOWING the Horizon once again. \nThis time the right side of the front fender SNAPS OFF and droops to one side. \nRay gets out and looks at Lila. \nRAY (CONT'D) I'm not leaving this here. \nLILA (points at the Acclaim) I got a friend who might buy that. \nRAY It's not for sale. \nLILA He'll pay more than it's worth. \nRay ignores her. \nLILA (CONT'D) Maybe two thousand. \nRAY Why's that? \nLILA He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks. \nRay thinks about it. \nLILA (CONT'D) He don't need papers or anything. \nLILA (CONT'D) Roll down your window. \nHe walks up slowly and hands her a brown paper bag. \nLILA (CONT'D) Count it. \nRay opens the bag and counts out the cash, as before. \nRAY Twelve hundred. \nLila takes the cash from Ray and pops the trunk release. The two Chinese men hurry out. The Dealer ushers them into a Garage. \nLILA Let's go. \n34   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY                             34 \nRay and Lila return down Route 37 past the sign \"AKWESASNE, LAND OF THE MOHAWK\" \nLila keeps the gun on Ray. \nLILA Turn down there. \nRay looks at the dirt road leading into the woods. \nLILA (CONT'D) Stop here. \nRay stops. \nLILA (CONT'D) Now open the door. \nRay hesitates. Lila jams the gun in her side. \nLILA (CONT'D) Open the door. \nRay opens the door. \nLILA (CONT'D) Now get out. \nRay doesn't move. \nRAY You can't have my car. \nLILA Get out. \nRAY You can't have my car. \nLila tries to push Ray out the driver's door with her feet. \nRay clings to the steering wheel. \nRAY (CONT'D) No! \nSuddenly, Ray grabs Lila by the hair and pulls her head down to the car seat. Lila hits Ray in the head with the gun. \nRAY (CONT'D) (gasps) Fuckin' bitch! \nBleeding and holding Lila's hair, Ray pries the gun out of Lila's hand. Lila grabs the sack of money, jumps out of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the woods. \nRay chases her, but Lila is faster and gets ahead, then disappears into the woods. Ray stops, panting, and wipes the blood from her forehead. \nRAY (CONT'D) (calls after her) Little bitch! \nRay stares after her for a long moment then gets back in the Acclaim. \n35   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              35 \nRay drives up in the Acclaim. \nT.J., wearing PROTECTIVE GOGGLES, works on the broken Duck Kiddie ride with a BLOW TORCH. He doesn't notice Ray. \nRay covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. He jumps and cuts the flame. \nRAY I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here. \nT.J. If I get it working I can sell it. \nShe looks at the rusted pieces of it. \nRAY I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here! \nT.J. Rentaworld called. They're coming to get the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow. \nHe notices the car. \nT.J. (CONT'D) Did you find him? \nRAY No. \nT.J. Where was the car? \nOn the windshield of the Malibu in huge white letters: \nMIKE Nothing with a trunk. \nLILA That thing has been sittin' here for six months. \nMIKE I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay? \nLILA He doesn't have to know. \nMike rolls his eyes. \n37   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                37 \nRay wakes up with Ricky staring at her. \nRICKY Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house? \nRAY (half asleep) They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China. \nRICKY Then what? \nRAY They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it. \nRICKY Then what? \nRAY They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar. \nRICKY And you can buy me some? \nRAY That's right. \nRICKY Yes! \n38   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - DAY                          38 \nRay puts out a breakfast spread of Microwave popcorn and tang. \nT.J. I'm not eatin' that again for dinner. \nRAY We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday. \nT.J. What about Rentacenter? \nShe searches through the couch cushions. \nRAY What about them? \nT.J. They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock. \nRAY You told me that already. \nShe finds change and hands it to him. \nRAY (CONT'D) Here, lunch money. \nShe gives the rest to Ricky. \nT.J. Look I don't see why you won't just let me get a job with Mitch. \nRAY (to T.J.) Who's Mitch. \nT.J. He's got like this whole business he runs. \nRAY He sells pot to kids? \nT.J. No, it's computers. He works on computers. \nRAY You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it. \nT.J. That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV while I'm sitting in some Christmas assembly when I could be- \nRAY Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him? \nT.J. (going out the door) I still say we should go back to the rez, get the Horizon and kick some serious butt. \nT.J. goes out the door behind Ricky and slams it in Ray's face. \nRay slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror to put on her mascara. She cakes it on trying to ignore the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it. Finally she stops and stares at herself. \nCUT TO: \n39   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    39 \nRay pulls up in front of the camper and stops. \nThe Horizon is still there and all is quiet. \nRay gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking over her shoulder every once in while at the camper. \nJIMMY I don't want any trouble with him, Lila. \nLILA Don't worry about it. \nJimmy's cell phone rings. \nJIMMY This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino. \nLILA Okay. \nJimmy takes the call. \n43   INT.

An old BLACK SUV pulls up from the opposite direction, FACING THEM. \nTwo MIDDLE-AGED CHINESE MEN, get out of the back. One carries an envelope. At the sight of Ray and Lila, he stops and says something to the other one. \nBoth turn around and head back to the SUV. \nThe DRIVER JACQUES BRUNO, a large Quebecois man, wearing a full-length fur coat gets out. They argue. He pulls out a LONG PISTOL and motions the men to the Acclaim. \nRAY What the hell is he doing? \nRay reaches for her gun. \nLILA Keep that thing down. \nBruno walks towards the Acclaim. \nLILA (CONT'D) Roll down the window and see what he wants. \nRAY What the hell is going on here? \nLILA Just roll it down. \nBruno stands at Ray's window. \nRay slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the window.

ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - SAME                    52 \nThey continue down the road to the reservation line. After they pass the sign: YOU ARE ENTERING THE LAND OF THE MOHAWK, Ray pulls over and stops. \nRay takes the money and consolidates it into one paper bag. \nLILA What about mine? \nRAY We're even now. \nThey stare at each other for a second or two, but Ray does not take out the gun.

From a shirt pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards. \nShe throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her cigarettes. \nShe takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream home, \"The Commodore\" a gleaming pre-fab structure with a landscaped yard and a family with paid-for smiles. \nAfter a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties. \n60   EXT.

She grabs Ray through the window and the dealer pulls her off. \nRAY (CONT'D) What's the matter with her!? \nDEALER She had something in the bag. \nThe woman continues screaming in Urdu. \nRAY What is she saying!? \nHe speaks to her in Urdu. \nDEALER She says her baby.

It is a boy. \nShe tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response. \nLILA It's dead. \nRay keeps giving it air. There is no response but she keeps at it. Then, between breaths: \nRAY Tap the bottom of his feet. \nLILA Why? \nRAY That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born. \nRay puts the baby on Lila's lap. She pulls away. \nLILA I don't want to touch it. \nRAY Well, I can't hold it and drive. \nRay cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby. Lila stares down at the baby in her lap, not touching it. \nLILA I don't think it matters. \nRAY At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up. \nLILA But it's too late. \nRAY Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold. \n89   INT.

To Bob's. \nLILA He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut. \nRAY What if he searches the car.

BOB'S MOTEL - SAME                                     98 \nRay and Lila look around the shabby motel office circa 1950s with a few threadbare chairs. No one is at the front desk. \nRay ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door. She carefully opens it to a small office with a desk, cluttered with papers and, beyond it, another door. Ray knocks and opens it to: \nA living room hung with heavy red Pakistani fabrics and lights. The dealer and the Pakistani man study a map of New York State spread out on the table. \nBehind them the Pakistani woman sits on the couch. \nRay comes in, followed by Lila carrying the baby. \nRAY We found him. \nThe Pakistani woman looks up, sees the bundle and hurries across the room to Lila. Lila holds out the baby with a little smile and the Pakistani woman snatches it out of her arms. \nThe Pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the baby -- alive. She sinks to her knees letting out a wail. \nLila's eyes fill with tears. Ray chokes back her own. \nRAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) Come on.

I called a friend. \nRAY Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know. \nT.J. No, its not. \nRAY Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news. \nT.J. It's not like you were gonna get it. \nRAY Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide. \nRAY Absolutely. \nHe eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible. \nTROOPER NAPOLI Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday. \nRAY Thanks. You, too. \nRay stands and watches the trooper drive away. She feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold. \nWhen she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it. \n106   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                  106 \nT.J. listens at the door. Ricky looks up. \nRICKY Why is the police man here? \nT.J. Shh. \nFrom outside the door: \nRAY (O.S.)

What did he want? Did something happen to Dad? \nRAY No. \nT.J. Then what did he want? \nShe points to the blackened siding on the trailer. \nRAY Did you have a fire last night? \nT.J. The pipes froze so I fixed `um. \nRAY You fixed um? \nT.J. Yeah. \nRAY Did you happen to use the blow torch? \nShe walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a mass of charred and melted insulation. \nRAY (CONT'D) Look at this. We can't live here anymore! \nT.J. It's just a tin crapper. \nRAY No, it was our house. \nT.J. So, we're gettin' a new one, right? \nRAY Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother. \nShe grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but it is indestructible. \nT.J. It's not yours, he gave it to me. \nShe goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow torch on the ground and aims at it -- but T.J. grabs it. \nRAY Put it down. \nT.J. No! \nRAY Put it down. \nT.J. Are you gonna shoot me now, too? \nRAY Put that thing down! \nHe ignites the blow torch to spite her. \nT.J. Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. Maybe that's why he left. \nRAY That was an accident. \nT.J. Some accident you shot him in the foot. \nRAY He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J. \nT.J. So, he'd done it before. \nHe aims it at her. She walks towards him. He increases the flame. \nRAY There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move. \nLila keeps walking. \nRAY (CONT'D) I just need one more run to get the double. \nLila keeps walking. \nRAY (CONT'D) Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay? \nLila keeps walking. \nLILA I don't want it. \nRAY What is it then?! \nLila keeps walking. \nRAY (CONT'D) Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag? \nLila keeps walking. Ray follows trying to figure her out. \nRAY (CONT'D) You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby. \nLILA I got enough. \nRAY Yeah, but you gotta get him first. \nLila stops dead in her tracks and looks at Ray. \nRAY (CONT'D) I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun. \nLila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets in the Acclaim with Ray. \nANGLE FROM BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE: The Ticket Taker watches the Acclaim drive away. \n112   EXT.

The pipes can never freeze. \nRay gets out. \nRAY (CONT'D) I'll be back. \nShe disappears into the Office. \nLila looks at the house. \n114   INT. OFFICE, VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - NIGHT            114 \nRay comes in on Guy Versailles giving a young couple the hard sell. \nVERSAILLES ...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up- \nRAY I wanna schedule a delivery. \nVersailles looks up, annoyed. He plasters on a smile. \nVERSAILLES (to the couple) Give me just a second. \nHe tries to take Ray aside. \nVERSAILLES (CONT'D) What do you want? \nShe pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket. \nVERSAILLES (CONT'D) Is this all of it? \nRAY It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow. \nVERSAILLES I told you all or nothing. \nShe holds out the cash. The couple tries not to watch. \nRAY Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it. \nHe picks up his full-length fur coat. \nBRUNO (CONT'D) D'is way. \nThey follow him out the back of the club. The Bartender follows. \n120   EXT. PARKING LOT, CLUB SUPER SEXE - SAME                   120 \nThey wait. \nBRUNO D'at your car? \nHe points to the Acclaim parked a few feet away. They nod. He walks out to a shed and unlocks the door. Two very young CHINESE GIRLS, sickly and pale, wearing jean jackets look vacantly out. \nBruno signals them to get out. \nBRUNO (CONT'D) Open the trunk. \nLILA We need to get paid, first. \nBRUNO Oh, yes. \nHe pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it to Lila. She counts it out. \nLILA You only got six hundred here. \nBRUNO You get the rest at drop off. \nLILA It's six hundred apiece. \nThe girls stand shivering by the trunk. \nBRUNO That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now you want to change? \nLila and Ray look at each other. \nLILA It's twelve hundred. \nBRUNO You want to make a problem? \nBruno glances at the Bartender watching from the back door of the club. \nBRUNO (CONT'D) (annoyed by Ray) ...because you're not making a problem for me. And you're making a problem for them. Let me show you something. \nHe approaches the two girls. \nHe grabs one of the girls by the hair, kicks her in the back of the knees forcing her to the ground. \nLila looks at Ray. The girl tries to get on her feet, but each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees again. \nLILA (to Ray) Let's just go. \nHeld up by her hair, the girl slides around helplessly. Lila winces at the sight. Ray stares at Bruno. \nRAY Okay. We'll take them. \nLila looks at Ray. \nBruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet. \nLILA Let's go. \nRAY Just open the trunk. \nLila leans into the passenger side of the Acclaim and pops the trunk. Bruno looks at Ray: \nBRUNO You must be the brains of the operation. \nHe motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after them. \nLila get in the passenger side and Bruno starts for the back door of the club. \nRay pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at Bruno. \nRAY Turn around! \nBruno stops and turns around. \nRAY (CONT'D) I want the rest. \nHe opens his fur coat. \nBRUNO (cool) I don't have any more. \nIn the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol is visible. \nRAY (to the Bartender) Go get it. \nBruno looks around and nods at the bartender. The bartender panics not knowing what to do and begins speaking in French to Bruno. \nRay speeds towards it, but the Quebec cruiser still pursues them. \nRAY What the hell? We're on the reservation. \nLILA They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money. \nRAY Shit! \nRay bounces into the woods through the trees. \n124   EXT. ACCLAIM ON RIVER BANK - NIGHT                        124 \nThe Acclaim emerges from the woods at the edge of the river.

ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                       129 \nRay and Lila hold their breath as they cross the river. They make it over the midpoint and Ray accelerates toward the shore. \nTwo hundred feet from the bank, the BACK RIGHT TIRE HITS A CRACK in the ice. The TIRE DROPS and the UNDER BELLY of the car SCRAPES THE ICE. SPARKS FLY. \nThe RIGHT REAR END of the car DROPS DOWN and the FRONT LEFT TIRE LIFTS off the ice. The car TEETERS BACK AND FORTH. \nRay and Lila sit perfectly still. \nLILA We gotta crawl out the window. \nLila rolls down her window. The car shifts. The wad of cash SLIDES toward the edge of the dashboard. Ray grabs it. \nLila pops the trunk. The two Chinese girls scramble out.

No one is there. \n133   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY - NIGHT                                133 \nA small house on the river's edge with a hand painted sign:\"Bakery\" Jimmy drives up. He helps Ray, Lila and the Chinese girls to the door. \nRosalie and Barbara shoot him an ANGRY STARE. He shrugs. \nBARBARA We can expel her. \nBERNIE You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is. \nROSALIE She makes the Mohawk people look bad. \nBERNIE But she has a Mohawk son. \nROSALIE She cost us a Mohawk son. \nBERNIE Jake was a big boy.

That's so stupid. \nRAY You're going to school. \nHe follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus rolling up out front. \nSuddenly, Ray remembers: \nRAY (CONT'D) Wait, wait. \nThey turn around. She digs in her pockets. \nRAY (CONT'D) Here. Lunch money. \nThey take it and keep running for the bus. \nRay looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. She takes out her second to last one. She lights it and takes out her mascara. \nShe tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears keep getting in the way. \nCUT TO: \n7   INT.

Not here for long, not really committed. \nRay follows him to the stock room. \nRAY When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago. \nHe opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip. \nMATT It's my opinion. \nRAY Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late. \n", "test2_input": "He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else to say.

It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five. \nRay shakes her head. \nMOHAWK TEENAGER (CONT'D) Thanks, anyway. Have a good day. \n10   INT./EXT.

Ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her window. \nRAY That's my car. \nLila SPINS around. \nLILA Huh? \nRAY (points to the Acclaim) What are you doing with my car? \nLila fingers the keys in her hand. \nLILA That? I found it. \nRAY You stole it. \nLILA The keys were in it. \nRAY So you just took it...? \nLila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind her. \nRay gets out of the Horizon and walks up to the camper door and takes out her cell phone. \nRAY (CONT'D) We'll just see what the troopers say about that. \nLILA (O.S.) (From inside camper) Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here. This is Mohawk territory. \nRay stops dialing closes up her phone, then goes to her car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper. \nRAY (knocks with the gun) You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now. \nThere is no reponse.

Okay? \nRay nods never taking her eyes off the dog. \nLila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out of sight. \nOut of the garage comes JIMMY, 33, a stocky Mohawk, eating a sandwich. \nJimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila. \nThunder growls. \nJIMMY Thunder!

Probably tangled in river weeds. \nShe gives Ray a spooky look. \nLILA (CONT'D) You better slow down there are ruts out here.

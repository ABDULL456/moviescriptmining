INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - DAY                      1 \nA sign reads \"Bridge to Canada.\" \nA steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St. Lawrence River. \nCars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs officials inspect and question impatient drivers. \nBeyond them a smaller sign: \"THANK YOU FOR VISITING MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for you\". \n2   EXT. BELOW THE BRIDGE - DAY                                 2 \nThe river stretches for miles in either direction, frozen, and still with trees on either side. \n3   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD, MASSENA NEW YORK - DAY             3 \nRAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open, smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in the cold morning air. \nHer bare feet rest on the cold ground. \nHer 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE. \nAround her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride. \nBeyond the yard, flat, winterbare land. \nAfter a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR., leans out the trailer door. \nT.J. We're out of Capt'n Crunch. \nHis breath is visible in the cold. \nRAY Just give him toast. \nT.J. We got no butter, we got no jelly. \nRay is out of ideas. He expects her to move, but she stays still. He looks around the yard. \nT.J. (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nRAY Listening for the trucks. \nT.J. Are they really coming? \nRAY Yeah. \nT.J. Where's dad? \nShe is silent. \nT.J. (CONT'D) (says it slow) Where's dad? \nShe looks at him. \nRAY I don't know how he found it, T.J. \nT.J. Found what? \nRay takes a drag off her cigarette. T.J. walks over to the car. \nT.J. (CONT'D) The money? \nRAY I locked it in my glove compartment. \nT.J. looks in at the OPEN AND EMPTY GLOVE COMPARTMENT. \nT.J. That was stupid. \nRAY Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened. \nT.J. Did you tell him you had it? \nRAY Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out. \nT.J. Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That's the stupidest place you could have put it. \nRAY He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay! \nT.J. Did he leave anything? \nShe shakes her head. \n", "test1_true": "RAY Nothing. \nT.J. You could look for him? \nRAY He could be anywhere. \nT.J. We should look for him. \nRAY Where? \nT.J. The Rez, \nRAY With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now. \nT.J. So let's go, let's find him before he blows it all. \n(CONT'D) \nRAY I can't. \nT.J. What do you mean? \nRAY I just can't do it anymore. \nT.J. But he'll lose it all. \nRAY T.J., we can't make him stop. \nT.J. He stole our money. Call the Troopers. \nRAY It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too. \nT.J. So you're just gonna sit there? \nRAY I'm sorry. \nIn the distance the RUMBLE OF TRUCKS. Ray hears it. It gets louder. \nT.J. Another Christmas in the tin crapper. \nT.J. goes into the shed and slams the door. \nRay throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer. \n4   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                      4 \nShe looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV. \nAn enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture. \nRay hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into a pair or jeans and a t-shirt. \nA sleepy-eyed, toe-headed boy, RICKY, 5, walks in, shirtless in pajama bottoms, eyes shining. \nRICKY Is it here? \nRay stops what she's doing when she sees him and kneels down. \nRAY Hey, little sleepy head. \nRICKY Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready. \nHe drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the corner. \nThe RUMBLE OUTSIDE GROWS LOUDER. Ricky BOLTS out of the bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door. \nRAY Wait a sec- \nHe bursts into the yard where: \n5   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                       5 \nA PICK-UP TRUCK DRAPED WITH A \"WIDE LOAD\" banner leads TWO SEMIS hauling halves of a DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind. \nRicky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly, trying not to pee himself. \nT.J. comes out of the shed. \nThe Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard. \nGUY VERSAILLES, pot-bellied, in a green velour running suit, squeezes out of his truck. On the door: \"MASSENA MODULAR AND MOBILE HOMES, NEW AND RECONDITIONED.\" \nRicky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and tries to climb the side of it. The TRUCK DRIVER looks down from his cab. \nT.J. (to Ricky) Get down. \nRay peeks out the kitchen curtain. \n", "test1_id": 1566, "test2_input": "After a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a pasted-on smile. \nRAY We're all ready for ya'. \nShe points to the new concrete foundation. He consults a clipboard. \nVERSAILLES We'll need the balloon payment to unload. \nT.J. looks at Ray. \nRAY We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway- \nVERSAILLES Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not? \nRAY It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back- \nVERSAILLES When's he gonna be back? \nRAY As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you. \nT.J. could crawl out of his skin. \nVERSAILLES (ironic smile) This is the second time you've dragged me out here. If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit. \nHe walks toward his car. She follows him. \nRAY Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house- \nHe gets in the car. \nVERSAILLES Call me when you have the balloon payment. \nHe makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's rev their engines and grind into reverse. \nRAY I'll call you... \nHer voice is DROWNED OUT by REVVING engines. \nRicky rushes to her. \nRICKY Wait, where are they going? \nShe takes his face in her hands. \nRAY Listen to me. We'll get them back. \nRICKY But why are they leaving? \nRAY Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey. \nRICKY That's our house! \nHe BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing after the semis. Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out of steam and stops, panting. \nShe catches up to him and tries to hug him. He pushes her away. She gets down on her knees and takes his face in her hands. \nRAY We're gonna get it back. \nShe picks him up and walks back to the trailer. Ricky looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down the road. \nRAY (CONT'D) (to T.J.) You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus. Let's get your clothes on, Ricky. \nT.J. just stares at her. \nT.J. I can get a job you know. \nRAY You're 15, T.J. \nT.J. They won't ask any questions. \nRAY You're finishing school. \nT.J. Come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at All for a Dollar do you? \nRAY You're going to school. \nShe goes inside.   T.J. follows. \nT.J. I bet I could make more than you do. \nShe ignores him. \n6   INT.

Aren't we even gonna look for him? \nRAY No! I'm going to work and you're going to school. \nT.J. That's it? \nRAY The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same. \nRICKY Where did he go? \nRAY He had to take a business trip. \nT.J. rolls his eyes. \nT.J. Aren't you even gonna look for him? \nRAY And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack. \nT.J. stares, sullen. \nRAY (CONT'D) Go on! \nRICKY When is daddy coming home? \nRAY I don't know, Ricky. \nT.J. I can't believe you're not even gonna look for him. \nRAY Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer) \nT.J. The reservation. \nRAY I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now. \nShe helps Ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss. \nT.J. (shakes his head) The glove compartment. That's so stupid. \nRAY You're going to school. \nHe follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus rolling up out front. \nSuddenly, Ray remembers: \nRAY (CONT'D) Wait, wait. \nThey turn around. She digs in her pockets. \nRAY (CONT'D) Here. Lunch money. \nThey take it and keep running for the bus. \nRay looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. She takes out her second to last one. She lights it and takes out her mascara. \nShe tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears keep getting in the way. \nCUT TO: \n7   INT. ALL FOR A DOLLAR STORE - DAY                              7 \nRAY stacks shelves with a knock-off version of plastic \"My Little Pony\" in a messy aisle of boxes. \nMATT, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by. \nRAY (soft) Matt. Could I talk to you? \nHe looks at her. \nRAY (CONT'D) I need to come on full-time. \nMatt blinks with a blank expression then: \nMATT I see you as a short timer. \nRAY What is that? \nMATT A short timer. Not here for long, not really committed. \nRay follows him to the stock room. \nRAY When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago. \nHe opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip. \nMATT It's my opinion. \nRAY Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late. \n", "test2_id": 1567, "test3_input": "He picks up his full-length fur coat. \nBRUNO (CONT'D) D'is way. \nThey follow him out the back of the club.

Two very young CHINESE GIRLS, sickly and pale, wearing jean jackets look vacantly out. \nBruno signals them to get out. \nBRUNO (CONT'D) Open the trunk. \nLILA We need to get paid, first. \nBRUNO Oh, yes. \nHe pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it to Lila. She counts it out. \nLILA You only got six hundred here. \nBRUNO You get the rest at drop off. \nLILA It's six hundred apiece. \nThe girls stand shivering by the trunk. \nBRUNO That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now you want to change? \nLila and Ray look at each other. \nLILA It's twelve hundred. \nBRUNO You want to make a problem? \nBruno glances at the Bartender watching from the back door of the club. \nBRUNO (CONT'D) (annoyed by Ray) ...because you're not making a problem for me. And you're making a problem for them. Let me show you something. \nHe approaches the two girls. \nHe grabs one of the girls by the hair, kicks her in the back of the knees forcing her to the ground. \nLila looks at Ray. The girl tries to get on her feet, but each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees again. \nLILA (to Ray) Let's just go. \nHeld up by her hair, the girl slides around helplessly. Lila winces at the sight. Ray stares at Bruno. \nRAY Okay. We'll take them. \nLila looks at Ray. \nBruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet. \nLILA Let's go. \nRAY Just open the trunk. \nLila leans into the passenger side of the Acclaim and pops the trunk. Bruno looks at Ray: \nBRUNO You must be the brains of the operation. \nHe motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after them. \nLila get in the passenger side and Bruno starts for the back door of the club. \nRay pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at Bruno. \nRAY Turn around! \nBruno stops and turns around. \nRAY (CONT'D) I want the rest. \nHe opens his fur coat. \nBRUNO (cool) I don't have any more. \nIn the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol is visible. \nRAY (to the Bartender) Go get it. \nBruno looks around and nods at the bartender.

Lila steers. Then Ray takes the wheel as they swerve out onto the main road. \nRAY He shot me. \nRay wipes the blood from her forehead. \nLILA You should'a just taken the money from me? \nRAY (blood streams down her face) I'm tired of people stealing from me.    Is it all there? \nLILA We gotta get outta here, first. \nRAY Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there! \nRay hands her the wad of money. Lila struggles to put on her glasses and counts out the money. \nRAY (CONT'D) Is it there? \nLILA It's all there. \nRAY Good. \nLILA Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the speed limit. \nRay smiles and wipes away the blood. \nThey drive a short distance.

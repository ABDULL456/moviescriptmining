ALFRED AND ALMA HITCHCOCK 
Step out into a sea of FLASHBULBS. Hitch basks in the limelight while Alma, his razor-sharp, charming wife of over 30 years stands in the background, uncomfortable with all the attention. 
Hitchcock's agent LEW WASSERMAN, 45, dynamic, charismatic, comes into view. 
LEW WASSERMAN This thing is going to be gigantic. I wish I had twenty percent of the take. 
Lew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS. 
REPORTER ONE Does tonight's incredible reaction surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK No, when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter. (then, to a BEAUTIFUL BLONDE FAN) Any questions, my dear? 
The blonde fan, holding out her autograph book, shakes her head `no' and giggles. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) A pity. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
The reporters crack up. Alma manages a polite smile as Lew helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment to sign his autograph for the blond fan... 
REPORTER TWO Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six motion pictures. You host a hit TV show seen around the world. You're the most famous director in the history of the medium... but you're sixty years old. Shouldn't you just quit while you're ahead? 
HOLDING ON HITCHCOCK 
motionless and quietly devastated as FLASHBULBS CRACKLE over his face. The whiteness transforms into... 
INT. THE HITCHCOCKS' BEL AIR HOME - BATHROOM - MORNING 
THE GLEAMING WHITE TILES of a bathroom. We move past chrome fixtures that evoke those in Spellbound and Psycho and arrive at that same pudgy hand pouring CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC '53 into a cut crystal glass. 
HITCHCOCK 
soaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor. 
At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes shift to the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door. 
IN THE MIRROR 
We catch fleeting glimpses of Alma in a white half-slip and matching bra. She takes out some NYLONS and holds them up to the light. 
Hitchcock watches enthralled. He puts down his glass and shifts a little in the tub, causing the water to lap against the sides. 
BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Alma pauses when she hears the small splashes. Neither upset nor amused she continues about her business, taking a skirt from the drawer. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALMA Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows. 
Hitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd been reading the whole time. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Talking of arrows, did you read Mr. Weiler's review in the New York Times? Apparently, he found "the climax" to be -- and I quote -- "overdrawn." 
ALMA I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a climax in years. 
Alma steps into her skirt as Hitch opens the London Times. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK And how about this little grenade? (READING) North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers." (BEAT) And just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense. 
Hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs. They're all young. Thinner. And with hair. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Why do they keep looking for new masters of suspense when they still have the original? 
ALMA Don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me. 
He catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks further down into the water to hide his protruding belly. 
Alma comes in, takes the newspapers from him and puts them on the side. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Stop reading them. You've been reading them for a week now. 
She puts down the TOILET SEAT and sits on it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Tell me, dear. Am I really too old? 
ALMA Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one. 
She comes over and kisses the top of his head. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you?

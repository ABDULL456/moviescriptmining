She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Where in the plane? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
KELLER Find them yourself. 
MURPHY What the hell's going on? 
She glares at him. 
CARRIE The cannisters are on the plane. 
She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Throw him in the holding cell. 
The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller screams. 
The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away. 
Murphy looks to Pryce -- 
MURPHY Who the hell are you? 
Carrie looks at Pryce. 
PRYCE Name's Pryce. 
Pryce looks at Carrie. 
CARRIE He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now! 
Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare -- 
MURPHY We don't have time. We'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands. 
Pryce steps in -- 
PRYCE It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) PRYCE (cont'd) Once that plane is in the air, we've as good as lost it. Just give us 10 minutes. 
Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly -- 
CARRIE Sam, do what is right here.    Come on. 
MURPHY Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour. 
CARRIE We'll need some help. 
MURPHY I'll send what I can. 
He leaves. 
TIME CUT TO: 
INT. LC-130 - DAY 
Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo. 
PRYCE It's clean. 
Carrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off. 
PRYCE (cont'd) You check the cockpit? 
CARRIE Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller? 
PRYCE I don't get it, why lie to us -- we have him either way. He's stuck here. 
Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that -- 
CARRIE He's buying time. 
Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace. 
INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER 
Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the evac. Pryce is close behind. 
CARRIE Out of the way! 
INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER

JOSH Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that. 
SUSAN You don't...you don't know me that well. 
JOSH Yes I do.  You're one of the nicest people I've met. 
SUSAN How do you do it? 
SCENE 52 
PAUL What's this? 
SUSAN What does it look like?!  Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and your exercise tape!  Oh, and I want my keys back! 
PAUL Sure.  It's just some scratches.  He'll get over it. 
SUSAN Oh, it has nothing to do with him. 
PAUL Oh come on Susan!  He's just another link in the chain!  First it was Tom Caulfield, then Handlen.  Then Golding, then me!  Am I missing somebody? 
SUSAN It's not like that anymore! 
PAUL What is so special about Baskin? 
SUSAN He's a grown up! 
PAUL Susan. 
SUSAN I can't believe you brought up Golding. 
SCENE 53 
BILLY And many more!  What are you going to wish for this time? 
SCENE 54 
BILLY I know what we can do!  We can go out and get some beers, some dirty magazines and go back... 
JOSH Uh, I can't Billy. 
BILLY What you mean you can't?  Of course you can!  It's your birthday!

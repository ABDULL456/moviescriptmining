MARTHA Where is she? 
WOMAN Who is this? 
MARTHA Who is this? 
WOMAN It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this. 
Martha hangs up. The phone rings. She unplugs the phone and collapses on the floor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FARM - DAY 
Martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing. Martha looks out into the feild to see Patrick talking with Sarah. She is enamoured by him. 
EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY 
Zoe, Martha, Sarah and MAX are shooting bottles in the woods. 
MAX Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but I think you're hopeless. 
ZOE I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it. 
MAX Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday. 
Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe, wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on. 
MAX (CONT'D) God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes my willy hard. 
Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several shots. He misses the bottles. 
ZOE What happened Doc? I should be teaching you. 
He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle. 
MARTHA Alright, my turn. 
Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping the gun. 
ZOE (PLAYFUL) Alright Max, was this just an excuse to grope Marcy. 
MAX I'm teaching her how to shoot. Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze. 
Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha fires a few shots and misses. 
PATRICK Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel how they made you feel in your stomach. Take a deep breath, feel it all moving out into your hands. Let it build. It's transferring to the gun, building in the gun. Now release. 
She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A smile grows on martha's face. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) (SMILING) Feels good right? 
Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Now try that.

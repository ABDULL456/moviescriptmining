Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room. 
Mark stares after her. 
INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost in anger. 
HELEN So he was a scientist? 
He keeps his face averted. 
HELEN What kind of scientist, Mark? 
MARK Biologist. 
HELEN What was he trying to do to you? 
He doesn't answer. 
HELEN Mark!... 
He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness to understand on her face. 
HELEN What was he trying to do to you? 
MARK Watch me... grow up... 
She walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wipes his forehead. 
MARK He wanted a record of a growing child... complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me... at all times... 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 
MARK I never knew... the whole of my childhood... one moment's privacy... 
HELEN And those lights in your eyes?... and that - thing? 
MARK He was interested ... in the reactions of the nervous system... to fear...  Fear? 
HELEN Fear? 
MARK Fear. 
CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear'. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK 
We are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf. The full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor A. N. Lewis. 
MARK'S VOICE IS OVERLAID: 
MARK (O.S.) Especially fear in children - and how they react to it. 
CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear' on the next book. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK 
The full title reads: FEAR AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, PART I. PROFESSOR A. N. LEWIS.  There is a row of such books all by Professor Lewis. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 
MARK I think he learned a lot... from me... I'd wake up... screaming... sometimes... and he'd be there... taking notes... and pictures... and I'm sure good came of it... for some people... He was brilliant. 
HELEN A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it? 
MARK I don't know... if he did... but if he did... he'll have learned something of value... 
HELEN If only about lizards!  Mark - it sounds to me as if your father was... 
MARK He founded clinics. 
HELEN He sounds completely... 
MARK He was famous! Professor A. N. Lewis... three clinics. 
HELEN Why do you still live in his house... and watch his films? 
MARK They helped make me... what I am. 
HELEN A photographer? It's no wonder, is it? But you still haven't shown me anything you've photographed! 
He looks at her in silence. 
HELEN Will you? 
There is a knock on the door. 
MARK One day... 
He hurries to the door, and opens it. 
Tony is standing there. 
TONY Excuse me, but... 
From Tony's POV WE SEE Helen looking at the door of the dark room. 
TONY Oh, there you are, Helen. 
She turns towards him. 
TONY The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if... 
HELEN I'm coming. 
She turns to Mark. 
HELEN I wish you'd join us. 
Mark shakes his head. 
MARK Thanks... work. 
HELEN I hope that you... 
She is suddenly aware of Tony watching her. She glances at the birthday cake on the table. 
HELEN ... have a sweet tooth! 
She smiles at him. 
HELEN Thank you... for my present. 
She goes into the passage. 
TONY Good night, old boy. 
He puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door.

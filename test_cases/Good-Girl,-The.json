{"test1_input": "THE GOOD GIRL \nWritten by \nMike White \nJUSTINE (v.o.) As a girl, you see the world like a giant candy store, filled with sweet candy and such. But one day you look around and see a prison and you're on death row. You wanna run, or scream or cry. But something's locking you up. Are the other folks cows, chewing cud till the hour come and their heads roll? Or are they just keeping quiet, like you... Planning their escape? \n(Camera zooms on Holden/Tom) \nGWEN On your left, honey. \nJUSTINE What's that cashier's name? \nGWEN Can't say. \nJUSTINE When did he start working here? \nGWEN Don't know. Yesterday? \nJUSTINE Who is he? \nGWEN Don't know. Can't say. \nJUSTINE What are you doing? \nGWEN It's called work, princess. Kind of fun. You might want to give it a go someday. \nCHERYL Attention, shoppers. There's a Retail Rodeo special on aisle three. Liquid drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for $5. Liquid drain cleaner has churning power and will churn right through your pipes. Ladies, shove something clean and new up your filthy pipes. Liquid drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Retail Rodeo. \n", "test1_true": "JUSTINE Yeah. \nCORNY I was just curious. Have you ever been to a Bible study? \nJUSTINE Yeah. \nCORNY We got a good one going on every Wednesday at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney comes, Benita comes. You got any interest in reading the Bible? \nJUSTINE I have my own, you know, beliefs. \nCORNY We don't preach fire and brimstone. Just the Ten Commandments. We\u0092re not interested in scaring people. We\u0092re about loving Jesus. \nJUSTINE I kinda like my nights to myself. \nCORNY Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you. Drive safe. \nJUSTINE Bye-bye. \nBUBBA Hey, Justine. \nPHIL Hey, Teeny. How was your day? \nJUSTINE The same. How was yours? \nBUBBA The wind was flipping paint in our eyes. \nPHIL Paint stings. Feel like I've been attacked by hornets in my eyeballs. \n", "test1_id": 1494, "test2_input": "PHIL Were you been? \nJUSTINE Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin' up all over the store. I had to take her to the hositpal, and sat with her. \nPHIL Did she sick up on you? \nJUSTINE No. \nPHIL Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles) \nJUSTINE It's not funny, Phil, this is serious. I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too. And the next day. \nJACK Justine? What happened to you? \nJUSTINE What? \nJACK I went down to St. Catherine's to check up on Gwen. I looked all over for you, she was askin' for you. \nJUSTINE Well, how is she? \nJACK She was heavin' up until there was nothin' left to heave. Doctor said she must've eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite in it or somethin'. \nJUSTINE I bet it was those blackberries. \nJACK They're gonna keep her in there until she gets better so you're gonna have to supervise cosmetics. \n(there they go again) \nJUSTINE Stop it, somebody's gonna see! \n", "test2_true": "JUSTINE I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas when I was eleven. My daddy was in the Air Force. \nHOLDEN I wanna knock open your head and see what's inside. I've had so much pain in my life. I know you have too, I can see it. \n(at the hotel, in bed, probably after they made love) \nJUSTINE Holden gave me two of his stories to read. It's like what a story would be. I was about a boy who was put upon, his mother was cold and selfish, and his father wanted him to play football. Other people didn't get him, especially girls. Then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him. So he starts actin' out, drinkin', and doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end the boy kills himself but jumpin' over abridge. The second story was pretty much the same as the first. Except at the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' a bottle of bug poison. \nJUSTINE Your stories are intense. \nHOLDEN I just wanna leave some kind of legacy. Somethin' great. After that I don't care what happens to me. \nJUSTINE Don't say that. I wish there was a story about me. I don't know who would read it though. \nHOLDEN I would. \nJUSTINE I like this. I like havin' a secret. You gave me a secret Holden. \nHOLDEN Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious. And dark and twisted. \nJUSTINE I'm going to hell, aren't I? \nHOLDEN Yes, you are. \n(she rolls on top of him and they kiss) \n(they exit the hotel and Justine sees a car) \n", "test2_id": 1495, "test3_input": "JUSTINE Why? \nHOLDEN What do you mean 'why'? I thought you hated your life. \nJUSTINE I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You are really depressed. \nHOLDEN I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal the money whatever it takes. You just, just whatever you want as long as it's you and me. Please don't forsake me Justine. \nJUSTINE Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere; Justine and Holden are sitting on the car, Holden's smoking) \nJUSTINE I realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I'd have to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops. \n(Justine goes up to the \"Blackberry Man\") \nJUSTINE How much are the blackberries? \nBLACKBERRY MAN A tin for two dollars, miss. (gives her the blackberries) There you go. \nJUSTINE Thank you. \n(Holden and Justine are in the car again, Justine's driving) \nJUSTINE Have a blackberry. \nHOLDEN We need a plan. We can't keep livin' day to day. We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick.... \nJUSTINE Have a blackberry, Holden! \nHOLDEN But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're sweet. If I could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the answer. I gotta do. But If I ever do, I end up thinking about it instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine pushes the blackberry he's about to eat away from his mouth) What...? What was that for? \n", "test3_true": "(Jack talking to Holden about something) \n(Justine's talking to Holden's parents.) \nJUSTINE I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well, I think he's mentally ill. He has this idea in his head that we've had some sort of affair. Which is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, and I just think he would be better off in a place where people, professionals, could take care of him. Otherwise, he's just gonna get himself in trouble. \nPHIL What are you doin' in here? What's that? \nJUSTINE It's a home pregnancy test. \nPHIL Why you takin' it? \nJUSTINE 'Cause I still haven't gotten my period. \nPHIL What's it say? \nJUSTINE Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could you give me a minute please? \nPHIL I wanna be here when you find out. \nJUSTINE Okay. \nPHIL The little plastic doohickey's turnin' blue. What's that mean? \nJUSTINE Blue? \nPHIL Bright blue. \n", "test3_id": 1496}

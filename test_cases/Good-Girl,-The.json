{"train": "THE GOOD GIRL \nWritten by \nMike White \nJUSTINE (v.o.) As a girl, you see the world like a giant candy store, filled with sweet candy and such. But one day you look around and see a prison and you're on death row. You wanna run, or scream or cry. But something's locking you up. Are the other folks cows, chewing cud till the hour come and their heads roll? Or are they just keeping quiet, like you... Planning their escape? \n(Camera zooms on Holden/Tom) \nGWEN On your left, honey. \nJUSTINE What's that cashier's name? \nGWEN Can't say. \nJUSTINE When did he start working here? \nGWEN Don't know. Yesterday? \nJUSTINE Who is he? \nGWEN Don't know. Can't say. \nJUSTINE What are you doing? \nGWEN It's called work, princess. Kind of fun. You might want to give it a go someday. \nCHERYL Attention, shoppers. There's a Retail Rodeo special on aisle three. Liquid drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for $5. Liquid drain cleaner has churning power and will churn right through your pipes. Ladies, shove something clean and new up your filthy pipes. Liquid drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Retail Rodeo. \nJUSTINE He didn't say. \nPHIL You could make paint where, at different angles, the house is different colours. You stand at the front door and the house is red. You stand at the street and the house is green. Or you could make, like, an invisible paint. Make the whole house disappear. \nBUBBA What would be really neat is a paint that could change the molecular structure of a house, like a chemical acid deal. \nPHIL What do you think, Teeny? \nJUSTINE I think you two are a pair of potheads. \nCHERYL You getting a whole one of these or a half? \nCUSTOMER That oneright there. \nCHERYL You didn't bring this into the store? \nCUSTOMER No. \nCHERYL Well then, I'll charge you for it. This is a hand lotion. So don't put it anywhere else, even if you need lubrication. We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer is at fault. Here's your change and Fuck you very much. \nCUSTOMER Excuse me? \nCHERYL Thank you very much. \nGWEN Good as new, I'll tell ya, good as new. \nJUSTINE Now, you might be interested in purchasing some of the products I used today... \nCUSTOMER Oh, I'm not buying anything today. \nHOLDEN I twisted up my ankle on the stairs. I was wonderin', maybe you could give me a ride home? \nJUSTINE Yeah, sure okay. \nHOLDEN Alright I'll talk to you about it later. \nGWEN All I know is, everyone should have one beau, before anyone has two beaus. \nJUSTINE He's not my beau, he's my friend. \nCHERYL Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers! There's a Retail Rodeo special on all bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls and goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering these aisles, day after day. I'll put a Halloween curse on you. \nGWEN Night Corny. Happy Halloween. \nCORNY Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all the same. \nGWEN Which ankle did you twist, Holden? \nHOLDEN My, uh, left. \nGWEN Maybe you should put some cold water on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame. \nHOLDEN Okay. \nJUSTINE You're a writer so you have yourself a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine other cities, other jobs I could have. Other husbands. Now I don't even know what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have a husband. \nHOLDEN You said he was a pig. \nJUSTINE Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody. \nGwen I'm okay. I feel a little sick. \nJUSTINE Gwen? Gwen you sick? \nJACK Justine? Justine what's goin' on in here? Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her to a hospital. Justine you drive her. \nJUSTINE Well what time is it? \nJACK It's aquarter to five. Why, you gotta be somewhere? \nJUSTINE Gwen? \nGWEN Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that I sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts. \nJUSTINE I'm gonna let you off here, okay? \nGWEN Okay,You'll meet me inside? \nJUSTINE Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet you inside. \nGWEN Okay. Your a doll. \nHOLDEN Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came. \nJUSTINE I just ditched Gwen at the hospital. \nHOLDEN Oh god, thank god. \nJUSTINE Where are we goin'? \nPHIL Were you been? \nJUSTINE Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin' up all over the store. I had to take her to the hositpal, and sat with her. \nPHIL Did she sick up on you? \nJUSTINE No. \nPHIL Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles) \nJUSTINE It's not funny, Phil, this is serious. I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too. And the next day. \nJACK Justine? What happened to you? \nJUSTINE What? \nJACK I went down to St. Catherine's to check up on Gwen. I looked all over for you, she was askin' for you. \nJUSTINE Well, how is she? \nJACK She was heavin' up until there was nothin' left to heave. Doctor said she must've eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite in it or somethin'. \nJUSTINE I bet it was those blackberries. \nJACK They're gonna keep her in there until she gets better so you're gonna have to supervise cosmetics. \n(there they go again) \nJUSTINE Stop it, somebody's gonna see! \nJUSTINE That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car. Phil takes that truck to work everyday. Bubba picks him up, and drops him off. Why, why would that truck be parked there? \nHOLDEN I don't know. \nJUSTINE If he finds out about us.... \nHOLDEN I won't let him hurt you. \nJUSTINE He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll beat me, but he'll kill you. \nHOLDEN You can't worry about somethin' that hasn't even happened yet. \nJUSTINE I gotta go to the hospital. \nHOLDEN Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls away) \nJUSTINE Don't! I mean he could be followin' us. \nCORNY Justine! Poor lady. She just passed. \nJUSTINE Who? \nCORNY Gwen! She just passed away. \nJUSTINE What do you mean? I thought she had a stomach ache? \nCORNY It got worse. She was on life support all day. \nJUSTINE I don't understand. \n(Justine and Holden are running towards the car and get in) \n(Next scene they're in the car; back seats, kissing) \nJUSTINE What are we doin'? \nHOLDEN Makin' one out of two. \nJUSTINE (sighs) I haven't thought this through. \nHOLDEN Justine, will you leave him? \nJUSTINE And go where? \nHOLDEN Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin' I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend, a pretty one, who knows me and likes me. And they'll be so happy, they'll give me money to write my novel. \nJUSTINE But where will we GO? \nHOLDEN We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye. Only by me. I'll be immortal and then like JD Salinger I'll just vanish. \nPHIL Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good. We got the day off on account of the rain. \nJUSTINE I thought you might. \n(TV sounds) \nBUBBA So I heard about your friend bein' dead, and all. I'm sorry. \nJUSTINE Yeah. She was real healthy too. \nHOLDEN Well, let's go in the store room. \nJUSTINE Just be patient, Holden! \n(Holden looks freaky; sort of like he's losing his mind not being able to be close to her) \nJUSTINE I was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study? \nCORNY Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to have ya. \nJUSTINE Can I bring my husband? \nCORNY 'Course! A couple that prays together stays together. \nPHIL What's this? \nJUSTINE The Holy Bible. There's one for you, and one for me. \nPHIL Not very light is it? \nJUSTINE We're goin' to Bible study. A couple that prays together, stays together. \nPHIL I heard it was the couple that lays together stays together. \nJUSTINE Well you heard wrong. \nJUSTINE Cheryl? You think you can take this one? \nCHERYL Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're gonna make you pretty. Now how do you like your hair? \nJUSTINE He left. \nPHIL Well, I'm ready. Let's go. \nPHIL I don't know what to say about Jesus. I'm stoned. \nJUSTINE Just let the other people do the talking. \nPHIL Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine. \nJUSTINE Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us. \nCORNY Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad you could make it! \nJUSTINE Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil. \nCORNY Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good discussion going tonight. If man is made in God's image, what does that say about God? \nPHIL Yeah, that sounds like a good one. \n(Justine recognizes one of the people. It's the guy who works at the motel where she and Holden have been going to.) \nJUSTINE Phil, come with me to the car. \nPHIL What? \nJUSTINE Come with me to the car, I gotta get somethin'. \nPHIL What's goin' on? \nJUSTINE Thanks. \n(Justine arrives at Bubba's. He opens the door and his dog, Bitz, is barking.) \nBUBBA Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! Back in your corner! Back in your corner, Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock. \nJUSTINE Why? \nBUBBA You know why. \nJUSTINE Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open. Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work. The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer Bubba's image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do. Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle. \nJUSTINE Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you. \nBUBBA But don't you see? This is my chance, for liberation. \nJUSTINE But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness. There's just no way. \nBUBBA I'm gonna have to tell Phil then. \nJUSTINE Why? \nBUBBA He's my best friend. I can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big. He's a cuckhold. \nJUSTINE You wanna cuckhold him yourself! \nBUBBA Well that's different. That isn't about him. That's about my salvation. Look, you've got your choice to make. Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart. Or have sex with me right now. \n(Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name) \nPHIL You didn't even say nothing about the TV bein' fixed. \nJUSTINE Oh. Is it? Thanks. \nPHIL You're welcome. \nJACK Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you talked to Holden lately? He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives. I know you two are friends. \nJUSTINE We're not friends. \nJACK You eat lunch together every day. \nJUSTINE No, we don't. \nJACK Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is lookin' for him. \n(Justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees Holden in the car, more depressed than ever.) \nJUSTINE Oh my god. What are you doin'? \nHOLDEN You're a hooker, you hooker. \nJUSTINE I saw you. You followed me. \nHOLDEN So, how many guys you gettin' with? You gettin' with every guy in the state? \nJUSTINE No, Holden, this is all because of you. He had me over a barrel. If I didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us! \nHOLDEN I'm so alone! \nJUSTINE No, I don't. \nBUBBA I know you're angry and I can figure why. But, from where I stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing. \nJUSTINE Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it. \nBUBBA Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine. \nJUSTINE Bubba, I mean it. \nBUBBA Let me just ask you one thing. How do I stack up against Phil? You know, how do I stack up where it counts? \nNURSE Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request for your presence. \n(Justine knocks on the door.) \nPHIL Who's there? \nJUSTINE It's Justine. (gets into the room) \nPHIL C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I need help. \nJUSTINE You've never done it on your own? \nPHIL Not in a place like this! Not where I have to hand over the results! Just, let me hold your boob. \n(holds her boob; Justine's face is full of pain) \nJUSTINE Ah, they're sore. (Justine looks fed up with everything) \nJUSTINE Why? \nHOLDEN What do you mean 'why'? I thought you hated your life. \nJUSTINE I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You are really depressed. \nHOLDEN I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal the money whatever it takes. You just, just whatever you want as long as it's you and me. Please don't forsake me Justine. \nJUSTINE Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere; Justine and Holden are sitting on the car, Holden's smoking) \nJUSTINE I realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I'd have to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops. \n(Justine goes up to the \"Blackberry Man\") \nJUSTINE How much are the blackberries? \nBLACKBERRY MAN A tin for two dollars, miss. (gives her the blackberries) There you go. \nJUSTINE Thank you. \n(Holden and Justine are in the car again, Justine's driving) \nJUSTINE Have a blackberry. \nHOLDEN We need a plan. We can't keep livin' day to day. We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick.... \nJUSTINE Have a blackberry, Holden! \nHOLDEN But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're sweet. If I could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the answer. I gotta do. But If I ever do, I end up thinking about it instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine pushes the blackberry he's about to eat away from his mouth) What...? What was that for? \nJUSTINE It means I'm pregnant. \nPHIL ALRIGHT! \nPHIL I knew it. Waste of time going to that sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna have ourselves a baby. \nJUSTINE Maybe. \nPHIL And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna bring Bubba. You can bring some of your friends from work. Or Bible study guy. Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead. \nJUSTINE The test could be wrong, Phil. It's a little early to be havin' a party. \nPHIL Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't seem too excited. \nJUSTINE No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby... \nPHIL Don't think negative. Think positive. We could have ourselves a tiny Phil. Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have a tiny weeny Teeny. \nJUSTINE Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby? \nPHIL What do you mean? Everything's gonna change. \nJUSTINE Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's really gonna change? \nPHIL What do ya mean? \n(Holden and his parents sit on the couch and watch TV when the phone rings. Holden gets it.) \nHOLDEN (picks up the phone) Hello? \nCHERYL Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his cashier key in the door. \nJUSTINE Oh my god. \nCHERYL They can't find him though. They say he robbed his folks too. You in on it? \nJUSTINE What?! No! \nCHERYL I know you two played hookie in the store room. I never rat on ya, I've done some things myself. But, still. You in on it? \nJUSTINE I don't know what you're talkin' about. \nCHERYL Suit yourself. \nCORNY Justine. Can we talk to you for a second? \nJACK Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat. \nCORNY Justine, you like workin' at the Retail Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize that by makin' some silly error in judgement would ya? \nJACK Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe last night. Did you have anything to do with it? \nJUSTINE No. I don't know anything. \nCORNY 'Cause we know you're pretty tight with Holden. \nJUSTINE I hardly know him. \nCORNY I've seen you in the store room with him Justine. On many the occasion. I think you know him pretty well. \nJUSTINE This is all going too fast. \nHOLDEN Justine, what have you got to lose? \nJUSTINE Nothin'. \nHOLDEN So be there by noon. \nJUSTINE Okay. \nHOLDEN I love you, Justine. This is all gonna work out. I know it. I almost forgot. This is a story of your life. You inspired me. (they kiss and Holden gets out of the car) \nPHIL Hey Teeny! \nJUSTINE Hey. \nPHIL We were gettin' worried about ya! \nJUSTINE Sorry. \nBUBBA Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this is Justine. \nJUSTINE Hi. \nLIBERTA Hi. \nBUBBA Congratulations, on your expectation. \nJUSTINE Thanks. \nPHIL Hey. \nJUSTINE Hey. \nPHIL What's going on in the bedroom? Looks like a twister hit it. \nJUSTINE Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry. \nPHIL I thought we were robbed. Why aren't you at work? \nJUSTINE They gave me the day off. \n(TV reporter talking about Holden killing himself at the hotel) \nPHIL Retail Rodeo? You know that guy? \nJUSTINE No. \nJACK Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed. The important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one's for you Holden. \nCHERYL I thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies.... \nJUSTINE What? \nBUBBA I was just at your house and the mail came. Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card company. And F&$%. Please don't tell him about us, Justine. Please. Please. I love Phil. I love him more than myself. Please have mercy on me. \nJUSTINE Hey Phil. \nPHIL Have you been sleepin' around behind my back? \n", "test1_input": "JUSTINE Bubba, stand up. \nBUBBA Why? \nJUSTINE For Christ's sakes. Look at that couch, Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This ain't gonna come off. Damn it, Phil. \nTV REPORTER ...including this gorgeous eggplant... \nPHIL I think we got most of it out. \nJUSTINE You two were stoned. You, keep frying your brain liike that, you'll slip off a ladder and crack open your head bone. You do really stupid things when you're high, Phil. \nPHIL Like what? \nJUSTINE Like sitting on my couch with your big blue ass. Everything just turns to shit. You finally get nice things, then everything just gets messed up. Why is this TV buzzing? \nPHIL It's the wind doing that. They the wind's coming in different lately. \nJUSTINE Different from what? \nJUSTINE What you reading? \nHOLDEN Catcher in the Rye\u0092 I'm named after it. \nJUSTINE What's your name?

Justine will be right with you. Where is she? \nJUSTINE I better go. What happens at the end of your book? \nHOLDEN Oh, he has a nervous breakdown. Goes to a mental hospital. \nGWEN You don't get paid to pick your crack. You get paid to work. \nJUSTINE I'm not sure I can do makeovers. \nGWEN Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner, mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder it up. Then you take a moist tissue, roll it in a ball and toss it in their face! Jeez, Louise... I'm talking to a tree stump! Girl, where are you?! \nJUSTINE Sorry, I\u0092m just a little tired. \nGWEN It's the food you eat, Justine. Look at me. I am 10 years older than you and have 10 times your energy. Cause I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy. It's probably why you can't get pregnant, honey. And why you have that hung-jaw look on your face. It's the cheese in your pizza and the chicken in your salad. \nJUSTINE I went to the doctor. He says I'm fertile. He says I could repopulate the entire planet. \nGWEN Then what's the deal here?

Strange thought come into your head and you'd better think 'em. Has a special fate been callin' you and you not listenin? Is there a secret message right in front you, and you're not reading it?

There is an awkward pause. 
DUSHAN (flustered) I'm not...I don't believe Leo Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is Christ but... 
SOFYA But what? 
DUSHAN I believe he's one of the prophets. God speaks through him. I recognize the cadence in his voice. 
SOFYA This is unbearable. No wonder I feel lonely. I'm surrounded by morrons. 
SASHA Mama, you're being ridiculous. 
SOFYA Am I? I sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have. 
TOLSTOY (exhausted) You keep going on like that...Why do you think we should profit from the work I´m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people. 
She turns to see Dushan scribbling again. 
SOFYA STOP IT!   STOP WRITING NOW! 
Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the tension. 
DUSHAN In defense of my gift, let me demonstrate. It's quite remarkable, really. 
He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's voice. 
It is a recording of a recent speech against capital punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is completely caught up in the technology. 
VALENTIN It's your voice. It's wonderful. 
They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a response. 
TOLSTOY It's tiresome. Another remarkable invention will supercede it. 
Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to hide his disappointment. 
TOLSTOY Please excuse me. 
Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn. Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of irritable blessings. 
DUSHAN Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite, I fear. 
Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought. 
Suddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She   returns to her place. There is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table. He stands completely still. Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his cheeks. 
TOLSTOY Oh, that´s better. That´s nice. Very nice indeed. 
Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face. Valentin watches as they embrace. 
VALENTIN (O.S.) Do your parents often speak to each other so...bluntly? 
29   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. EVENING.                      29 
Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering endless stacks of mail. Valentin sits near her, learning the ropes. 
SASHA My mother doesn't understand my father's goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary.    His commitment to the spiritual life offends her. They've fought about it for years. 
VALENTIN I'm sure she means well. 
Sasha just looks at him. 
VALENTIN Your father is the greatest writer in the world. 
SASHA Quite. 
A pause. 
VALENTIN I mean to say, I feel privileged to be here. It's an... honor. 
Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity. Sasha goes back to her letter.   Valentin SNEEZES. 
SASHA God Bless You. 
They read together for a moment.   He sneezes again.

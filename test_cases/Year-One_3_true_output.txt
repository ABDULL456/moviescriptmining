AUCTIONEER (addresses the crowd) Next up, an unusual item-- looks like a Caucasian-- he's big, he's strong, he's a good breeder, so I'm going to start at                                               100        gold minas. Do I hear                                                       100? As the bidding starts, Zed spots Maya, his sister Eema, and Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves waiting to be sold. Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go to them. 
ZED (amazed to see them) Eema! Maya! The women embrace him with relief and excitement. 
OH 
(SHEEPISH) Hi, Eema. 
EEMA Oh. 
ZED What happened? How did you get here? 
Official white                                                             42. 
MAYA Well, after the fire-- (she shoots him an accusing look)) --the hill tribes raided the village. The men fought them but they were too many. They took us captive, marched us to the sea, then traded us to the boat people who brought us here. 
OH (to Eema) Are you all right? Did they-- rape you? 
EEMA 
(SHRUGS) Just a little. Zed and Oh look at her curiously. The SLAVE TRADER sees them talking to Eema and approaches. 
SLAVE TRADER You interested in some slaves? 
ZED (like a prospective buyer) Yeah, this one looks pretty good-- He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's breasts. She punches him. Zed                                                             (cont'd) Ooh, feisty! So how does this work if we want them? The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes. 
SLAVE TRADER You have money? 
ZED 
(CAGEY) Well, that depends on what you mean by money? 
SLAVE TRADER Look, pal, money talks and bullshit walks. I don't have time for looky- loos. 
Official white                                                                     43. Cain steps up and intercedes. 
CAIN 
(GRANDLY) Perhaps I can help. (confidentially to Zed and 
OH) Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I can make a deal with him. You guys wait here. Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and walks him away. CAIN                                                        (cont'd) (to the slave trader) So what are we lookin' at here? From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't hear what they're saying. 
OH (to Eema) What an amazing coincidence-- running into you and Maya and them. 
ZED You still think it's all just a coincidence?                                                All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular time? 
OH 
(THINKS) I don't know. Why do you think? 
ZED I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason. Like, why did I eat the forbidden fruit? 
OH To get laid? 
MAYA Hey! 
ZED 
Official White                                   44. Okay, that might have been what I was thinking at the time, but what if some omnipotent force put the fruit there because I was supposed to eat it? 
OH which omnipotent force? 
ZED What do you mean "which" omnipotent force? How many omnipotent forces could there be? 
OH I don't know! What's "omnipotent" mean? 
ZED Work with me-- I'm just speculating here. Let's call this force "God"; and let's say this "God" is controlling everything. Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil. 
OH Why would he want that?

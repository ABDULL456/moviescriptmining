TAO No! Let me out!! Tao pounds on the door. 
WALT You've come a long way. I'm proud to call you a friend. You have your whole life ahead of you, whereas this is what I do. I finish things. You'd just get in the way. Sorry. Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his cellar. Tao howls to be let out. 
EXT. WALT'S HOUSE 
Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash. He walks over to Tao's house. Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt. She yells in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her. 
WALT Aw, pipe down, you hag. 
PHONG 
(SUBTITLED) You're an evil man. I've seen your kind before. Back home, white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young men's minds with ideas of glory. Then you'd lead them away to their deaths. Walt, of course, has no idea what she said. 
WALT Fine, I hate you too.

PAGE 111 Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She looks down at Daisy and back at Walt. She lashes out again in Hmong. 
WALT I need you to watch my dog. Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in defiance. Walt exhales loudly. Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow him. 
WALT Her name is Daisy. Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He scratches her belly. 
WALT You take it easy, old gal. You good old girl. Walt gets up and walks away without looking back. Phong is stunned; she is silent for once. 
INT. VFW 
Walt walks in and sits down. He nods to the regulars. 
WALT Good afternoon, gentlemen. 
DARREL Walter, how are you doing? 
WALTER Never been better. 
BARTENDER Beer and a shot, Walt? 
WALT I think I'll have something different. Walt looks at the liquor display. At the pinnacle of bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue. 
WALT Think I'll try that Johnnie Walker Blue Label.

PAGE 112 The regulars all Oooooo and Ahhhhhhh at Walt's order. 
MEL Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally? 
WALT Naw, just having something special. Walt sips his Scotch and nods. It's good. 
WALT Why don't you get all the guys the same. 
BARTENDER You sure? 
WALT I'm sure. This is too good not to be shared. Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more. Several regulars hold up their drinks towards Walt. 
INT. VFW PHONE BOOTH 
Walt slips into the phone booth. He puts in change and dials. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed. 
SUE Hello? 
WALT (V.O.) It's Walt. The key to my front door is under the ceramic turtle. Open the door and go let your brother out of the cellar. I have to go. The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs. Phong blocks her path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.

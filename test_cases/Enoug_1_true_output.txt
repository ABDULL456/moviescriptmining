"ERIN" No questions, okay?, or it ends now. (hands phone back to "Queen E.":) Just tell him you love him and say goodbye, okay? "Queen E." nods, puts the receiver to her ear. Even "Erin" can hear Mitch yelling... "Queen E."'s face changes. Mitch keeps shouting angrily. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Goodbye Daddy. She did not say "I love you." She hands "Erin" the receiver. "Erin" hangs it up. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" I am really really sad. "Erin" nods, angry at herself: 
"ERIN" Sorry, kid. My mistake. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FANCY OFFICE. DAY. 
Mitch hands up his cordless phone, picks up another line. 
MITCH I know mine was (too) short, but she made other calls, right? Ginny?, or my mother? He crosses to a map with colored pins. Sticks in another one - 
MITCH (CONT.) Good. Good. Keep it up. (hangs up, goes to intercom:) Isn't he here yet? Great, yeah, send him in. To our shock, the person who enters is the man previously known as "Our Hero." ROBBIE (real name) and Mitch are good buddies: 
MITCH Hey. 
ROBBIE Hey. 
MITCH Look, will you tell what's his face, Lieutenant Harris: I bought his Miata, I paid for his rec room, can he please keep his patrolmen from hassling my guys? 
ROBBIE You got me on a Sunday, for that? 
(JOKE) I could be out shaking down wetbacks. 
MITCH I didn't bring you for that. 
ROBBIE Her? (off Mitch' s nod) I told you not to be an asshole. 
MITCH Yeah, but coming from you... 
ROBBIE We had rules, okay? The rescue routine - like in the diner? It always worked, 'cause we said: one time only. You come, then you go. But you end up marrying the bitchl 
MITCH I know where she is, Robbie. More or less. 
ROBBIE That's a blessing. 
MITCH I need you to find her. Take your 
VACATION - (as Robbie rolls his eyes) I'll make it worth your while, and I'll fix it with the department - 
ROBBIE 
(DRILY) Thanks. Thanks a lot. 
MITCH Who else'm I gonna get? Huh? She stole my fucking childl 
C ; ROBBIE Okay, okay. Ease it up. 
MITCH (walks to map, pins) She made calls from these places - 
ROBBIE She's that stupid? You traced her? 
MITCH She's not stupid, okay? It says on the Net it takes 84 seconds to trace a call; she keeps hers well under. 
(SMILES) Of course-your equipment is faster. 
ROBBIE You're welcome, you're welcome... 
MITCH (drawing on map) Okay: say she lives within a two hour radius...

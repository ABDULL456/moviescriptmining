{"train": "MY GIRL \nWritten by \nLaurice Elehwany \nSetting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972 \nCLOSE UP OF VADA \nVADA (to camera) I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction. (to Harry) Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying. \nHARRY (ignoring Vada) O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge. \nFRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE \nVada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group of boys \nVADA All right, who's in raise your hand. \nAll the boys raise their hands except Thomas J \nBOY Are you coming or not Thomas J? \nTHOMAS J I don't think so. \nVADA I knew he wouldn't come. \nTHOMAS J I can't, I have to go home. \nBOY#2 Yeah, to play with his DOLLS. \nVADA Leave him alone! Come on, let's go. \nGroup of boys enters house lead by Vada \nOnce inside, the group is suddenly stopped \nVADA (to boy#2) Hey, you didn't pay me! \nBOY#2 How do I know you were gonna show us one? \nVADA You're such a baby. \nBOY#2 All right, here. \nBoy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it to Vada \nVADA All right, follow me and don't say a word. \nThey walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns around \nYou ready? \nThey enter the coffin display room, and move over to the coffin in the middle of the room \nYou sure you wanna see it, or is someone gonna go yellow belly? \nBOY#3 I'm not chicken! \nVADA Okay. Lean forward. \nA tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and the boys gasp as they look inside \nGIRL#1 It's empty! \nARTHUR I like to buy off all the railroads. \nHarry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them \nHARRY Vada, we're trying to work here. \nCAMPER PULLS UP OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS HOUSE \nBASEMENT \nVADA Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em! \nHARRY (to Arthur) Hand me the canula. \nVada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in \nHARRY (annoyed) VADA! \nVADA Dad? \nHARRY I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing. (beat) All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... (fades out as Vada climbs stairs) \nVada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF DEATH - CANCER OF PROSTATE \nHARRY (to corpse) One nice model C-501 bronze stainless eternal journey, yeah, you look like a champion. \nOUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE DAY, STRANGE WOMAN GETS OUT OF CAMPER, WALKS UP TO DOOR AND RINGS BELL, VADA ANSWERS \nSTRANGER Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in? \nVADA Sure, come on in. \nVada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the foyer, and sit down \nSo, have you had the unfortunate experience of recently losing a loved one? \nSTRANGER (puzzled look) Could I see your Dad, just for a second? \nVada runs across to call downstairs \nVADA DAD, SOMEBODY'S HERE!! \nVada runs back to the desk \nHe's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate, you're a goner. \nSTRANGER Oh. \nHarry enters \nHARRY How may I... Help you? \nSTRANGER I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day regarding the make up artist job. \nHARRY Oh yes. \nSHELLY It's still available I hope? \nHARRY I think it's still available. \nSHELLY I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the \"Dino Raphael\" Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving. \nHARRY Uhh, Miss devoto... \nSHELLY I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease. \nSHELLY Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common. \nHARRY You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone. \nSHELLY Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal. \nHARRY Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the.... \nSHELLY I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks. \nHarry and Vada exchange weird looks \nOUTSIDE SHOPPING MALL-AREA DAY \nVada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town \nTHOMAS J Hey look at this, no feet! \nVADA Oh wow, a real evil canieval. \nVada and Thomas J ride up through a garage \nPSYCHO MECHANIC WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY GARAGE, GET OUTTA HERE!!! \nVada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room \nINSIDE DOCTOR WELTY'S WAITING ROOM \nNURSE RANDALL Hi Vada, what's wrong today? \nVADA I'm very sick. \nNURSE RANDALL Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor can see you. \nShe picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the doctor \nNURSE RANDALL Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in? \nVada opens door to doctors surgery and enters \nOVER DR WELTY'S SHOULDER, CLOSE UP OF VADA HAVING HER EAR EXAMINED \nVADA Well, what is it? I can handle it. \nDR WELTY You are perfectly healthy. \nVADA That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms. \nDR WELTY Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today? \nVADA Yes. \nDR WELTY Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you! \nVada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, stopping and says with condescending intonation... \nVADA I'll just have to get a second opinion. \nOUTSIDE DOCTORS SURGERY DAY \nVada emerges from the building and gets on her bike \nTHOMAS J So, what'd he say was wrong with you? \nVada is turning and beginning to ride away \nVADA Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer. \nHARRY Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist. \nHarry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV screen \nVADA Dad? \nHARRY (referring to TV) I love this guy! (he laughs) \nVADA Dad?? \nHARRY What? \nVADA The money? \nHARRY Ahh, maybe next summer. \nVADA'S THOUGHTS He forgot about the time I wanted to be a magician, I was really great at making myself disappear. \nFOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA BOUNCING BASKET-BALL, ARTHUR ENTERS \nVADA Wanna play? \nARTHUR No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me. \nArthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a demonstration \nSee. You were looking at the ball. All right? Keep your head up. Gimme some skin, \nThey both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the basement \nSCARY MUSIC \nVada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy- diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on the step \nSHELLY Vada? VADA?? What happened?? \nVADA (extremely frightened and timid) My ball, I lost my ball. \nSHELLY (picking Vada up onto her feet) Come on sweetie. \nThe two exit the scene \nSHELLY PUTTING MAKEUP ON DEAD LADY, BASEMENT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE \nSHELLY Excuse me Harry? \nHARRY Uh huh? \nSHELLY Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter? \nHARRY Yeah. \nHarry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed \nDidn't I give you a picture of what she looked like? \nSHELLY Yeah, (searches pockets, eventually pulling out a photo) \nHarry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face \nSHELLY You don't like it? \nHARRY This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker. \nShelly notices Vada reading the book \nSHELLY Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a little too old for you. \nShe takes the book away from her \nVADA Did you read ALL these books? \nSHELLY Uh huh. \nVADA What are they about? \nSHELLY Mostly love, and romance. \nTHOMAS J Eeeeuuuww, gross. \nSHELLY They're just fun to read. \nShelly hands the soda around \nHere, cheers. \nEverybody takes a mouthful of drink \nVADA Are you married? \nSHELLY No, I'm divorced. \nVADA Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced. \nSHELLY Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other. \nTHOMAS J Mine aren't divorced. \nThomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar \nShelly, can I have a cookie? \nSHELLY With bottle of soda in mouth Hmmmph gurgle gurgle... \nThomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination \nTHOMAS J Hey, where are all the cookies?? \nVada sees the money and the expression on her face shows she has an idea \nSHELLY Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place. \nTHOMAS J What are you saving for? \nSHELLY Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day. \nCuckoo clock goes \"Cuckoo.\" Lunch time, 12 o'clock \nTHOMAS J I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, thanks Shelly. \nThomas J leaves \nSHELLY Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back? \nVADA Can I use your bathroom first? \nSHELLY Sure. \nVADA You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late. \nOUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, THEN INSIDE ON SHELLY AT DESK, TUBA IS BEING PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND \nShelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and proceeds to the living room \nShelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a tune to Grammoo on his tuba \nHARRY (sung, to Grammoo) Can not do without, Harry's wild about me. \nSHELLY Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up. \nHARRY Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh. \nSHELLY I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much. \nHARRY After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though. \nSHELLY I'm sure she will. \nVADA AND THOMAS J AT THEIR FAVORITE SPOT, EDGE OF LAKE WITH VERY LARGE BEAUTIFUL WEEPING WILLOW JUST UP THE BANK A LITTLE FROM A SMALL PIER WHERE TWO FISHING POLES ARE SET UP, ONE HELD BY VADA AND THE OTHER BY A HOLDER AS THOMAS J HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE TREE \nTHOMAS J Nothing's biting today. \nVADA Maybe they had a big breakfast. \nTHOMAS J (hanging from tree) I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up. \nVADA Big deal, I can do that too. (Thomas J's reel begins to click) Thomas J, you got something! \nTHOMAS J Oh no! (he jumps down from the tree) UUH. \nVADA Hurry! \nTHOMAS J I'm trying. \nVADA Reel it in. (Thomas J reels the fish in) He's only tiny, throw him back. \nTHOMAS J I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it? \nThomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls \nVADA You're hurting him, don't kill him!! \nThe hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier \nVada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor error in film} and in the process pricks herself \nVADA Ouch! Darn hook! \nVada puts the fish back \nVADA I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look. \nThomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of the water \nTHOMAS J Yeah he got away. Come on let's go. \nVADA Hey, we can become blood brothers. \nTHOMAS J Naah, I don't wanna. \nVADA You could pick that scab on your arm. \nTHOMAS J It's a mosquito bite. \nVADA It'll bleed. \nSHELLY Have you ever tried any? \nVADA No. \nSHELLY Come here, sit down. \nVada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her \nSHELLY Now, first we blot. \nVada blots her lips on some tissue \nSHELLY Take a look. I think it looks real nice on you. \nVada looks in Shelly's mirror \nVADA Shelly, do you think I'm pretty? \nSHELLY Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth. \nVADA The boys at school don't think I am. \nSHELLY They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow. \nVADA Do you like putting makeup on people? \nSHELLY Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet. (she finishes her work) All right, open your eyes. \nVada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror \nVADA Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that Hollywood thing. \nVADA EXITS HOUSE THROUGH FRONT DOOR, RAUNCHY MUSIC IS PLAYING AND SHE DOES A GROOVY WALK TO THE STEPS WHERE THOMAS J AWAITS HER, SHE LIES DOWN LENGTH WAYS ACROSS THE STEP AND LOOKS AT HIM \nTHOMAS J Your lip bleeding? \nVADA No. \nTHOMAS J What's wrong with your eyes? \nVADA A girl can never wear enough eye shadow. \nTHOMAS J Where's your bike? \nVADA Oh, in the garage. Walk me over. \nThe two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is parked \nVADA It's only a garage, come on. \nVada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone \nVADA Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably fell off in here. \nThomas J walks over to a model of a head \nTHOMAS J Hey look at this! \nVADA That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head. \nTHOMAS J No, I don't wanna. \nVADA Come on, it's fun. \nVada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the chart \nHARRY Oh come on. \nPHIL Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry. \nHARRY Are you sure about all this? \nPHIL Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh? \nHARRY Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute. \nPHIL Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track. \nHARRY No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look? \nPHIL Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em. \nHarry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way \nHARRY Goodnight Vada. \nVADA Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo? \nHARRY Ahh, I just wanna look nice. \nVADA You never cared before. \nHARRY Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together. \nVADA Why? \nHARRY She likes to play bingo. \nVADA Can I go too? \nHARRY Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company. \nHarry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out the door \nOUTSIDE THE SENNET'S HOUSE, VADA IS CREEPING ALONG NIGHT \nVada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does \nTHOMAS J Vada? Vada?? Where are you?? \nVada springs up from her hiding place \nVADA Here. \nTHOMAS J Don't DO that!! \nVADA Sorry. \nTHOMAS J What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here. \nVADA Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight. \nTHOMAS J I told you i'll get in trouble. \nVADA Pacifist! \nTHOMAS J I am not. \nVADA Bed wetter! \nTHOMAS J I stopped that! \nVADA (in semi-deep fake voice) BINGO! \nBINGO ANNOUNCER We have a winner. Will the winner please raise their hand? \nCARL There was no bingo, it came from outside. \nVERNON How could someone outside get a bingo? \nCARL Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you moron! \nVERNON Who are you calling a mowon? (false teeth) \nVERNON'S WIFE Put a lid on it Vernon! \nCARL Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!! \nThe two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break it up \nHARRY Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game. \nMeanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing \nOUTSIDE \nVADA We can go now. \nVada and Thomas J run off down the street \nVADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING \nAs she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her window and looks out it through the venetian blinds \nOUTSIDE STOPPED CAR \nHarry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, eventually \nSHELLY I had a good time tonight. \nHARRY I haven't had a bingo partner in ages. \nThey walk up to Shelly's camper \nSHELLY Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute. \nHARRY Okay, sure. \nThey enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room \nINSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER \nSHELLY Home sweet home. \nHARRY It's nice. \nSHELLY I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces. \nHARRY Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems. \nSHELLY You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush. \nHarry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the bathroom, and then flushes the toilet \nHARRY Yeah. \nSHELLY Are you mad at me? \nVada backs off, followed by Shelly \nTHE TWO MEN THAT GOT OUT OF THE CAR ARE PROCEEDING UP THE SULTENFUSS' DRIVEWAY \nFOCUS ON PHIL, HARRY, VADA, SHELLY AND GRAMMOO AT THE TABLE OUTSIDE, SHELLY SAYS A SEMI-GRACE \nSHELLY Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God. \nHARRY I'll second that. \nVADA Hey Shelly, like seafood? \nSHELLY Uh huh, why? \nVADA See food! \nVada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine to Shelly \nSHELLY (laughing) That's attractive. \nShelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing looking around \nSHELLY (under her breath) Oh shit! Excuse me... \nShelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space \nMAN Hey Shelly, who lives here? (pointing at hearse) The Addams Family? \nSHELLY Danny, what are you doing here? \nDANNY What am I doing here????? What am I doing here? \nSHELLY (to other man in background) Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here? \nDANNY You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home. \nScene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment \nPHIL These two people do not have a good relationship. \nSHELLY (in background) No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it... \nScene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing \nSHELLY I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine. \nDANNY Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be \"OUR MUTUAL ASSET\", not \"Shelly's recreational vehicle\". Gimme the keys. \nSHELLY Keep your voice down! \nDANNY What? \nSHELLY The boss is watching us... \nDANNY (sarcastic) I'm impressed. \nSHELLY God I guess i'll have to introduce you now. \nDANNY Yeah, all right... \nShelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind \nSHELLY (Talking to Danny, pointing at the people respectively) This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss... \nDANNY Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break. \nRALPH WHY?? \nHARRY Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front yard. \nRalph looks rather disturbed by this \nFOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL, VADA STILL GAPING \nPHIL (quiet voice, to Vada) Your father is a savage. \nVada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods \nROAD IN FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, DANNY AND RALPH IN CAR, SHELLY LEANING OVER WITH HER HEAD IN WINDOW NIGHT \nSHELLY Bye Ralph. \nThe car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly waves \nSHELLY (to Harry) Well, you were pretty great! \nHARRY Is it really your camper? \nShelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting \"sort of\" \nSuddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks \nSHELLY Can we see it from the back yard? \nHARRY You can get the general idea... \nThey move off to the back yard... \nHARRY Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year... \nSHELLY Pointing upwards Look... \nHARRY Did you ahh, love him? \nSHELLY I would never marry anybody I didn't love. \nVADA AND PHIL SITTING ON SEAT-SWING WATCHING FIREWORKS \nVADA He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life. \nPHIL He likes her. \nVADA Does he love her? \nPHIL Probably. \nVADA Do you like her? \nPHIL Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father. \nVADA Why? \nPHIL After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny. \nVADA Really? \nPHIL Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry. \nVADA My Dad was funny? \nPHIL Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh. \nVada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down the stairs \nFOREST DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE RUNNING THROUGH IT FIRING THEIR WATER GUNS AT EACH OTHER AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER, HAVING FUN \nSuddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks \nTHOMAS J Woah!! \nVADA What? \nTHOMAS J Pointing There's a beehive right there! \nVADA So? \nTHOMAS J Stand back. \nThomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and begins to squirt the beehive \nVADA Are you crazy, you'll get stung!! \nTHOMAS J You're right, let's knock it down. \nVADA What do you want it for anyway? \nTHOMAS J For their meat. \nThe two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets damaged and eventually falls to the ground \nTHOMAS J Got it! \nVADA My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it! \nThey begin to search for Vada's mood ring \nSuddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in time \nTHOMAS J They're alive!!

Would you like us to get you another goldfish? \nVADA (angry) NO!, He's fine. (less angry, talking to fish) Fish are very resilient animals you know.

(to Vada) I got the blue one!! \nVada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car \nVADA NO! \nSHELLY Yes!! \nShelly gets in the blue one \nSHELLY (pointing at Vada) I am gonna get you. \nVada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the song is \"Bad Moon Rising\" \nHARRY Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!! \nVada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't escape Vada \nHARRY Careful Vada, careful. \nHARRY Shelly LOOK OUT! \nWWHHAAMMM \nShelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin \nVADA IS RIDING HER BIKE ALONG HER STREET TOWARDS THE CAMERA, SHE STOPS AND DISMOUNTS OUTSIDE THOMAS J'S HOUSE \nVada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers \nMRS.

So she opens the door again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs \nVada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed \nVADA'S THOUGHTS In social studies we learned some people stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN tonight. \nOUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, A LOUD HIGH PITCHED SCREAM IS HEARD \nVIEW OF CORRIDOR LEADING TO BATHROOM \nVADA OH MY GOD!!! \nVada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs \nVADA DADDY!!

I'm so sorry about Thomas J. \nVada covers her ears and begins to sing \"doo-wah-diddy- diddy\" \nMR. BIXLER Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right? \nVADA (crying) Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel. \nMR. BIXLER (nods) Come here, sit down over here. \nThe two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch \nVada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop \nVADA Mr. Bixler, (emotional pause) I love you. \nMR. BIXLER Oh, Vada... \nVADA I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here. \nMR. BIXLER Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you. \nVADA No he wouldn't, I can't go home. \nA woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door \nSUZANNE I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem to find my other earring.... \nMR. BIXLER Suzanne, this is Vada. \nSUZANNE (comes over to Vada and crouches) Vada, hi, I'm really sorry. \nMR. BIXLER Could you just give us a minute? \nSUZANNE Yeah. \nSuzanne goes back inside \nVADA Who's that? \nMR. BIXLER That's Suzanne.

Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her. \nVADA Really? \nHARRY Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl. \nVADA Do you miss her? \nHARRY Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked. \nVADA I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J. \nHARRY That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.

You just go home to eat. \nVada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks \nDon't pee on the hydrant!! \nVADA'S BEDROOM \nVada puts a record on to play. (song is \"Wedding Bell Blues\") She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking at the photo longingly \nSULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON THE FLOOR SPRAWLED OUT, HARRY AND PHIL ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION, AND GRAMMOO IS SITTING STARING INTO SPACE, SHELLY ENTERS \nSHELLY Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's hair. He kinda looked...... (she sees Vada lying down sprawled out on the floor) Harry, what's wrong with her?? \nHARRY Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli! \nShelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada \nVADA (very sick sounding voice) I think it's my prostate. \nAll of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing \nGRAMMOO I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in green pastures, I got my man, who could ask for anything more? \nAs this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY weird expression, this is too much for her \nOUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J SITTING ON STEPS DAY \nShelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J \nSHELLY Who's winning? \nVADA I am. \nAs Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway \nGIRL#1 Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND (very mocking voice) \nVADA He is not my boyfriend! \nGIRL#2 I bet she kissed him on the lips! \nVADA Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing? \nTHOMAS J Yeah anyway. \nGIRL#2 Come on let's go. \nGIRL#1 & GIRL#2 Judy's father owns the movie theater and we get to see all the movies WE want for free. \nJUDY Maybe you can come some time. \nGUY#2 Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to bring her boyfriend. \nThe two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends \nGIRL#2 (together) Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S- I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage. \n", "test1_true": "SHELLY You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you. \nVADA I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating. \nThomas J looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the friend of such an intelligent girl \nSHELLY (to Vada) Want a piece of chocolate? \nVada shakes her head \nSHELLY Thomas J? \nTHOMAS J I'm allergic to it. \nSHELLY To chocolate? \nVADA He's allergic to everything. \nSHELLY Chocolate? \nVADA & THOMAS J TO EVERYTHING. \nShelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right index finger \nSHELLY Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing. \nVADA It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in. \nTHOMAS J It doesn't work, it always stays black. (NOTE ring is BLACK) \nVADA It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood. \nSHELLY Maybe black means you're happy? \nVADA I don't think so. (pause) Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars? \nTHOMAS J She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer. \nVADA It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer. \nTHOMAS J She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher. \nVada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and pushes Thomas J \nVADA Shut your big fat mouth! \nSHELLY I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad? \nVADA He won't give it to me. \nSHELLY Well you don't know that. Ask him. \nSULTENFUSS' LIVING ROOM, GRAMMOO AND HARRY WATCHING TV, VADA ENTERS \nVada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a TV show, she then seats herself next to Harry \nVADA Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars? \nHARRY That's a lot of money for a little girl. \nVADA It's for school, for summer writing class. \nHARRY (engrossed with TV show) Any more soda left? \nVada pours Harry another soda \n", "test2_input": "HARRY Goodnight Shelly. \nSHELLY Goodnight. \nHarry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the door \nOUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S CAMPER \nSHELLY Well, I guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime. \nHARRY I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours. \nSHELLY Goodnight. \nHarry waves \nVADA'S ROOM \nVada finishes watching, and goes to bed \nSUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY \nMR. BIXLER Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation. \nWOMAN Ooooh that's really cool. \nJUSTIN Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes out into the group. \nJustin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play weird music \nRONDA Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. Relax your muscles and take deep breaths. \nJUSTIN Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it? \nRONDA Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody feel? \nGUY I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength. \nOTHER GUY I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, she's so cosmically in tune. \nRONDA So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, and I felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony. \nMR. BIXLER Vada, what did you feel. \nVADA I felt Justin's hangnail. \nJUSTIN No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, feel my aura. \nVADA I don't think I'm allowed to. \nJUSTIN I tell you what, let's try it again, hold hands. \nVADA'S THOUGHTS Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. It got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't think Grammoo thought it was insignificant. \nVADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING \nVada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual healing \nSUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING \nHARRY Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce. \nSuddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out \nSHELLY Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada. \n", "test2_true": "HARRY I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue. \nSHELLY Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along? \nHARRY Not at all. Lot of potatoes! \nSHELLY It's for Shelly's famous potato salad. \nHARRY I'm looking forward to that. \nVada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, and she rams her cart into Harry \nHARRY HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing. \nVADA Sorry. \nSHELLY You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time. \nHARRY Really? \nVADA (picking up large can of prunes) Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad? \nHARRY Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. (to Shelly) I don't know what's gotten into her today. \nVada begins to throw cans of every description from the shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not giving a stuff what they contain \nVADA'S THOUGHTS I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff. \nCLOSE UP OF AMERICAN FLAG DAY, HARRY - PLAYING TUBA, SHELLY, PHIL & VADA SINGING \"STAR SPANGLED BANNER\" AND GRAMMOO STANDING NEXT TO THEM WATCHING \nMUSTANG PULLS UP NEXT TO SHELLY'S CAMPER, IT STOPS AND TWO MEN GET OUT \nHARRY COOKING MEAT PATTIES ON BARBECUE, WHICH ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK CHARRED, PHIL IS STANDING NEXT TO HIM \nPHIL Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done.

Do you wanna do it?? \nPHIL No, no no.... \nHARRY Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while! \nPhil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry \nSHELLY How's it going chef? \nHARRY Okay. \nVada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between Harry and Shelly \nVADA Are they ready yet? \nHARRY No, sweetie, not yet. \nShelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off \nVADA When? \nHARRY Soon honey, soon. \nShelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair (which there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with) And Vada shakes her off again \nVADA When?? \nHARRY In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out. \n", "test3_input": "VADA (beginning to look worried) I told him not to tease those bees.

Her only friend in the world is dead. \nHARRY I know that, but what do you want from me? \nSHELLY Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, \"if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.\" \nHARRY Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive. \nSHELLY I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter. \nArthur enters \nARTHUR Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about to begin. \nHARRY Thank you Arthur. \nShelly exits \nFUNERAL ROOM, MINISTER IS WALKING UP THE FRONT \nMINISTER We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett.

(fades as camera changes) \nCAMERA IS ON VADA, WHO IS SLOWLY MAKING HER WAY OUT OF HER ROOM \nThe minister is heard to say this in the background \nMINISTER The family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed. No words that I could say, would begin to describe the loss and grieving, one word that keeps ringing in my ear is Why?. Why would God choose to take this little boy from us? I can't give you an answer to that question, but I can tell you that God has chosen Thomas J for some very special reason, we must find solace in knowing that Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, there is no sorrow such as.... \nThe ministers words fade into the very moving music \nCAMERA IS ON VADA SLOWLY DESCENDING THE STAIRS AND LOOKING INTO THE FUNERAL ROOM, THE MUSIC, SCENE AND ACTIONS OF CHARACTERS IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF MAKING THE VIEWER CRY \nVada stops and sits on a step where she can look through and see Thomas J lying in his coffin, she begins to cry \nBACK IN FUNERAL ROOM, VADA ENTERS AT THE BACK AND BEGINS TO SLOWLY MAKE HER WAY UP TO THE FRONT \nMINISTER ....disciples began to chastise them, and Jesus said \"Let the children come to me, do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

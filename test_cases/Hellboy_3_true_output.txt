The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce. 
On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy. 
HELLBOY (weak) Liz... 
The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands. 
The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all. 
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY 
The screen FADES TO WHITE and then... 
Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat. 
Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, on her side, unconscious. 
Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd comedy. 
Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him with a hammer -- 
FADE OUT / FADE IN 
OMIT 
INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT 
Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church- like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar. 
Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts. 
Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from Lapikov. 
Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key. 
GRIGORY "And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit..." 
Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't bend. 
GRIGORY (gestures at the stone piece) These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world. 
ILSA (to Hellboy) You are the key! The right hand of doom! 
Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS -- 
ILSA (triumphant) What did you think it was made for? Open the locks. 
Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first time. 
MYERS Don't do it!! Don't do it!! 
Ilsa kicks Myers in the face. 
ILSA Silence!! 
The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. The altar's clockworks monitors its progress. 
ILSA Imagine it: An eden for you and her -- 
HELLBOY No. 
Grigory turns to Hellboy. 
GRIGORY No? (reasonable) In exchange for her life then, open the door. 
In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no. 
GRIGORY As you wish. 
He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. Then she goes limp. 
GRIGORY She's dead. 
HELLBOY Noooo! Noooo!!! 
He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the eclipse. 
GRIGORY Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back... (beat) Open the door and claim her. 
His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed. 
He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper. 
HELLBOY For her. 
Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. It lands near Myers. 
GRIGORY Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads." (beat) And crossroads I have become. (beat) Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.

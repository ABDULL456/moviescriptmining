{"train": "DAVE Holding down the porch area? \nEd gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn. \nDAVE ...That's quite a wife you got there. \nED Mm. \nDAVE She's a rare one. \nED How's business, Dave? \nDAVE Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop? \nED All right, I guess. \nDAVE ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day. \nHe chuckles. \nDAVE ...Say, where do you get those things anyway? \nED Specialty store down in Sacramento. \nDAVE Uh-huh. \nThere is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big Dave clears his throat. \nCHURCH \nED (V.O.) Doris and I went to church once a week... \nWe are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting the resurrection of Christ. \nED (V.O.) ...Usually Tuesday night... \nFaintly, we hear an amplified voice: \nCALLER I... seven... \nEd sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit cigarette in his mouth. \nCALLER ...Bee... Four... \nED (V.O.) Doris wasn't big on divine worship... \nDoris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of her. \nED (V.O.) ...and I doubt if she believed in life everlasting; she'd most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth and bingo is probably the extent of it... \nStill focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed: \nDORIS Watch your card, honey. \nCALLER I... sixteen... \nEd continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from his cigarette. \nED (V.O.) I wasn't crazy about the game, but, I don't know, it made her happy, and I found the setting peaceful. \nCALLER Gee... nine... \nDoris sucks in her breath. \nDORIS Jesus, bingo--BINGO! \nBARBERSHOP \nSun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back. \nFRANK ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying? \nED Uh-huh. \nBATHROOM DOORWAY \nIt is evening. Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a cigarette between his lips pluming smoke. \nED (V.O.) Dry cleaning... \nThe reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine. \nED (V.O.) ...Was I crazy to be thinking about it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity, the real McCoy? \nEd takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales. \nED (V.O.) ...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money? \nDORIS Honey? \nED Mm. \nShe lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub. \nDORIS Shave my legs, will ya? \nEd saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette back in his mouth to free his hands. He picks up a bar of soap and starts soaping the leg. \nHe sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor. \nThe razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark bits of hair flecking the white foam. \nED (V.O.) ...It was clean. No water. Chemicals. \nHe shakes the razor in the tub. Shavings float away across the soap-slicked water. \nDORIS (absently, as she reads) Gimme a drag. \nEd pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris as she sucks. \nHe brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to his own mouth. She murmurs: \nDORIS ...Love ya, honey. \nA DOOR \nWe hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into laughter. \nA hand enters to knock. \nVOICE Yeah, come in. \nThe door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. A tray of room- service dishes sits near him. \nHe is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him. \nCREIGHTON (into the phone) OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. \nHe hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed. \nCREIGHTON ...Oh, I thought you were the porter... Can I help you? \nEd stands awkwardly by the door. \nED ...I'm, uh, Ed. \nThe stranger's look does not show recognition. \nED ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today? \nCREIGHTON Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage. \nED I'm, uh, I'm--the barber. \nCREIGHTON Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber. \nEd nods, his smile faint and forced. \nED Frank. \nFRANK Huh? \nED This hair. \nFRANK Yeah. \nED ...You ever wonder about it? \nFRANK Whuddya mean? \nED I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing. \nFRANK Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal? \nED No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away. \nFRANK Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid. \nEd shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap. \nED OK, bud, you're through. \nThe kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out the door. Ed gives Frank a considering stare. \nED ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt. \nFRANK What the-- \nED I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt. \nFRANK What the hell are you talking about? \nEd turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers. \nED I don't know. Skip it. \nEXT. ED'S HOUSE \nIt is twilight. Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and, cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk. \nMusic filters out from the house. \nINT. ED'S HOUSE \nEd walks though the living room, hands in his pockets. The music emanates from a radio in the bedroom. \nDORIS Ed? \nA track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her hair. Her dress is half zipped at the back. \nDORIS ...Gimme a zip. \nEd walks over behind her. \nED Where you going? \nDORIS Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push. \nED Yeah, right. \nWe are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, the lowers it slightly. Her back blooms through the dark fabric of the dress. \nHe slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume atomizer. \nDORIS Come on, get ready. It's important. \nED Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties. \nDORIS Oh, don't be a grump. \nSALES FLOOR \nDAVE ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been carrying on with a married woman. Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh-- what is it they say?--the--the--the chickens are coming home to roost. \nEd awkwardly holds the two burning cigars. \nED Uh-huh. \nDAVE Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows. \nED Uh-huh. \nDAVE Well, you know what that would do to me. \nED I guess it would be pretty awkward. \nDAVE Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed. \nED Uh-huh. \nDAVE I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus. \nED How much to they want, Dave? \nDAVE $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is. \nED ...You know... who *who* is? \nDAVE The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount. \nED Would he... it sounds pretty obvious. \nDAVE Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious. \nED Mm. How, uh... how did he know that-- \nDAVE He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us. \nBig Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed. \nDAVE ...Thanks... \nHe exhales with a long sigh. \nDAVE ...Oh, Jesus. \nED ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave? \nDAVE That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann. \nED Mm. \nDAVE Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife! \nHe give a tearful chuckle. \nDAVE ...Doris, she was pretty hot about that. God bless her. She doesn't know I'm telling you this--she's mad enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm sorry I... I better get back to the party. \nHe rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his face. \nDAVE ...I look all right? \nPULLING ED \nHe has left the office to wander through an adjacent room lit only by spill from the party. It is the music department; pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor. \nED (V.O.) In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I knew the ten grand was going to pinch him where it hurt... \nEd sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. He takes out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar. \nED (V.O.) ...But Doris was two-timing me and I guess, somewhere, that pinched a little too. \nHis attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room. \nThe person can only be seen only obscurely, from three- quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play. \nED Mm. \nThey ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head. \nDORIS ...What a knucklehead. \nSTREET \nAs the car roars past and into the distance. \nANOTHER STREET \nIt is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a Packard and drives off. \nED (V.O.) Big Dave did it, though... \nEd, sitting in his car, is watching. \nED (V.O.) ...I sent a note telling him where to drop the money... \nHOTEL HALLWAY \nEd emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray by the elevator. \nED (V.O.) ...and he did. He came across. \nEd reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag. \nHe goes back to the stairwell. \nANOTHER FLOOR \nEd emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks. \nThe door swings open. \nCREIGHTON Yeah, good, how are ya, come in... \nEd follows him into the room. \nCREIGHTON ...You bring a check? \nED Cash. \nCREIGHTON Cash?! \nHe gives Ed a look. \nCREIGHTON ...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh? \nED Sure. \nCREIGHTON I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh? \nED Yeah. \nCREIGHTON Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer-- \nED It's OK. \nCREIGHTON Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point? \nHe perspires as he counts the money. \nCREIGHTON ...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh-- \nED That'll be fine. \nCREIGHTON Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh... \nHe wipes his brow, finishes counting. \nCREIGHTON ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion. \nED OK. \nWOMAN (to Doris) He's a barber, right? It's a good trade. So how come you got no kids? \nPICNIC TABLE \nA group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a picnic table set out with pies in a row. \nVOICES Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for Frankie! \nFRANK No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch! \nVOICES No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join! \nAn old man stands by with a stopwatch. \nOLD MAN Ready... \nHe clicks the timer. \nOLD MAN ...Go! \nFrank and the line of children plunge their faces into the line of blueberry pies. \nThe other picnickers cheer them on. \nELSEWHERE \nEd and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple accepting congratulations. \nDoris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk: \nDORIS 'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful. \nED Congratulations, Gina. \nDORIS Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it. \nED Honey... \nDORIS It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure. \nEd tries to lead her away. \nED Honey... \nDoris calls back over her shoulder: \nDORIS Congratulations on your goddamn cherries! \nAs Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant: \nDORIS ...Leggo my goddamn elbow. \nELSEWHERE \nIn a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering slowly, painfully, toward a tree. In his right hand he clutches a trophy. \nWhen he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against it, leans forward, and vomits. \nCAR \nLate afternoon, driving home. \nEd drives. Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring lightly. Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to his chest, eyes closed, murmuring: \nFRANK I never wanna see another blueberry pie... \nSilence. \nFRANK ...I never even wanna hear those words. \nDoris moans. \nDAVE ...I'm ruined. \nHis hands writhe on the desktop. \nDAVE ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell. \nED So you paid the guy? \nBig Dave stares without speaking. \nAfter a long beat: \nDAVE ...What kind of man *are* you? \nED ...Huh? \nDAVE What kind of man *are* you? \nED Big Dave-- \nDAVE I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it. \nED I, uh... \nDAVE I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*. \nNo one talks. \nBig Dave sighs. \nDAVE ...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. And then I went and found the pansy. \nHe looks at Ed. \nDAVE ...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, well, you already know the story. I didn't, I hadda beat it out of the pansy. *Your* money. \nNo response. \nDAVE ...What kind of man *are* you? \nBig Dave rises. \nDAVE ...Well. \nHe crosses around the desk and adds, sadly: \nDAVE ...I'm all shot to hell. \nEd starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him. Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall. \nEd hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave. Big Dave wallops him in the stomach. Ed doubles over. \nDAVE ...What kind of man *are* you? \nBig Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face against the desktop. Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. He slams him face-first into the window between the office and the dark sales floor. \nEd twists around, the back of his head now pressed against the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat. \nBig Dave sweats and strains. \nA crack shoots up the pane of glass. \nEd's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's neck. \nBig Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up to his throat. \nEd watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer. \nBig Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his head twisted away. \nHe falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face- down onto the floor. \nBig Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knees awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something across the floor with his nose. \nCUSTOMER Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold it down. *That'll* flood it. \nFRANK You crazy? You pumped it? \nCUSTOMER Well, ya can't hold it down. \nThere is the jingle of the door bell. Ed opens his eyes. \nTwo men in fedoras are entering. \nEd starts to rise. \nMAN 1 Ed Crane? \nED Right. \nMAN 1 Come on outside. \nED Sure. \nOUTSIDE \nThe two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant to speak. One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker: \nMAN 2 ...So you're a barber, huh? \nED That's right. \nMAN 1 I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs. \nEd nods toward their car: \nED ...We goin'? \nKREBS Huh? No. \nBeat. \nPERSKY ...Cigarette? \nEd holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette. \nPERSKY Right. Uh... Pete's got some news for you. \nHis partner gives Persky a dirty look. \nKREBS ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched. \nPERSKY They sent us to tell ya. \nED Huh? \nKREBS They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail. \nED My *wife*? \nPERSKY Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh... \nKREBS Homicide. \nPERSKY Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent. \nED I don't understand. \nKREBS He's the dead guy. \nEd stares at him. \nPERSKY ...Yeah, it's a tough break. \nKREBS Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow. \nPERSKY Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya. \nThe man looks dubiously at Ed. \nMAN Mr...? \nED Crane. Ed Crane. \nMAN You also have an interest in the securing property? \nFRANK He's a barber. \nMAN Ah. \nFRANK Second chair. \nMAN Not an owner. \nFRANK No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law. \nMAN Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here. \nHe goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, and we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the words lost. \nEd sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes successive documents across his desk with a word of explanation for each as Frank signs. \nEd takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively. \nED (V.O.) The barbershop. Doris and Frank's father had worked thirty years to own it free and clear. Now it got signed over to the bank, and the bank signed some money over to Frank, and Frank signed the money over... \nTRACKING POINT OF VIEW \nIt is midday. We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb. A couple of kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is no doubt the fanciest in town. \nED (V.O.) ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who got into town two days later... \nEd, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spells out \"DaVinci's\". \nED (V.O.) ...and told me to meet him at DaVinci's for lunch. \nTRACKING POINT OF VIEW \nInside the restaurant. We are tracking toward a table whose lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu as he orders from a facing waitress: \nMAN ...not fried, poached. Three of 'em for two minutes. A strip steak medium rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice, and plenty of hot coffee. \nHe flips the menu over. \nMAN ...Do you have prairie oysters? \nWAITRESS No, sir. \nMAN Then bring me a fruit cocktail while I wait. \nHe looks up at Ed. \nMAN ...You're Ed Crane? \nED Yeah-- \nMAN Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries. \nED No thanks, I-- \nThe waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of Riedenschneider. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed? \nED No. Of course not. She didn't do it. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood? \nED ...OK. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No? \nEd is puzzled: \nED Yes? \nANN We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed. \nShe gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he will find this significant. \nED ...Yes? \nANN At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report. \nED Ann-- \nANN A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else. \nED Ann-- \nANN The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and-- \nED Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink? \nANN Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again. \nEd says nothing. \nShe touches his arm. \nANN ...Tell Doris not to worry. I know it wasn't her. Perhaps this will bring it out, finally. Perhaps now it will all come out. \nShe turns and heads down the walk. \nHer high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk, then are lost in the rustle of leaves. \nEd watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller. \nPRISON MEETING ROOM \nIt is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs. One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight. \nEd and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into his pockets. \nAll three are motionless for a long beat. Finally: \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...It stinks. \nDORIS But it's true. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER I don't care it's true, it's not true; it stinks. You say he was being blackmailed; by who? You don't know. For having an affair; with who? You don't know. Did anyone else know about it? Probably not; you don't know. \nED I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific. \nHe starts pacing. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon-- \nED It was Big Dave's. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER --don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone. \nED *I* was with her. \nRiedenschneider gives him a hard look. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...Like I say, it stinks. \nAnother long pause. \nED ...I killed him. \nRiedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning. \nED (V.O.) ...disappeared into thin air, vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki. Gone now. All gone. The money gone. Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could I have been so stupid? \nThe continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby chair, also listening as Birdy plays. \nWalter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, and he starts lightly to snore. \nBARBERSHOP \nThe distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at the cut. Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs, administering haircuts. \nThe customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do not hide rolls of fat. He has a hot towel over his face that does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some extent: \nCUSTOMER She makes this stuff, she calls it gatto, it's got egg in there, it's got sugar, it's got--it's cake, basically, except she calls it gatto. Like if you don't call it cake maybe you won't put on any weight, like I need to eat gatto, you know what I'm saying? This stuff, if I've had a square meal, I've had my steak and potatoes, I can just have another cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask for the desert if it's not there... \nHis voice turns into a drone under the narration. \nED (V.O.) Sooner or later everyone needs a haircut... \nCUSTOMER Got the recipe from a magazine, woman's magazine... \nED (V.O.) We were working for the bank now. We kept cutting the hair, trying to stay afloat, make the payments, tread water, day by day, day by day... \nCRANE DOWN \nInside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy Riedenschneider. \nED (V.O.) Most people think someone's accused of a crime, they haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial, but it's not like that, it's not that fast. The wheels of justice turn slow... \nBAILIFF ...did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one David Allen Brewster, a human being... \nED (V.O.) They have an arraignment, and then the indictment, and they entertain motions to dismiss, and postpone, and change the venue, and alter this and that and the other. They empanel a jury, which brings more motions, and they set a trial date and then change the date, and then often as not they'll change it again. \nBAILIFF What say you to these charges? \nOur boom down has ended close on Doris. We hear Freddy Riedenschneider, off: \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER We plead not guilty, your honor. \nBARBERSHOP \nBooming down toward the fat man. \nED (V.O.) And through all of it we cut the hair. \nCUSTOMER I say, Honey, if you're gonna make a cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler, don't put a whole pan in front of me and tell me it's not gonna be any good when it's cold... \nOPERA SINGERS \nWe are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. We pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a mask over his eyes, slumbers. \nED (V.O.) ...Meanwhile, Freddy Riedenschneider slept at the Metropole... \nRESTAURANT \nTracking in toward Freddy Riedenschneider, who sits twirling spaghetti with a fork against a spoon. \nED (V.O.) ...and shoveled it in at DaVinci's. \nLATERAL TRACK \nFrom inside a car. Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. Among them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind. \nED (V.O.) He'd brought in a private investigator from Sacramento... \nLATERAL TRACK \nMoving the opposite way. A different day, but again a crowd moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring his face. \nED (V.O.) ...to nose around into Big Dave's past. \nPUSHING IN TO ED \nIn the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy at the piano, but now the two of them are alone. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money... \nHe is looking at Doris. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch! \nED So... who... who actually-- \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try. \nHe chuckles as he heads for the door. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight. We got a real shot at this, folks. Let's not get cocky. \nThe door shuts behind him. \nDoris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene. \nA silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her mouth. \nED Honey...? \nThe smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. Ed frowns. \nED ...Honey? \nHer laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes her head: \nDORIS What a dope. \nABUNDAS LIVING ROOM \nEd sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, her eyes on the sheet music: \nBIRDY He was deaf when he wrote this. \nED Who? \nBIRDY Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow. \nOver her continued playing: \nED (V.O.) So maybe Riedenschneider could get Doris off. Maybe it would all work out. And I thought--I hoped--that maybe there was a way out for me as well... \nA SIGN \nThe cardboard sign on an easel says \"COME ONE, COME ALL / PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949, 8:00 P.M. \nED (V.O.) The girl had talent, anyone could see that. And *she* wasn't some fly- by-nighter, she was just a good clean kid... \nSCHOOL GYMNASIUM \nA young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the baby grand that has been set out center stage. \nED (V.O.) ...If she was going to have a career she'd need a responsible adult looking out for her... \nWe track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest on Ed. \nED (V.O.) ...some kind of... manager. She'd have contracts to look at, be going on tours, playing on the radio maybe. I could help her sort through all of that, without charging her an arm and a leg, just enough to get by... \nBirdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience. \nEXT. SCHOOL \nEd is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm summer night. He looks around the parking lot. \nED (V.O.) ...I could afford to charge less than the usual manager, not having to put up a big front like a lot of these phonies. And I could be with her, enough to keep myself feeling OK... \nA trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another student--a boy. \nED (V.O.) ...Why couldn't that work?... Why not?... \nBirdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults. \nEd, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider looks back over his shoulder at Ed. \nFRANK ...Ed, what is this? Is this procedure? \nThe two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man standing to one side. \nJUDGE Bailiff. \nAs the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various papers. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER I don't understand... We had a real shot at it... We could have won this thing... \nThe Bailiff Announces: \nBAILIFF In the matter of the State of California versus Doris Crane, Case Number 87249 assigned to this Superior Court... \nAs the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...It doesn't make any sense... \nBARBERSHOP \nLate afternoon sun slants in. \nThe shop, not open for business, is very still. Ed, in his courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees. \nFrank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping. \nED (V.O.) She'd hanged herself. I'd brought her a dress to wear to court and she'd used the belt. I didn't understand it either. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with me, that she'd figured out somehow how I fit into it and couldn't stand it, couldn't stand knowing... \nBEDROOM \nNight. Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling. \nED (V.O.) ...That wasn't it, I would find out later. For now, everything just seemed ruined... \nMETROPOLE LOBBY \nRiedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags. \nED (V.O.) ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back to Sacramento still shaking his head, saying it was the biggest disappointment of his professional career... \nFRANK'S HOUSE \nDay. Frank's kitchen. \nFrank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown over his pyjamas, unshaven. \nED (V.O.) ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect he was drinking; anyway, he stopped coming to work... \nBARBERSHOP \nEd, in his smock, works on a customer. \nED (V.O.) ...That left me to keep the place going, or the bank would've taken it. \nAs he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between his lips. He squints against the smoke drifting past his eyes. \nED (V.O.) ...*I* was the principal barber now. I hired a new man for the second chair... \nEd's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer. \nED (V.O.) ...I'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing when he came in for an interview. But I guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous; once he had the job, he talked from the minute I opened the shop in the morning... \nEXT. BARBERSHOP \nIt is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating to illustrate his store. \nED (V.O.) ...until I locked up at night. For all I know, he talked to himself on the way home. \nSTREET \nEd walks along the sidewalk. \nED Yeah. \nBIRDY We've certainly missed you. \nED Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards... \nHe is loading a cigarette into his mouth. \nED ...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're-- \nBIRDY Pop doesn't like people smoking in here. \nEd stares. This takes a moment to register. \nED Oh. Sorry. \nBirdy lowers her voice: \nBIRDY Sometimes I have a cigarette in here when he's away. Never when he's in the house. He can smell it a mile off. \nEd is pocketing the cigarette. \nED Sure... Sure, it's his house. \nBIRDY That's what he keeps telling me. \nEd smiles thinly. \nED Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away. \nBIRDY Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school. \nED That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman. \nBIRDY Boy. \nED You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest-- \nBIRDY Oh, Mr Crane-- \nED I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand. \nBIRDY Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff. \nED I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words. \nBIRDY Geez, Mr Crane. \nED Just see him, as a favor to me. \nSTUDIO WAITING ROOM \nIt is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a fast and difficult piece of music. \nEd sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons. \nEd looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a Junior Contour. \nAnother boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch. \nThe piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices. Dull footsteps. \nThe studio door swings open. \nA small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and settle on Ed. \nCARCANOGUES ...You are ze fahzer? \nED No. Uh... family friend. \nMAN I am Carcanogues. \nHe smiles at Birdy. \nED He didn't say that. \nBIRDY But more or less. \nED Look, I'm no expert, but-- \nBIRDY It doesn't matter, Mr Crane. \nED I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony. \nBIRDY But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally. \nEd looks at her. \nBIRDY ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian. \nED ...Uh-huh. \nBIRDY I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though. \nED Ah... it's nothing. \nBIRDY I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are? \nED Huh. \nBIRDY You're an enthusiast. \nED Huh. Yeah. Maybe... \nHe loads a cigarette into his mouth. \nED ...I guess I've been all wet. \nBIRDY But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane... \nShe reaches over to touch his thigh. \nBIRDY ...I wanted to make you happy. \nED Birdy-- \nBIRDY It's OK... \nShe is leaning over his lap. \nBIRDY ...I want to do it, Mr Crane. \nEd is shocked: \nED Birdy! \nHe reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting to be violent. \nED ...No, please. \nBIRDY Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please-- \nThe blare of an oncoming horn. \nEd looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on the wheel. \nThe oncoming car. \nEd swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams. \nCRASH: the car hits a roadside tree. \nBLACK. \nED (V.O.) Time slows down right before an accident, and I had time to think about things. I thought about what an undertaker had told me once--that your hair keeps growing, for a while anyway, after you die... \nA hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then off the road, down an embankment. \nEd sits, smoking. \nAt length he rises and goes in to the house. \nINT. BUNGALOW \nIt is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping from the kitchen. \nDoris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set. \nWith a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the couch. \nEd sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray closer on the coffee table. \nShe sips. He puffs. \nED ...Doris-- \nDORIS Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright. \nThe sit. The light is failing. The clink of ice cubes. \nFADE OUT \nIn the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin. As the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint, distant: \nVOICE Are you there? Are you awake? \nA blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolves into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in close. \nHe leans away, murmuring: \nDOCTOR He's coming around. Can you talk, sir? These men have to talk. \nEd is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and one side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life support. \nDOCTOR ...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake. \nTwo police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in. \nPERSKY Are you awake?... Is he awake? \nKREBS Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious? \nPERSKY His eyes are open. \nKREBS Uh... you're under arrest. \nPERSKY As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious? \nKREBS You'll go to the prison hospital. \nPERSKY Under arrest for murder. \nEd's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia: \nED Birdy... I didn't mean to-- \nKREBS What'd he say? \nED Birdy... \nDOCTOR Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. Broken clavicle. \nThe doctor leans in. \nDOCTOR ...That's the collarbone, Crane. Broken. She's OK though. \nKREBS So he understands? He's under arrest for murder? \nED Big Dave. \nPERSKY Huh? \nThe district attorney is pointing at Ed. \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY ...cynically used his own wife as a cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical cunning... \nED (V.O.) On and on it went, how I'd used Doris and then let her take the fall. That stuff smarted because some of it was close to being true... \nThe district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn to Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking inspiration for his own. \nED (V.O.) ...And then it was Freddy Riedenschneider's turn. \nRiedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk. \nED (V.O.) ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe... \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...a puny player on the great world's stage... \nED (V.O.) ...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris... \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...who among us is in a position to say... \nED (V.O.) ...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake... \nWe pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider. \nED (V.O.) ...I was just like them, an ordinary man, guilty of living in a world that had no place for me, guilty of wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, but not of murder... \nRiedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground to point a finger directly at Ed's face. \nED (V.O.) ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and if they voted to convict me, well, they'd be practically cinching the noose around their own necks. He told them to look not at the facts but at the meaning of the facts, and then he said the facts *had* no meaning. It was a pretty good speech, and even had me going... \nA tap on the shoulder turns Ed around. \nED (V.O.) ...until Frankie interrupted it. \nFrank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor. \nA bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over Ed, bellowing through tears: \nFRANK What kind of man *are* you? What kind of man *are* you? \nRiedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's, loudly protesting: \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER Move for a mistrial, your honor! Move for a mistrial! This outrageous display cannot help but prejudice... \nEd moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the floor. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER ...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women... \nED (V.O.) ...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway... \nEd is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman who enters the plea in the new trial: \nGARROWAY Your honor, we plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances. \nED (V.O.) ...who threw me on the mercy of the court. It was my only chance, he said. I guess that meant I never had a chance... \nThe judge starts droning the sentence: \nJUDGE ...a menace to society... a predator on his own wife, his business associates, on an innocent young girl... social contract... line crossed... the offender forfeits the right to his own life... I hereby order that you be taken to a place of confinement... \nPRISON HALLWAY \nWe are tracking down the hall. \nED (V.O.) He wasn't buying any of that Modern Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, or any of the mercy stuff either. No, he was going by the book, and the book said I got the chair... \nEd is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, hands clasped behind his head. \nED (V.O.) ...so here I am. At first I didn't know how I got here. I knew step by step of course, which is what I've told you, step by step; but I couldn't see any pattern... \nLATER \nEd sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing. \n", "test1_input": "The Man Who Wasn't There \n\"THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE\" \nBY \nEthan Coen & Joel Coen \nBlack. \nED (V.O.) Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But I never considered myself a barber... \nWe track back from a barber's pole. \nED (V.O.) ...I stumbled into it--well, married into it more precisely... \nWe track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head of a customer entering in slow motion. \nED (V.O.) ...I wasn't my establishment. Like the fella says, I only work here... \nWe track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush. \nED (V.O.) ...The dump was 200 feet square, with five chairs, or stations as we call 'em, even though there were only two of us working... \nWe track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats. \nED (V.O.) ...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, was the principal barber. And man, could he talk... \nAnother man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips. \nED (V.O.) ...Now maybe if you're eleven or twelve years old, Frank's got an interesting point of view, but sometimes it got on my nerves. Not that I'd complain, mind you. Like I said, he was the principal barber. Frank's father August--they called him Guzzi--had worked the heads up in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years until his ticker stopped in the middle of a Junior Flat Top. He left the shop to Frankie free and clear. And that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's ambitions: cutting the hair and chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk much... \nHe plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into a tray. \nED (V.O.) ...I just cut the hair... \nLATE IN THE DAY \nThe barbershop is empty of customers. Late sun slants in through the front window. The two barbers--the narrator and his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly reading magazines. \nFRANK Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it. \nED Uh-huh. \nFRANK How d'ya like them apples? \nBeat. \nFRANK ...Ed? \nED Huh? \nFRANK Russians exploded an A-bomb. \nED Yeah. \nFRANK (shaking his head) Jesus... \nED (V.O.) Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie... \nWe cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off: \nED (V.O.) ...the Flat Top, the Ivy, the Crew, the Vanguard, the Junior Contour and, occasionally, the Executive Contour. Adults get variations on the same, along with the Duck Butt, the Timberline... \nEd trims the fringe around a balding head. \nED (V.O.) ...and something we call the Alpine Rope Toss. \nHe snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes it across a bald pate. \nED (V.O.) ...I lived in a little bungalow on Napa Street. The place was OK, I guess; it had an electric ice box, gas hearth, and a garbage grinder build into the sink. You might say I had it made. \nWe float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as a black coupe pulls into the driveway. \n", "test1_true": "We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting on a girdle. \nED (V.O.) ...Doris kept the books at Nirdlinger's, a small department store on Main Street. Unlike me, Doris liked the work, accounting; she liked knowing where everything stood. And she got a ten per cent employee discount on whatever she wanted--nylon stockings... \nClose on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to the garter. \nED (V.O.) ...make-up, and perfume... \nClose on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache. \nED (V.O.) ...She wore a lot of perfume. \nDoris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee table. \nED (V.O.) ...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster, was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the department store heiress. Tonight they were coming over for dinner--as Doris said, we were 'entertaining'... \nEd sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable suit, smoking. \nED (V.O.) ...Me, I don't like entertaining. \nThe doorbell rings. \nTHE DOOR \nEd opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure, bird-like wife. \nDAVE How ya doin', Ed? \nED OK. Take your coat, Ann? \nDINNER TABLE \nThe two couples are in the middle of the meal. \nDAVE Japs had us pinned down in Buna for something like six weeks. Well, I gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. *They* were eating grubs, nuts, thistles. When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh... And this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about. I mean, I never would've, ya know, so what do I say, honey? When I don't like dinner, what do I say? \nAnn smiles wanly. \nDAVE ...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg-- *again*?! \nHe roars with laughter. \nEd gives an acknowledging smile. \nDAVE ...Arnie Bragg--*again*?! \nHe dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin. \nDAVE ...Were you in the service, Ed? \nED No, Dave, I wasn't. \nDORIS Ed was 4F on account of his fallen arches. \nDAVE Mm, that's tough. \nFRONT PORCH \nEd is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down. Crickets chirp. From inside the house we hear laughter and clattering dishes. \nED (V.O.) ...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had the feeling that she and Big Dave were a lot closer than they let on... \nHe turns and looks through the screen door into the house. \nAcross the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing dishes across. \nED (V.O.) ...The signs were all there plain enough--not that I was gonna prance about it, mind you. It's a free country. \nFootsteps approach the front porch. \nWith the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges. \n", "test2_input": "BIRDY OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane. \nThey watch her go back in. \nWALTER Damnit! She's a good kid. \nEd nods. \nA beat. \nED ...So, uh, who should I-- \nWALTER Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here. \nHe takes a sip of his drink. \nWALTER ...Probity. \nED Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh... \nWALTER Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money. \nED Uh-huh. He's the, uh... \nWALTER Yeah, the best. \nHe sniffs. \nWALTER ...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I could tell you more. Hell, I wish I could handle it myself. But I'd be absolutely worthless for this kind of thing. \nHe takes a musing sip. \nWALTER ...Criminal matter? Freddy Riedenschneider. \nHe thinks. \nWALTER ...No question about it. \nED AT A TABLE \nIt is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides, one side for prisoners, the other for visitors. The room is empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across from a younger woman at the far end of the table. The younger woman, in a prison smock, is wailing. The elderly woman is holding her hand. \nEd sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed toiletries kit. There are echoing voices suggesting large spaces outside the room. \nHe sits and waits. \nApproaching footsteps. \nThe door opens. A large prison matron steps aside to let Doris enter. \nDoris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big for her. Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled. Not only is she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on her lip. \nAs Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around. \nED Honey... I brought your make-up. \nShe looks at him. \nDORIS Honey. \nED How are you? \nShe shrugs. \nDORIS I don't know what's going on. I-- \nED What happened to you? \nShe shakes her head. \nDORIS ...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it. \nED You don't have to-- \n", "test2_true": "ED You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer. \nDoris doesn't seem to be listening. She sighs: \nDORIS I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them. \nED Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider. \nDoris finally looks at him. \nDORIS Should I... should I tell you why? \nED You don't have to tell me anything. \nHer gaze drifts away again. She notices the sobbing woman. \nDORIS Jesus Christ. \nDoris looks around and laughs. \nDORIS ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store. \nED Honey... \nDORIS I knew we'd pay for it. \nBARBERSHOP \nEd sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock. Frank paces in front of him. He smacks a fist into his palm. \nFRANK This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together! \nED Yeah. \nFRANK Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches! \nED Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider-- \nFRANK I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together! \nED That's very generous. \nFRANK The hell with it, Eddie! \nBANK \nEd and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby. Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit. As they wait, he looks nervously about. \nIn a hushed voice: \nFRANK They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that. \nED Uh-huh. \nFRANK Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me. \nED Uh-huh. \nFRANK They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here? \nA door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle age emerges. \nMAN Mr Raffo? \nFrank hops to his feet. \nFRANK Yes, sir. \nMAN Could you come with me please? \nFRANK Sure. Can Ed come too? \n", "test3_input": "DWIGHT Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your time. \nBAR \nIt is late afternoon, dusty and empty. \nEd and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position. \nAs the bartender approaches: \nDIEDRICKSON Rye. \nED Just coffee. \nDIEDRICKSON You sure you don't want something stiffer? \nEd shrugs and shakes his head. \nBARTENDER Coffee it is. \nHe leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop and stares at them. After a beat: \nDIEDRICKSON ...County M. E. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody. I don't know if you knew that. It's routine. \nEd doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at his hands, plows on: \nDIEDRICKSON ...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told. \nED Told what? \nDIEDRICKSON I, uh... thanks. \nThe bartender has set down the drinks. \nDiedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his glass. Finally: \nDIEDRICKSON ...I'm sorry to add to your burden, Crane, but I'd want to know it it was me. Your wife was pregnant. First trimester. \nA pause. \nDIEDRICKSON ...Well, there it is. \nAnother pause. \nDIEDRICKSON ...I'm sorry. \nHe mutters to himself: \nDIEDRICKSON ...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing. \nED My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years. \nDiedrickson stiffens. \nDIEDRICKSON (murmuring) ...Jesus. (aloud) ...Well, that's not really my business. \nHe is hastily digging for money. \nDIEDRICKSON ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is. \nHe leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he leaves: \nDIEDRICKSON ...Good luck, Crane. \nHis retreating footsteps echo down the bar. \nAPARTMENT HALLWAY \nIt is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the middle background, knocking on a door. \nED (V.O.) Doris and I had never really talked much. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily. But it was funny: now I wanted to talk--now, with everyone gone. I was alone, with secrets I didn't want and no one to tell them to anyway. \nThe door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant. \n", "test3_true": "We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its feeble light. \nOur pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration as she mumbles. \nED (V.O.) I visited a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating with those who had passed across, as she called it. She said that people who passed across were picky about who they'd communicate with, not like most people you run into on this side... \nThe woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed. \nWOMAN Giff me your hant. \nEd places his hand in the center of the table. \nED (V.O.) ...so you needed a guide who they didn't mind talking to, someone with a gift for talking to souls... \nEd looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes. \nED (V.O.) ...Well, first she told me that my wife was in a peaceful place, that our souls were still connected by some spiritual bond, that she had never stopped loving me even though she'd done some things she wasn't proud of... \nEd looks up at the old woman. \nED (V.O.) ...She was reading me like a book. \nShe is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction. \nED (V.O.) ...And then she started talking about 'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that and was there anything I wanted to tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just be telling it to the old bat. And even if somehow Doris could hear, it wouldn't be on account of this so- called medium. \nAPARTMENT HALLWAY \nEd is leaving. \nED (V.O.) She was a phony. Just another gabber. \nEXT. TENEMENT \nEd emerges from the building. \nED (V.O.) I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my back on the old lady, on the veils, on the ghosts, on the dead, before they all sucked me in... \nEd disappears into the night. \nABUNDAS HOUSE \nIt is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand. \nEd's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets the phone down and comes to the door. \nWALTER Ed, how're you holding up? \nED I'm OK, Walter, thanks. \nWalter opens the door to him. \nWALTER I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible. \nED Yeah. \nWALTER Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here. \nED Sure, Walter. Thanks. \nPARLOR \nBirdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance. \nBIRDY Hello, Mr Crane. \nED Hello, Birdy. \nBIRDY We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry. \nEd sits across from her. \n"}

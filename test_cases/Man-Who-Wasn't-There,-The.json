Big Dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn. \nDAVE ...That's quite a wife you got there. \nED Mm. \nDAVE She's a rare one. \nED How's business, Dave? \nDAVE Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop? \nED All right, I guess. \nDAVE ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day. \nHe chuckles. \nDAVE ...Say, where do you get those things anyway? \nED Specialty store down in Sacramento. \nDAVE Uh-huh. \nThere is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big Dave clears his throat. \nCHURCH \nED (V.O.) Doris and I went to church once a week... \nWe are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting the resurrection of Christ. \nED (V.O.) ...Usually Tuesday night... \nFaintly, we hear an amplified voice: \nCALLER I... seven... \nEd sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit cigarette in his mouth. \nCALLER ...Bee... Four... \nED (V.O.) Doris wasn't big on divine worship... \nDoris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of her. \nED (V.O.) ...and I doubt if she believed in life everlasting; she'd most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth and bingo is probably the extent of it... \nStill focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed: \nDORIS Watch your card, honey. \nCALLER I... sixteen... \nEd continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from his cigarette. \nED (V.O.) I wasn't crazy about the game, but, I don't know, it made her happy, and I found the setting peaceful. \nCALLER Gee... nine... \nDoris sucks in her breath. \nDORIS Jesus, bingo--BINGO! \nBARBERSHOP \nSun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back. \nFRANK ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying? \nED Uh-huh. \n", "test1_true": "ED Uh-huh. \nFRANK Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek? \nED Yeah. \nFRANK Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed... \nWe see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows at the far end of the shop. He is almost blown out by the late-day sunlight hitting the window. \nFRANK ...My point is, this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him, so sell him the goddamn FISH, Ed. \nThe bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle- aged man walks in. He is well dressed--perhaps a little too snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil mustache. \nMAN OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege? \nFRANK We're just closing, friend. \nMAN Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned! \nFRANK Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours-- \nEd cuts in with a jerk of the head. \nED I'll take care of him, go ahead, Frank. Have a seat, mister. \nFrank looks sourly at the stranger. \nFRANK ...You sure, Eddie? \nED Yeah, yeah--go home. \nAs Frank leaves: \nFRANK In your ear, mister. \nThe stranger chuckles. \nSTRANGER Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! Not so fast there, brother-- \nEd has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him back; he lifts off a toupee. \nSTRANGER ...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the experts. 100 percent human hair, handcrafted by Jacques of San Francisco, and I'd hate to have to tell you what I paid for it. \nED Uh-huh. \nSTRANGER Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for it down on the installment plan... \nEd starts to trim the stranger's fringe. \nSTRANGER ...A lot of folks live with the pate exposed. They say the dames think it's sexy. But for my money it's just not good grooming--and grooming, my friend, is probably the most important thing in business--after personality, of course... \nHe twists around to offer his hand. \nSTRANGER ...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to know ya. \nED Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa Rosa? \nCREIGHTON A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital? \nED Uh-- \nCREIGHTON Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul! \nED That right. \nCREIGHTON It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage. \nED Huh. \nCREIGHTON That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on... \n", "test1_id": 2715, "test2_input": "CUSTOMER Ya gotta pump it.

We pulled the detail. \nED My *wife*? \nPERSKY Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh... \nKREBS Homicide. \nPERSKY Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent. \nED I don't understand. \nKREBS He's the dead guy. \nEd stares at him. \nPERSKY ...Yeah, it's a tough break. \nKREBS Visiting ends at five. Too late today.

Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined street similar to his own. He gets out of his car and goes up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a hand of greeting. \nMAN 'Lo, Ed. \nED Hello, Walter. \nHe steps up on the porch. \nThe man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks as the swing moves. His skin glistens with drinker's sweat, and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's put at least a couple away. \nWALTER Have a seat. \nEd glances around but the swing is the only seat. He sits next to Walter. \nED Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home. \nWALTER Oh, hell. Drink? \nED No thanks. \nWALTER Sure you don't need one? \nED I'm fine. \nWALTER OK. Boy. Jesus! \nED Yeah. What do I, uh... \nWALTER Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless. \nHe belches. \nWALTER 'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender. \nED He a good man? \nWALTER Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm... \nED So-- \nWALTER Taking it seriously. \nED So, who should I-- \nThe front door opens and someone speaks through the screen: \nVOICE You want any coffee, Dad? \nEd looks around at the voice. \nVOICE Oh, hello, Mr Crane. \nShe steps out: it is Birdy Abundas. \nEd rises, and they awkwardly shake hands. \nED Hello, Rachel. \nBIRDY I'm so sorry...

Is this procedure? \nThe two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man standing to one side. \nJUDGE Bailiff. \nAs the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various papers. \nRIEDENSCHNEIDER I don't understand... We had a real shot at it...

She'd hanged herself. I'd brought her a dress to wear to court and she'd used the belt. I didn't understand it either.

Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling. \nED (V.O.) ...That wasn't it, I would find out later. For now, everything just seemed ruined... \nMETROPOLE LOBBY \nRiedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags. \nED (V.O.) ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back to Sacramento still shaking his head, saying it was the biggest disappointment of his professional career... \nFRANK'S HOUSE \nDay. Frank's kitchen. \nFrank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown over his pyjamas, unshaven. \nED (V.O.) ...Frankie fell to pieces.

I hired a new man for the second chair... \nEd's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer. \nED (V.O.) ...I'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing when he came in for an interview. But I guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous; once he had the job, he talked from the minute I opened the shop in the morning... \nEXT. BARBERSHOP \nIt is evening.

VINCE It's business, Tess. Not personal. 
TESS My business. Which I built from the ground up. 
MARCUS You're not gonna get another opportunity like this. 
TESS Exactly. She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all their glory. 
TESS (CONT'D) Which is why I'll never let it go. She gets up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus shoots Vince an angry look as they head downstairs. IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus: 
VINCE Don't worry. The balloon payment's due on the first. She doesn't have the money. She has to sell. IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard. Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then: 
SEAN Well. We've had a pretty good run. She looks up. Sean is in the doorway. 
SEAN (CONT'D) Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it up. Let it go. Call it a day. Tess's eyes go steely with determination. 
TESS No. You cannot say that to me. I can eat these "sky is falling" dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be that person. I've scoured dirty flea markets for costumes, stayed up all night sewing till my fingers bled, painted and repainted every goddamn wall of this place myself. 
(MORE) 
TESS (CONT'D) I choreographed every step of every number. I've played nursemaid, sister, mother and shrink to every girl who's ever danced here. I've hocked every keepsake I've ever owned to keep this place afloat. Because this club is the last of it's kind, and if it goes away, one day there won't be anything like it- - and THAT would be a tragedy. So you cannot say that to me. Because now someone's gotta believe in me, Goddamnit. And I need that person to be you. So don't you ever let me hear you say that again. I will never let this club go. Never. Sean looks at her...a wry smile. 
SEAN There she is. Thought I'd lost you for a minute. Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile fades. IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house as..SEAN CROSSES the floor. 
SEAN (CONT'D) Night, Jack. 
JACK Night. Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song. ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. (TBD) The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up, surprised that she is there. 
ALI Beautiful. You write that? 
JACK Just some sentimental crap. Ready? 
She smiles at his modesty. Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her dance bag and they EXIT together. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Jack enters, unloading his keyboard from his back. He hears Ali in the bedroom. He quietly moves over to the ajar bedroom door -- peeks in and sees: ALI, in bra and undies. She hums the song he played the night before in the mirror as she gets dressed. ON JACK, watching, mesmerized. His eyes travel her body. She moves out of view. He leans against the wall to try to keep seeing her -- and steps on the CAT. It MEOWS. He flattens against the wall. Ali looks up. 
ALI Jack? Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it. 
JACK Hey! Just got home! Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it. 
ALI In here! Can you zip me up? In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom. 
ALI (CONT'D) Hey. Where you been? 
JACK Rehearsing. I'm playing a late show tonight. As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO propped against the lamp on the bedside table. 
JACK (CONT'D) Who is that? She picks up the picture. Looks at it. 
ALI Me and my mom on my 7th birthday. She died just a few weeks later. 
JACK She was so young. 
ALI 24. There was so much she never got to do. Sometimes I feel like, if I make the most of my life, part of her will get to live a little more, too. 
JACK Wow. You must miss her. She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close. 
ALI Every single day, something happens I want to tell her about. 
JACK What was today's? A beat. Their eyes connect. 
ALI Don't know. Hasn't happened yet. They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it. His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes, feeling his fingers against her neck. Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable to look away. Until: His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali. 
JACK I should... it's... Natalie. Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone. 
JACK (CONT'D) Hey, babe, how are you? Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the conversation with Natalie. 
JACK (CONT'D) Yes, she's still here-What do you want me to do, it's not like you're here helping out, you know... 
Ali grabs her bag and jacket, heads for the door. MUSIC UP: An incredibly sexy saxophone which takes us to: FULL CLOSE UP: ALI steps into frame, starts singing. 
ALI 
A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME... PULL BACK to reveal she's on stage at the club with the BURLESQUE GIRLS. Finger waves and 1920's sexy clothes. 
ALI (CONT'D) 
I'LL GO FOR ANY TIME. I'M A FAST 
MOVIN' GAL WHO LIKES THEM SLOW. 
GOT NO USE FOR FANCY DRIVIN', WANT 
TO SEE A GUY ARRIVIN' IN LOW. I'D 
BE SATISFIED TO KNOW A GUY WHAT

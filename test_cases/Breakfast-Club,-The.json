SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nDuring Brian's monologue, we see various views of things inside the school including Bender's locker. \nBRIAN (VO) Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer High School, Shermer, Illinois. 60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, what we did was wrong.  But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are, what do you care?  You see us as you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.  You see us as a brain, an athelete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?  That's the way we saw each other at seven o'clock this morning. We were brainwashed... CUT TO: \n2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY \nWe see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the parking lot. \nClaire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob. \nCLAIRE I can't believe you can't get me out of this...I mean it's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday! It's not like I'm a defective or anything... \nCLAIRE'S FATHER I'll make it up to you...Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn't make you a defective.  Have a good day. \nClaire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks up the school front steps CUT TO: \n3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY \nWe are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd. \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Is this the first time or the last time we do this? \nBRIAN (upset) Last... \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Well get in there and use the time to your advantage... \nBRIAN Mom, we're not supposed to study; we just have to sit there and do nothing. \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Well mister you figure out a way to study. \nBRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER (annoyingly) Yeah! \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Well go! \nBrian gets out of the car and walks towards the school. CUT TO: \n4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY \nWe see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock; he\u0092s wearing a letterman\u0092s jacket with lots of patches on it. \nANDREW'S FATHER Hey, I screwed around...guys screw around, there's nothing wrong with that.  Except you got caught, Sport. \nANDREW Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright? \nANDREW'S FATHER (angry) You wanna miss a match?  You wanna blow your ride?  Now no school's gonna give a scholarship to a discipline case. \nBender looks up. \nBENDER Crystal... \nVERNON Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself.  Maybe you'll even--decide whether or not you care to return. \nBrian raises his hand and then stands. \nBRIAN You know, I can answer that right now sir...That'd be \"No\", no for me. 'cause... \nVERNON Sit down Johnson... \nBRIAN Thank you sir... \nHe sits. \nVERNON My office... \nVernon points. \nVERNON ...is right across that hall.  Any monkey business is ill-advised... \nHe looks around at them. \nVERNON ...any questions? \nBENDER Yeah...I got a question. \nVernon looks at him suspiciously. \nBENDER Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe? \nVERNON I'll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns. \nVernon leaves. \nBENDER That man...is a brownie hound... \nEveryone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is Allison, biting her nails. \nBender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her. \nBENDER You keep eating your hand and you're not gonna be hungry for lunch... \nAllison spits part of her nail at Bender. \nBENDER I've seen you before, you know... \nWe see Vernon look out from his office. \nWe see Brian playing with his pen. \nBRIAN (quietly to himself) Who do I think I am?  Who are you? Who are you? \nHe attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top under his upper lip. \nBRIAN I am a walrus... \nBender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth-- embarrassed. \nBender points at Brian. \nBENDER ...they are. (to Brian) What do you guys do in your club? \nBRIAN In physics, um, we ah, we talk about physics...about properties of physics. \nBENDER So it's sorta social...demented and sad, but social.  Right? \nBRIAN Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation.  I mean there are other children in my club and uh, at the end of the year we have, um, you know, a big banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton. \nBENDER You load up, you party... \nBRIAN Well, no, we get dressed up...I mean, but, we don't...we don't get high. \nCLAIRE (to Bender) Only burners like you get high... \nBRIAN And, uh, I didn't have any shoes. So I had to borrow my dad's.  It was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me to wear other people's shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana... He got high once and you know, he started eating like really weird foods.  And uh, and then he just felt like he didn't belong anywhere. You know, kinda like, you know \"Twilight Zone\" kinda. \nCLAIRE (laughs) (to Bender) Sounds like you... \nANDREW Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here...I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads... \nBENDER (to Andrew) Oh and wouldn't that be a bite... \nBender lets out a moan of fake agony. \nBENDER Missing a whole wrestling meet! \nANDREW Well you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot!  You never competed in your whole life! \nBENDER (with mock hurt) Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside because of it.  I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys! \nANDREW Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You don't have any goals. \nBENDER Oh, but I do! \nANDREW Yeah? \nBENDER I wanna be just--like--you!  I figure all I need's a labotamy and some tights! \nBrian becomes interested. \nBRIAN You wear tights? \nANDREW (to Brian) No I don't wear tights, I wear the required uniform... \nBRIAN Tights... \nANDREW (defensive) Shut up! \nThey hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table. Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway. \nBRIAN You know there's not s'posed to be any monkey business! \nBender turns and points at Brian. \nBENDER (in a stern voice) Young man...have you finished your paper? \nBender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks around cautiously and removes a screw from the door. \nCLAIRE We were just sitting here, like we were s'posed to... \nVernon looks around and looks at Bender. \nVERNON Who closed that door? \nBENDER I think a screw fell out of it... \nANDREW It just closed, sir... \nVernon looks at Allison in the back. \nVERNON Who? \nAllison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the table, hiding in her jacket hood. \nBENDER She doesn't talk, sir... \nVERNON (to Bender) Give me that screw... \nBENDER I don't have it... \nVERNON You want me to yank you outta that seat and shake it out of you? \nBENDER I don't have it...screws fall out all of the time, the world's an imperfect place... \nVERNON Give it to me, Bender... \nCLAIRE Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw? \nVERNON (to Claire) Watch it, young lady... \nVernon goes over to the door.  He tries to hold it open by putting a folding chair in front of it. \nBENDER The door's way too heavy, sir. \nThe door slams shut despite the chair. \nVERNON (OS) God damnit! \nThey laugh. \nVernon opens the door again.  He comes back in. \nVERNON (pointing) Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on, front and center, let's go. \nAndrew gets up and walks over to Vernon. \nBENDER Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up? If he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy! \nVernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel magazine rack in front of the door. \nVERNON Okay, now, watch the magazines! \nBENDER It's out of my hands... \nThey get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire door. \nBENDER That's very clever sir, but what if there's a fire?  I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir. \nBENDER Do you really think I give a shit? \nVERNON Another... \nBender glares at him. \nVERNON You through? \nBENDER How many is that? \nBRIAN That's seven including the one when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet. \nVERNON (to Bender) Now it's eight... (to Brian) You stay out of it! \nBRIAN Excuse me, sir, it's seven! \nVERNON Shut up, Peewee! (to Bender) You're mine Bender...for two months I gotcha!  I gotcha! \nBENDER What can I say?  I'm thrilled! \nVERNON Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you want these people to believe.  You know something, Bender?  You ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people.  You might be better off. (to everyone) Alright, that's it!  I'm going to be right outside those doors.  The next time I hafta come in here...I'm cracking skulls!  (Bender mouths \u0093I\u0092m cracking skulls\u0094) \nVernon leaves and closes the door.  A musical riff builds to a climax as Bender screams. \nBENDER (screams) Fuck you! \nWe see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight. \nWe see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a cigarette with his shoe. \nWe see Claire thinking. \nWe see Brian playing with his balls. \nWe see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt. \nWe see Allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple. \nWe see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then plays air guitar. \nWe see Allison drawing. \nWe see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers silently. \nAllison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture. \nWe see everyone fall asleep. CUT TO: \n13. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nLater. \nVernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids. \nVERNON Wake up!  Who has to go to the lavatory? \nEveryone raises their hands. CUT TO: \n14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nANDREW I said leave her alone! \nBENDER You gonna make me? \nANDREW Yeah... \nBender walks over to where Andrew is standing. \nBENDER You and how many of your friends? \nANDREW Just me, just you and me.  Two hits. Me hitting you, you hitting the floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal! \nBender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on the ground with a wrestling move. \nBENDER I don't wanna get into to this with you man... \nAndrew gets up. \nANDREW Why not? \nBender gets up. \nBENDER 'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple. I'd kill you and your fucking parents would sue me and it would be a big mess and I don't care enough about you to bother. \nANDREW Chicken shit... \nAndrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a switchblade and opens it. \nHe stabs the switchblade into a chair. \nANDREW Let's end this right now.  You don't talk to her...you don't look at her and you don't even think about her! You understand me? \nBENDER I'm trying to help her!. \nWe see the janitor, CARL come into the room. \nCARL Brian, how you doing? \nBENDER Your dad works here? \nBrian is embarrassed. \nBENDER Uh, Carl? \nCARL What? \nBENDER Can I ask you a question? \nCARL Sure... \nBENDER How does one become a janitor? \nCARL You wanna be a janitor? \nBENDER No I just wanna know how one becomes a janitor because Andrew here, is very interested in persuing a career in the custodial arts... \nCARL Oh, really?  You guys think I'm just some untouchable peasant?  Peon? Huh?  Maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years I've learned a couple of things...I look through your letters, I look through your lockers...I listen to your conversations, you don't know that but I do...I am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends.  By the way, that clock's twenty minutes fast! \nEveryone groans.  Bender smiles. \nAllison doesn't answer. \nANDREW What do you drink? \nAllison still doesn't answer. \nANDREW Okay...forget I asked... \nAllison waits for two beats and then speaks. \nALLISON Vodka... \nANDREW Vodka?  When do you drink vodka? \nALLISON Whenever... \nANDREW A lot? \nAllison smiles. \nALLISON Tons... \nANDREW Is that why you're here today? \nAllison doesn't answer. \nANDREW Why are you here? \nAllison snaps back. \nALLISON Why are you here? \nThey stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall. \nANDREW Um, I'm here today...because uh, because my coach and my father don't want me to blow my ride.  See I get treated differently because uh, Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does my old man.  I'm not a winner because I wanna be one... I'm a winner because I got strength and speed.  Kinda like a race horse. That's about how involved I am in what's happening to me. \nALLISON Yeah?  That's very interesting. Now why don't you tell me why you're really in here. \nANDREW Forget it! CUT TO: \n17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nClaire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around waiting for the Cokes. \nBENDER Claire...you wanna see a picture of a guy with elephantitus of the nuts? It's pretty tasty... \nCLAIRE No thank you... \nBENDER How do you think he rides a bike? \nClaire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust. \nBENDER Oh, Claire...would you ever consider dating a guy like this? \nCLAIRE Can't you just leave me alone? \nBENDER I mean if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car...Although you'd probably have to ride in the back seat 'cause his nuts would ride shotgun. \nCLAIRE You know what I wish I was doing? \nBENDER Well Brian, it doesn't sound like you're doing any business... \nCLAIRE I think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin... \nBender looks suprised. \nBRIAN You do? \nClaire smiles and nods. CUT TO: \n18.  INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nLater. \nEverybody has lunches now. \nClaire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag. \nBENDER What's in there? \nCLAIRE Guess, where's your lunch? \nBENDER You're wearing it... \nCLAIRE You're nauseating... \nBender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who catches it without even looking up. \nBender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter. \nBENDER What's that? \nCLAIRE Sushi... \nBENDER Sushi? \nCLAIRE Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed. \nBENDER You won't accept a guys tongue in your mouth and you're gonna eat that? \nCLAIRE Can I eat? \nBENDER I don't know...give it a try... \nWe now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag of cookies and a carton of milk. \nAllison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly slurps it up off the table and her fingers. \nAndrew sees Bender looking at him. \nANDREW What's your problem? \nAllison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up. It lands on the sculpture above. \nShe opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that. She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it. \nBender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes Brian's bag lunch. \nBENDER What're we having? \nBENDER Do you believe this?  Huh?  It's about the size of a cigar...Do I stutter?  You see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage. \nBender begins to walk away. \nBENDER See I don't think that I need to sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore! \nBender walks over to a map table and throws all the maps on the floor.  He climbs up on top of the table and then up to the second floor balcony. \nCLAIRE (to Andrew) You shouldn't have said that! \nANDREW How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway! CUT TO: \n19. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY \nVernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to pour coffee out of his thermos.  The top comes off and the coffee goes all over his desk. \nVERNON Oh, shit! CUT TO: \n20. INT. HALLWAY - DAY \nVernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself. \nVERNON Coffee...looks like they scrape it off the bottom of the Mississippi river.  Everything's polluted, everything's polluted...the coffee. \nBender comes out of the library doors followed bye veryone else. \nBender and Claire are walking next to each other. Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the end of the line, Allison is following. \nCLAIRE (to Bender) How do you know where Vernon went? \nBENDER I don't... \nCLAIRE Well then, how do you know when he'll be back? \nBENDER I don't...being bad feels pretty good, huh? \nBRIAN (to Andrew) What's the point in going to Bender's locker? \nANDREW Beats me... \nBRIAN This is so stupid...Why do you think, why are we risking getting caught? \nANDREW I dunno... \nBRIAN So then what are we doing? \nANDREW You ask me one more question and I'm beating the shit out of you! \nBRIAN Sorry... \nBender opens his locker. \nANDREW Slob! \nBENDER My maid's on vacation. \nBender pulls out a bag of marijuana. \nBRIAN Drugs... \nBender runs away singing loudly.  \u0093I wanna be an airborne ranger...\u0094 \nWe see Vernon hear Bender. \nThe rest of them run. \nVERNON That son of a bitch! \nWe see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in the gym. \nBender is going up for a basket. \nBENDER Three...two...one! \nHe dunks the ball.  Vernon enters. \nVERNON Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is this?  What are you doing here, what is this? \nBENDER Oh, hi! \nVERNON Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's over! \nBENDER Don't you wanna hear my excuse? \nVERNON Out! \nBENDER I'm thinking of trying out for a scholarship. \nVERNON Gimmie the ball, Bender. \nBender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him. \nThey leave. CUT TO: \n21. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nThe rest of the kids are all sitting back in their seats when Bender and Vernon enter.  Vernon pushes Bender. \nVERNON Get your stuff, let's go! (to everyone) Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon himself to go to the gymnasium.  I'm sorry to inform you, you're going to be without his services for the rest of the day. \nBENDER (to Vernon) B-O-O H-O-O! \nVERNON Everything's a big joke, huh Bender? The false alarm you pulled, Friday, false alarms are really funny, aren't they...What if your home, what if your family... (a beat) ...what if your dope was on fire? \nBENDER Impossible, sir...It's in Johnson's underwear... \nAndrew laughs. \nVERNON (to Andrew) You think he's funny?  You think this is cute?  You think he's bitchin', is that it?  Lemme tell you something.  Look at him, he's a bum. (to everybody) You wanna see something funny?  You go visit John Bender in five years! You'll see how God damned funny he is! (to Bender) What's the matter, John?  You gonna cry?  Let's go... \nVernon grabs Bender's shoulder. \nBENDER Hey keep your fuckin' hands off me! I expect better manners from you, Dick! \nBender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays them in front of Andrew. \nBENDER For better hallway vision! \nBender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the way. CUT TO: \nUnder the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's legs. \nANDREW What noise? \nCLAIRE Really, sir, there wasn't any noise... \nClaire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her knees. \nEveryone starts faking a coughing fit. \nCLAIRE (flustered) That noise?  Was that the noise you were talking about? \nVERNON No, it wasn't.  That was not the noise I was talking about.  Now, I may not have caught you in the act this time, but you can bet I will. \nAllison laughs at Vernon. \nVERNON You make book on that missy! (to Claire) And you!  I will not be made a fool of! \nHe turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the toilet seat cover stuck to his pants. Vernon leaves. \nEveryone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a barage of slaps. \nBENDER It was an accident! \nCLAIRE You're an asshole! \nBENDER So sue me... \nBender gets up and walks over to Brian. \nBENDER So, Ahab...Kybo Mein Doobage... \nBrian gives Bender his bag of marajuana.

I'm so popular, everybody loves me so much, at this school... \nBENDER Poor baby. \nBrian waves Claire over to him and he falls over. \nAndrew is impressed. \nANDREW Wow!

Either you really wanna run away or you want people to think you wanna run away. \nALLISON Eat shit! \nAllison gets up and walks away. \nBRIAN The girl is an island, with herself.

I never did it! \nSilence for two beats. \nALLISON I never did it either, I'm not a nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive liar... \nCLAIRE You are such a bitch!  You did that on purpose just to fuck me over! \nALLISON I would do it though...If you love someone it's okay... \nCLAIRE I can't believe you, you're so weird.  You don't say anything all day and then when you open your mouth...you unload all these tremendous lies all over me! \nANDREW You're just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn't want to admit to... \nCLAIRE Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre... \nANDREW What's bizarre?  I mean we're all pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all. \nCLAIRE (to Andrew) How are you bizarre? \nAllison decides to field that question. \nALLISON He can't think for himself... \nANDREW She's right...do you guys know what, uh, what I did to get in here?  I taped Larry Lester's buns together. \nClaire laughs. \nBRIAN (to Andrew) That was you? \nANDREW (to Brian) Yeah, you know him? \nBRIAN Yeah, I know him... \nANDREW Well then you know how hairy he is, right?  Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too... \nCLAIRE Oh my God... \nANDREW And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man...I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do.  And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee.  And Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me.  Yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And afterwards, when I was sittin' in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him.  And the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt.  It mustuv been unreal...I mean, (he's crying) I mean, how do you apologize for something like that?  There's no way...it's all because of me and my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate him!  He's like this...he's like this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore...\"Andrew, you've got to be number one!  I won't tolerate any losers in this family...Your intensity is for shit! Win.  Win!  WIN!!!\"  You son of a bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give...and I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore.  And he could forget all about me... \nBENDER I think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling. \nAndrew laughs briefly. \nBRIAN It's like me, you know, with my grades...like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know?  And I see me and I don't like what I see, I really don't. \nCLAIRE What's wrong with you?  Why don't you like yourself? \nBRIAN 'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing shop.  See we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um...and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on...my light didn't go on, I got a F on it.  Never got a F in my life... When I signed up, you know, for the course I mean.  I thought I was playing it real smart, you know. 'Cause I thought, I'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average... \nBENDER Why'd you think it'd be easy? \nANDREW You fucking prick! \nBender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his words hitting home. \nBENDER What do you care what I think, anyway?  I don't even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference...I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? (he turns to Claire) And you...don't like me anyway! \nCLAIRE You know, I have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them! \nBENDER God, you're so pathetic! (furious) Don't you ever...ever!  Compare yourself to me!  Okay?  You got everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin' Rapunzel, right?

Your mouth! \nBENDER Or did your daddy buy those? \nCLAIRE (furious) Shut up! \nClaire starts crying. \nBENDER I bet he bought those for you!  I bet those are a Christmas gift! Right?  You know what I got for Christmas this year?  It was a banner fuckin' year at the old Bender family!  I got a carton of cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me and said \"Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!\" Okay, so go home'n cry to your daddy, don't cry here, okay? \nThere are a few beats. \nANDREW My God, are we gonna be like our parents? \nCLAIRE Not me...ever... \nALLISON It's unavoidable, it just happens. \nCLAIRE What happens? \nALLISON When you grow up, your heart dies. \nBENDER Who cares? \nAllison is on the verge of tears herself. \nALLISON I care... \nBRIAN Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I know it's kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering, um, what is gonna happen to us on Monday?  When we're all together again?  I mean I consider you guys my friends, I'm not wrong, am I? \nANDREW No... \nBRIAN So, so on Monday...what happens? \nCLAIRE Are we still friends, you mean? If we're friends now, that is? \nBRIAN Yeah... \nCLAIRE Do you want the truth? \nBRIAN Yeah, I want the truth... \nCLAIRE I don't think so... \nBrian hides his head in his arm because he is crying. \nBRIAN Know why I'm here today?  Do you? I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a gun in the locker... \nANDREW Why'd you have a gun in your locker? \nBRIAN I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on...and it didn't go on, I mean, I... \nANDREW What's the gun for Brian? \nBRIAN Just forget it... \nANDREW You brought it up, man! \nBRIAN I can't have an F, I can't have it and I know my parents can't have it! Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I'm still only a B.  And everything's ruined for me! \nCLAIRE (with pity) Oh Brian... \nBrian bashes a chair over. \nBRIAN So I considered my options, you know? \nCLAIRE No!  Killing yourself is not an option! \nBRIAN Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I don't think so! \nALLISON It was a hand gun? \nBRIAN No, it was a flare gun, went off in my locker. \nANDREW Really? \nAndrew starts to laugh. \nBRIAN It's not funny... \nThey all start to laugh, including Brian. \nBRIAN Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was destroyed! \nALLISON You wanna know what I did to get in here?

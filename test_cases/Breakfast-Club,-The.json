SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nDuring Brian's monologue, we see various views of things inside the school including Bender's locker. \nBRIAN (VO) Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer High School, Shermer, Illinois. 60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, what we did was wrong.  But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are, what do you care?  You see us as you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.  You see us as a brain, an athelete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?  That's the way we saw each other at seven o'clock this morning. We were brainwashed... CUT TO: \n2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY \nWe see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the parking lot. \nClaire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob. \nCLAIRE I can't believe you can't get me out of this...I mean it's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday! It's not like I'm a defective or anything... \nCLAIRE'S FATHER I'll make it up to you...Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn't make you a defective.  Have a good day. \nClaire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks up the school front steps CUT TO: \n3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY \nWe are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd. \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Is this the first time or the last time we do this? \nBRIAN (upset) Last... \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Well get in there and use the time to your advantage... \nBRIAN Mom, we're not supposed to study; we just have to sit there and do nothing. \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Well mister you figure out a way to study. \nBRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER (annoyingly) Yeah! \nBRIAN'S MOTHER Well go! \nBrian gets out of the car and walks towards the school. CUT TO: \n4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY \nWe see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock; he\u0092s wearing a letterman\u0092s jacket with lots of patches on it. \nANDREW'S FATHER Hey, I screwed around...guys screw around, there's nothing wrong with that.  Except you got caught, Sport. \nANDREW Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright? \nANDREW'S FATHER (angry) You wanna miss a match?  You wanna blow your ride?  Now no school's gonna give a scholarship to a discipline case. \n", "test1_true": "5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAY \nWe see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't stop walking. \nThe car slams on its breaks directly in front of him. \nBender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps forward to look in the car's front window and the car drives away. CUT TO: \n6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nThere are six tables in two rows of three. Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in and sits at the table behind her. \nAndrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there. \nIn walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. \nHe walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian reluctantly gets up and moves. \nBender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up. \nAllison walks in.  She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian. \nAndrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. \nBrian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. \nEnter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job. \nVERNON Well...well.  Here we are!  I want to congradulate you for being on time... \nClaire raises her hand. \nCLAIRE Excuse me, sir?  I think there's been a mistake.  I know it's detention, but...um...I don't think I belong in here... \nVernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk. \nVERNON It is now seven-oh-six.  You have exactly eight hours and fifty-four minutes to think about why you're here.  To ponder the error of your ways... \nBender spits into the air and catches the spit in his mouth again. \nClaire looks like she is going to gag. \nVERNON ...and you may not talk.  You will not move from these seats. \nHe glances up at Bender and points at him. \nVERNON ...and you... \nVernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet. \nVERNON ...will not sleep.  Alright people, we're gonna try something a little different today.  We are going to write an essay--of no less than a thousand words--describing to me who you think you are. \nBENDER Is this a test? \nVernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice of Bender. \nVERNON And when I say essay...I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr. Bender? \n", "test1_id": 1050, "test2_input": "Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's legs. \nANDREW What noise? \nCLAIRE Really, sir, there wasn't any noise... \nClaire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her knees. \nEveryone starts faking a coughing fit. \nCLAIRE (flustered) That noise?  Was that the noise you were talking about? \nVERNON No, it wasn't.  That was not the noise I was talking about.  Now, I may not have caught you in the act this time, but you can bet I will. \nAllison laughs at Vernon. \nVERNON You make book on that missy! (to Claire) And you!  I will not be made a fool of! \nHe turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the toilet seat cover stuck to his pants. Vernon leaves. \nEveryone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a barage of slaps. \nBENDER It was an accident! \nCLAIRE You're an asshole! \nBENDER So sue me... \nBender gets up and walks over to Brian. \nBENDER So, Ahab...Kybo Mein Doobage... \nBrian gives Bender his bag of marajuana.  Bender turns and walks away. \nANDREW Yo waistoid...you're not gonna blaze up in here! \nClaire gets up and goes after him.  Then Brian. \nANDREW Shit... \nAndrew goes. CUT TO: \n25. INT. STAIRS - DAY \nWe see Vernon go down the stairs. CUT TO: \n26. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nBrian, Bender and Claire are sitting in a circle and laughing hysterically. \nBender lights Claire up and she coughs the smoke out. Brian laughs at her.  He exhales and tries to eat the smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice. \nBRIAN Chicks, cannot hold der smoke!  That's what it is! \nCLAIRE Do you know how popular I am?  I'm so popular, everybody loves me so much, at this school... \nBENDER Poor baby. \nBrian waves Claire over to him and he falls over. \n", "test2_true": "He goes back in the room he was in.  He screams and it shatters the glass in the door. CUT TO: \n27. INT. BASEMENT - DAY \nVernon is glancing through the confidential files in the school basement. \nVERNON (to himself) Mister, oh mister Tearney...a history of slight mental illness? Wooh, no wonder he's so fucked up! \nCarl enters. \nCARL Afternoon, Dick... \nVERNON Hey Carl, how you doin'? \nCARL Good... \nVERNON Good, what's up? \nCARL Not much, what's happening, what are you doing in the basement files? \nVERNON Oh, nothin' nothin' here.  I'm just doin' a little homework here... \nCARL Homework, huh? \nVERNON Yeah... \nCarl, laughing, comes over and looks at the files that Vernon was looking at. \nCARL Confidential files...hmmm? \nVERNON Look, Carl...this is a highly sensitive area and I, I tell you something...certain people would be very very embarrassed.  I would really appreciate it if if if if this would be something that, that you and I could keep between us... \nCARL What're you gonna do for me, man? \nVERNON Well, well what would you like? \nCARL Got fifty bucks? \nVERNON What? \nCARL Fifty bucks... CUT TO: \n28. INT. LIBRARY - DAY \nWe see Andrew and Brian laughing.  Allison is hanging out over by the statue in the back of the library. \nANDREW No no man, no; you got a middle name? \nBRIAN Yeah, guess... \nAllison suddenly takes interest in the conversation and as she speaks, she moves over and sits next to the two. \nALLISON Your middle name is Ralph, as in puke... \nBrian and Andrew look at her in confusion. \nALLISON ...your birthday is March 12th, you're five-nine and a half you weigh a hundred and thirty pounds and your social security number is (a beat) \n", "test2_id": 1051, "test3_input": "Andrew is impressed. \nANDREW Wow!  Are you psychic? \nALLISON No... \nBRIAN Well would you mind telling me how you know all this about me? \nAllison reaches in her bag. \nALLISON I stole your wallet... \nShe produces it in her hands and grins. \nBRIAN Give it to me... \nALLISON No... \nBRIAN Give it! \nAllison reluctantly hands over the wallet and Brian glances through it to make sure nothing is missing. \nBRIAN This is great...you're a thief too! Huh? \nALLISON I'm not a thief! \nBRIAN Multi-talented! \nALLISON What's there to steal?  Two bucks and a beaver shot! \nANDREW A what? \nALLISON He's got a nudie picture in there! I saw it, it's perverted! \nANDREW Alright, let's see it! \nWe see Bender, he is brushing his teeth with one of Claire's cosmetic brushes. \nWe see Claire looking through Bender's wallet pictures. \nCLAIRE Are all these your girlfriends? \nBENDER Some of them... \nCLAIRE What about the others? \nBENDER Well, some I consider my girlfriends and some...I just consider... \nCLAIRE Consider what? \nBENDER Whether or not, I wanna hang out with them... \nCLAIRE You don't believe in just one guy, one girl? \nBENDER Do you? \nCLAIRE Yeah...that's the way it should be. \nBENDER Well, not for me... \n", "test3_true": "Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that.  He acts defensive. \nBENDER How come you got so much shit in your purse? \nCLAIRE How come you got so many girlfriends? \nBENDER I asked you first... \nCLAIRE (shrugs) I dunno...I guess I never throw anything away. \nBENDER Neither do I... \nCLAIRE Oh... \nWe cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet. \nANDREW This is the worst fake ID I've ever seen... \nBrian laughs. \nANDREW Do you realize you made yourself sixty eight? \nBRIAN Oh, I know...I know, I goofed it... \nANDREW What do you need a fake ID for? \nBRIAN (like it's obvious) So I can vote! \nAllison looks up suddenly. \nALLISON You wanna see what's in my bag? \nBRIAN & ANDREW No! \nAllison looks hurt and then resentful.  Just to spite them, she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch. \nLots of stuff comes out. \nANDREW Holy shit!  What is all that stuff? \nBRIAN Do you always carry this much shit in your bag? \nALLISON Yeah...I always carry this much shit ...in my bag...You never know when you may have to jam... \nBRIAN Are you gonna be like a shopping bag lady?  You know like, sit in alleyways and like talk to buildings and wear men's shoes and that kinda thing? \nALLISON I'll do what I have to do... \nBRIAN Why do you have to do anything? \nALLISON (with feeling) My home life is un...satisfying... \nBRIAN So you're saying you'd subject yourself to the violent dangers of the Chicago streets because your homelife is unsatisfying? \nALLISON I don't have to run away and live in the street...I can run away and, go to the ocean, I can go to the country, I can go to the mountains.

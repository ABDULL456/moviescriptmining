We hear another NOISE O.S. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Oh shit -- 
Kale looks out --

KALE'S POV - Giles' GARAGE DOOR STARTS TO CLOSE. 
KALE Ronnie? 
RONNIE (staticky) -- make it -- interference -- somebody's here -- 
KALE Ronnie?! 
Dead air.    Giles' GARAGE DOOR SLAMS SHUT. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie picks up the camera, aims it at his face. Looking terrified. The camera swings away as we see Ronnie's feet scrambling along the concrete floor and then -- they appear to RACE THROUGH A DOORWAY ONTO DIMLY LIT HARDWOOD FLOOR -- making us and Kale realize -- 
KALE (CONT'D) He's in the house -- (into walkie) Ronnie? 
Still nothing. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Shaky. We catch GLIMPSES OF RONNIE'S FEET -- hauling ass down a HALLWAY, ROUNDING A CORNER ONTO CARPET, THEN BACK ONTO HARDWOOD -- 
KALE (CONT'D) What the hell -- 
ON THE SCREEN - Ronnie suddenly PANS THE CAMERA up to his face as he runs, clearly mouthing "HELP ME!!" 
KALE (CONT'D) RONNIE!    Shit -- 
Then -- the camera seems to fall, SLIDING ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR TOWARD AN OLD BOOKCASE... 
THE IMAGE CUTS OUT -- GOES TO ALL SNOW -- 
Kale jumps up, pacing. Peers out the window to Giles'. No telling what the hell's happening -- or happened -- in there. 
Kale eyes his ankle bracelet.      Green light.   Kale eyes his bat. Grabs it. Fuck it.

85   EXT. KALE'S BACK YARD - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER                      85 
Kale SLAMS out the back door, races across the yard, skips over his kite string boundary -- 
ON HIS ANKLE BRACELET - Red light FLASHES. 
WITH KALE - he hops the fence, racing to... 
86   EXT. GILES' BACK YARD/HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                   86 
KALE Ronnie?! 
Kale darts to Giles' back door, tries the knob -- locked. 
KALE (CONT'D) Ronnie, can you hear me?! Giles, open the door!! 
The house is still. Kale bolts around the side, uneasily feeling his way through shadows and low-hanging branches. 
87   EXT. GILES' FRONT YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                        87 
It's even darker on this side. No lights on in Giles' house. Kale cautiously rounds the side, approaches the front door -- it's open a few inches -- darkness beyond. 
Kale eyes it a beat. Then -- steps up onto the porch, about to push it open when -- SIRENS BLARE O.S. 
Kale SPINS AROUND to see A POLICE CRUISER ROLLING TO A STOP. Kale races toward it as two uniformed officers step out -- 
KALE Hey! 
The officer pulls his sidearm, aims it at Kale -- 
UNIFORM #1 Freeze.    Hands above your head, now!! 
KALE Please, my friend's been kidnapped, he's in this house -- he's inside, I think the owner's trying to kill him -- 
UNIFORM #1 Stay right there. 
UNIFORM #2 I've got it -- 
Uniform #2 heads briskly to Giles' front door.

DISPATCHER (V.O.) (over mic) 13A74, ten-four, units already in the area, will advise -- 
Kale watches as Uniform #2 approaches the Giles' door.

FBI #4 Check the bathroom. 
FBI #5 opens the bathroom door. Empty. Both Agents hurry to the window, SEE OUTSIDE: A large TREE six feet out from the ledge and a broken branch at street level. A seemingly impossible escape route. 
FBI #4 (CONT'D) Sonofabitch. This guy's crazy. 
INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - MORNING 
A badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous agents around a conference table. 
NOKES 
walks the room, says to all: 
NOKES This is an atrocity, gentlemen. Incompetence at it's highest level. I gave you my name. My resources. My trust...Carte blanche. And now this handsome face of mine...can't step foot in Washington, for fear of being laughed off the Hill. 
Nokes circles behind Bud... 
NOKES Now, I'd love to point to Local on this. But truth is, they've carried their weight. We are federally fucked... (looks right at Fitch) Because Federal fucked up. 
Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard. 
NOKES So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of command? Point of procedure? I don't give a fuck. That's out the window, just like our informant... (beat) I want Jesse Wheeler found. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY, FEDERAL BUILDING 
As everyone files out. Braddock says low to Bud: 
BRADDOCK You smell like a fuckin' distillery, Bud. Clean up... 'find your boy. 
ON BUD. Tired eyes. Everything else, and now this... 
INT. STORAGE GARAGE - DAY 
A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in. 
A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement. 
Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS. 
Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag. 
Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers, shaves his scalp and mustache. 
Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BAYOU GHOULA - NIGHT 
A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou. Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays. 
INT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT 
Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere. 
There's a METALLIC BANG O.S. 
Long-Hair looks up. 
The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat, slowly approaching... 
LONG-HAIR Who's there? 
Sudden surprise as the screen SNAPS OFF and a SILHOUETTE breaks the glass, opens it. 
LONG-HAIR What the fuck?! 
Long-Hair RUSHES for the door as THE BUTT OF A 12-GAUGE SLAMS DOWN LIKE A TOMAHAWK. 
Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream. 
Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT 
The front lights go out. A terrible darkness. 
INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT 
A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in. Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck. 
They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward, reaches the doorway, creeps through... 
INT. BEDROOM 
The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau. 
As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse. Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once. 
The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking. Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't. 
The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner. 
Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

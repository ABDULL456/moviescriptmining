They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the 
MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS) 
A city-sized, mall-like environment. All under a GIANT DOME. The ceiling simulates the sun and sky. A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Buy N Large. Everything you need to be happy. Your day is very important to us. 
Wall-E is gobsmacked. A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him. Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E. 
JOHN Hey, Drink-bot. 
Wall-E shies away. John reaches farther out with the cup. 
JOHN Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa! 
Reaches too far. John falls to the floor. Flails like an upside down turtle. Unable to stand on his baby legs. 
Instantly, SIRENS. Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive. Block John's accident. EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor. Redirect the hover chair traffic. John reaches out for assistance. Nobody notices. Just drive past. 
JOHN Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help. 
STEWARD Please remain stationary. A service-bot will be here to assist you momentarily. 
Suddenly John begins to rise. 
JOHN Uhh...Hey! What's going on? 
Wall-E lifting him up from behind. Loads him back onto his chair. John doesn't know how to react. Wall-E waves hello. 
WALL-E Wall-E! 
JOHN Uhh... John. 
WALL-E Ee-vah? 
JOHN Uh no, John. 
Wall-E scans the concourse. Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL. He races after them. Abandons the stunned John. 
WALL-E Ee-vah! 
JOHN (small wave) Bye...Wall-E. 
ON MONORAIL 
It pulls out of the station. Wall-E leaps on. Barely catches the last car. It glides down the concourse. 
INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER 
A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS. All wearing matching BNL ONESIES. Motionless in their HOVER RINGS. They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens. 
NANNY-BOT "A"! "A" is for "Axiom", your home sweet home. "B"! "B" is for "Buy N Large", your very best friend... 
OUT THE WINDOW 
Wall-E's monorail glides past. 
ON MONORAIL 
Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery. Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by. Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.

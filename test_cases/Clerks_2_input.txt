SMOKER I was in the Food City last year when the same thing happened, different guy though. Stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit. I ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more. 
RANDAL Get out of here. 
SMOKER I kid you not. They call it Shell Shock. Only happens with guidance counselors for some reason. The kid said they used to make a big deal about it, but there's no point. 
The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor. He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor. 
SMOKER (O.C.) He said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody. 
DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man. 
DANTE Why guidance counselors? 
SMOKER If your job served as little purpose as theirs, wouldn't you lose it, too? 
RANDAL Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kind of worthless. 
SMOKER (grabbing matches) See? It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys. That's why I kill Chinamen for the railroad. 
CUT TO: 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY 
POV RANDAL: THE EMPTY COUNTER 
And then a LITTLE GIRL comes into view, smiling and holding money. She can't be any more than five. 
LITTLE GIRL (innocently) Can I have a pack of cigarettes? 
RANDAL, without looking up from his magazine, completes the transaction. THE LITTLE GIRL puts a cigarette in her mouth. RANDAL hands her matches. DANTE returns to the counter as the girl skips away. Dante holds a price gun. 
DANTE Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie. 
RANDAL You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour? 
DANTE What's a jizz-mopper? 
RANDAL He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off. 
DANTE Nudie booth? 
RANDAL Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth? 
DANTE I guess not. 
A female CUSTOMER pops items onto the counter. DANTE rings her up. 
RANDAL Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks. 
DANTE What kind of show? 
RANDAL Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body...any opening. (to customer) He's led a very sheltered life. 
DANTE (indicating CUSTOMER) Can we talk about this later? 
RANDAL The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away. 
CUSTOMER (grabbing her bag, disgusted) This is the last time I come to this place. 
DANTE Excuse me? 
CUSTOMER Using filthy language in front of the customers...you should both get fired. 
DANTE We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away. 
CUSTOMER Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive. 
The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something. 
RANDAL Well, you think that's offensive... 
RANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open. 
RANDAL ...then check this out. I think you can see her kidneys. 
RANDAL checks out the centerfold wistfully. DANTE frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting CUSTOMER. 
DANTE Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please, wait a second, ma'am... 
The CUSTOMER is gone. DANTE'S pursuit stops at the counter. DANTE turns on RANDAL. 
DANTE Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss. 
RANDAL Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers. 
DANTE I'm gonna hear it tomorrow. 
RANDAL You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer. 
DANTE What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. 
RANDAL Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis. 
DANTE There aren't. 
RANDAL How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?

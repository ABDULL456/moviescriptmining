She gives him a terrible slap. 
JAMES (ironic) You always hurt the ones you love. 
LAURA You mean the ones you pity. 
JAMES Say anything you want...  I know you love me and I love you. 
LAURA I do love you. (whispers) Let's get lost together. 
211.    CONTINUED: 
They kiss again.  Hot.  Hands everywhere. 
LAURA (continued) (breaking away) Shit, maybe he'll kill you. 
JAMES What? 
LAURA When he finds out. 
JAMES What? 
LAURA Bobby killed a guy. 
JAMES What are you talking about?  Bobby didn't kill anybody. 
LAURA You want to see... 
JAMES See what? 
LAURA (disgusted) Right.  Open your eyes, James.  You don't know me.  Even _Donna_ doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared...  It's just me now. 
James grabs her trying to control her.  She twists out of his arms. 
LAURA (continued) How 'bout this, James? 
She lifts her hand and gives him the finger.  James ignores the finger and kisses her, but she's gone ice cold. 
LAURA (continued) I think you want to take me home now, James. 
She leads him back to the bike.  He won't start it. 
LAURA (continued) Oh, quit crying.  I've had enough of your fucking caring. 
He kicks the bike to a start.  Behind him, Laura watches and silently starts to cry. 
212.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT 
Laura and James on the bike make their way down to Sparkwood and Twenty One. 
Laura leans way back on the bike. 
LAURA'S POV 
Looking up at the trees as they fly by in a dark blur. 
LAURA AND JAMES 
LAURA The trees...  the trees... 
Laura screams with agony and tries to get off as they approach the light.  Laura falls off as they skid to a stop. 
JAMES (confused and terrified) Laura... 
Laura crawls back up and puts her hands around James' neck. 
LAURA (from far away she screams) JAMES, I LOVE YOU. 
For a moment she focuses on him.  She looks like the Laura that James loves.  Innocent and Beautiful. 
Laura turns and sees the woods.  It pulls her.  She releases her hold on James and runs into the waiting darkness. 
The red light swings in the wind above James.  It turns green, but he doesn't move.  When the light turns red again, James guns the engine and lifts the bike up on its back tire.  James screams then roars down the road away from us. 
Off to the side of the road lies Doc Hayward's wilted red rose. 
213.    EXT.  PACKARD LOGGING ROAD - MIDNIGHT 
Laura runs up thru the woods.  At the Packard Logging Road Laura meets Jacques, Leo and Ronette all standing around Leo's red corvette. 
JACQUES Right on time, baby. 
LAURA Buy me a ticket to The Great Went. 
213.    CONTINUED: 
JACQUES We're on our way, Baby. 
LAURA Let's go _all_ the way. 
They pile into Leo's 'Vet and peel down the dirt road. 
214.    INT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT 
The foursome getting roasted and toasted - very high. 
Jacques starts to tie Laura up with some light rope. 
LAURA (drugged, screaming) Don't tie me up, tonight.  Don't tie me up. 
Jacques and Leo laugh.  Jacques starts to tie Laura up while Leo holds her.  Laura struggles and screams begging them not to do it.  With Laura tied up, Leo starts to tie up Ronette.

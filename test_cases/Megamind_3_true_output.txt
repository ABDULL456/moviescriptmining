HAL (to Attractive Woman) Oh, crap. You got me. 
TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder. 
TRUCKER#1 Let me tell you something. That was just about the bravest damn thing I've ever witnessed. (he turns to the rest of the bar) Hey, everybody! This guy's the hero from TV! 
The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox. 
TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room quickly goes silent. 
TRUCKER#1 I want to give you something. 
He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it up in the air for everyone to see. 
TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D) Lost my whole platoon. They were a lot a good boys, a lot of good boys. That was just the way things were in "The Grenada." I'd rather a real hero have this. 
Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal. 
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN Hey, you're on TV again. 
The crowd looks up at the Television. 
TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS 
The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache), suddenly has a memo passed to him. 
BRAD HELMS This just in. Upon a second look at that tape from this morning, which we'll now replay for you, it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be. 
The tape shows Hal running in slow motion. 
BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D) With the tape slowed down you can actually see the man push the woman and her child out of the way in an effort to save his own life. 
The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation, pushing the woman and child out of the way. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS 
In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal. 
HAL I guess that looks kinda bad. 
Trucker#1 snatches his medal back. 
EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT 
Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal cutting through a dark alley. 
DA VINCI There he is, boss. 
Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle. 
MASTER MIND Now, we're sure this won't kill him? 
PLATO Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight electrical shock. 
MASTER MIND Good. 
Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve. 
A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row of garbage cans. 
EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT 
An angry Master Mind slaps Plato. 
MASTER MIND Slight electrical shock? 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering. 
Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky. 
HAL God, I hate the weather in this city. 
Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the emitting smoke from his jacket. 
EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT 
Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.

INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Bart sits in his desk chair, frowning. 
Mathilda knocks and opens the door. 
MATHILDA Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly coming over? 
BART Not tonight, ma. 
Mathilda pauses and looks at her son. 
MATHILDA Okay, then. 
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY 
An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR and CAMERAMAN unload equipment from a van. 
The DIRECTOR looks off into the distance, trying to visualize. 
Kelly pulls up next to the van. He wears a spotlessly clean uniform. 
DIRECTOR Are you with the 101st or the 82nd? 
KELLY Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual division. Technically, my patches indicate - 
DIRECTOR Whatever. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be a while setting up. Some of the other boys are over by craft service. 
KELLY Oh? 
Kelly doesn't go anywhere. 
DIRECTOR The snack table. It's over there. Someone will come get you when we're ready. 
KELLY Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet? 
DIRECTOR Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't know. 
KELLY Ok. Thanks. 
CRAFT SERVICE 
Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks. 
A MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds. 
MAKEUP ARTIST (to Kelly) And you are? 
KELLY Kelly Ernswiler, private first class. 
MAKEUP ARTIST All right, Kelly. Let's take a look at you. 
She gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair, slicking it back. 
MAKEUP ARTIST That's it, handsome. 
Kelly grins. When she walks away he messes up his hair again. 
He scans the crowd. No Bart. 
The A.D. walks over. 
A.D. Okay, everyone. We're going to start positioning. Then we'll go through a few rehearsals. (points at soldiers) You, you and you - go over there by that tree. You and you guys, behind the hill. (looks at clipboard) Okay, who's got the Jeep? 
KELLY That MG? She's mine. 
A.D. Great. We'd like to use it. Can you drive it beyond the hill over there? 
Kelly tries to act casual. 
KELLY Sure. I don't think that would be a problem. 
He walks towards his Jeep and pauses. 
KELLY Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he checked in? 
A.D. Don't know. We've got enough people. It doesn't matter. 
Kelly nods, wondering a bit. But it's soon forgotten. 
KELLY (to Jeep) Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to be famous. 
A.D. (yells) Okay people. Listen to my voice. From now on, you do whatever this voice says. Take your place. 
BEHIND THE HILL 
Kelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored. 
He sees a FIGURE in the shadows of the trees.

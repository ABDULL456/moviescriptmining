JIMMY (still looking at Kelly) What? 
SAM A ride.  You want one? 
JIMMY Yeah.  But I got my bike. 
EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY 
Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy. 
As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign. 
A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as... 
Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage. 
Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops. 
SAM We got room for one more, Suzie.  You need a ride? 
Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them. 
KELLY Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes? Whores-4-Less? 
Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud. 
KELLY (CONT'D) That's cute. 
Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie, offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear. 
KELLY (CONT'D) (to Suzie) I hope you swallow it. 
Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away. 
EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid lush, tropical settings. 
Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN" woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches in a code.  The gates swing open. 
KELLY Don't forget the car wash. 
SAM I won't. 
SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42 in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive. 
Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her mother coming toward her, her face hardens. 
SANDRA Is that Sam Lombardo? 
KELLY (sarcastic) Hi, Mon. 
SANDRA Sam!  Hi! 
Sam has already hung a U. 
Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep. 
Jimmy is checking her out.  All eyes. 
SANDRA (CONT'D) (to Sam; as if Jimmy wasn't even there) What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi? 
SAM Hi, Sandy. 
SANDRA Why don't you come in, have a drink? 
SAM Can't.  Got a passenger. 
Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy. 
SANDRA He can wait. 
Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front of the house, watching. 
SAM I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run. 
SANDRA I'll bet. (then, softening) Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out... 
SAM (cutting her off) Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans. 
SANDRA What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat... 
SAM Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time. 
Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house. 
CLOSE ON KELLY 
still at the door, a cold smile on her face.

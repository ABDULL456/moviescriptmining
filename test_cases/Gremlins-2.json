As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS the stairs to the basement curiosity shop. \n2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE \nMR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day. As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs. \n3 EXT. STREET 3 \nPEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short. ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows. FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car. INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj. Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep into the store. \nMister Wi Daniel Clamp would like to see you. \nThe men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New York's most successful real estate developer. \nCLAMP (ON TV) Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's out through to key issues, okay? I'm prepared to increase my offer substantially. \n(BEAT) Now, Mister Wing, you're attached to your business. I appreciate that. I'm attached to my own business. I develop the biggest buildings in New York, and you sell, ah, little things. Fine. But I'm not just talking about money here. On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the grandiose of a huge office building,.. \n4 CONTINUED: 4 \nCLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.) Take a look, Mister Wing -- \n(READS) \"The Clamp Chinatown Center -- Where Business Gets Oriented.\" When I put up a building, it's the biggest -- it's the newest -- it's the best. People are going to be killing each other to get into this building -- The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove of the store. \nGIZMO (O.S.) Tee vee! \nCLAMP (ON TV) Now,'we've been able to reach an understanding with everyone on the block -- except for you. Let me show you what I willing to do for you -- a s tand and souvenir cone on, right here under the at The foot traffic thrr here is going to make the building look like a ghost town. \nMr. Wing regards the video image impassively. \nCLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.) Please IF us know when you've made a decision, Mister Wing. You know, I believe that there's always an area of agreement that two people can reach. The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized \"C\" -- fills the wereen, replacing Clamp's image. \nMR. WING Yes -- a man can always agree with others. It is more difficult to agree with oneself. \nFORSTER Does that mean you -- He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he answers Forster. \nMR. WING I'm sorry. Please tell Mister Clamp that the answer is no. \nFORSTER Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie \nCAMERA: \nSTALLONE To survive a war... you've got to become war. Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES. \nGIZMO (0.3.) Neat! \nBut as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo. \nMR. WING Television again! Ai-vuh !. An - invention for fools. \nCD As he starts COUGHING again, \n5A INT. LIMO/EXT.

In addition to regular glass doors, there are a couple of REVOLVING DOORS, \nBILLY Want to try the revolving doors today? Before Kate can answer, a WORKER enters one of the revolving doors.

Kate waves hello to a thirtyish WOMAN (DOREEN) who's guiding a TOUR GROUP through the lobby. Doreen wears a uniform like Kate's, plus a matching HAT in the shape of the building. \nDOREEN .hope you've enjoyed your tour of the world's most modern automated office building.

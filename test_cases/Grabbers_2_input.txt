O'Shea changes weight to his other leg and accidentally kicks over Lisa's side-table. 
O'SHEA Feck. 
It clatters to the floor, knocking her toiletries over. 
O'SHEA Sorry. 
LISA It's OK. 
He helps her pick them up -- 
O'SHEA (notices a 'Stress Ball') What's that? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        26. 
Lisa grabs it off him, mortified as he rises with a headrush. 
O'SHEA Whoa, that last drink's gone straight to me head. 
LISA Just your head? 
O'SHEA Well, other places too. 
O'Shea grins suggestively, reading her wrong. 
LISA Do you get this drunk every night? 
O'SHEA Just high days and holidays. 
O'Shea rests against the wall.       Eyes drooping. 
LISA Let's get you to bed. 
O'SHEA Now you're talking. 
EXT. GARDEN PATH - NIGHT 
Paddy crashes his bicycle into a fence and staggers in the gate, mumbling something about bastards and fences. 
INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Paddy pours himself a drink of what looks like homemade potcheen. Still muttering. 
THUD!    The bathroom door rattles.    He looks at it, wide-eyed. 
INT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The door yawns opens and Paddy creeps in, wearing his welders mask. He gazes into the tub and removes his mask. There just as he left it is the lobster trap, but it's BROKEN. 
Paddy leans down and checks the trap as behind him reflected through the slimy residue of his bathroom cabinet's mirror something black and slithery crawls up the wall behind him. 
We see it but Paddy doesn't until a HISS. Paddy turns and the GRABBER spits a barbed tongue and whips itself onto his face. Paddy slams against the bathroom mirror, as if leveled by a punch. The mirror shatters, obscuring the scuffle. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         27. 
Paddy tears it off his face, gasping and flings it away. Blood seeps from a three point puncture wound on his neck. 
PADDY You dirty ... 
Paddy stamps on it, whatever it is. Again and again, until out of breath, he staggers from the bathroom. A moment later he returns with a standing lamp and continues beating it. Over and over and over until he's exhausted. 
PADDY Bastard. 
EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
The warm glow of light from within would attract every moth within a mile if it were a dry Summer's night, but it's not. It's raining and it's attracting something far more sinister. 
INT. BEDROOM / BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
IRENE MURPHY, cocooned in a bathrobe and slippers, snatches a pair of socks and a sweater off the floor. Muttering, she sniffs the sweater and recoils. It reeks. 
On a mission she marches through the open plan home passing Fisherman Tadhg gazing at the TV. 
IRENE Tadhg, you're stinking. Would you get in the bath already, I can smell you from here. 
TADHG I'm watching this. 
IRENE (TO HERSELF) What were you doing at all today? 
Irene enters the kitchen -- 
EXT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
-- and dumps it in a wash basket for tomorrow's load -- 
A BANG against the window. Irene startles. She leans, hands cupped around her eyes pressed up against the glass, staring out into the darkness. Any second now she's going to be pulled through ... only not. She tightens her robe instead. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011     28. 
IRENE (TO HERSELF) God, 'tis blowing a gale out. 
TADHG (O.S.) What?

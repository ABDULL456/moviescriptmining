Travis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES to enter without making physical contact - something Travis would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface. 
Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave. 
WIZARD Travis. 
TRAVIS Hey Wizard. 
Travis straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying: 
DOUGH-BOY Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it, 
WIZARD (ironic) Ask Travis. He's the ladies man. 
Travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee. 
WIZARD (continuing) Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she changes her pantyhose! 
DOUGH-BOY No. 
Travis turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but is. 
WIZARD Yeah. 
DOUGH-BOY Could you see anything? 
WIZARD Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still. 
DOUGH-BOY What did you do? 
WIZARD Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - What do you think! (they laugh) What do I have to do? Draw you a picture? 
DOUGH-BOY Yeah. 
WIZARD What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. (to Travis) So howsit? 
TRAVIS (w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just heard it on the radio. 
DOUGH-BOY Stick up? 
A WAITRESS brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water. He asks for a cheeseburger. 
WIZARD Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..." 
DOUGH-BOY You said that? 
WIZARD Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..." 
DOUGH-BOY And what happened? 
Travis awaits Wizard's answer. 
WIZARD She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. A real skunk. 
DOUGH-BOY A real skunk. 
Wizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met. 
WIZARD (paternal) Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie T.? 
Charlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy. 
DOUGH-BOY Yeah. We went to Harvard together. (laughs) 
WIZARD We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey. 
DOUGH-BOY Look who's talking? (gestures around table) Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour? 
Travis sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut. 
WIZARD (to Travis) So howsit? 
TRAVIS (w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up.  Just heard it on the radio. 
DOUGH-BOY Stick up?

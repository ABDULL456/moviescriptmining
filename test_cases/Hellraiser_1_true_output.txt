... take it from me ... 
Now, total darkness. 
... Come to Daddy ... 
And suddenly, she wakes. 
141  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT 
KIRSTY is lying in a bed in a private room.  A NURSE is at her bedside, monitoring her condition. 
NURSE You're awake. 
She goes to the door. 
I'll get the doctor. 
She exits. 
KIRSTY tries to sit up.  Her head hurts, badly.  As she achieves a sitting position, the door opens.  The NURSE returns, with a DOCTOR. 
DOCTOR (approaching the bed) So ... you're back with us. 
KIRSTY I think so. 
DOCTOR How are you feeling? 
KIRSTY Tender. 
DOCTOR You took quite a beating.  Do you remember what happened? 
She looks at him, uncertain of where to start. 
KIRSTY I want to speak to my father ... 
DOCTOR (nods) Of course.  We'll bring you a telephone. 
The NURSE exits.  The DOCTOR brings the box from his pocket. 
Maybe this'll jog your memory. 
He lays it on the bed.  She stares at it, her expression betraying nothing. 
I had the Devil's own job getting it out of your hand. Does it ring any bells? 
She shakes her head. 
Do you want it left? 
KIRSTY Why not? 
He offers her a reassuring smile. 
DOCTOR Chin up.  There's no serious damage.  And you're safe here. 
KIRSTY Um. 
He leaves the room. 
KIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively.  She turns it over in her hand, examining it. 
142  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT 
FRANK is standing in the shadows.  He is wearing a fresh shirt.  He smirks.   JULIA watches him. 
Downstairs, the telephone rings.  JULIA is very nervous now; desperate even. 
JULIA She'll tell them everything ... 
FRANK I don't think so.  She'll want Larry first. 
JULIA That's probably her now.  Or the police. 
FRANK Maybe. 
JULIA Don't you care?

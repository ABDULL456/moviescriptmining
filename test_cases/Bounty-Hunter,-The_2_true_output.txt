EXT PIER 19- DAWN 
CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO." 
Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench, exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a squad car. 
After a moment: 
MILO Merry Xmas. I got you this. 
Milo hands Cass some seaweed. 
CASS You shouldn't have. 
Milo checks his watch. 
MILO Hey. I've still got three hours to get you to jail. Looks like I'm gonna win that bet after all. 
Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS. 
MILO (to himself) You have got to be kidding me. 
EXT BEACH- DAWN 
Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the cuffs. 
CASS (muffled, face in the SAND) I'm not going without a fight. 
MILO Yeah. I'm getting that. 
He pulls her to her feet. 
INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING 
Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a mess. He checks his watch: 
MILO 9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging Cass) Go on, say it. 
CASS (to the clerk) I'd like to turn myself in. (can't resist) Though I didn't do anything wrong... 
MILO Stop talking. 
CASS ...and I was unjustly arrested... 
To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT. 
Then Milo hands her over to the clerk. 
MILO (to Cass) See ya. 
CASS (a little disoriented) Oh. Ok. 
The clerk leads her into the jail. 
EXT POLICE STATION- MORNING 
Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN, THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING. 
GELMAN Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty hunter. 
Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons. DECIDES: 
MILO Ah, what the hell. 
He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE WITH HIS FIST. 
INT HOLDING CELL- MORNING 
Cass is trying to find a clean place to sit down, when MILO GETS THROWN INTO THE HOLDING CELL NEXT TO HERS. 
CASS Oh my god, what happened? 
MILO Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas alone. Besides, I didn't really have any plans other than drinking some cheap whiskey and putting my fist through a wall. 
CASS I'm touched that you would give that up for me. 
MILO Hey. It's the kind of guy I am. 
Cass grins. WEDDING MUSIC KICKS IN: 
SID (O.S.) Well, you were right. 
INT WEDDING CHAPEL- DAY 
Sid and Lois are watching as MILO AND CASS GET REMARRIED.

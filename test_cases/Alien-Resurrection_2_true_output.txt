What the fuck is that? 
ANGLE: RIPLEY 
is slamming her fist on the hatch doors, hanging on with her other arm. 
The ship continues to tremble and buck -- she's nearly thrown off. 
RIPLEY 
Godamnit! 
She looks around at the alien.  It's almost on her. 
Working its way painfully toward her, gripping with its legs and tendrils.  Hissing. 
It slams a tentacle down at Ripley, but she rolls, just holding on 
ANGLE: JOHNER 
Above the cockpit, looking at a fuzzy external monitor. 
JOHNER 
It's Ripley!  Ripley's on the fucking hatch! 
In the cockpit, Call nearly goes white. 
CALL 
Let her in! 
JOHNER 
Fuck no!  There's something else out there with her! 
VRIESS 
One of them. 
Johner looks at the image, realizes how masive the newborn is. 
Awed fear creeps into his voice: 
JOHNER 
No. it's something else. 
Frustrated, Call jumps out of her seat.. Vriess fights to control the ship as she  climbs up toward the hatch. 
VRIESS 
Goddamnit, Call! 
Johner grabs her, practically throws her at the monitor. 
JOHNER 
Look at that fucking thing!  We can't open up! 
They both tumble as the ship jerks 
ANGLE: RIPLEY 
Is bucked OFF THE SHIP 
before she grabs the newborn's tentacle, holds on to it -- 
The newborn SMASHES it against he ship, trying to shake her again - 
- she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away. 
ANGLE: CALL 
Pushes Johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence. 
ANGLE: VRIESS. 
Desperately pulling up as wooded, snowy mountains zoom dangerously close below. 
ANGLE: THE ALIEN 
Turns as the HATCH OPENS nearby, the door sliding slowly beast is torn between Ripley and this new distraction -- 
Ripley sees it too, starts climbing for it frantically, one on the newborn. 
The beast makes for the doorway -- and CALL POPS HALFWAY OUT pointing a GRENADE LAUNCHER  at the thing.. She BLASTS it once,  the beast roaring and starting back, hurt but not nearly enough.  Call fires again but the ships rocking sends the shot wild. 
she flies back for all of a second 
The beast rears to attack but Ripley is at the hatch -- Call drags her in and closes the hatch, the beast just SLAMMING in it as it closes. 
INT.  THE BETTY 
Ripley is hanging on Call, exhausted. 
Another BANG on the hatch, and they can see the door starting to give. 
VRIESS 
Call!  NOW! 
Call and Ripley head into the cockpit.Johner continues looking at the vidscreen at the beast. 
VRIESS 
We can't to do a vertical setdown! Braking systems are shot! 
CALL 
Find me a patch of land!  I'll put her down. 
Call jumps back into the pilot's seat by Vriess.  He pulls up hard on the wheel, but the ship is still dangerously close to the ground. 
JOHNER 
That thing isn't going anywhere! 
VRIESS 
Johner, strap in!  We're coming down hard! 
ANGLE:     -BETTY  Approaches the rough, wooded terrain, just above the trees.  Hits a relatively clear patch, touches down -- bounces back up and then down again 
ANGLE: CALL 
Fighting the wheel -- she can't pull it up hard enough. 
ANGLE: THE BETTY 
The ship blasts through trees.  The newborn moves to the back of the ship to avoid debris. 
JOHNER 
That things gone back behind the thrusters! 
Call and Ripley look at each other. 
RIPLEY 
Hit it. 
Call throws on the thrusters, the ship ROCKETS forward   ANGLE: THE NEWBOM

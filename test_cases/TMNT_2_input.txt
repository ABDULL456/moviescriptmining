APRIL Give me strength. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WINTERS OFFICE 
Winters is still alone in his office. Still studying the statue. A beat. He turns his head to the side. 
WINTERS You can come out now. IDER - As we see FOUR FIGURES appear out of the smallest and darkest of shadows! The LEADER slinks forward - clearly a 
S woman - dressed in cloak and Japanese Noh mask over her face. he takes it off, revealing KARAI - the beautiful leader of the Japanese Foot Clan, flanked by three, FOOT NINJAS. 
WINTERS Your talents are commendable. 
KARAI As are yours. Most don't notice us until we decide they will. 
WINTERS Well, I guess I'm just special that way. Winters walks over to his desk. The Statue looms behind them. 
WINTERS So down to business - aside from the other reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we discussed? 
KARAI I must confess... I still don't know exactly what we are to do for you. 
WINTERS I need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of your Foot Ninja to... monitor the city for me over the next few days. Winters walks to his window. It's night. Overlooks the city. 
WINTERS Just keep your eyes peeled for anything... strange. 
KARAI (long beat) What kind of strange things? The question hangs as we PUSH IN ON Statue's face... his eerie eyes. We think his eye GLOWS, only we- 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. STAR-FILLED SKY - NIGHT 
The glowing eye is really a STAR. The same line pattern we saw at movie's open. The stars ADJUST... lining up in a more straight-lined manner. CAM LOWERS, placing us back in- 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
A MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED ALLEYWAY, he hears a low GROWL come from it. He stops. ALLEY POV - As the man looks in. Can't see a thing. Hand-held cam. He moves to leave... and the growl comes again. STREET - Man stares in. No one on the street. Looks closer... closer... grows more tense as... 
...WHAM! The requisite CAT jumps out of the shadows. Scares Man half to death. 
MAN 
WAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!! (calms down) Gave me a scare kitty. He pets the kitty a bit, then walks off. CAM LOWERS behind cat, as Man walks off into the distance. Until... ...WHAM! A large burly CLAWED ARM slams out of the shadows onto the cat, yanking it back into the alley! Quick caterwaul. Silence. And then we hear a BURP. 
C AM LOWERS further through the asphalt, then quickly hooks up with an air duct pipe. Zips faster and faster until we're in- 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - TRAINING DOJO 
Leo feverishly works out. He stops, looking up, panting. 
LEONARDO (O.S.) Does ANYBODY train anymore?! 
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.) Just a sec, dude! I'm almost at level eighteen. (OS video game explosion) Scratch that... seventeen. 
LEONARDO 
DONNAY! 
DONATELLO (O.S.) In... uh... a few minutes, Leo. I'm in the middle of- KZZZT-BOOOM! - An OS invention blows up. 
DONATELLO (O.S.) Um... make that another hour. Leo sighs. Splinter walks by, not stopping.

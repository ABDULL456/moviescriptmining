DOUGH-BOY Where. 
TRAVIS In the jungle. 122nd. 
Travis' eyes turn toward the restaurant's other patrons. 
POV: THREE STREET PEOPLE sitting at a table. One GUY, stoned, stares straight ahead. A raggedly attractive GIRL rest her head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily bearded YOUNG MAN with a headband.  They kiss and tease each other, momentarily lost in their separate world. 
Travis watches the hippie couple closely, his feeling sharply divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy. Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has always eluded him? He must enjoy these schizoid emotions, because his eyes dwell on the couple. 
DOUGH-BOY (changing the subject) You run all over town, don't you, Travis? 
WIZARD (referring to 122nd St.) Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is. 
Travis turns back to his companions. 
TRAVIS Huh? 
DOUGH-BOY I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh? 
TRAVIS (catching on) I have. 
DOUGH-BOY You carry a piece? You need one? 
TRAVIS Nah. (a beat) I suppose not. 
Waitress slaps down smudge-marked glass of water, and a cheeseburger plate that looks more like a shrunken head on a serving platter. 
DOUGH-BOY Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around. 
WIZARD The cops and company raise hell they find out. 
Travis drops two Alka-Seltzer into his glass of water. 
DOUGH-BOY Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch. 
WIZARD For a fee. 
DOUGH-BOY For a fee. 
WIZARD I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat. 
DOUGH-BOY (getting up) well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of hares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em. 
WIZARD What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy? 
DOUGH-BOY Support my kids. Can you dig it? (pause) nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. (nods to Charlie T.) 
Charlie T. remains unmoved: He is sleeping. 
Dough-Boy exits. Travis smiles perfunctorily, then looks back at Wizard. They really don't have much to talk about, and the Wizard doesn't care to manufacture any more conversations. 
Travis scans the greasy spoon: The scene is unchanged. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DAY 
Traffic passes. 
INT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS 
Tom and Betsy are talking. She takes out a cigarette. He takes out matches to light it. 
BETSY Try holding the match like this. 
TOM This is gotta be a game, right? 
BETSY (putting on glasses) This I gotta see. 
TOM (burning fingers) Ouch! 
BETSY (giggling) Oh, are you all right?

A small Nazi transport launch, carefully disguised as a Greek fishing boat, sits bobbing by the dock. The only human: a Nazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant. He is perched on a pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the train tracks. As the mine car barrels noisily down toward him, he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine gun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching mine car. He opens fire. 
In the out-of-control mine car, Indy pulls Marion down with him. They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact with the bouncing Ark. Bullets clang against the outside of the car and whiz inches overhead. Indy and Marion are forced into a tighter and tighter embrace of life. 
At the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes. He realizes the car is not going to stop. He lacks faith in his stronghold. Too late. 
The mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker. And right on through. The Nazi Sentry, his machine gun and a dozen bursting seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild, hurtling mass. The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water. 
INT. COMMAND CENTER 
Fire. Everywhere. No sign of life. A large gaping doorway, flames ringing it, blazing into the room beyond. Hanging by one hinge there, its metal blasted and jagged, is a heavy door with the signed lettering, in German, "DANGER - MUNITIONS". 
The first explosion happens. It's a baby compared to what's coming yet it rocks the earth. It's terrible. And then, almost immediately, another. The long, irregular, ever larger chain of explosions begins. 
EXT. THE ISLAND - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 
The island rumbles and shakes. From fissures and small natural caves, dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water. Still the explosion continue. A huge chunk of white cliff falls away into the turbulent sea. Birds scream and soar, afraid to land. 
Finally, we settle on a full shot of the island. We can recognize that the small opening high on the slope from which a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of the mine tunnel. And there below it, quite small from this distance is the dock. And the boat that looks like a Greek fishing boat. There can be no mistake even from this far away - the boat is chugging out to sea. 
INT. THE PENTAGON - DAY 
Indy, Brody, and Marion, looking very stylish, are seated in Colonel Musgrove's huge office. Sun pours in a window, through which Washington can be seen sparkling across the Potomac. Everything is neat and clean and regular. Including the three men who are arrayed around the office. Two we know - Col. Musgrove and Maj. Eaton. The third is an unnamed Bureaucrat. He hangs back, smiling and genial, his features obscured by the glare of the window. He doesn't say anything, yet you have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter at hand. He is the essence of all that is Byzantine and inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine. 
Indy and Brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting has gone. Marion, on the other hand, is very happy and eager to get out of there. Eaton's manner is irritatingly cheery. 
MUSGROVE You've done your country a great service. 
EATON And we trust you found the settlement satisfactory? 
MARION Quite. 
EATON Good, good. (glances around at the others) Then I guess that about does it. 
BRODY When can we have the Ark? 
Eaton's glance flicks over to the mysterious Bureaucrat, then back to Brody. 
EATON I thought we answered that. It's someplace very safe - 
INDY (heated) That's a powerful force. Research should be done - 
EATON Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure you. We have top men working on it right now. 
INDY Who? 
EATON Top men. 
Indy exchanges a look with Brody. 
INDY We may be able to help. 
EATON We appreciate that. And we won't hesitate to call on you. 
MUSGROVE (dismissing them) Thank you all. Thank you again. 
Indy looks them over coldly. He gets up, sullen.

ABBY Martha ! Martha ! What do you think has happened ? 
MORTIMER «A fib !» 
Mortimer starts dancing around the room. Then he hears a door closing on the balcony, and he sits on the window-seat. We see Jonathan on the balcony. He starts going downstairs. Mortimer goes toward him. 
MORTIMER Jon... Oh-oh... Ah-ah... 
JONATHAN This may interest you, Mortimer. I've decided that we're staying. And I've also decided that you're leaving, and I mean now. 
MORTIMER Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question. Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear? 
JONATHAN I've led a strange life, Mortimer. 
Abby comes in through the kitchen door, followed by Martha. 
ABBY Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see what's in that window-seat. 
Jonathan and Mortimer both rushes across the room and sit on the window-seat 
MORTIMER No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't... 
He stops when he realizes that Jonathan is sitting with him. He suddenly understands the situation, and shows a broad smile to his brother. He then stands up 
MORTIMER Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat. 
Jonathan's face shows that he is no more so sure of himself. 
MORTIMER Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology. 
He kisses her on the forehead. 
MORTIMER I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving. And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion with him. (to Jonathan) Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So, I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ? 
Jonathan doesn't move from the window-seat. 
MORTIMER All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police. 
He goes to the desk. 
JONATHAN Don't reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to Mister Spenalzo can happen to you, too. 
Mortimer picks up the phone. 
MARTHA Spenalzo ? 
ABBY I knew he was a foreigner. 
JONATHAN Put down that telephone, Mortimer. 
Jonathan puts his hand to his pocket, to take his gun. The doorbell rings and we see a policeman's shadow through the frosted glass. Jonathan stands up and Abby rushes to the door. 
ABBY Oh... 
She opens the door on O'Hara. He is smiling and he's got his stick in his hand. 
O'HARA Hello ! ABBY Oh, Officer O'Hara ! 
O'HARA I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness in the house... 
ABBY No... 
He looks around. 
O'HARA Oh, you got company ? Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you. 
He starts to walk back out, but Mortimer stops him. 
MORTIMER No ! Come in. 
ABBY Yes, do come in. She closes the door behind him. 
MARTHA Come right in, Officer O'Hara. This is our nephew, Mortimer. 
They shake hands, both smiling. 
O'HARA Oh, pleased to meet you. 
MORTIMER And glad to see you, fellow. 
ABBY And this is another nephew, Jonathan. 
O'HARA Pleased to make your acquaintance. Hey, your face is familiar. Haven't I seen a picture of you somewhere before ? 
JONATHAN I don't think so. 
O'HARA I'll be running along. 
MORTIMER Oh, come on. What's the hurry ? Why don't you stick around until my brother leaves. 
O'HARA I got to ring in, Mr. Brew... Say, you're not «the» Mortimer Brewster, the book-writer and the dramatic critic, are you ? MORTIMER Yes, why ? 
O'HARA Oh, what a break for me ! I'm a playwright. 
MORTIMER No ? 
O'HARA I'm working on a play now. 
MORTIMER You are ? 
O'HARA Yeah. 
MORTIMER Well, well, well ! Maybe I can help you with it. 
O'HARA Oh, would you ? Oh, what a break ! I get wonderful ideas, but I can't spell them. 
MORTIMER You can't ?... Oh, I can spell like the dickens. Constantinople ? Come on, come on, let's go into the kitchen. 
O'HARA All right. 
MORTIMER You can tell me all about it. (to Abby) Couldn't you whip up a sandwich for Officer O'Hara ? 
MARTHA I hope you don't mind eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara. 
O'HARA And where else would you eat ? 
They all enter the kitchen, laughing, and leaving Jonathan alone in the room. Mortimer lets them in, but comes back into the sitting-room, closing the kitchen door behind him. 
MORTIMER (to the policeman and his aunts) See you in a moment.

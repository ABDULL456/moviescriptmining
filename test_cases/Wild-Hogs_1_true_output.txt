WOODY Yeah, we could stay another few-- 
VOICE (O.C.) Whhheeeeew! The guys look to the other side of the spring to see the HIGHWAY PATROLMAN cannonball naked into the spring. They stare, horrified, as he pops up and smiles at them. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Saw you're bikes out there. You guys ever chicken fight? The guys look at each other for a moment, then; 
DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY Ahhhh! / Oh, god! / Run! They frantically sprint out of the water, grab their clothes and hurry away.

EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATE THAT AFTERNOON 
The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once again, but suddenly Doug smiles... On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis. The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes. Bob immediately falls to the ground. 
BOB Dammit! Leg's asleep. The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike and falls to the ground. 
DUDLEY Me, too. 
DOUG You guys have to shift every once in awhile. Blood has to circulate. A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar. 
WOODY Now this is the best part of any road trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels. Look at this place. America! The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack of a bar. Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front. 
DOUG Look at these bikes. They're all classics. 
BOB Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead. You know how rare this thing is? The guys all crowd around the bike. 
DOUG Yeah, but why didn't he customize it? You have a 51 panhead and you don't chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.

WOODY Probably no good custom stores out here in hick-land. We'll leave 'em a catalog. The guys push open the door and step into the bar. 
INT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS 
The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing. We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY. 
DOUG 
(TO BIKERS) How's it going? 
BOB Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends. I'm surprised we've never seen you in Daytona. The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's - and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces. 
JACK Yeah, how do we keep missing that? The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though they don't quite get what's so funny. 
JACK (CONT'D) So you re "Wild Hogs," huh? That's your gang? 
DOUG Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends that ride... you know. 
JACK So it's like a little hobby for you guys? How sweet. Doug smiles, but is now sensing the hostility. He looks back for the exit. 
DUDLEY 
(TO JACK) Yeah, just a little hobby for us.

DUDLEY (CONT'D) We're all successful professionals in real life. But on Tuesday and Sunday afternoons... We're bikers! Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his jacket. 
JACK Wow. That's great. Can I try that on? 
DUDLEY Hell yeah, brother. Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who pulls it on his massive frame. He shows it to the gang, who laugh again. Dudley does, too. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) So who's '51 panhead is that? Sweet ride. Woody has a catalog so you can make it cool. 
WOODY No, I don't. Doug does. I think it's great the way it is. Doug glares at Woody incredulously. Woody shrugs. 
JACK 
(TO DUDLEY) Well, if you like my '51, we should trade... "brother."

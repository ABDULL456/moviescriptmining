{"test1_input": "The teacher, MR. JOHANSEN, sips from a coffee cup and reads a newspaper, his feet on the desk. The headline says: \"Mass Suicide in Jonestown. Cyanide in the Kool-Aid.\" Above him is a long banner reading: \"Sorry, Absolutely no bathroom breaks\". \nHawk, Trip, and Lex sit before a half-built radio on a work bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces. \nLex solders two copper wires together. Hawk attaches a dial. Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long plastic tube. He blows air into his face repeatedly with it. \nTRIP (re:squeeze pump/tube) Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this? \nHAWK Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away. \nHawk turns the radio on and a HIGH FREQUENCY WHINE pours from its speaker. He adjusts the volume, then the tuner, until a DJ's VOICE comes through crisp and clear. \nDJ'S VOICE ...and this is Simple Simon on the rock of Detroit, W.A.R.P., home of the biggest KISS giveaway in the history of the universe! \nDetroit? DETROIT? Hawk, Trip, and Lex react like they've just been hit by phasers on stun. God is intervening. \nDJ'S VOICE I got four, count 'em, four front row tickets along with four backstage passes to the concert tonight at Cobo Hall and I'm giving them to the 106th caller who can tell me the real names of each KISS band member! \nHIGH FREQUENCY NOISES again, then the radio loses reception. Hawk exchanges an anxious glance with Trip and Lex. \nLEX Too bad we're stuck in electronics or... \nHAWK Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off. \nDISSOLVE TO: MOMENTS LATER \nMr. Johansen still sits with his feet up, reading. The next page's headline reads: First Test Tube Baby Born. \nTrip runs up to Mr. J's desk, one hand behind his back, the other on his crotch. His face is drawn in an expression of sheer agony. Hawk and Lex watch anxiously in the background. \nMR.J Mr. Verudi, get back to your bench. \nTrip puts one leg over the other always keeping a hand behind his back. \nTRIP But I gotta take a piss like you would not believe, Mr. Johansen! \nMR.J Put a clothespin on it till the end of class, Verudi. You know my rule. \nTRIP But ever since my doctor put me on salt pills, it's been like Niagara Falls every half hour! Please, Mr. J! Have mercy! \nSuddenly, a wet stain grows across the crotch of Trip's pants. \nMR.J Salt pills? Don't insult my intelligence, Verudi... \nMr. J. stops when he sees the stain starting to spread. \nTRIP Jeezis, I'm taking a leak in my pants! \nWe now see Trip is squeezing the pump from before. He holds it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the back of his pants. \nThe stain travels fast, hitting Trip's knee in a nanosecond. In a state of shock, Mr. J. slowly opens a long forgotten drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust-covered pad of bathroom passes. He tears one off and dust flies everywhere. \nHe holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was holding before an advancing vampire. \nMR.J (hoarsely) Get the hell out of here, Verudi! You disgust me! \nHawk and Lex observe that Trip has been successful, then do a Three Stooges-style handshake, whispering \"Curly!\" \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nThe SECRETARY sits at her desk in the reception area filing paperwork. She pauses when she hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Trip charges past, a big, wet stain on his crotch. \nThe secretary notices the pump and tube flopping from the back of his pants as Trip turns a corner. \nINT. MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY \nTrip runs up to a pay phone on the wall, pumps every nickel he has into it, puts the phone to his ear and dials. \nTRIP I need to be connected to the W.A.R.P. contest hotline... Now... lady!... Hello, is this me? I'm Trip. \nINT. SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nA cubby-of-an-office. Cluttered beyond belief. Elvis leans back on his chair against the wall reading a PLOP Magazine. A transistor radio plays W.A.R.P. He bolts at the sound of Trip's name causing his chair to slide out from under him. THWAM! \nTRIP ON RADIO Am I on the air?... Yeah... Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter, uh, Criscoula... yeah, that's it! \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nThe secretary hears an ecstatic \"YEEEHAAWW\" and turns to see Trip wheeling back around the corner, leaping in the air as he runs, YOWLING like a rodeo cowboy. He bounds past her. She watches him and shakes her head. \n", "test1_true": "INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nStill on the floor, Elvis grabs the little radio with rage, flips it off and screams at it. \nELVIS Why you little...! Over my dead body! \nThe bell RINGS. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VOC/TECH ROOM - DAY \nStudents pour into the hall. Hawk and Lex exit the class just as Trip comes zigzagging down the corridor dodging the hordes. All three converge as Trip can't contain his enthusiasm. \nTRIP I did it! I did it! We won! \nLEX We won?! \nHAWK Fuckin' A! Woooooo! \nThe three burnouts jump, scream, HOOT, and play air instruments like loons as if they're the only ones in the hall. They can't stop. The rest of the student body are not amused \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nHawk, Trip, and Lex hold their trays over the counter as the LUNCH LADIES fill them with Salisbury steak, hard dinner rolls and scoops of bluish pudding. Ah, public school nutrition. \nTRIP (stoked) This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario. \nHAWK (double stoked) Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one. \nLEX The Chinese have a proverb: \"That which appears too good to be true, usually is.\" There's gotta be a catch. \nTRIP Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, \"Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole.\" We're going this time and that's all there is to it. \nHAWK I'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time, Trip. There is a catch. \nHawk's really got their attention now. \nTRIP Namely? \nHAWK Our band \"Mystery\" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere. \nLEX But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county! \nHAWK So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check? \nLEX We are not stealing my mom's car. \nHAWK Damn straight we are. \nLEX Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati. \nHAWK And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway? \nLEX Sunday, but... \nHAWK Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit. \nTRIP Simplicity, Hawk. \nLEX Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us. \nHAWK There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero? \nLEX The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar \nHAWK Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check? \nLex nods. \nHAWK Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence. \nTRIP Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever. \nHAWK I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand. \nLEX Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something. \nHAWK Curly. \n", "test1_id": 2643, "test2_input": "He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh! \nKENNY Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band! \nKenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist. \nJAM Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's leave KISS out of it. Please. \nKENNY A bunch of guys who make bad music, dress like freaks, and wear more make-up than all my sisters combined? These assholes must be stopped! \nKenny pushes Jam away. \nCHRISTINE That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving! \nChristine gets out of the car and starts walking down the highway, exiting the scene. \nBARBARA Oh, Christine! You googatz in the head or something? We're on the side of the freakin' highway! \nBOBBY Let her go, Barbara, she'll come back to Kenny. She always does... (to Kenny) Right, Kenny? \nKenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo. \nKENNY Kool and the Gang, now there's real music. \nKenny takes the 8-track from the car... \nKENNY But this... is crap! \nHe flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi. \nFOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at Jam's feet. \nTILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to the CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the Indian in that \"Keep America Beautiful\" litter ad. \nHawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him. \nKENNY So. All that having been said and done, I believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. Namely: Have you learned your lesson yet, puke? \nHawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He blows some smoke in Kenny's face. \nHAWK Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. (puffing on cig) So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it. \nKENNY (beat, in disbelief) Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself? \nHAWK Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut. \nKENNY Oh, yeah...? \nOut of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by. \nKENNY That's not what your mother said last night. \nTrip, Lex, and Jam exchange \"uh-oh\" glances. Meanwhile, Hawk's eyes glaze over. \nHAWK It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me... \nHawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his side. \nHAWK ...what exactly did my mother say last night? \nKenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one. \nHAWK You heard me, prick. What did my mother say last night? \nKenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk. \nKENNY Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what your mother said last night. (beat) She said that I was the fuck of her life. \nHawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker. \nHAWK (very Clint Eastwood) How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch? \nKENNY (smirking) Sure. \nQuick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards from the impact. He hits his head on the ground. \nTaking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his drumsticks. \nAs if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead. \n", "test2_true": "Bobby shrieks. \nMeanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot. \nHawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity. \nHawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking Bobby out cold. \nTerrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered. \nLEX Not so fast, stella. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMOMENTS LATER \nKenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of Barbara's shoulders. \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the stella, snickering. \nBARBARA When they wake up, they're gonna come looking for you jerks. You best hope they don't find you, cause if they do, they're gonna kick your asses. \nHawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking up to the Trans Am. \nHAWK Right, stella, and we'll deserve it. But let's really make it worth their while. \nHawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the engine WHINE in protest. (Again we are cautious not to show the guidos' faces.) \nHAWK By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote. \nHe throws the Trans Am into drive. \nAll who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH, then watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway. \nIt races into ditches, bounces off trees, and SPLASHES through ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like. \nThe disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, and finally, BOOM! It explodes on final impact. \nThe boys all look at each other and shrug. Hawk walks back to the Volvo and gets in. Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and pile in as well. Lex shouts back to Barbara. \nLEX Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply. You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse! \nANGLE ON KENNY, BOBBY, AND BARBARA. \nWe now see them from the front. Lo-and-behold, Kenny has been made-up like Gene Simmons, Bobby like Paul Stanley. Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste... and kick their asses all over again. \nBARBARA Very funny. I hope you choke! \nSTELLA ON BOARD \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nHawk starts the engine and takes off. Trip pulls a baggie of weed and some rolling papers out. \nJAM Hey, look, it's that girl. \nJam points out at the road ahead to Christine. She's a few hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane. \nTRIP That's no girl. That's a stella. \nJAM Stella or no stella, we should pull over and help her out. \nHAWK Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice. \nJAM Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again. \nHawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling about two miles per hour. Christine doesn't notice as they edge closer to her. \nLEX What is it with you, Jam? You got a thing for that... thing? \nJAM She's a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway. They make very scary movies that start out like that. \nHAWK Well, they may not make movies about four dudes going to a KISS concert. But if they ever did, the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny. \nPause. \nTRIP Unless there was gonna be a scene where the disco bunny blows the four dudes on the way to the show. \n", "test2_id": 2644, "test3_input": "INT. VOLVO - DAY \nChristine sits between Jam and Lex in the back SNAPPING gum. Jam and Lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl. \nHawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking herself in a compact. She swathes on some 7-Up flavored, Bonnie Bell lip gloss. \nTrip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling in his mouth, sealing it. He winks at her disgustingly. \nCHRISTINE Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there? \nTRIP (smirks) What's it worth to you? \nCHRISTINE (grossed out) What the hell is that supposed to mean? \nJAM It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him. \nHAWK (rolls his eyes) Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike. \nTrying to be suave, Lex moves in close, putting the make on her. \nLEX Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby. \nCHRISTINE Well, your tee-shirt may say rock 'n' roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby. \nShe pushes him away. Jam laughs. \nTRIP (frustrated) So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what? \nCHRISTINE (thoroughly offended) What? That's disgusting! \nJAM Trip! That's so fuckin' rude, man. \nTRIP Oh, quit bein' the wussy, sensitive guy to impress her, Jam. She's obviously not gonna put out. She's a fuckin' tease. \nCHRISTINE Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids? \nTRIP You got in the car, didn't you? \nCHRISTINE Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere. \nTRIP Whatever... stella. \nTrip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot. He passes it to Lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the exception of Christine. The car starts to fill with smoke. \nCHRISTINE The name's Christine, not stella. And there's no need to be such pigs just cause I prefer Donna Summer or KC and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over KISS? \nHAWK (with disdain) The Village People? They're fags! You're a fag hag! \nJAM Come on, Hawk. \nCHRISTINE I can take care of myself, but thanks anyway, germ. \nJAM Jam. \nCHRISTINE Whatever. (to Hawk) Okay, Joe Burnout, let's get one thing straight here. As far as I'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category. True, if I had to choose, I'd pick the category labelled disco because I happen to enjoy dancing. Disco is just easier to dance to. \nHAWK You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me. \nTRIP Disco blows dogs for quarters. \nChristine processes this remark. \nCHRISTINE Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony. \nTrip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment. \nHAWK Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car! \nCHRISTINE Yeah, why don't you put your money where your mouth is? \nHAWK Why don't you kiss my hairy crack? \nCHRISTINE Why don't you bend over, you're looking right at it! \nAll, Christine included, pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean. Lex takes a hit off the joint. \nLEX (holding in smoke) That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever. \nHawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit. \n", "test3_true": "Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the whole car gets a great laugh for a while. \nThey finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes. Lex still has the joint now as Christine looks at it. \nCHRISTINE Man, this is some kickass shit! (beat) Gimme a hit off that jay will ya? \nLex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to her as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHELLO DETROIT, GOODBYE TICKETS! \nMONTAGE \nThe Volvo passing a big sign that says: \"Welcome to Michigan, the Great Lakes State.\" \nThe Volvo racing toward the Detroit skyline. \nDetroit landmarks: The General Motors Building, the Ford Building, Motown Records, and finally... \nCOBO HALL, where thousands of fans in KISS tees gather, waiting for its doors to open. \nUnbelievable traffic stretches to an intersection at which stand four key landmarks... a cathedral, a convenience store, a parking lot, and a male strip joint. They face one another, each on its own corner. \nA gigantic sign on the auditorium's facade flashes the commandment, \"YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY\" over and over again. \nEXT. COBO HALL - SUNSET \nThe sun hangs low on this day as the Volvo sits in traffic, passing Cobo Hall. Movement is nearly impossible. \nKISS FANS cram every square foot of open macadam, pushing through the jammed cars. STREET VENDORS hawk KISS souvenirs from tee-shirts to pennants. Some are in stands along the sidewalk. Others come right up to car windows. \nINT. VOLVO - SUNSET \nChristine is fast asleep between Jam and Lex. \nLEX Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella. \nTRIP (whispers lustfully) Let's lift up her shirt. \nHAWK (pointing out windshield) There it is! \nAll look ahead. COBO Hall. A HALO GLOW forms around the building accompanied by a CHOIR OF ANGELS. \nJAM (in reverence) We made it! \nLEX Curly driving, Hawk. We still got two hours to spare. \nHAWK Ample time to grab our tickets at the station. See, up ahead. W.A.R.P. \nOne block on the left is the W.A.R.P. tower. \nHAWK Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes. \nJAM Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me. \nThe opening to the Carpenters' \"TOP OF THE WORLD\" begins. \nINT. W.A.R.P. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT \n\"TOP OF THE WORLD\" continues, playing through the speaker of the ascending elevator inside which Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam stand. They watch the numbers climb, smiling. \nHAWK What was that D.J.'s name again? \nTRIP Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar... \nINT. SIMPLE SIMON'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam poke their heads around the corner of an office doorway totem pole-style. \nHAWK Simple Simon? \nSIMPLE SIMON strikes a pose before a full-length mirror in a glittery-back Gene Simmons tee-shirt, silver pants, and very high heel boots. He has a huge Afro and bushy moustache. He turns when he hears Hawk. \nSIMPLE SIMON The one and only. But can you kids hurry this up? I'm due at Coco Hall in half an hour for the warm-up. \nThey all enter and stand at Simple Simon's desk. \n", "test3_id": 2645}

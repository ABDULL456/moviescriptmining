{"train": "DETROIT ROCK CITY \nWritten by \nCarl V Dupre \nFADE IN: \nINT. MRS. BRUCE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDecorated in Carol Brady chic. When it's not gaudy, tacky, and loud, it's blander than toast. Colors like lime green and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only. \nMRS. BRUCE, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. She carries a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank. \nHUMMING \"We've Only Just Begun,\" Mrs. Bruce crouches next to her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track. She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate. Album after album flaps forward. Olivia Newton-John, Neil Diamond, the Osmond Brothers. She stops on the Carpenters and sighs at the serene cover art. Just what the doctor ordered. \nPlacing the vinyl on the turntable, she CLICKS the dustcover closed and FLICKS \"Play.\" Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen Carpenter. \nSuddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun GUITAR. Caustic ROCK 'N' ROLL assaults her senses. She jumps, spilling her wine all over herself. This isn't the Carpenters... \nIT'S KISS! \nRacing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. The music is even louder now. \nFlustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover. It's stuck. She screams and covers her ears. This is Hell. Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to reach the plug, but can't. Fingertips millimeters away. \nAs the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo with all her frantic might. \nSCREEEEEECH! The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a shrill, finally coming to a stop. Whew, silence! \nThen, POP, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. Shaken, she grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label... \nKISS - LOVE GUN, SIDE TWO \nMrs. Bruce's blood boils. \nMRS. BRUCE KISS! The devil's music! \nEXT. LEX'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly trees. \nTwo-car garage. \nA faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL, inhuman. \nCAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice. \nINT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAn inner-sanctum of KISS devotion. Faux-wood paneling is plastered with countless KISS posters, pictures, fold-outs. The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters. KISS dolls, magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted floor. Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage pail. \nThe four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast a familiar tune offensively off-key. \nBOYS SINGING \"I wanna rock 'n' roll all night and party every day!\" \nThey stink, but they sure are trying hard. Meet the band \"Mystery.\" Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs. \nHAWK, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his rhythm guitar. Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but knowing the others, that doesn't say much. \nLEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes everything way-too-seriously. \nTRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he's hammering nails. All id, Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap. \nJAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. The big drum bears the word \"Mystery\" painted on its skin with a lightning \"S\" just like the KISS logo. \nThey bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol. Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience. \nHAWK Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great crowd. But after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and seven encores on top of that, I'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies. \nBehind him, Trip grabs Lex's bass and swings it by the neck at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again. Lex quickly yanks it away from him. \nLEX What the fuck, Trip? That's my bass! \nJam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling. \nJAM That was curly! \nTRIP Just one more day of school to get through, girls, before tomorrow night... Live! (getting excited) COBO Hall! Detroit, Michigan! (like an announcer) You wanted the best! \nHawk is on the phone as Lex and Trip scour every inch of the cluttered room on their hands and knees searching frantically for something. \nHAWK Jam, listen up. \nJAM (O.S.) Hawk? \nHAWK Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary. \nINT. JAM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJam clutches the phone with his shoulder GRUNTING as he does battle with the Bullworker for possession of his foot. \nHAWK (O.S.) Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana. \nJAM It's my Bullworker. \nHAWK (O.S.) Anyway, listen up. They're gone! \nJAM What's gone? \nHAWK (O.S.) The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm! \nJAM (panicked) Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...? \nHAWK (O.S.) Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now! \nJam briefly scans his surroundings double-taking at the denim jacket lying on the floor. He checks the pockets and sees four tickets labelled KISS - JUNE 7, 1978 - COBO HALL, DETROIT. \nJAM Whew! Oh, God, Hawk... I got'm! Somehow I musta taken Trip's jacket by mistake! \nINT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - DAY \nHawk SIGHS like a deathrow convict pardoned at the last second. \nHAWK (to others) He's got'm! \nLex and Trip collapse with relief. \nHAWK Trip, he took your jacket by mistake. You must be wearing Jam's. \nTrip reaches in a breast pocket and pulls out Rosary beads. Spooked, he drops them like they were a bug. \nHAWK (into phone) Cool. \nJAM (O.S.) I'm really sorry about that, man. \nHAWK Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what? \nINT. JAM'S ROOM - DAY \nJAM Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school. \nCLICK. DIAL TONE. Jam hangs up. \nINT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - DAY \nLex buckles his belt with its huge KISS belt buckle. \nLEX Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell. \nTRIP You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke. \nTrip pockets his wallet which is affixed to a long chain attached to a side belt loop. \nLEX Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD. \nTRIP Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day. \nHAWK Both you assholes, SHADDAP! \nLex and Trip shaddap. \nHAWK Enough of the mom-bashing, all right? Lex's mom is cool about us crashing over here while she's out of town. And if it weren't for Trip's mom, we wouldn'ta smoked that fine Panama Red last night. So leave the women who gave you life out of it. They're both cool. \nTrip and Lex cease and desist the mom-bashing and continue getting ready for school. Suddenly, Lex pushes Trip angrily. \nLEX Trip, you fuckin' asshole. \nTRIP What? \nTRIP Hey, that dork looks just like Jam. \nHawk and Lex look and laugh when they see him. \nLEX Shit, that dork is Jam. \nHAWK (to Jam) YO, DOOFUS! \nJam gives them the finger. \nINT. SCHOOL LOCKER AREA - DAY \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam grab books from their lockers. KISS stickers, photos, and rock magazine cut-outs line the insides. Jam's locker door is covered with Peter Criss only. \nTRIP So, Jam, who did your wardrobe, Tad the preppie sailboat captain? \nJAM Hey, my mom had me over a barrel, all right. After last night, I had to let her dress me today. It's a give and take relationship. \nLEX Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it. \nHAWK Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them. \nJAM They're still at my house in Trip's jacket. \nHAWK They're what? \nJAM She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake. \nTRIP That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too? \nLEX If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year! \nJAM Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem. \nHAWK All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City. \nJAM Check. \nThe BELL RINGS. \nHAWK As they say in the Tampon biz, see you next period. \nSLAM! They shut their lockers in unison. \nINT. STUDY HALL - DAY \nThe STUDY HALL TEACHER grades papers. On the wall a picture of President Carter hangs next to Old Glory. The words \"Be Quiet\" are written on the blackboard. \nStudents study, read, doodle, sleep. Jam is at his desk touching up the word \"Mystery\" on his drumstick. Next to him sits BETH. Quirky, but cute, she stares longingly at him wanting to say something, but not having the guts. \nPleased with his work, Jam puts the drumsticks on the desk and opens a Peter Criss album cover notebook depicting countless doodles of the KISS logo, the Mystery logo, and renderings of Peter Criss. \nBeth SIGHS and opens her own notebook. Drawings of hearts fill the pages. In them is written \"Beth + Jeremiah\" and \"I love Jeremiah.\" \nThen, one of Jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto the floor. Beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just as he bends to get it too. THUD, they bash heads. \nJAM Oof! (whispering) Sorry. \nRubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick. \nBETH No problem. \nJAM Thanks. \nHe stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs down. Jam and Beth stare at each other. There's a mutual crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move. Both want to speak, neither does. They awkwardly go back to their notebooks. \nMustering the nerve, Jam breaks the ice and whispers... \nJAM Beth? \nBeth spins too quickly. Her pen flies out of her hand. \nBETH Yes? \nBOINK! The pen hits Jam in the eye. \nJAM Ow! \nFeeling awful, Beth moves in to help. The teacher looks up sternly. \nJAM You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school? \nMRS. BRUCE What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less! \nShe flicks the lighter, not yet lighting the cigarette. \nJAM Mom, three of those tickets don't even belong to me. They're for the guys. \nMrs. Bruce holds the tickets over the lighter's flame. \nMRS. BRUCE And if the \"guys\" have parents who truly love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things. \nMrs. Bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets, then drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel eternity. Jam stares semi-catatonic through his mom's sour expression. \nMRS. BRUCE It's been a long time coming, son, but you're finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve. \nShe stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm. \nREVERSE ANGLE ON NEARBY CORNER \nHawk, Trip, and Lex peek around it, their heads forming a totem pole. One-by-one they pull back. \nAROUND THE CORNER \nThey slump against the wall devastated. \nLEX I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked! \nTRIP Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together! \nHAWK What are you, high? \nTRIP Yeah. \nHAWK For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here. \nSuddenly, a caustic voice BLURTS from down the hall. \nVOICE I hope you rodents have hall passes! \nThe boys whip their heads around to see a potbellied, yellow- toothed, security officer with long sideburns and slicked back hair at the far end of the hall, fists on his hips. Meet ELVIS. \nLEX Wanna bet. \nELVIS Could that be three detentions I smell? \nElvis laughs and breaks into a run barreling down on them like a maniac. Keys JANGLING furiously. \nHAWK Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there! \nLEX Check! \nThey take off in three different directions. Still laughing, Elvis stops where the boys just were. Which one to follow? He bolts after Hawk who has taken the nearest staircase. \nINT./EXT. JAM'S STUDY HALL - DAY \nBeth looks sadly out the window watching Mrs. Bruce push Jam in the car. Beth puts her hand on the pane wanting to touch him. \nINT. STAIRWAY - DAY \nMeanwhile, Elvis HUFFS and PUFFS up a flight of stairs arriving at a set of swinging doors. He goes to push one in, but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him backward. \nFrom behind it pops Hawk wielding a fire extinguisher. BLAST! A hail of foam covers Elvis's face. Hawk shoves the extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes Elvis backwards down the stairs. He topples ass-over-head till he hits the landing. \nHAWK You're way out of your league, Elvis. \nElvis rises and shakes the CO2 off like a wet dog. Looking up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out. No sign of Hawk. \nINT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - DAY \nTrip kicks a bathroom stall violently. \nTRIP Fuck! Shit! \nLex sits on the toilet in the stall. \nLEX Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember? \nTRIP Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it! \nHawk scopes out the cafeteria to make sure the coast is clear. \nHAWK Ok, dudes, follow my lead. \nLEX Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school? \nTRIP About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway. \nLEX Hello summer detention. \nHAWK As I was saying, follow my lead. And maintain. Elvis just showed up. \nHawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough Elvis has just entered. Luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet. \nElvis swaggers to a table of CHEERLEADERS, puts his leg on a chair and starts a one-sided conversation with them. They promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites. \nMeanwhile, back at the condiment tray, Hawk and Trip each grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table. Lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup packets too. All three of them put their trays down and sit. \nHAWK (eyeing Elvis) Five second rule, boys. See you on the other side. \nHawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then leaves. \nTrip and Lex look at their watches for five seconds. Then Trip heads for the exit door also. \nLex still stares at his watch. After five, he looks at Elvis, who stops talking to the cheerleaders. As if possessing some sixth sense, Elvis turns quickly and looks STRAIGHT INTO CAMERA. \nELVIS'S POV -- He spots the swinging exit door and an empty table with three full lunch trays sitting on it. \nELVIS Excuse me, ladies. \nRelieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again. \nElvis moves through the cafeteria in SLOW MOTION toward the exit door. The hunter in action. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nElvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead-eye stare focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply. He catches a glimpse of Lex. Smiling like the devil, Elvis bolts. \nINT. OTHER HALLWAY - DAY \nLex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around the corner and marauds after them CACKLING maniacally. A mad chase ensues. Down hallways. Around corners. Upstairs. Down ramps. \nHawk, Trip, and Lex scramble as fast as they can to escape the clutches of their sideburn-clad nemesis. \nAs the boys pass a classroom, a NERD comes out pushing a projector on an AV cart. Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis. \nNERD Hey, I'm responsible for that! \nCRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector. \nAROUND A CORNER \nElvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water fountain pipe. He slides on his belly along the polished floor unable to stop. \nINT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY \nOld MISS HIBBS is lecturing on MOBY DICK. The kids are dozing. \nMISS HIBBS Then a cry from the crow's nest... \"Thar she blows!\" \nSuddenly, a screaming Elvis slides into the open door on his stomach and bowls Miss Hibbs over like a Brunswick. He clamors to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nPausing at the corner, Elvis takes a breath and leaps around it. He smiles at what he sees. \nUp ahead, Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand on a 3-stair stoop, desperately pulling at a locked door. Elvis smiles. They GULP. \nELVIS KISS concert? Kiss my ass morelike. A nice, fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening's plans. \nElvis takes his key ring off his belt and begins twirling it. The boys turn and face him. He savors the moment. \nELVIS Looking for something, rodents? \nHAWK Yeah, Elvis... \nHawk's brow furrows as he pulls about fifty ketchup packets out of his pocket. Trip and Lex do the same. \nHAWK ..Your ass on a lunch tray. \nThey hear an ENGINE and turn to see a delivery truck labelled PIZZA PIG parking behind them. A DELIVERY BOY holding a pizza box steps out. Trip's mouth waters. \nTRIP (licking his chops) Mmm, pizza... \nSeeing the boys, the delivery boy stops at the Volvo. \nDELIVERY BOY Hey, you guys know where... (looks at slip on box) Philip McNutly's office is? \nHawk, Trip, and Lex exchange an anxious glance, then Hawk smiles. He is officially inspired as he turns to the boy. \nHAWK Yeah, I'm Philip McNutly. \nINT. FATHER MCNULTY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Father TAPS his pencil looking impatiently at Jam who has totally withdrawn. He sits motionless staring into space. \nFATHER MCNULTY Jeremiah, are you aware you need to answer these questions, not just listen to them? Jeremiah? \nJam doesn't respond. \nFATHER MCNULTY Please don't become difficult this early in your stay. I hate disciplining boys before I get to know them. \nA NUN enters KNOCKING. \nNUN Forgive me, Father. A young man here with a pizza for you? \nFATHER MCNULTY Ah, yes! Send him in Sister Conimaria. \nThe nun exits and a second later Hawk enters wearing Lex's baseball cap pulled down over his eyes. \nFATHER MCNULTY Well, what's the damage, pizza fellow? \nHAWK Ten even. \nThe priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled \"Donations.\" While he looks for cash, Hawk gives Jam a discreet kick in the shin. Jam looks up and recognizes Hawk. He then looks out the window seeing Trip, Lex, and the Volvo below. \nFor the first time we see what Jam looks like with a big, fat, shit-eating grin on his face. \nHAWK (whispering to Jam) If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check? \nJAM (whispering) Check. \nFather McNulty swivels back around with a ten. \nFATHER MCNULTY Here's ten and I'm donating your tip to the church. The Lord thanks you. \nHAWK Tell the Big Guy not to mention it. \nHawk takes the ten, tips the brim of the baseball cap and leaves, giving Jam a cautious wink as he goes. \nFATHER MCNULTY And not a moment too soon. I'm famished. I hope you brought a lunch for yourself. \nJAM No, but I'm not hungry anyway. \nFather McNulty raises his eyebrows, then opens the pizza box. \nFATHER MCNULTY Well! It finally speaks. There's one barrier we've broken through. \nFather McNulty smiles, taking a big bite. Jam smiles for an entirely different reason. The priest mumbles with a mouthful. \nFATHER MCNULTY You know, your coming here reminds me of a gospel called The Prodigal Son. \nJam grins a bit feigning interest. \nFATHER MCNULTY There was once a farmer who had two sons. Both grew up on the farm, helping their father until... (suddenly alarmed) GYYAACK! \nFather McNulty GAGS sticking his pizza-covered tongue out. He pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down looking concerned for the moment. Finally, he BELCHES. \nFATHER MCNULTY That was a very stale mushroom. (beat) Where was I?... Ah, yes, one day the elder son decided to leave the farm... \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nHawk, Trip, and Lex look up at Father McNulty's window. \nTRIP Usually takes anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour. \nThey look at their watches, then back at the window. \nHAWK Shit! This is such a lousy view. How the hell are we gonna know when he's lit? \nLex looks at the speedometer. Hawk's got it up to ninety- five. \nLEX Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit? \nHAWK Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed. \nTrip holds his stomach as we hear it GROWL. \nTRIP I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime. \nHAWK Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo. \nTrip spots a sign on the side of the road: Next Exit, Sandusky. \nTRIP Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk. \nHAWK What's in Sandusky? \nTRIP Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMOMENTS LATER \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nThe boys chomp on their pizza slices and chug cans of Hawaiian Punch. Another raucous KISS tune BLARES. \nBehind them, a car horn starts HONKING rhythmically. Hawk looks into the rearview mirror and sees two guys and two girls in a tailgating Trans Am. \nThe guys have 90 M.P.H. haircuts, tacky, wide-collared shirts, and massive amounts of jewelry on their necks. \nThe girls wear 10-layer make-up, mega-jewelry, and hair teased so high, it touches the car's roof. \nHAWK Only a car full of guidos and stellas would ride someone's ass on a two- lane road and beep. \nINT. TRANS AM - DAY \nThe speakers BLAST a DISCO SONG to which the four passengers sing. KENNY, the driver, HONKS to the disco beat. \nThey're slightly older than our heroes and very full of themselves. Kenny and his best girl CHRISTINE sit in the front. BOBBY and BARBARA are in the back. It's a double disco date. \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nTrip lifts a rubbery slice of pizza to his mouth and the top layer slides off PLOPPING into his lap. \nTRIP Eyowch! This is one hot pizza! \nLEX Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery! \nTrip grabs the wad of goop and throws it out the window. \nEXT. TRANS AM - DAY \nJust as the DISCO TUNE playing in the Trans Am hits the next chorus, a fistful of pizza SPLATTERS across the windshield. Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road. \nRighting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well have been insulted. \nKENNY Stop singing... NOW! \nHe turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator, swerving into the left lane and passing the Volvo. Bobby is just now noticing the mess on the windshield. \nHe starts to laugh. \nBOBBY Hey, Kenny, look! There's a hunk of fawkin' cheese on your windsheel! \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nLex is looking at the mess on the Trans Am's windshield and the anger in the eyes of its passengers. \nLEX Holy shit! We just pissed off the Incredible Hulk, his idiot half brother and two circus clowns. \nThe Trans Am runs alongside the Volvo and Hawk turns to see Kenny pointing to the breakdown lane. \nKENNY Stop the friggin' car NOW! \nHawk rolls up his window. Kenny yells, VOICE MUFFLED, and points to Hawk who pays absolutely no attention whatsoever. \nJAM Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off? \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nChristine sits between Jam and Lex in the back SNAPPING gum. Jam and Lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl. \nHawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking herself in a compact. She swathes on some 7-Up flavored, Bonnie Bell lip gloss. \nTrip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling in his mouth, sealing it. He winks at her disgustingly. \nCHRISTINE Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there? \nTRIP (smirks) What's it worth to you? \nCHRISTINE (grossed out) What the hell is that supposed to mean? \nJAM It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him. \nHAWK (rolls his eyes) Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike. \nTrying to be suave, Lex moves in close, putting the make on her. \nLEX Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby. \nCHRISTINE Well, your tee-shirt may say rock 'n' roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby. \nShe pushes him away. Jam laughs. \nTRIP (frustrated) So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what? \nCHRISTINE (thoroughly offended) What? That's disgusting! \nJAM Trip! That's so fuckin' rude, man. \nTRIP Oh, quit bein' the wussy, sensitive guy to impress her, Jam. She's obviously not gonna put out. She's a fuckin' tease. \nCHRISTINE Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids? \nTRIP You got in the car, didn't you? \nCHRISTINE Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere. \nTRIP Whatever... stella. \nTrip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot. He passes it to Lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the exception of Christine. The car starts to fill with smoke. \nCHRISTINE The name's Christine, not stella. And there's no need to be such pigs just cause I prefer Donna Summer or KC and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over KISS? \nHAWK (with disdain) The Village People? They're fags! You're a fag hag! \nJAM Come on, Hawk. \nCHRISTINE I can take care of myself, but thanks anyway, germ. \nJAM Jam. \nCHRISTINE Whatever. (to Hawk) Okay, Joe Burnout, let's get one thing straight here. As far as I'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category. True, if I had to choose, I'd pick the category labelled disco because I happen to enjoy dancing. Disco is just easier to dance to. \nHAWK You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me. \nTRIP Disco blows dogs for quarters. \nChristine processes this remark. \nCHRISTINE Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony. \nTrip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment. \nHAWK Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car! \nCHRISTINE Yeah, why don't you put your money where your mouth is? \nHAWK Why don't you kiss my hairy crack? \nCHRISTINE Why don't you bend over, you're looking right at it! \nAll, Christine included, pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean. Lex takes a hit off the joint. \nLEX (holding in smoke) That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever. \nHawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit. \nHAWK We're right behind you, Simo. Just wanted to thank you in advance for handing over those burly-ass tix me and my buds won this morning. \nThe boys do a Three Stooges handshake and say \"Curly!\" Simple Simon on the other hand suddenly appears nonplussed \nSIMPLE SIMON Your name isn't Trip is it? \nINT. PRODUCER'S BOOTH - NIGHT \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam sit in the tiny producer's booth with Simon who fast forwards a reel-to-reel tape through some very loud, high-speed conversation and bits of music. \nLooking at the footage counter on the tape player, he slows down at a certain point and lets the boys listen to this: The CLICK of a phone being answered. \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller. \nTRIP'S VOICE Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air? \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS? \nTRIP'S VOICE Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it! \nPause. \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE Is that your final answer? \nTRIP'S VOICE (with trepidation) Yeah. \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE (building to crescendo) Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight! \nPause. \nTRIP'S VOICE I did? \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE Yeah, you did! \nTRIP'S VOICE Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God! \nCLI-CLICK. \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not \"Taxi Driver.\" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and... \nDIAL TONE. \nSIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE Trip? Trip? Oh, man, you didn't hang up on me did you? Trip? (beat) What kind of total moron would hang...? \nSimple Simon stops the tape and looks at the boys who look like they've just been served a life sentence behind bars. \nSIMPLE SIMON Well, there you have it. We had no choice but to give the tickets to the next caller. I'm sorry. \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam stare at the floor in silence. \nSIMPLE SIMON We got sodas in the fridge if that helps any. \nINT. W.A.R.P. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam ride back down the elevator sipping NeHi sodas, watching the floor numbers get lower and lower. Terry Jack's immortal hit \"SEASONS IN THE SUN\" plays over the elevator speaker. \nHAWK Well, here we are, dudes. One hour and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century... ticketless. All thanks to Wile E. Coyote, Super- Fucking Genius over here. \nTrip looks away from the rest, ashamed. \nLEX Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change? \nTRIP Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake. \nHAWK Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense. \nJAM Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize. \nHAWK Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you? \nJam looks at his feet. \nJAM Sometimes I think I don't deserve friends as good as you guys. \nHawk, Trip, and Lex cringe. \nHAWK I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say? \nTRIP Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf? \nTRIP Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think? \nHAWK (sarcastic) Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize. \nTrip smiles proudly. \nLEX I think we should try sneaking in. \nHAWK Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan. \nLEX Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all \"re-enter\" the concerto. Voila! \nHAWK Still too risky for my money. (looking at watch) We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection... \nHawk points to the intersection where the church, the male strip joint, the parking lot, and the Smiley Mart are located. \nHAWK ...at twenty-thirty hours. \nTRIP One more time in English. \nHAWK For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there. \nJAM (inspired) Wait! I know how we can get in! \nHAWK Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it. \nJAM (sadly) But... my plan involves all four of us acting together. \nHAWK See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. (to Lex and Trip) Dudes? Later. \nHawk, Trip, and Lex split up, leaving Jam alone. He starts walking in the opposite direction, passing MATMOKS. The leader is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone. \nLEADER Look around you tonight, mothers! Look at all the young faces! They smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all hope! Not one among them appears to possess the love and fear of God... This satanic group KISS has stolen their souls. \nThe leader's gaze finally falls upon Jam. He lets out a GASP. Yes, the leader is Mrs. Bruce. So this was her church meeting. \nShe freezes when she sees her son; her jaw slackens. Meanwhile Jam looks stunned beyond comprehension. \nJAM Oh... dear... Lord!! \nMrs. Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another MATMOK member, who picks up where Mrs. Bruce left off. \nJam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too late. Mrs. Bruce slices through the crowd of KISS fans and grabs Jam by the ear. He yelps. \nMRS. BRUCE I don't know how you got here tonight and I don't want to know either. All I know is you're going to pay dearly for this one, young man! \nEXT. ST., SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT \nMrs. Bruce tugs Jam toward the intersection we saw before. They cross the street toward the corner where the Cathedral sits. \nJam looks up at the cross on the steeple and GULPS with trepidation. \nJAM Mom, what're we...? \nMRS. BRUCE Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah. \nThey climb the steps to the cathedral passing a bulletin board reading: Thank God It's Friday Mass, 6PM-7PM. \nPARISHIONERS exit the beautiful church, shaking hands with a PRIEST as they leave. \nPARISHIONERS What a wonderful mass, Father/So inspirational, Father/Thank you. \nPRIEST Thank you/Come again next week. \nMrs. Bruce pulls Jam up to the priest. \nPRIEST Next mass is tomorrow morning, sister. \nMRS. BRUCE Can we talk, Father? I'm desperate. My son was about to defy God by going to that blasphemous KISS concert. \nPRIEST In that case, come right in. \nMeanwhile, across the street... \nEXT. WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT \nParked in front of the busy fast-food establishment we recognize the two-toned Chevy Impala with luggage tied on top. In the window we see Beth and her parents sitting at one of the booths. \nOut the window Beth looks across the street just as Jam, Mrs. Bruce, and the priest enter the cathedral. Her face drops. \nTRIP No thanks, dude. I'm beating my ticket out of some poor, defenseless chump. \nTrip exits FRAME. \nSCALPER What's happening to kids today? \nINT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT \nHawk enters your average, everyday, male strip joint. A crowd of LUSTY WOMEN cheer on a STRIPPER IN A FIREMAN'S SUIT. He dances on a lighted, tile stage under a spinning, mirror ball. \nHawk shows the MAN AT THE DOOR his fake license and the man nods him in. He approaches the bar in the early stages of being very intimidated. \nThe BARTENDER, a man dressed only in tight, black, tuxedo pants, shirt cuffs, and a tie, comes up to Hawk. \nHAWK (voice cracking) Like to sign up for the contest. \nThe bartender gives Hawk the once over. \nBARTENDER You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name? \nHAWK Hawk. \nBARTENDER Pick a song, Hawk. \nHAWK Got any KISS? \nBARTENDER You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink? \nHAWK Yeah, a man's drink... \nHawk squints at a name tag on the bartender's tie. \nHAWK ...Dickey. \nDickey goes to the bottle rack on the other side of the bar. \nHAWK (to himself) I'm gonna need all the help I can get tonight. \nDickey returns with the drink and Hawk pulls out his money clip. \nHAWK (looking at the drink) What's that? \nBARTENDER You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before? \nHawk looks at the unfamiliar drink again trying to play it cool. \nHAWK Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all. \nBARTENDER (seeing money clip) Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love. \nDickey points to a WOMAN sitting at the end of the bar. Mature and sexy. She's a knock-out. Every teenage boy's fantasy. Hawk's eyes pop at this \"Mrs. Robinson\" before him. \nHAWK Whoa... she is a killer. \nBARTENDER Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young. (leaning in) And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games. \nDicky pats Hawk's shoulder and leaves. Hawk looks away from Amanda and scans the room. He glances back at Amanda. She's still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed particularly cute knights. She winks and toasts Hawk. \nHawk raises his glass smiling nervously. They both sip at their drinks. She licks her lips suggestively at him. And, Hawk proceeds to COUGH up his mouthful of Jack Daniels, SPRAYING it all over the bar. \nSMILEY MART / HAULING BASS \nEXT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT \nYour typical 70's convenient store. Out front two SIX YEAR OLDS in Star Wars tee-shirts play tug-o-war with a Stretch Armstrong doll. \nTrip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts. When he tries to act tough, it's pathetic. Even six year olds aren't afraid. \nTRIP Hey, you little twerps, gimme your KISS tickets or I'll pop your fuckin' faces in. \nSIX YEAR OLD #1 We don't have any KISS tickets. \nSIX YEAR OLD #2 Yeah, KISS sucks! \nTRIP I oughta kick your asses for sayin' that. \nHe grabs the Stretch Armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket. \nTRIP But I'm in a hurry so I'll just take this instead. Now scram. \nChongo scratches his head. \nCHONGO How much cash do you figure? \nLITTLE KID Take five for a minute, Chongo. Let me do the math. \nThe little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme from \"JEOPARDY\" begins. While the kid thinks, Trip looks nervously up at Chongo and his buds. Chongo reaches into his denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE. He comes back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and forearm. \nTrip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh. CREEEAAAACK! Chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nThe full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of SECURITY GUARDS. \nLex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain link fence that surrounds the lot. \nHe crouches down and walks between two cars parked against the fence, looking both ways. Seeing a guard's flashlight beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then SIGHS eased. \nLEX (whispering to self) I can't believe I'm actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in. I oughta have my cranium examined. \nLex finds a vertical break in the chain link. He lays on his back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the fence. He's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also happens to be poorly lit. \nLEX Whoa. Danger Will Robinson. \nSpooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through when a flashlight beam hits his eyes. \nSECURITY GUARD'S VOICE Hey you! Get back in here! \nLex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the other side of the fence. Panicking, he bolts deeper into the field. \nSECURITY GUARD'S VOICE You're not getting far, kid! \nLex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his walkie-talkie. \nSECURITY GUARD'S VOICE We got one just ran into the field from the north lot! \nThe field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well- lit loading dock, where ROADIES empty the remaining bits of KISS's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler. Other huge trucks are parked nearby. There's a bustle of last minute activity. \nEXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT \nLex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to huge trunks, keeping well hidden. He dodges roadies and avoids being seen by OTHER GUARDS. \nHe slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading bay. Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building. \nSECURITY GUARD'S VOICE There he is! \nLex spins. The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel right for him. \nLEX Shit! \nHe dives rolls under the 18-wheeler. The three security guards leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him. \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEMI \nThe three guards scramble to their feet and grab a SCRAWNY BODY. They spin him around roughly. \nSECURITY GUARD Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta here! \nThey suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. It's a roadie. \nROADIE Hey, what the fuck? \nThe roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily. \nROADIE Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb fuckin' apes. \nThe security guards look around frantically for Lex as other roadies join in to defend their comrade. \nSECURITY GUARD Where'd he go? You see him? \nNo one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the guards and up the loading dock ramp. They don't notice Lex crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master. \nPraying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's carried into the building and disappears. \nJAM IN A JAM / KISS THIS \nINT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT \nJam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as Mrs. Bruce and the priest talk on the alter. \nHawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his face. \nHAWK Wow. I feel a hundred times better! \nHe hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman. \nHAWK Thanks lady. \nHe looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the DJ booth. \nHAWK Maestro? As you were. \nThe emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape. \nHAWK Come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment! The show must go on! \nHawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado. \nThe women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly start CLAPPING again. \nHawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into the crowd. The women actually fight over it. \nEncouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may be scrawny, but they don't mind. This lad's got personality. \nAdrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing the crowd of very responsive ladies. \nHe unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does an \"air guitar\" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps. \nHawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger and touches one of his cheeks: \"hot stuff\" (he does this in a manly way of course). \nThen Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear bunching up in his crack. \nThe women WHOO-HOO. \nHe segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream in orgastic joy. \nThen, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk's whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw suggestively. \nAt long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want. \nHe puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go batty. \nUnfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the face. She flies backwards over a chair. \nTrying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the bar. \nDRUM ROLL / NEGOTIATION \nINT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT \nTrip looks at the little kid, Chongo, and the two buds in fear. \nTRIP Two hundred bucks? \nLITTLE KID You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life. \nTRIP Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks. \nThe little kid shakes his head in disgust. \nLITTLE KID Chongo? Take him outside and tear his ass out through his mouth. \nChongo advances, muscles flexing. \nTRIP Hold on! I know how I can get the money! I just figured it out! Only you might wanna wait outside. \nThe little kid and Chongo look at each other. \nCHONGO I don't trust him. \nLITTLE KID I think he's on the level. He's too stupid to try anything sneaky anyway. Look at him, he's a moron. \nThey look back at Trip. \nLITTLE KID You got fifteen minutes and not a second longer. We have a concert to go to. See you outside. \nTrip nods sullenly as the kid, Chongo, and the two buds exit. Then he checks to make sure Stretch Armstrong is still with him. \nINT. BASS DRUM - NIGHT \nBETH can hardly speak. She gulps thinking of what to say. \nBETH I have a confession. Here it is. \nBeth gives him the biggest, wettest, sloppiest kiss in recorded history. She pulls away finally wiping her mouth. \nBETH I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me. \nJAM I don't care. I wanna hear more. \nShe lunges at him again, kissing him for dear life. Her lips leave his and begin to explore his chin, neck, ear. \nBETH I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it. \nJAM Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name. \nBETH You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam! \nHe kisses her neck. Unable to stop, they start undressing each other, both breathing heavy. \nBETH We've got to take this slow... \nJAM Right, slow... \nBETH Oh, screw it! \nShe tears his tee-shirt open with her teeth. \nINT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT \nA really buff STRIPPER dressed as a construction worker is on stage with about ten others who stand in the background. The emcee's hand hovers above the stripper's head. \nEMCEE Okay, ladies, it's down to... Troy the Human Jackhammer... \nThe women APPLAUD as we... \nFOLLOW the emcee's hand to Hawk who holds an ice pack on the side of his head. \nEMCEE ...and Mr. Massive Head Wound Accompanied by an Upset Stomach-Hawk! \nThe women APPLAUD but not quite as loud. \nEMCEE No contest. The grand prize of seventy- five dollars goes to Troy the Human Jackhammer! \nThe women cheer and a DISCO SONG starts as Troy does a reprise of his act. Hawk walks away from the stage with the rest of the rejected strippers, looking the way he feels: pretty damn stupid. He puts on his pants, trying to walk at the same time and falls to his knees. \nA helpful hand grabs him under the arm and helps him up. It's Amanda looking lustier than ever. \nHAWK Thanks, miss. \nAMANDA You're too kind. I'm Amanda. \nHAWK Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore. \nAMANDA Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities. \nHAWK Huh? \nAMANDA I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me. \nHawk GULPS. \nINT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT \nJam and Beth lay buck naked, tightly wrapped around each other in the heat of passion on the confessional booth floor. They kiss, sweat, and PANT heavily. \nSuddenly, the sliding door to the priest's booth opens. Jam and Beth freeze. \nPRIEST'S VOICE Where are you, son? \nJAM Uhh, tying my shoe. \nPRIEST'S VOICE Oh. So, have you thought of a colorful confession yet? \nJAM Actually, yes. Last year I walked out of a candy store with a Reggie Bar I hadn't paid for, but went back and apologized the next day. \nPRIEST'S VOICE Boooring. Think, boy, think! \nWe hear the door SLIDE shut again as Beth and Jam pick up where they left off. \nThe hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut as two SECURITY MEN jump in front of it. \nInstantly, huge, burly hands come down on Lex's shoulders. Before he can react, a slew of OFFICERS have him off his feet and carry him away, a stunned expression frozen to his face. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND COBO HALL - NIGHT \nLex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff of his neck. The security officers laugh and pat themselves on the back as they hurry back in. \nLex peeks out the lid. The alley is dark and spooky. He jumps out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived. Its teeth are bared and its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring. GRRRRRRR! \nLex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. A GROWLING PITBULL walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd. \nLEX (petrified) Dogs! Why did it have to be dogs! \nThen, a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges from the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, muscular form making the brick building nearby look like jello. \nLex starts SLAPPING himself on the face. \nLEX Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This part's gotta be a nightmare! \nNo luck. He stops, when several other DOGS emerge from the shadows and gather behind the first three. These new mutts immediately join in the GROWLING chorale. The Shepherd snaps at Lex. \nLEX (to the heavens) God, if you ever get me outta this, I swear I will never masturbate again! \nThe pack BARKS even louder. \nLEX (to heaven again) I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME! \nINT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT \nBeth lays in Jam's arms on the floor. They might as well be the only two people on the face of the earth. They whisper. \nBETH So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long? \nJAM I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia. \nBETH Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right? \nJAM Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that? \nBETH I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here. \nShe opens her backpack and pulls out a package addressed to Jam. The return address reads: Beth Bumsteen, Somewhere in Ann Arbor. \nJAM Ann Arbor? \nBETH My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out. \nJam opens the box and his jaw drops. It's a black tee-shirt with the \"Mystery\" logo printed in white on the chest. Jam holds it up. It's gigantic. \nBETH I pass by this really cool tee-shirt shop on my way to school every day and I know you wear those black tee- shirts all the time. You look like a size thirty-five, but all the sizes were in Roman numerals. So I got you an XXXL. That's thirty-five, isn't it? \nTouched, Jam kisses her for a long time. He starts putting on the shirt when suddenly they hear the SHUFFLING of the priest entering his booth. Jam grabs his clothes and sits back on the bench. Beth starts getting dressed at his feet. \nPRIEST Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute. \nJAM (pulling up his pants) Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath. \nPRIEST No... \nBeth is tying her shoes. Jam slips on his socks. \nJAM I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me. \nPRIEST Oh, this is terrible... Please go on. \nJAM Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour. \nJam pauses. \nPRIEST Well? Continue! Continue! \nJAM Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath. \nPRIEST Was it a teddy? \nFully dressed, Beth crawls out of the confessional. \nJAM No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that. \nBEEFY JERK #1 Who's there? \nSilence except for CRICKETS. Then... from out of the darkness emerges a figure... Lex. Christine's eyes brighten like a bulb. \nLEX I'm here for the girl and the car. You can try to stop me, but I must warn you, it may be hazardous to your health. \nThe beefy jerks laugh at this little punk. They start toward him, one with a tire iron, the other a big monkey wrench. \nBEEFY JERK #1 Too bad. He was such a young idiot. \nBEEFY JERK #2 Ehhh. He was a stupid boy. He deserved to die. \nLex lets out a quick HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE. The pack of BARKING dogs led by the Shepherd, the Pit Bull, the Doberman, and the Basset Hound, step from the darkness and flank Lex, GROWLING and SNARLING at the beefy jerks. \nLEX Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make... Hounds of hell? Say hello to dinner! \nThe beefy jerks drop their tools on their feet and yelp in pain. The pack takes this as a threat and charge the beefy jerks, who bolt for a glass-partitioned office. The dogs SCRATCH and BARK at the window ferociously. \nLex smiles at Christine. She smiles back. He presses the \"down\" button on the lift and the Volvo descends. Lex yells to the beefy jerks through the glass. \nLEX One foot out of that office and your asses are Alpo! \nLex unlocks Christine. She leaps into his arms. \nCHRISTINE Wow! Thank you! You're cooler than the Fonz. \nShe gives him a lingering kiss. Lex leans back, gives the double thumbs-up, and says... \nLEX Aaaayyyyy! \nLex takes her hand and they walk over to the Volvo. Lex lets her in then rounds the car to the driver's side. \nBEEFY JERK #1 Hey, what about the dogs? \nLEX You got a phone in there? \nThey nod. Lex drips a dry smile onto them. \nLEX Call the cops. \nThe beefy jerks watch in disbelief as the Volvo SCREECHES out of the chop shop. \n2 GODDBYES, A PUNCH IN THE GUT AND A DRUMSTICK \nEXT. WHITE CASTLE PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nBeth's parents wait in the running car as Jam and Beth share a heartfelt good-bye outside the back door. \nBETH Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right? \nJAM Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time. \nBETH That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know? \nJam takes her hands. \nJAM I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted. \nBETH Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam. \nJAM Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again. \nThey stare at each other for a really long time. Then, kiss. \nBEEP. BEEP. Dad looks back out the window and CLEARS HIS THROAT LOUDLY. \nBETH (flustered) Coming dad. (to Jam) I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye. \nJAM Bye. \nShe gets in the car. They both wave as the Impala turns a corner out of sight. Jam is left alone still waving long after she's gone. \nINT. AMANDA'S JAG - NIGHT \nAmanda and Hawk are half-dressed post-coitus. She looks in her purse. \nHAWK Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me. \nAMANDA I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer. \nTaken aback by his confidence, Mrs. Bruce grabs his ear and tries to pull him away. He won't budge. \nJAM Again, can I have my drumsticks? \nA BUNCH OF IDIOTS walk by with big transistor radios. One of them holds a Mr. Microphone and heckles the MATMOKS. \nLEAD IDIOT Hey, I'm on the radio! Hi, good- lookin'. We'll be back to pick you up later! \nMrs. Bruce yells at Jam through her bullhorn. \nMRS. BRUCE Drumsticks are the least of your worries, young man. You are in a world of... \nJam yanks the Mr. Microphone from the lead idiot and screams at his mother, his voice amplified on the transistors. Everyone stares. \nJAM I know, mom, I've been in trouble for about twelve hours now! Hellooooo!? \nThe other MATMOKS turn to look as Jam climbs onto a trash receptacle and shouts down at his mother, his face slowly turning purple. \nJAM I'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at St. Bernard's Boarding School, remember?! I'm gonna be outta your hair till I'm a legal adult, remember?! That way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila! All is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! Then, you can spend your days in guilt-free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! That way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child!!! And that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too. Cause if you did, you'd realize what a LOUSY, GODDAMN, SHITTY- ASS, PARENT YOU ARE!!! \nThe crowd of KISS fans APPLAUD Jam's rant. Mrs. Bruce is utterly winded from the assault. \nMRS. BRUCE (timidly) Jeremiah... what's gotten into you? \nJAM (into Mr. Microphone) I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!! \nThe crowd cheers. Jam jumps down and hands the Mr. Microphone back to the lead idiot. He turns to his mom. \nJAM For the last time, mom. Let me have my fucking drumsticks. Please. \nMrs. Bruce reaches into the trash, finds the drumsticks and hands them to him. He spins them like pistols, then stuffs them into his socks and walks away. \nSIMPLE PLAN \nEXT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP CLUB - NIGHT \nHawk runs to the scalper across the street who's selling a ticket to another KISS fan. \nHAWK Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be the last ticket! I hope you have another one for me! \nThe scalper sees Hawk and bolts down the street disappearing around a corner. Hawk stops. He's lost him. \nHawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four landmarks meet. He takes one more look up the block at Cobo Hall. Nearly all the KISS fans are inside. The streets are almost deserted. \nHAWK Fuck me! \nHe sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the street. It's Jam. Lex approaches the other corner. Trip comes up to the forth corner. They all stop when they see each other. Each standing on his own corner. They're all pissed. They meet in the middle of the street as last minute CONCERT GOERS hurry by. \nHAWK Any luck? \nTRIP Plenty, but it was all bad. \nLEX I found the Volvo. \nHAWK Tickets? \nThey all shake no. \nHAWK Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna see KISS this tour is by some fuckin' miracle. \nSuddenly, a commotion up the street. A SURLY MOM yanks four 12 YEAR OLD BRATS dressed like KISS by the scruffs of their necks. She's furious, they're CRYING. \nSURLY MOM How dare you sneak out of the house like that! You had me worried to death! Don't you know this is Detroit! And for a degenerate band like KISS! They're sick, sick, sick and oughta be in jail with their vile antics! \nShe throws a wad of paper to the pavement as they pass our four heroes. The dudes watch her pull the brats away. \nSURLY MOM Just wait until your father gets ahold of you! \nJam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip turn and look at the crumpled wad at their feet. It's an envelope. An ANGELIC SPOTLIGHT FROM ABOVE highlights it. \nLEX No... You don't think...? \nHAWK Nah. Couldn't be. \nThey all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't. Then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the envelope. Jam tears it open. His trembling hand reaches in. All their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside. \nJam pulls out four KISS tickets. Their jaws drop. Their eyes bug. \nJAM It's a miracle! A miracle! \n", "test1_input": "The teacher, MR. JOHANSEN, sips from a coffee cup and reads a newspaper, his feet on the desk. The headline says: \"Mass Suicide in Jonestown. Cyanide in the Kool-Aid.\" Above him is a long banner reading: \"Sorry, Absolutely no bathroom breaks\". \nHawk, Trip, and Lex sit before a half-built radio on a work bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces. \nLex solders two copper wires together. Hawk attaches a dial. Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long plastic tube. He blows air into his face repeatedly with it. \nTRIP (re:squeeze pump/tube) Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this? \nHAWK Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away. \nHawk turns the radio on and a HIGH FREQUENCY WHINE pours from its speaker. He adjusts the volume, then the tuner, until a DJ's VOICE comes through crisp and clear. \nDJ'S VOICE ...and this is Simple Simon on the rock of Detroit, W.A.R.P., home of the biggest KISS giveaway in the history of the universe! \nDetroit? DETROIT? Hawk, Trip, and Lex react like they've just been hit by phasers on stun. God is intervening. \nDJ'S VOICE I got four, count 'em, four front row tickets along with four backstage passes to the concert tonight at Cobo Hall and I'm giving them to the 106th caller who can tell me the real names of each KISS band member! \nHIGH FREQUENCY NOISES again, then the radio loses reception. Hawk exchanges an anxious glance with Trip and Lex. \nLEX Too bad we're stuck in electronics or... \nHAWK Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off. \nDISSOLVE TO: MOMENTS LATER \nMr. Johansen still sits with his feet up, reading. The next page's headline reads: First Test Tube Baby Born. \nTrip runs up to Mr. J's desk, one hand behind his back, the other on his crotch. His face is drawn in an expression of sheer agony. Hawk and Lex watch anxiously in the background. \nMR.J Mr. Verudi, get back to your bench. \nTrip puts one leg over the other always keeping a hand behind his back. \nTRIP But I gotta take a piss like you would not believe, Mr. Johansen! \nMR.J Put a clothespin on it till the end of class, Verudi. You know my rule. \nTRIP But ever since my doctor put me on salt pills, it's been like Niagara Falls every half hour! Please, Mr. J! Have mercy! \nSuddenly, a wet stain grows across the crotch of Trip's pants. \nMR.J Salt pills? Don't insult my intelligence, Verudi... \nMr. J. stops when he sees the stain starting to spread. \nTRIP Jeezis, I'm taking a leak in my pants! \nWe now see Trip is squeezing the pump from before. He holds it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the back of his pants. \nThe stain travels fast, hitting Trip's knee in a nanosecond. In a state of shock, Mr. J. slowly opens a long forgotten drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust-covered pad of bathroom passes. He tears one off and dust flies everywhere. \nHe holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was holding before an advancing vampire. \nMR.J (hoarsely) Get the hell out of here, Verudi! You disgust me! \nHawk and Lex observe that Trip has been successful, then do a Three Stooges-style handshake, whispering \"Curly!\" \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nThe SECRETARY sits at her desk in the reception area filing paperwork. She pauses when she hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Trip charges past, a big, wet stain on his crotch. \nThe secretary notices the pump and tube flopping from the back of his pants as Trip turns a corner. \nINT. MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY \nTrip runs up to a pay phone on the wall, pumps every nickel he has into it, puts the phone to his ear and dials. \nTRIP I need to be connected to the W.A.R.P. contest hotline... Now... lady!... Hello, is this me? I'm Trip. \nINT. SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nA cubby-of-an-office. Cluttered beyond belief. Elvis leans back on his chair against the wall reading a PLOP Magazine. A transistor radio plays W.A.R.P. He bolts at the sound of Trip's name causing his chair to slide out from under him. THWAM! \nTRIP ON RADIO Am I on the air?... Yeah... Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter, uh, Criscoula... yeah, that's it! \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nThe secretary hears an ecstatic \"YEEEHAAWW\" and turns to see Trip wheeling back around the corner, leaping in the air as he runs, YOWLING like a rodeo cowboy. He bounds past her. She watches him and shakes her head. \n", "test1_true": "INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nStill on the floor, Elvis grabs the little radio with rage, flips it off and screams at it. \nELVIS Why you little...! Over my dead body! \nThe bell RINGS. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VOC/TECH ROOM - DAY \nStudents pour into the hall. Hawk and Lex exit the class just as Trip comes zigzagging down the corridor dodging the hordes. All three converge as Trip can't contain his enthusiasm. \nTRIP I did it! I did it! We won! \nLEX We won?! \nHAWK Fuckin' A! Woooooo! \nThe three burnouts jump, scream, HOOT, and play air instruments like loons as if they're the only ones in the hall. They can't stop. The rest of the student body are not amused \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nHawk, Trip, and Lex hold their trays over the counter as the LUNCH LADIES fill them with Salisbury steak, hard dinner rolls and scoops of bluish pudding. Ah, public school nutrition. \nTRIP (stoked) This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario. \nHAWK (double stoked) Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one. \nLEX The Chinese have a proverb: \"That which appears too good to be true, usually is.\" There's gotta be a catch. \nTRIP Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, \"Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole.\" We're going this time and that's all there is to it. \nHAWK I'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time, Trip. There is a catch. \nHawk's really got their attention now. \nTRIP Namely? \nHAWK Our band \"Mystery\" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere. \nLEX But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county! \nHAWK So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check? \nLEX We are not stealing my mom's car. \nHAWK Damn straight we are. \nLEX Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati. \nHAWK And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway? \nLEX Sunday, but... \nHAWK Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit. \nTRIP Simplicity, Hawk. \nLEX Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us. \nHAWK There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero? \nLEX The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar \nHAWK Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check? \nLex nods. \nHAWK Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence. \nTRIP Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever. \nHAWK I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand. \nLEX Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something. \nHAWK Curly. \n", "test2_input": "He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh! \nKENNY Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band! \nKenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist. \nJAM Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's leave KISS out of it. Please. \nKENNY A bunch of guys who make bad music, dress like freaks, and wear more make-up than all my sisters combined? These assholes must be stopped! \nKenny pushes Jam away. \nCHRISTINE That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving! \nChristine gets out of the car and starts walking down the highway, exiting the scene. \nBARBARA Oh, Christine! You googatz in the head or something? We're on the side of the freakin' highway! \nBOBBY Let her go, Barbara, she'll come back to Kenny. She always does... (to Kenny) Right, Kenny? \nKenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo. \nKENNY Kool and the Gang, now there's real music. \nKenny takes the 8-track from the car... \nKENNY But this... is crap! \nHe flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi. \nFOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at Jam's feet. \nTILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to the CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the Indian in that \"Keep America Beautiful\" litter ad. \nHawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him. \nKENNY So. All that having been said and done, I believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. Namely: Have you learned your lesson yet, puke? \nHawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He blows some smoke in Kenny's face. \nHAWK Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. (puffing on cig) So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it. \nKENNY (beat, in disbelief) Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself? \nHAWK Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut. \nKENNY Oh, yeah...? \nOut of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by. \nKENNY That's not what your mother said last night. \nTrip, Lex, and Jam exchange \"uh-oh\" glances. Meanwhile, Hawk's eyes glaze over. \nHAWK It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me... \nHawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his side. \nHAWK ...what exactly did my mother say last night? \nKenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one. \nHAWK You heard me, prick. What did my mother say last night? \nKenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk. \nKENNY Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what your mother said last night. (beat) She said that I was the fuck of her life. \nHawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker. \nHAWK (very Clint Eastwood) How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch? \nKENNY (smirking) Sure. \nQuick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards from the impact. He hits his head on the ground. \nTaking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his drumsticks. \nAs if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead. \n", "test2_true": "Bobby shrieks. \nMeanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot. \nHawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity. \nHawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking Bobby out cold. \nTerrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered. \nLEX Not so fast, stella. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMOMENTS LATER \nKenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of Barbara's shoulders. \nHawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the stella, snickering. \nBARBARA When they wake up, they're gonna come looking for you jerks. You best hope they don't find you, cause if they do, they're gonna kick your asses. \nHawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking up to the Trans Am. \nHAWK Right, stella, and we'll deserve it. But let's really make it worth their while. \nHawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the engine WHINE in protest. (Again we are cautious not to show the guidos' faces.) \nHAWK By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote. \nHe throws the Trans Am into drive. \nAll who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH, then watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway. \nIt races into ditches, bounces off trees, and SPLASHES through ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like. \nThe disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, and finally, BOOM! It explodes on final impact. \nThe boys all look at each other and shrug. Hawk walks back to the Volvo and gets in. Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and pile in as well. Lex shouts back to Barbara. \nLEX Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply. You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse! \nANGLE ON KENNY, BOBBY, AND BARBARA. \nWe now see them from the front. Lo-and-behold, Kenny has been made-up like Gene Simmons, Bobby like Paul Stanley. Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste... and kick their asses all over again. \nBARBARA Very funny. I hope you choke! \nSTELLA ON BOARD \nINT. VOLVO - DAY \nHawk starts the engine and takes off. Trip pulls a baggie of weed and some rolling papers out. \nJAM Hey, look, it's that girl. \nJam points out at the road ahead to Christine. She's a few hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane. \nTRIP That's no girl. That's a stella. \nJAM Stella or no stella, we should pull over and help her out. \nHAWK Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice. \nJAM Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again. \nHawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling about two miles per hour. Christine doesn't notice as they edge closer to her. \nLEX What is it with you, Jam? You got a thing for that... thing? \nJAM She's a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway. They make very scary movies that start out like that. \nHAWK Well, they may not make movies about four dudes going to a KISS concert. But if they ever did, the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny. \nPause. \nTRIP Unless there was gonna be a scene where the disco bunny blows the four dudes on the way to the show. \n", "test3_input": "BEEFY JERK #2 You're lucky you're still alive, wench. If you was a guy, we woulda thought nothin' of sawing your head off with a butter knife. \nBEEFY JERK #1 What are we gonna do with her anyway? \nBeefy jerk #2 bares what's left of his yellow, crusty teeth \nBEEFY JERK #2 I dunno, but she sure looks fun. \nBeefy jerk #1 touches the bandage on his head. \nBEEFY JERK #1 Yeah, and payback's a bitch. \nChristine GAGS at the thought. \nANGLE ON WALL CRACK \nLex's eyeball bulges with terror. \nEXT. IT'S RAINING MEN PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nDOLLY FROM the front end of a Jaguar XKE, Michigan vanity plate reading: AMANDA. \nTO its windshield, through which we see Hawk and Amanda kissing in the front seat, clad only in their underwear. Something like \"ME AND MRS. JONES\" plays on the radio. When they separate, Amanda takes out a flask and offers it to Hawk. \nHAWK Thanks. \nHe gulps some down and pulls the flask away COUGHING. \nHAWK What the hell is that? \nAMANDA Gin. \nHAWK Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself. \nAMANDA Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we? \nHAWK Who's Whiskey Dick? \nAmanda plants a stocking foot on Hawk's crotch and rubs. \nAMANDA Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody. \nHAWK My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw... \nHawk's eyes cross as he lets out a DEEP, OBNOXIOUS GROAN. \nHAWK ...holy shit! \nAmanda looks down at his crotch. \nAMANDA But you do know Premature Peter, don't you? Shame, I just bought these stockings. \nHawk has never been more embarrassed. \nHAWK Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. (to the heavens) What's next? Projectile diarrhea? (beat, to Amanda) Man. What a stud, huh? \nAMANDA Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick. \nShe takes a healthy swig of gin, relishing its bitterness. \nHAWK You love him? \nAMANDA I just told you, he's a big, hairy... \nHAWK No, I mean... you love your son? \nAMANDA More than anything in the world. \nHAWK And he loves you back, doesn't he? \nAMANDA He's a little spoiled, but I know he does. \nHAWK Well, shame on him if he doesn't. \nShe pats his shoulder. \nAMANDA You're sweet. \nHawk stares out the windshield. \n", "test3_true": "Amanda caresses Hawk's cheek. He turns with her hand and kisses it. He takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to her neck, her cheek, her mouth... \nDR. LOVE TO THE RESCUE \nINT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT \nIt's a stand-off. Prone customers look up at Trip and the man with the long coat circling each other like sharks. The helpless cashier lets out fearful sobs. \nMAN WITH COAT Gimme your gun, boy! \nTRIP No, you gimme your gun, boy! \nMAN WITH COAT Don't tempt me, I'll shoot! \nTRIP Not if I shoot first! \nMAN WITH COAT I don't even think you have a gun! \nTRIP Neither do I! \nThe man with the coat puts his shotgun against Trip's head. \nMAN WITH COAT Now, for the last time, take the piece out and lay back down or your mom's gonna need the White Tornado to get the brains outta your ski cap. \nTrip GULPS. The jig's up. He slowly pulls out Stretch Armstrong, and the man with the coat glances down and starts to laugh very loud. So loud, he throws his head back. \nWhen he recovers, Trip's got Stretch aimed at his head and pulled back to maximum tension. \nTRIP Smile, you sonofa... \nTrip lets go. WZZMACK! The man gets it right in the face and falls backward onto the Hostess display, toppling a whole bunch of Ho-Ho's, Ding-Dong's, Twinkies, and Suzy-O's to the ground. \nTrip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the coat lifts his head briefly, then passes out. \nTrip turns around and the cashier SLAMS into him, nearly knocking him over. She throws her arms around him letting out relieved SOBS. Behind her all the customers rise from the floor CLAPPING. Trip did it. He saved the fucking store! \nThe cashier looks into Trip's masked eyes. \nCASHIER Thank you! Thank you!... Who are you? \nTRIP (with confidence) Call me... Dr. Love! \nShe plants a thousand mega-watt kiss on his lips and we ZOOM IN on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine red. \nTrip's eyes widen just before... KABOOM... The shotgun he's holding goes off, blowing a hole in the ceiling. \nThe recoil from the blast jolts Trip and the cashier apart. We now see Trip's face is smeared with bright, red lipstick. A huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesn't move. The kiss hit him harder. \nI'M HERE FOR THE GIRL AND THE CAR \nINT. CHOP SHOP - NIGHT \nBZZZZZ! Christine and the beefy jerks watch the brown, '78 Volvo, Ohio plates: OB-GYN, ascend on a hydraulic lift. \nBehind them sits the BMW skeleton. These boys work fast. \nCHRISTINE You guys better kill me before you do what you're thinking of doing. Cause when I'm mad enough, I can bite down very hard. \nThe beefy jerks laughs. \nBEEFY JERK #1 Sweet Polly Purebred's got some spunk, huh? \nBEEFY JERK #2 I'll give her some spunk alright. \nThey put their blow torches down and turn to her. \nBEEFY JERK #1 We stripped that Beemer in fifteen minutes. Bet we can strip her in fifteen seconds. \nThey giggle maniacally and lumber toward Christine. Their shadows growing larger and larger across her. \nCHRISTINE (mile a minute) Now wait a minute, guys! Two against one ain't fair. Lemme go back and get my friend Barbara. You'd love her. Tits the size of your head. You'll feel like a little baby sucking on 'em. I swear, I'll bring her right back. It'll be a four-way... You guys like disco? I teach disco dancing at my church. You guys look like you got rhythm in your blood. Come on, free lessons if you let me go. \nBEEFY JERK #1 I know a dance we can do. The horizontal hustle. \nThey both laugh. Just as they're about to grab her... \nSuddenly, the garage door behind them SLIDES UP revealing darkness. Christine and the beefy jerks look out anxiously. \n"}

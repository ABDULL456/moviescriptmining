VICK Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters. ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit. 
ALAN All right, we're scaring the children. Let's go. The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants. 
STU Wait -- so have either of you tested the waters? 
VICK No! We're not gay! 
Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto 
THE CASINO FLOOR The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit. Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned. 
STU How am I going to tell my wife? 
VICK Quickly, and from a great distance. Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS... 
STU Jesus, what kind of father am I? Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold. 
ALAN Oh my God. 
STU (really scared) You think Erin will try to take the kids--? 
ALAN Oh...my...God. 
VICK (turning, annoyed) What now? Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it. 
STU (not getting it) Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this. Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and starts back towards Alan. 
VICK Oh my God... Oh my God... 
STU What's the big--? (finally realizing) Oh! OH! OH! 
Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily takes off the massive unicorn ring. 
STU (CONT'D) Maybe it's not a wedding ring? 
ALAN (reading inscription) "To My Noble Husband, Alan." The guys eyes bulge, oh shit! 
STU This is worse than my underwear! Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription: 
VICK "Now & Forever Wedding Chapel." They guys exchange a look. 
VICK (CONT'D) Well, at least it's a lead. Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over, disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY 
The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum. 
VICK So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in LA before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass. No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car. 
STU Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night. Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear. 
ALAN That was us, dude. 
STU Really? 
ALAN Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's room. 
STU 
(FROWNING) Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good reason for doing it. 
(BEAT) You think they'll charge us for--?

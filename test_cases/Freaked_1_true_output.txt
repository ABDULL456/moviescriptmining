Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He pounces and catches the furry little bugger. 
JUAN Gotcha! Damn, it's about time! 
ALL THE EX-FREAKS (happy to see him) JUAN! 
JUAN Hey guys! Jeez! You look great! 
They all hug. 
REGIS That's just great. What a story. And what an ending! Elijah transformed by the goop! 
KATHIE LEE And he really looked like--? 
RICK Exactly like you two, I swear. Same faces, same outfits, except they had these really big, hideous feet... 
He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big, hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red-- It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice. 
ELIJUS Show's over, Ricky! 
ELLY LEE I'm gonna drink your blood! 
Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on Rick's throat when... 
BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny. They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick. They embrace. 
JULIE Rick! It's finally over! 
RICK Yes... Yes it is. 
STUEY(O.C.) Rick! Rick! 
Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag dripping blood. 
RICK Stuey! 
STUEY Look! I found the real Regis and Kathie Lee! 
Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles. 
STUEY (CONT'D) No, this is just my lunch! 
Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar leaking bag and holds it up. 
STUEY (matter of fact) This is Regis and Kathie Lee. 
Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh." 
AUDIENCE Awwww! 
Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch, bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and Julie when... 
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out and they fall dead--again. 
Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun. 
ERNIE Oh, like that wasn't totally predictable. 
JULIE Well, now it really is over. 
Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up. 
RICK Thank God. You know, this adventure has taught me something. (MORE) RICK(CONT'D) When man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order, the only thing he'll create is havoc. 
ERNIE Right, Coog. I learned somethin' too. That men and women truly are equals. That the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance, and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise. I believe it was Moliere WHO SAID-- 
Julie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw. 
JULIE Oh, shut up. (She turns to Rick) Let's go fuck. 
Rick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience. 
RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER Good night, everybody!

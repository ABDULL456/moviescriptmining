Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal points to a well-dressed man in the front pew. 
CARDINAL (CONT'D) How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever do anything for you? 
The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet. 
MAYOR (standing) Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord.  If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins."  Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want. 
A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof again, this time energetically. 
CARDINAL Amen to that.  Let the sin begin! 
The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting over the money in the collection plate. 
The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) Oh, this is delicious. 
ON MAYOR 
He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response. 
CASSIUS (O.S.) (laughing) "Let the sin begins" - that was a good one. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell.  How are things going down at City Hall? 
CASSIUS (O.S.) I lowered the drinking age to ten. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I never want it to end. 
CASSIUS (O.S.) Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us? 
The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO: 
Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the same. 
NICKY This is intense!  And it happens every day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my hat to you people! 
BEEFY Look, it's okay for me to shit the street.  But you gotta use a toilet. 
NICKY (pulling up pants) Okay, just point me in the right direction next time. 
BEEFY Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking. 
NICKY Well, let's rock and roll. 
Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart. You froze the gate and you're killing him.  Drink! 
Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips. 
CHINESE DELIVERY GUY I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty! 
NICKY just get in the flask! 
The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel?  Well, in the immortal words of Judas Priest, "You got another thing comin'." 
Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot long lense, real people, real reactions.) 
INT. POPEYE'S - DAY 
Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu, ordering some chicken.

Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes. He steps back, clearly a little spooked. 
COOPER (CONT'D) I think we need to go, Murph. 
MURPH But can't we take it back? You could fix it up, get him to do chores. 
COOPER No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving. 
Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot. 
Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level. 
Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot. 
The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. 
Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine. 
ROBOT Tell the boy to stop hitting me. 
COOPER (IGNORING HIM) Hit him in the back of the neck. 
Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him. 
VOICE (O.S.) I wouldn't do that. 
A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND -- tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that she's pointing at Cooper. 
COOPER We were just looking for salvage. 
BRAND Is that what they call stealing these days? 
COOPER I didn't know it belonged to anyone. 
BRAND It doesn't. (TO ROBOT) You want to let them go, Tars, or do you want some help with your work? 
The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely. Then lets him go. 
COOPER You've got me wrong, lady. 
BRAND Really? You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower? 
Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Get back in your little plane, go back to your farming commune. And don't come back. 
Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles. 
TARS Don't forget your gun. 
COOPER (points at Tars) Word of advice -- careful with that thing. When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting. 
BRAND I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. Keep moving. 
Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him. 
Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane. He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked. 
COOPER Wait a second-- 
Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned. 
BRAND Get it inside. (MORE) 
BRAND (CONT'D) (points rifle at Cooper) You too. We'll figure out what to do with you later. 
Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a huge, reinforced service elevator. 
INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY 
Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered. 
COOPER Now who's stealing from who? 
BRAND This doesn't belong to you. 
COOPER You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money. 
Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward. 
INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY 
They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket. Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it. 
Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand. 
COOPER Who are you people? 
BRAND (WRY) The government gave us plenty of practice looking for our own funding. (gestures with rifle) Keep moving. 
Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS converge around Tars. 
An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years earlier. 
BRAND (CONT'D) I found them outside with it. It looks like six. Maybe seven. I can't tell from the radiation damage. 
The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished. 
OLD ENGINEER Where did you find it? 
COOPER Galveston. 
BRAND'S FATHER (thinking it over) Of course. It must have been looking for Canaveral. 
Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE, 40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe. 
COOPER Canaveral's been gone for thirty years. 
Brand ignores him. 
Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated. 
DOYLE It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary. 
Brand looks up at Cooper. 
BRAND What did you do to it? 
COOPER Nothing. I got something off of it. 
Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator.

SALESMAN (exasperated) If there's a God. 
BRAD Do we get a balloon with these? 
SALESMAN Yes. 
ROBERT All of us, or just her? 
SMASH CUT TO: EXT. STREET NEAR SHOE STORE - DAY 
Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of man's shoes.  We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march victoriously down the street.  We MOVE IN on Lucy's little brown shoes skipping with joy and -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY 
Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black soccer cleats.  We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a fierce kids soccer game. 
Score's tied.  The ball comes to Lucy.  She kicks and misses. From the sidelines we hear: 
SAM Beautiful kick!  Very close! 
Lucy looks up at her dad proudly.  The ball comes again. Nobody could miss this one.  But Lucy does. 
SAM (CONT'D) Thatta girl!  Thatta girl!  They're getting scared now! 
The game continues.  The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES, handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son: 
MR. RHODES C'mon, Conner!  On your toes!  They're all counting on you! 
Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure.  Meanwhile, down at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.  She kicks it! Hard.  Right into her team's own goal.  The crowd GROANS. 
SAM Hurray, Lucy!  You're getting the hang of it now!  You've got them scared now! 
Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and NAILS IT!  The ball goes flying.  The parents in the stand are completely baffled!  Sam is completely ecstatic! 
SAM (CONT'D) L-u-c-y!  That's our battlecry! 
The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie, Conner.  Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan reaming his son -- 
MR. RHODES The whole game was right in front of your nose!  I leave work early to watch you blow the whole game!? 
Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away. Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 
A child's hand double jumps across a checker board. 
CONNER (O.S.) Ha! 
Lucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner. Two carrots cut into ten pieces. Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces each. 
CONNER (CONT'D) What's wrong with your father?  Why's he acting like a retard? 
LUCY He is. 
Their hands graze against each other on the check board - he pulls his hand away. 
CONNER Are you? 
LUCY No. 
CONNER Are you sure? 
LUCY Yeah. 
CONNER How do you know? 
LUCY He told me. 
CONNER But he's a retard. 
LUCY Yeah well it takes one to know one! 
He crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the first time a bit uneasily.

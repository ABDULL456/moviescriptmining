{"train": "DJANGO UNCHAINED \nWritten by \nQuentin Tarantino \nI \nEXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY \nAs the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run, by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK. \nThe location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID, BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called, The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY). \nOne of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small \"r\" burned into his cheek (\"r\" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings. \nAs the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the skin off ankles. \nAS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the Greenville Auction. \nDJANGO Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block. \nHe fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance, he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he hears the Auctioneer yell; \"Sold.\" Then she's taken away to whereabouts unknown, never to be seen again. \nAs the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers; \nDJANGO in the SLAVE PEN with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed for forty. \nWHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the structure. \nThe ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front of the auction block. \nDJANGO is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on the block. A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side. \nDJANGO takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly. \nIt's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to buy Niggers, who look up to him. His heart fills with poison. \nBACK TO DJANGO walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating. \nTHE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE end. \n/--\" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT \nIt's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward. It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang. It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves, two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison, resemble a human locomotive. The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white fur collars. \nWHEN... .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their rifles for possible trouble. \nA BLACK HORSE carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries. \nTHE RIDER appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler hat on his head. \nDICKY SPECK Who's that stumblin around in the dark? State your business, or prepare to get winged! \nTHE RIDER Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler. The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his face. He speaks with a slight German accent. \nTHE RIDER (to the Slavers) Good cold evening gentlemen. (to the shivering Slaves) Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the'name of The Speck Brothers. Might that be you? \nACE SPECK Who wants to. know? \nTHE RIDER I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this is my horse, Fritz. Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught him. \nDICKY SPECK You a doctor? Dr.SCHULTZ Affirmative. \nDICKY SPECK What kinda doctor? Dr.SCHULTZ Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction? \nACE SPECK So what? \nLE Dr.SCHULTZ So, I wish to parley with you. \nACE SPECK Speak English! Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a second language. Amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire. (to the slaves) Hello you poor devils. Is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation? Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a VOICE rings out; \nDJANGO I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta tell ya. As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a western town. They pass by a sign that says; \"WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY, \nTEXAS\" \n/Z Dr.SCHULTZ Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it well. Good job Django, well done. \nEXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a million other visitors. Dr.SCHULTZ What's everybody staring at? \nDJANGO They never seen a nigger on a horse before. Dr.SCHULTZ What's this bizarre obsession they have with. you not riding horses? \nDJANGO You askin' me? Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions. Dr.SCHULTZ So what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in? As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; \"What\"? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do, and what you can't do, and if you can't do it, why can't you do it? Like for instance, what if we were to walk in this saloon here, sit down at a table, order a drink, and drink it? Would the authorities frown on that? \nDJANGO Hell yeah, they gonna frown. Dr.SCHULTZ What part would they find the most offensive? \nDJANGO All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon. I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair, at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink. And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink, with no white man, in public. Dr.SCHULTZ So if you and I did those things, that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff? \nDJANGO You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff. The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance. Dr.SCHULTZ Well in that case Django, after you. \nDJANGO Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there. Dr.SCHULTZ Django you're going to have to learn to trust me, and as the man said; \"There's no time like the,present.\" He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment. \nINT - SALOON - MORNING The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the saloon. The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned away from the two patrons. Dr.SCHULTZ Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two weary travelers. \nSALOON KEEPER It',s still pretty early, we won't be open for about a hour. But by then we'll be servin' breakfast - He turns around and sees them. \nSALOON KEEPER Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy, get that nigger outta here. \nIT \nTIME CUT \nEXT - SALOON - MORNING It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out of the bar to get the Sheriff. When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls; Dr.SCHULTZ Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction, on what I assume is a simple county ordinance, and that would fall under the domain of the Sheriff. The Saloon Keeper runs away. The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon. Dr.SCHULTZ It looks like we must act as our own bartender. The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks; \nDJANGO What kinda dentist are you? This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's. Dr.SCHULTZ I haven't practiced dentistry in five years - Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure it's a disaster - But these days I practice a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter. This gets no reaction from Django. Dr.SCHULTZ Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is? The Black Man shakes his head, no. As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer, \nHE EXPLAINS; Dr.SCHULTZ Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter, deals in corpses. \nDr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D) The state places a bounty on a man's head. I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man. After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities - and sometimes that's easier said then done. I show that corpse to the authorities - proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him - At which point, the authorities pay me the bounty. (lifting his beer) Cheers. The two men touch glasses, and take a drink. \nDJANGO What's a bounty? Dr.SCHULTZ It's like a reward. \nDJANGO You kill people and they give you a reward? Dr.SCHULTZ Certain people, yes. \nDJANGO White people? Dr.SCHULTZ Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen. \nDJANGO Bad people? Dr.SCHULTZ Badder they are, bigger the reward. Which brings me to you, and I must admit I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you. On one hand, I despise slavery. On the other hand, I need your help, and if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better. So for the time being, I'm going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit. \n(BEAT) Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty. So... I'd like the two of us to enter into an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers, however in this endeavor I'm at a slight disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha? \n1G \n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis Brittle, as Big John BURNS the \"r\" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON. \nBACK TO DJANGO \nDJANGO I know what they look like, all right. Dr.SCHULTZ Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel with me till we find them - \nDJANGO - Where we goin'? Dr.SCHULTZ I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where. That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them. You do that, I agree to give you your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother - that's seventy-five dollars... . your horse, Tony even though I've already gave him to you -- but once the final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat included. Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window. Dr.SCHULTZ And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff. \nEXT - SALOON - MORNING We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town. Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street. \nSHERIFF SHARP Okay boys, fun's over, come on out. Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch. As they do, The Sheriff says; \nSHERIFF SHARP Now why y'all wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people? You ain't got nothin' better to do, then to come into Bill Sharps town and show your ass - From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :. \n.THEN... A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp. The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound. The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the dirt. The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled. As is Django. As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out; \nPEDESTRIAN What did you jus' do to our sheriff? Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's skull, killing him dead. In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter. Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street. Dr.SCHULTZ Now you can go get the marshall. \nTIME CUT \nEXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention. \nDJANGO They could do that? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not saying they would, but they could. \nDJANGO They do that I'll kill 'em. Dr.SCHULTZ Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white man. The point being is the place,is just too dangerous for you. \nDJANGO Well I gotta go, when do I go? Dr.SCHULTZ When you get more dangerous. \nEXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that. sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's wearing explains the distress. \nZ \nDJANGO is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at Versailles. Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him. Dr.SCHULTZ Django, you have to, it's part of \"The Act\". You're playing a character. Your character is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears. Remember what I told you. During the act, you can never break character. \nCUT TO \nEXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a riderless horse, behind him and Tony. As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight. The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER \"BIG DADDY\" BENNETT, dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground. While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, \"PONY'S\". The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton. As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES, BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S). Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse. \nSPENCER BENNETT It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory. Dr.SCHULTZ This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk. \nSPENCER BENNETT I said niggers - \nZ .ate` Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Django, he's a free man, and he can ride what he pleases. \nSPENCER BENNETT Not on my.property, around my niggers he can't. Dr.SCHULTZ My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell. My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my valet, Django, and these are our horses, Fritz, and Tony. Fritz, does his head bow. This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle. Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you are a gentleman, and a business man. And it is in these capacities that we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk with you now. \nSPENCER BENNETT State your business. Dr.SCHULTZ I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals. \nSPENCER BENNETT You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals, no appointment, no nuttin'? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm afraid so. \nSPENCER BENNETT Well what if I say, I don't like you, or your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta say about that? Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man, I've been led to believe you to be, I have five thousand things I might say, that could change your mind. i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett. Spencer laughs. \nZG \nSPENCER BENNETT C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool to drink. The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django. Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor. Dr.SCHULTZ Maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds. \nSPENCER Absolutely. Betina! A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named BETINA, snaps to attention. \nBETINA Yes sir, Big Daddy? \nSPENCER \n(TO SCHULTZ) What's your Jimmies name again? Dr.SCHULTZ Django. \nSPENCER Betina sugar, take Django around the grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff. \nBETINA As you please, Big Daddy. Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner; Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a free man. He cannot be treated like a slave. Within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself. \nSPENCER Understood., Schultz. Betina? \nBETINA Yes, sir? \nSPENCER Django isn't a slave. Django is a free man. Do you understand? You're not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here, cause he ain't like any of these other niggers around here. Ya got it? \nBETINA Ya want I should treat 'em like white folks? \nSPENCER No that's not what I said. \nBETINA Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy. \nSPENCER Yes, I can see that. \n(HE THINKS) What's the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass? His mama works at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes the winda's when we have a problem? The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in; \nMAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR Oh, you mean Jerry. \nSPENCER Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry. \n(TO BETINA) You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar? \nBETINA Yes 'em, Big Daddy. \nSPENCER Well that's it then... just treat 'em like you would Jerry. \nDJANGO Go git that white man, I came here with. He slaps her ass, to hurry her up. Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him and The Brittle Brothers. \nFLASH ON A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his wife Broomhilda, a peelin'. PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back. LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot. Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped. BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his \nBULLWHIP. DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy. \nDJANGO Please Big John, she won't do it no more! She's real sorry! The WHIP RIPS her back. \nDJANGO \n(SCREAMING) Goddamit, Big John! \nLITTLE RAJ Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny. Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John Brittle with everything he has. \nBACK TO DJANGO crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train. \nFLASH ON Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the \nKNEELING DJANGO; \nBIG JOHN BRITTLE I like the way you beg, boy. \nEXT - STABLE - DAY Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen) to a dead tree stump. BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP. LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy. ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'. \nBIG JOHN BRITTLE Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know yourself it's for your own good. Niggers are clumsy. You'd break everything in goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the only known cure for nigger clumsiness is a peelin'. Little Jody begs to differ. \nBACK TO DJANGO As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the little dogs no nevermind. \nBACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back. \nBIG JOHN After this we'll see if you break eggs again. \nDJANGO turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH... \nWHEN ... .DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him; \nDJANGO John Brittle! Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French Bulldogs. LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's the same thing in the mirror. LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice. BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize. DJANGO just stares back. BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django. So does Roger. \nLITTLE RAJ Django? Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to shake his hand ... \nDJANGO Remember me? .Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART. \nBIG JOHN FACE goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his heart, at Django. \nDJANGO I like the way you die, boy. \nBig John hears it...then tips over dead. LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen. FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see it. LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground. It goes off... BANG. SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain. The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG. DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest. MORE SLAVES gather. \nDJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger. To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement. Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees Django, and the two dead bodies. Dr.SCHULTZ Who are they? \nDJANGO That's John Brittle, and that's his little brother Raj. Dr.SCHULTZ Where's Ellis? \nDJANGO He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now. Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying to make an escape. \nSCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel. Dr.SCHULTZ Are you sure that's him? Ellis gets further away... \nDJANGO Yes! Dr.SCHULTZ Are you positive? Ellis gets further away... \nDJANGO I dunno. Dr.SCHULTZ You don't know if you're positive? Ellis gets further away... \nDJANGO I don't know what, positive,'means. Dr.SCHULTZ It means you're sure. \nDJANGO Yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, what? \nDJANGO Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle. \nBAM! The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse. The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush. RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON. The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention. Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS, and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob. The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands. Django does the same with his pistol. Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB. Dr.SCHULTZ Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm! \nSPENCER Just who the hell are you two jokers? \nDr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. SCHULTZ I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America. The man to my left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy. In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and Roger Brittle -- \nDjango still hesitates. Dr.SCHULTZ Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill. Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants. Dr.SCHULTZ Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson. \nDJANGO \n(READING) \"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members. Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and \nCRAZY CRAIG KOONS.\" Dr.SCHULTZ Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two, they would never of printed that. \n(REFERRING TO \nTHE HANDBILL) But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didn't mind killing people to do it. You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do. I kill people, and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse is worth seven thousand dollars. Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him. Django SHOOTS. The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down. The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt. Dr.SCHULTZ You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill. \nDJANGO Why? Dr.SCHULTZ It's good luck. You always keep the handbill of your first bounty. They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body, leading the extra body horse behind them. \nAs they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies. Dr.SCHULTZ See, they're having a tender little father son moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one they've ever had. \nEXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT It's now full on snowy winter in the hills. Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's heart would be. He DRAWS... Shoots the bottle heart! He DRAWS ... Shoots the left coal eye. He DRAWS ... Shoots the right coal eye. He DRAWS... Shoots the carrot nose. Dr.Schultz comes up behind him. Dr.SCHULTZ I think it's safe to say you're faster then the snowman. \nEXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT \nFROM ABOVE. \nDJANGO AND SCHULTZ up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them. \nEXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN with five corpses. \nThe local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them. \nSHERIFF GUS Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya, and who the hell ya got there? Dr.SCHULTZ The Wilson - Lowe Gang. \nSHERIFF GUS Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang? Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands it down to the friendly peace officer. Dr.SCHULTZ Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe. And three of their acolytes. \nSHERIFF GUS Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love 'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee. \nTNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office. They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty, \"That one\", Schultz says. Django RIPS IT off the wall. As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter. \nEXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django practices his fast draw against five men... .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ... DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then falls to the ground to get the fifth. He looks up from the ground at Schultz. \n5L As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says; Dr.SCHULTZ You're pretty confident aren't you? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ You have reason to be. He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm. All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on top of Django. \nDJANGO Still think I'm too green for Greenville? Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says; Dr.SCHULTZ Oh you're ready for Greenville. He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says; Dr.SCHULTZ Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so sure. He blows out the match... \nWE GO TO BLACK What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man. He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter. \nBLACK TITLE CARD ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala \"Rocky\" and \n\"FLASHDANCE\") \nMISSISSIPPI \nCUT TO \nEXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other. \nWe see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around. BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look. LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them along. BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street. A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING \nTHE KIDS ALONG. Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block. A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen: \nGREENVILLE \nCHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock. Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how Greenville operates. As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer. Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill. Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot. \nWE FLASH ON The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot. \nINSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.: A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo. \nJUDD Good god almighty these niggers stink! \nI F \nRUSS Niggers stink, where's the shock? (to the Slaves \nSCOTTY I ain't dueling with you! I don't want to duel! \nCALVIN CANDIE Then get out of here, get in your buggy and get out of town. \nSCOTTY Sure. Let me just get my girl. \nCALVIN CANDIE You lost that girl, fat boy. \nSECOND NOTE... \nSCOTTY Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I called you a cheat. But... please...I can't give you Broomhilda. \nCALVIN CANDIE Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta to fuckin' another one. \n(BEAT) Or pick up that gun. Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't leave. \nTHIRD NOTE... Calvin Candie SHOOTS Scotty Harmony dead. \nINT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the \nFRONT DESK CLERK.. \nCALVIN CANDLE Hello Oliver. \nFRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER) Hello Mr.Candie, good evening. \nCALVIN CANDLE Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver. Could you please inform me which room your guest Scott Harmony is staying in? \nINT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Broomhilda is asleep in bed... \nWHEN ... .Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda lies naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and backside. She hops out of bed. \nINT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs, down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door. All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS. \nEXT - GREENVILLE HOTEL - NIGHT She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking down at her. \nCALVIN CANDIE Welcome to Candyland. We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face. \nNARRATOR (VO) That was four months ago. \nCUT TO \nINT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room. The same room Django was sold in at the beginning. Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold fill the big hall. \nONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO) stands half naked on the auction block. The SELLER' (SHELBY) gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding. Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including Calvin Candie. Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES /-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing. FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW, always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below. Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him. Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the owner of Candyland. \nDJANGO Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place? Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, so you heard of it? \nDJANGO Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland. Dr.SCHULTZ Well apparently, that's where your wife is, and apparently the repellent gentleman down there is the one who owns her. \n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd` TIME CUT \n6R The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction hall. Dr.SCHULTZ How much do you know about mandingo fighting? \nDJANGO Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had a couple niggers he'd fight. Dr.SCHULTZ Can you play a mandingo expert? \nDJANGO What? Dr.SCHULTZ Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters? \nDJANGO\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 Why? Dr.SCHULTZ Because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get his attention, we better be talking about big sweaty black males. So my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game. And your character is the mandingo expert I hired to help me do it. \nDJANGO They call that \"One-Eyed Charly.\" Dr.SCHULTZ. One-Eyed Charly? \nDJANGO That's what you call it when you buy a slave expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses. He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco. Dr'. SCHULTZ Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly? \nDJANGO You know, back on the plantation, my. job wasn't historian. Dr.SCHULTZ Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly legitimate question. So, can you convincingly play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say, yes, if you can't. \nDJANGO You want me to play a black slaver? There ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black slavers are lower then head house niggers, and buddy, that's pretty fuckin low. Dr.SCHULTZ Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver. Django gets that. Dr.SCHULTZ Can you do that? \nDJANGO That, I can do. What's next? Dr.SCHULTZ To get ourselves personally invited to Candyland by Calvin Candie himself. \nCUT TO \n7S \nCALVIN CANDIE Quit stalling and answer the question. The room is quiet. Dr.SCHULTZ The awful truth? \n(PAUSE) I'm bored, and it seems like a good bit of fun. Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now. \nCALVIN CANDIE Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight goin on that's a good bit of fun_ Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight. The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one. Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches. Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it. \nCALVIN CANDIE. The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought him today. What's his name, Moguy? \nMOGUY Big Fred. \nCALVIN CANDIE The other nigger belongs to this disreputable Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi. \n(TO AMERIGO) What's your nigger's name? \nAMERIGO Luigi... .? Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight. Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender named, ROSCOE tends it. \nCALVIN CANDIE How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin' a good bit of fun? \nDJANGO You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all. \nCALVIN CANDIE How'd you two like to try the signature drink of the club? \nDr.SCHULTZ We'd love to. \nCALVIN CANDIE (yelling to the \nBARTENDER) Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and don't spare the rum. Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses. Big Fred kills Luigi. Candie and his friends cheer. \nCALVIN CANDIE Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks like you owe me ten dollars. Amerigo pays up the puny bet. Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it. Candle turns his attention to Django. \nCALVIN CANDIE What's your name, boy? Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Django. \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(TO SCHULTZ) Where'd ya dig him up? Dr.SCHULTZ A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together. \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(TO DJANGO) I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a real bright boy. \n(BEAT) I'm curious, what makes you such a mandingo expert? \nDJANGO I'm curious, what makes you so curious? Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django; \nBARTHOLOMEW What you say, boy? \n/\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder. \nCALVIN CANDIE Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle. Dr.SCHULTZ Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if you directed your line of inquiry to me. \nCALVIN CANDIE Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you. Dr.SCHULTZ With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I didn't seek you out for your advice. I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price. I was'under the impression when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business. \nCALVIN CANDIE No we weren't talking business yet. We were discussing my curiosity. Now according to Moguy here, if I do business with you... \n(POINTING TO \nSCHULTZ) , .I'm doin' business with both of y'all. \n(POINTING TO \nDJANGO) He does the eyeballin', you the billfold? Dr.SCHULTZ Well you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yes. None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is. Candie turns his attention back to Django. \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(TO DJANGO) So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you looked over my African flesh, and were none too impressed. \nFLASH ON we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS.. \nBACK TO CLEO CLUB \nRODNEY No sir. \nDJANGO Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me! Flash that bad look at me again, I'll give ya reason not to like me! As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but not without difficulty. Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him. Dr.SCHULTZ How do you like this side of the slave trade? \nDJANGO Not so much. Dr.SCHULTZ Prefer the other side? \nDJANGO I didn't say that. \nDr.SCHULTZ I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland. \nDJANGO Are you sure it's her? Dr.SCHULTZ He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and speaks German. Now while it's not wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe. \nDJANGO Did you offer to buy her? Dr.SCHULTZ I opened the door to my possible interest. But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be so interested. \nSUDDENLY ... Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them... \nCALVIN CANDLE Am I intruding? Dr.SCHULTZ Of course not. \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(APPRAISING THE \nTWO MEN) I swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish. Dr.SCHULTZ You'd be surprised what a good conversationalist Django is. \nCALVIN CANDIE Oh by now, I don't think that would surprise meat all. Candie gives Django a creepy smile. Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance. Dr.SCHULTZ When do we reach your property? \nCALVIN CANDLE You been on it. I own the whole sixty miles 'fore we get to Candyland. Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs. \nCALVIN CANDIE Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. \n(YELLING BEHIND him at Billy) Billy Crash, git up here! Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth, rides up. \nBILLY CRASH Yeah, Boss? \nCALVIN CANDIE Find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack! \nBILLY CRASH Right away, Boss. Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse. \nCALVIN CANDIE You know, confidentially, just 'tween us girls, worse things about this business, ain't the slaves. It's all the white trash ya gotta deal with. Like these peckawoods we got riding with us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but it's just a thin membrane separate 'em. And don't think they don't know it either. It's about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em. Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass, other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain boys I use as trackers for the runaways, they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was a pain in the ass, but with a lot of patience, that German lady taught Hildi how to speak German. Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, emotions betray nothing. \nPTE \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(CON'T) Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other hand, they can barely speak English. I can't understand a damn word most of 'em say. You could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run, they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog. Billy Crash comes riding back. \nCALVIN CANDIE What the hell's goin on? \nBILLY CRASH They got 'em a runaway. \nCALVIN CANDIE Who? \nCUT TO \nEXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation. A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the bunkhouse. The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty long haired lot. Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons, or just from the same hollow. Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of \nMARSHA. A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt, surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him. One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites, not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar patch. \nO V5 The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe. Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three old mandingos who know D'Artagnan. \nCALVIN CANDIE Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do a fool thing like run off? \nD'ARTAGNAN I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie. \nCALVIN CANDIE Oh yes you can. You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher, shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear myself think! Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha; Mr.STONESIPHER Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up! Marsha, Marsha, hush up! (to the other \nTRACKERS) Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger, he's just makin' em hungry. The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man. \nCALVIN CANDIE How long was he loose? Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice. Mr.STONESIPHER A.night. Day. Half the other night. \nCALVIN CANDIE How far he git off property? Mr.STONESIPHER Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer, considering that limp he got. \nDJANGO'S VOICE (OS) Hey Snowball. \n: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony. \nDJANGO If you wanna know who I am, or the name of my horse, you ask me. \nSTEPHEN Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud. \nCALVIN CANDIE Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it funny. Django's a Freeman. Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django. \nSTEPHEN This nigger, here? \nCALVIN CANDIE That nigger there. Let me at least introduce the two of. you. Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen. Stephen, this is Django. You two should hate each other. Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at Candyland. \nSTEPHEN Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain? \nCALVIN CANDIE Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz are customers, and they are our guests Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard... .are to show them every hospitality. Do you understand that? \nSTEPHEN I don't know why I gotta - \nCALVIN CANDIE You don't hafta know why, do you understand? \nSTEPHEN Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine. \nCALVIN CANDIE Good. They're spending the night. Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready. \nSTEPHEN \n(POINTING AT \nDJANGO) He's gonna stay in the Big House? \nCALVIN CANDIE Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different. \nSTEPHEN \n(INCREDULOUS) In the Big House? \nCALVIN CANDIE You gotta problem with that? \nSTEPHEN I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta problem with burin' the bed, the sheets, and the pillow cases once this black ass motherfuckers gone! \nCALVIN CANDIE That's my problem, they're mine to burn. Your problem, right now, is making a good impression. And I want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready. The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says; \nSTEPHEN Yes sir, Monsieur Candie. Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself. Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up to her brother on his horse. \nCALVIN CANDIE Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may I present to you, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly. Lara Lee does a southern lady bow. Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner. Dr.SCHULTZ I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd Django, (Django tips his hat) and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony. Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow. \nDr.SCHULTZ And it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose. \nLARA LEE Well aren't you the charming gentlemen. You're not from around here, are you? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually I'm from a far off land, Dusseldorf, to be exact. \nCALVIN CANDIE These two are in the market for a fightin' nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down, show 'em my stock. \nLARA LEE We'll all have dinner tonight, right? \nCALVIN CANDIE Half the reason I invited them. I thought you'd find.them as intriguing as I do little sister. Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles. All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits. As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to Dr.Schultz and Django, and says; \nCALVIN CANDIE You know since I started fightin' niggers about eleven years ago, it's been a new lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here now is the man responsible for all my success. Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust. Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and Schultz. \nCALVIN CANDIE Howdy Ace. \n(TO SCHULTZ \nAND DJANGO) This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, Ace Woody. \nPointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody. \nCALVIN CANDIE And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells Cody. \n(TO ACE) Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and Django Freeman, they're big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I brought 'em out here so you could give 'em a little display of our African flesh. Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them. \nFRED) This one over here? \nCALVIN CANDIE Yes. \nACE WOODY \n(TO FRED) You Fred? A very scared Fred answers. \nBIG FRED Yes, sir. \nACE WOODY Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody, I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in a kurfuffle? \nCALVIN CANDIE I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers last night. \n'ACE WOODY How is of Amerigo? \nCALVIN CANDIE His nigger lost. \nACE WOODY \n(TO FRED) Really? You won? \nBIG FRED Yes, sir. \nACE WOODY Wup'ed his ass? \nCALVIN CANDIE Beat 'em to death. Smiling impressively at Big Fred. \nACE WOODY \n(TO FRED) Really? \nCALVIN CANDIE He did have fifteen pounds on 'em, but still, he still beat his ass to death. \nACE WOODY \n(TO FRED) You did? \nBIG FRED) Yes, sir. \nACE WOODY Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya? \nBIG FRED Yes, sir. Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back. Candie acts out mock frustration. The remaining three mandingos jump a mile. \nCALVIN CANDIE Now why did you do that? \nACE WOODY He won his last fight last night. Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos \nACE WOODY \n(TO MANDINGOS) Those of you with exceptional ability will find it ain't so bad here. Those of you who don't possess exceptional ability, will wish you did. Ace looks up to Cody on his horse. \nACE WOODY Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em in the head. \n(TO MANDINGOS) Welcome to Candyland, boys! Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena. Candie leans over to Schultz and says; \nCALVIN CANDLE We only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy. But those two tend to be lucky. Ace Woody hops back up on his horse. \nCALVIN CANDIE You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think that you don't trust my judgement? Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says; \nACE WOODY Oh you know I always trust your judgement, Boss Candie...eventually. He rides off. Stephen limps back to the action. \nCALVIN CANDIE Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready? \nSTEPHEN All ready for your guest and his nigger. Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration. \nCALVIN CANDIE Stephen, you're incorrigible. \n(TO SCHULTZ \nAND DJANGO) Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your rooms. \nREVENGE MUSIC PLAYS as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE. Stephen breaks the mood. \nSTEPHEN \n(TO DJANGO) You comin', or you wanna sleep in that little box? Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House. \nINT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the room next door, opens the door, and leads him in. \nINT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it. \nSTEPHEN This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn nice too. Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out. Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen rattles on in the background. \nSTEPHEN Feel free to touch anything you want, cause we burnin' all this shit once you gone. I'll have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready. Django sits down on the bed. Stephen turns to leave. \nDJANGO Not so fast. \nSTEPHEN I got more important things to do then jaw with you. \nDJANGO Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots. Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around. \nDJANGO This tiny bell on this little table... .is this for you? I ring this, you do fer me? \nSTEPHEN Me or somebody. Django reaches over and picks up the bell. (a soft) DING-A-LING \nSTEPHEN \n(UNAMUSED) What 'cha want? \nDJANGO I want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up. Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude. \n)O' Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone. Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed. \nDJANGO Gimmie. Stephen hands him the basin full of water. Django takes it from him. Then throws the water in Stephen's face. The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man. \nDJANGO Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like that? Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor; \nDJANGO That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up. The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again. Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the floor below his knees. \nDJANGO I've known me House Niggers like you my whole life. Play your dog tricks with your Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an' then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and all the white folks think it's so cute. Meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your good side. Well this time Snowball, you gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass you wanna sling my way, before they give us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK off your ass. I will make you drop your drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of every nigga on this plantation. And after I do that, let's see you play the rooster round here. \nX07 \nSTEPHEN Calvin wouldn't. let you do it. \nDJANGO Oh that's right, he gives you first name privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me me again nigger, see what happen'. Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue. \nDJANGO That's what I thought. Now git outta\"here. With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up. Before he leaves, Django tells him;, \nDJANGO When I ring this bell, you better come a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While I'm on this property, you my nigger Snowball. Stephen leaves. Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm. A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and Schultz stands there. Dr.SCHULTZ Was that wise? Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes. \nDJANGO He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that. That's all that needs to be said. \nINT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door, after Calvin's sister raps on it. Dr.Schultz opens the door. Dr.SCHULTZ Hello ladies. \nDOG \nLARA LEE Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you, Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he speaks German. Dr.SCHULTZ \n(TO BROOMHILDA) I've been informed you do as well. \nBROOMHILDA \n(GERMAN) It would be my, pleasure to speak with you in German. Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment. Dr.SCHULTZ Astonishing. \n(IN GERMAN) Please come inside Fraulein. She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says, \"Thank You very much,\" and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed. \nINT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened, disoriented girl. He gives her a pleasant smile. Dr.SCHULTZ They call you Hildi, but your real name is Broomhilda, isn't it? \nBROOMHILDA Yes. How do you know that? Dr.SCHULTZ Stands to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name. Can I pour you a glass of water, Broomhilda? Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened girl. \nWE CUT TO DJANGO on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue to present himself. BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; Dr.SCHULTZ \nLARA LEE Hildi! Broomhilda snaps back. Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis, then issues his own appraisal; \nCALVIN CANDIE Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as long as you don't put 'em up against those two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass. \nDJANGO Maybe. The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that. \nF Dr.SCHULTZ You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight game, I do have a bit of a background in the European traveling circus. Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation. I need something more then just a big nigger. He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship. I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules. I said., and I quote; \"I would pay top dollar for the, right nigger.\" Now I'm not saying Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ... but is he right as rain ... ? Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep, then says; \nCALVIN CANDIE Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game. \n(BEAT) A nigger that can win fights. That should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern. After you have that, and you know you have that, then, you can start to implement a grande design. But since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table status - beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise, first things first. Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans. Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German.. She smiles, and says something pleasant back. \nCALVIN CANDIE I see you two gettin' on? Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin; Dr.SCHULTZ .Famously. \n(DRAMATIC PAUSE) Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear you native tongue for four years. \nCALVIN CANDIE Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston. \nEverybody at the table chuckles. Dr.SCHULTZ I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion. As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other. Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie. \nLARA LEE I don't know doctor, you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for Django. Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three, Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk. \nAND ... .STEPHEN sees it. Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook. Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser. Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen. Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit. \nCALVIN CANDIE Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished a drink in this house in twenty years. \nSTEPHEN When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes a COLD drink. Chuckle... . chuckle... \nCALVIN CANDIE Did you overhear that joke I said about me spending two weeks in Boston \nSTEPHEN \n(MOCK INDIGNANT) You don't have any idea the work I do to see food gets on the table. \nCALVIN CANDIE What does that hafta do with the price of Tea in China? \nSTEPHEN You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got nothin' better to do then listen in here to you tellin' unfunny jokes? Chuckle... . chuckle... \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(MOCK INDIGNATION) What? They laughed! \nSTEPHEN Of course they laughed, their parents raised them right. When they're a guest in somebody's house, and the master of of the house thinks he's- funny, you suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to. Chuckle... .chuckle... They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth. \nCALVIN CANDIE No it was really funny, \n(TO TABLE) wasn't it? \nSTEPHEN Now what do you expect these people to say? What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest. \n(TO TABLE) Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being polite, I understand, you mean well, but it just encourages him. Chuckle-chuckle... As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen. \nTNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her. \nSTEPHEN You know that nigger? /\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd She spins around. \nBROOMHILDA\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 Who? \nSTEPHEN Don't stall me bitch, you know who? \nBROOMHILDA At the table? I don't know him. \nSTEPHEN. You don't know him? \nBROOMHILDA No. \nSTEPHEN You wouldn't lie to me now, would you? She shakes her head, no. Stephen looks at her skeptical. \nSTEPHEN Okay, if you say so. \nBACK TO DINNER TABLE Pick it up again in mid-negotiation. \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(TO SCHULTZ) Rhubarb pie? Schultz looks at the pie and the man. Dr.SCHULTZ No. \nCALVIN CANDIE Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan. And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this. Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he examines he papers. \nCALVIN CANDIE Dumas...? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas. He wrote \"The Three Musketeers.\" I figured you must be an admirer. You named your slave after that novel's lead character. If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would of made of it? \nCALVIN CANDIE You doubt he'd approve? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best. \nCALVIN CANDIE Soft hearted Frenchy? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas is black. \nSchultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says; Dr.SCHULTZ We got it, let's go. \n(TO CANDIE) Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say, auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till I see you again, and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir, I say, goodbye. Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit. When Calvin says to the German's back; \nCALVIN CANDIE One more moment, Doc! Dr.SCHULTZ What? \nCALVIN CANDIE It's a custom here in the South, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. It implies good faith. Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not from the South. He turns to leave. \nCALVIN CANDIE You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid I must insist. This turns Schultz around. Dr.SCHULTZ Insist what...? That I shake your hand before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction. Calvin walks closer to the German doctor. \nCALVIN CANDIE You know what I think you are? Dr.SCHULTZ What you think I am? No I don't. \nCALVIN CANDLE I think you are a bad loser. Dr.SCHULTZ And I think you're an abysmal winner. \nCALVIN CANDLE Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands. Even after all this paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand. Dr.SCHULTZ If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars...? I don't think so. Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda. Dr.SCHULTZ Let's go. \nCALVIN CANDIE Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand. Cut 'er down. Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle.. .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks \nCANDLE; Dr.SCHULTZ. You really want me to shake your hand? Django gets it. \nCALVIN CANDIE I insist. \nDR -Schultz smiles. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, if you insist. Django goes to stop him... \nThe German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand... Candie offers his hand to Schultz... The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand... \nPOP! He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart. Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor. Everybody is stunned. Schultz looks to Django. Django looks back. Dr.SCHULTZ \n(TO DJANGO) I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda. \nFADE TO BLACK \nWe FADE UP FROM BLACK to see: The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down. The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor. \nINT - BARN - AFTERNOON Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn. Django begins to come to ... \nTIMMY \n(SHHH'S HIM) Act like you still sleepin'. \nDJANGO Where's Broomhilda? \nTIMMY Who? \nDJANGO Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago. They had her in The Hot Box. \nTIMMY I don't know 'bout no girl. \nDJANGO How 'bout that German white man I came here with? \nTIMMY Oh he's dead. His body's over there. Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger. Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn. Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy. \nACE WOODY Git on outta here, boy! \nDjango, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp. \nACE WOODY So y'all bounty hunters,.huh? Django thinks, \"How does he know?\" \nACE WOODY I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all. We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that line of work? Django retorts, upside down. \nSTEPHEN Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours didn't know what's what. He still thought his ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly you are, you always know the end is near 'fore the white folks. With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE. The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils. \nSTEPHEN Damn Nigger, you smell good. He walks behind Django with the poker. \nSTEPHEN You know, when you was sittin' on that feather bed in the quest room in the Big House - After you slapped my ass to the floor You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT. Remember that, Bright Boy? He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE buttocks. Django SCREAMS! Stephen LAUGHS. Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on the floor by the hanging man. \nSTEPHEN You leavin', that's what you can take with you. Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to him, he begins fondling Django's genitals. \nI31 \nSTEPHEN Now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours. Seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life, was comin' up with different ways to kill your ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say; \"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey, got it worse then that.\" Then they're, \"Let's whip 'em to death,\" \"Throw 'em to the mandingos,\" \"Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs.\" And then I say, \"What's so special 'bout that? We do that shit all the time. Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that.\" He stops massaging Django's balls. \nSTEPHEN So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin' your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company. And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, hence forth, till the day you die, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day, every day, turning big rocks into little rocks. And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be 'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more. Like them three y'all came back with. For them big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last 'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you, I give two or three. Stephen turns to leave. \nDJANGO Where's Broomhilda? \nSTEPHEN She's all right for now. Miss Lara soft hearted on 'er. She gave her to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er. Now Billy Crash might not look or smell too good, but ain't nobody gonna bother her. Stephen limps away. \nCUT TO \nEXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a 2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine. The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have stopped the caravan and are having a powwow. \nROY It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot the big boss. Let's git the niggers and git out. The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles. and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth. The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them. \nFLOYD You blacks line up. They do. \nFLOYD What's your names? \nCHESTER Chester. \nCHICKEN CHARLY Chicken Charly. \nRODNEY Rodney. \nFLOYD I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano. \n(POINTING AT \nCHESTER'S BUNDLE) What's that? \nCHESTER It's my stuff. \nFLOYD Throw it in the dirt. \nAll three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt. \nFLOYD (to Chicken Charly) You won't be doin' much smokin' mate. (to all three) You are now the property of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage. This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them. Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace Woody call out; \nACE WOODY (OS) Hold on, we got another hammer swinger for ya. Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope. \nROY We can't use that skinny bastard. \nACE WOODY We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take punishment niggers from time to time. \nROY No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment. \nACE WOODY Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his confidence, I'm sure I don't know why. \nROY Look, no one tole' me 'bout - \nACE WOODY - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss Candie killed. And we want his ass punished. Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey how and why you fucked up our nice little business relationship, take this nigger and hush up about it! \nROY Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage. \n\"H Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too. Django stops Ace Woody. \nDJANGO Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there with them. They'll kill me. What about all that -turning big rocks into little rocks- shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was the idea ain't it? You put me in there with them big ass garboons they kill me on the way. I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea, but I didn't think that was the idea. Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd. \nACE WOODY He can't go in there with them. \nFLOYD Why not? \nDJANGO Back at that plantation Candyland, there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode right past it. \nJANO You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits. \nDJANGO That's what's nice about this fortune, it's not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta earn it. \nJANO If you got something to say, say it. \nDJANGO The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang. \nJANO Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall? \nDJANGO Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang. There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices, Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons. And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back there at Candyland...laughin their ass off... cause they just got away with murder. \n(BEAT) But it don't hafta be that way. You and your mates could get that money. \nJANO Who pays the money? \nDJANGO The Court. \nJANO The Court? \nDJANGO The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by the way, the court don't give a damn about how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the back, from up on a hill, in the back of the head, in their sleep - don't matter. \n(CON'T) \nDJANGO \n(CON'T) Court doesn't care how you do it, just as long as you do it. \nJANO They.pay us to kill 'em? \nDJANGO No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the corpse. Get it? \nJANO I think so... . what did these jokers do again? \nDJANGO Killed innocent people in a stagecoach robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket. Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck. He hands it to Jano. \nJANO What's this? \nDJANGO I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang. Jano looks at the handbill. \nDJANGO Whatsamatter, can't you read? \nJANO I can read, I just don't have my glasses. I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run. \nDJANGO What about that cowboy fella in the lead? \nJANO Roy? \nDJANGO Can Roy read? \nJANO Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin read. I just don't got my glasses. \nCUT TO \nEXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to the side of the road. \nIN THE CAGE Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of what they're watching. What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a piece of paper. \nINSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks. \nDJANGO I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter. Yesterday as a free man, I rode into Candyland on a horse with my white German partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am. \n(TO ROY) You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you know I'm not suppose to be on this trip. But those four men, are still back there. They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs. And the last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back and gittin it. Django is damn convincing. \nROY What's your deal? You tell us who they are and we let ya go? \nDJANGO I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred, and I'll point 'em out to you. He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs one little push. \n1Q7 \nROY We'll give you that pack horse. \nDJANGO What's them saddle bags filled with? \nFLOYD Dynamite. \n!so \nDJANGO I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back! \nROY \n(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE) Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage. Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door, and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this at all. Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The Cage Wagon. Django moves to his new pack horse, and says; \nDJANGO Where's my pistol? \nROY Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give 'em your gun and your belt. Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it. About the pistol, Floyd tells Django; \nFLOYD Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights fixed last month, it's perfect. Django holding the gunbelt in his hand. \nDJANGO That's good to know. Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE in the chest... Roy turns around... Django takes the gun out of the holster... . BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass dead. Jano goes for the gun on his hip. Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!! \nJano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS... The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass... The CAGE WAGON Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in the air, obscuring all visibility... \nTHEN ... A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away, REVEALING in bright color focus... .DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of Jano. He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist. He locks eyes with the three men in the cage.. He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast, and climbs aboard him bareback. He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him. Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and horses bring the best out of Django. From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men... \n.THEN... Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the cage door. He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says; \nDJANGO Throw up that dynamite. Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on his Horse. Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland. The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away. \"Who was that nigger?\" \nCUT TO \nl.rz A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on 'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard. A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession. Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers, Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE. The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress, wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora) crying at her side. \nCORA The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur Candie think it real nice. \nLARA LEE Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora. \nWE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian. \nEXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack -Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share. The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse. \nINT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, \"NIGGER EARS\" (yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear. Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making. \nEXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on to the ground. \nIS3 \nINT - DOG KENNEL - SUNSET The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her head... \nSHIRTLESS DJANGO moves quietly through the woods. \nMARSHA rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three PALS continue to lay out. \nDJANGO BY A TREE he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way. \nMARSHA \nBARK! The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert. Django disappears. \nINT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET They hear the barking inside. Mr.STONESIPHER Jake! Jake building his birdhouse. \nJAKE Yeah? Mr.STONESIPHER Check on Marsha. Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs). \nEXT - TRACKER SHACK As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT. \nJAKE opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts... \nDJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE... \nJAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE. \nBROOMHILDA I can't help it! I'm really sad! He hops off her and yells at her. \nBILLY CRASH Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad for niggers! Git use to it! \n(CALMING DOWN) Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster from way back. But you know I've always been sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass. So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit. You calm down. He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone. WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for Django, she cries for herself... \n.THEN... She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED \"Ooomph\" SOUND. And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground. Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door. \nCU BROOMHILDA Her face, stained with tears, watches the door. A soft \"Knock Knock\" on the door. \nBROOMHILDA \n(SOFTLY) Yes? The VOICE on the other side of the door, says; \nDJANGO'S VOICE (OS) Hey Little Trouble Maker. \nShe hops out of bed, and throws open the door... \nTHERE HE IS, she runs into his arms. EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin. The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher. The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to them. A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the hill back to the big house. \nEXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers. \nDJANGO Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers. No matter what happens to me, hold on to these and get out of the south. \nBROOMHILDA What's gonna happen to you? \nDJANGO Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey, I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me around the side of the big house. \nBROOMHILDA But what about you - \nDJANGO - Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with Timmy and the horses, by the big house. He sends her on her way. Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house. \nEXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of: LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress. CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand. STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress Miss Lara, holding her other hand. ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself. LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself. BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with his hat, walks alone. BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together. and finally, SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos, wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew.. This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral drinks. They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front door. Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House. The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking their way. The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT moves closer towards the front of The Big House... \nWHEN ... The front of The Big House \nEXPLODES! knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses. BROOMHILDA and TIMMY can't believe their eyes. \nI6 I \nWOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER hang in the air. The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned. As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust. The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain. CUE cool MUSIC. STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints. ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints. BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint. In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them. ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE. MOGUY sees the.FIGURE. CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it. The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST. ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun around his waist. Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand... .it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace. ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun. The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO \nOUTFIT. STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's standing there. He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by the gun on his hip. The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of Wonder, Fear, and Hate. \nICZ \nWE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA as she watches this. As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him. The black man in the cool green jacket says; \nDJANGO I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody? You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right? \nACE WOODY I guess I shoulda'. \nDJANGO Yes you should of. He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass. \nDJANGO Everybody stand up! It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly. Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred. \nTHEN... He tosses the rifle away. Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a \nSHOWDOWN STANCE. EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions. Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY. DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps at the ten people, and says; \nDJANGO All black folks, take ten steps away from the white folks. DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him. \nDJANGO Not you Stephen. You're right where you belong. \nThe Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight. LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her. CORA is \"I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger.\" DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of his pocket. \nDJANGO \n(TO STEPHEN) Let's see if you can handle this as well as you can my nuts? He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun. \nDJANGO \n", "test1_input": "O.B. But Willards riding off. \nSPENCER Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill. And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em. \nRANDY Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off? Robert takes off his bag, and says; \nROBERT I think we all think the bags was a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they could of been done better. So how 'bout, no bags this time, but next time, we do the bags right, and then we go full regalia. Everyone takes off their bag. \nSPENCER Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags! \nYO \nTERRY But nobody can see. \nSPENCER So? \nTERRY So, it would be nice to see. \nSPENCER Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you can't see, so what? All that matters is can the fuckin horse see! That's a raid. Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well. \nEXT - LAKE - NIGHT The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see, everybody and everybody's horse is. confused. \nWE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS: \"Where are they, I can't see\" - \"They tricked us\" - \"Did somebody fall\" \"Where the hell are they\" \"Y'all, Redfish fell off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad.\" Then amongst the confusion... \nWE SNAP ZOOM TO \nA BIG TREE on the other side of the lake Then quickly cut into The Tree. Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye. \nSCOPE SIGHT POV The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it. \nTWO SHOT Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree. Dr.SCHULTZ Auf wiedersehen. \nL, He fires. The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart. Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles. Dr.SCHULTZ Let 'em have it! \nDJANGO I can't see nothin'. Dr.SCHULTZ Just fire into the smoke. The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire. \nINSIDE OF THE SMOKE pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic. Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like dogs. \nSPENCER BENNETT on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life... \nSCOPE SIGHT POV We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs. \nDJANGO scope sight rifle up to his eye. Schultz next to him, says; Dr.SCHULTZ He's getting away. \nDJANGO I got 'em. \nSPENCER'S HORSE his hooves race and rip up the grass. \nSPENCER riding for his life... \nDJANGO scope sight rifle up to his eye. \nDr.SCHULTZ He's getting out of range. \nDJANGO I got 'em. INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger. \nSPENCER BENNETT we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of what sounds like an incoming missle. \nSPENCER BENNETT we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet, RIPS THROUGH his CHEST. \nDJANGO \nDJANGO I got 'em. \nSPENCER BENNETT falls from his horse, dead. \nDJANGO scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to Dr.Schultz. Dr.SCHULTZ Like that, huh? Referring to the scope sight rifle; \nDJANGO I like. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, I think while they take this opportunity to lick their wounds, we should take this opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee. They hop out of the tree. \nMONTAGE Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his first initial \"D\" etched into it. The men go to different stores to purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django, with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket, Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat. He looks a. bit like Elvis in \"Flaming Star\" and a Little Joe Cartwright on \"Bonanza\". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as his winter coat. \n", "test1_true": "DJANGO She's my wife, it's my job to look after her. If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out where she went, then I gotta go. Now you were sayin' where I gotta go first? Dr.SCHULTZ There'should be some sort of records office. You know when she was sold, you know where she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and you know her name ... . what is her name? \nDJANGO Broomhilda. Schultz reacts. Dr.SCHULTZ Broomhilda? Django.nods his head yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Were her owners German? Now Django reacts, \"How did he know that? \nDJANGO Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can speak a little German too. Dr.SCHULTZ Your wife? \nDJANGO Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to talk German with. Dr.SCHULTZ So let me get this straight, your slave wife speaks German, and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft...? \nDJANGO Yep. Mouthful, huh? Dr.SCHULTZ To say the least. (stopping the horse) This looks like a very pretty place to have our picnic. What'd ya say, here? \nTIME CUT \nEXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out. Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a cup of tea. \nDJANGO How did you know Broomhilda's first masters were German? Dr.SCHULTZ Broomhilda is a German name. If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German. \nDJANGO Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda? Dr.SCHULTZ No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of all the German legends. \nDJANGO Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes there is. \nDJANGO Do you know it? Dr.SCHULTZ Every German knows that story. Would you like me to tell you? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods. Anyway, her father is really mad at her. \nDJANGO What she do.? \nDr.SCHULTZ I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys him in some way. So at first he's just going to obliterate her - \nDJANGO Obliterate... . what does that mean? Dr.SCHULTZ Like blow up. He pantomimes a explosion. \nDJANGO Phew, that's pretty mad. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a little time, he calms down a bit. He's still mad at her. He still wants to punish her. Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain. \nDJANGO Broomhilda's on a mountain? Dr.SCHULTZ It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain. And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire. And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero arises brave enough to save her. \nDJANGO Does a fella arise? From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he wasn't aware of when the conversation started. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella named, Sigfried. \nDJANGO Does Sigfried save her? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so. Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because he's not afraid.of him. \nDr.SCHULTZ (CON'T) He walks through hellfire because Broomhilda's worth. it. After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass as they nibble on their sandwiches. \nDJANGO I know how he feels. Dr.SCHULTZ I think I'm just starting to realize that. He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he thinks about what he's going to say next. Dr.SCHULTZ Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscious. Let me ask you a question, how do you like the bounty hunting business? \nDJANGO Kill white folks, and they pay ya? What's not to like? Dr.SCHULTZ I hafta admit, we make a good team. \nDJANGO But I'thought you were mad at me for killin' Big John and Rodger? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous. But normally, that's a good thing. How'd you like to partner up for the winter? \nDJANGO What'd ya mean partner up? Dr.SCHULTZ You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece. With one man, anything over three men is a risk. But with a partner? Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel. A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills for the winter. \nDJANGO You makin' another agreement? \nW7 Dr.SCHULTZ Yes. You work with me through the winter, till the snow melts. I give you a third of my bounties. And while we're together, I'll teach you a few things you're going to need to know. \nDJANGO Can you teach me how to make Tony do that head bow thing that Fritz can do? Dr.SCHULTZ That among other things. We make some money this winter, when the snow melts, I'll take you to Greenville myself, and we'll find where they sent your wife. I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal? No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So understandably, he's a little suspicious. \nDJANGO Why you care what happens to me? Why you care if I find my wife? Dr.SCHULTZ Well frankly, I've never given anybody their freedom before. And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're just not ready to go off on your own, it's that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt. Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,. it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda. Django accepts that response. What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes. \nWE SEE A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip. By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going to be good at this. \nEXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse. \nY, 8 \nDOWN BELOW WE SEE A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON helping him by leading the horse forward. On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says; Dr.SCHULTZ Keep down or he'll see you. \nDJANGO Who that farmer? Who cares? Dr.SCHULTZ Well since we came here to kill 'em, he just might. \nDJANGO What? The little man pushin' that plow? Dr.SCHULTZ That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall. \nDJANGO Smitty Bacall is a farmer? Dr.SCHULTZ No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber who's hiding out as a farmer, because there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head. He hands Django the scope rifle case. Dr.SCHULTZ And he's all yours my boy. DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye. \nSCOPE SIGHT POV: on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse and his son. Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates. Dr.SCHULTZ Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white folks for money? \nDJANGO His son's with him. Dr.SCHULTZ Good. He'll have a loved one with him. Maybe even share a last word. That's better then most get, and a damn. sight better then he deserves. \n", "test2_input": "INT - KITCHEN - DAY Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her; Mrs.HARMONY I want to have a word with you, wench. You met my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool with him, they fool with him for the wrong reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him. He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em wrong, you'll deal with me. \nBROOMHILDA I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he needs is a little confidence. Mrs.HARMONY And you'll give that to him? \nBROOMHILDA I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy. Mrs.HARMONY He is, isn't he? \nBROOMHILDA Ah-huh. The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist. \nNARRATOR (VO) Basically The Harmony's bought a slave bride for young master Scotty that day. And the two kids had a nice time playing house for awhile. We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in the daytime.. At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together. At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep, Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS. \nNARRATOR (VO) As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if no visitors were about, Broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table. We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy. \nNARRATOR.(VO) And pretty soon she was adopted into a member of the family. Mrs.Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together. The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard. After dinner, Mrs.Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano. Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook. \nNARRATOR (VO) Scotty was never happier. Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour. Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him through it, making him feel loved and secure. \nNARRATOR (VO) After three months of this bliss, Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for a romantic weekend in Greenville. \nSCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress, complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol. Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best described as plantation pimp daddy. \n6O \nNARRATOR (VO) White masters would take their pretty Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing how bad the other slaves had it, always made the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege position, (just in case they'd forgot). \nBROOMHILDA holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too. \nINT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel lobby, and rent a room at the front desk. \nINSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the registry book that indicates darkee female companion. \nINT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets. \nNARRATOR (VO) And two, there was a sliver of society that ran through Greenville at night that catered to white masters who were infected with a condition that was normally referred to as, \"Nigger love.\" At night the streets, the bars, bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich white masters showing off their pretty Pony's. \nEXT - CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT An establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into private club called, The Cleopatra Club. \nNARRATOR (VO) But the crown jewel of all this interracial frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra Club. \nINSERT: GOLD PLAQUE with the name, THE CLEOPATRA CLUB on it, next to it is a profile of Nefertiti. \nINT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean white men and black women). Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room. We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE, sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda. \nSCOTTY I gotta tell you Broomhilda - I don't care if I go to. hell for this - I love you. And if loving you means I go to hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil. That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his. \nNARRATOR (VO) Then... speak of the devil and the devil appears. \nCALVIN CANDIE appears at their table. \nCALVIN CANDIE Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like to welcome an attractive couple'like yourselves to my favorite place on earth. Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin. \nSCOTTY Thank you so much, it's a great honor. We love it here. Pointing at a empty chair. \nCALVIN CANDIE May I join you?- \nSCOTTY Please, by all means. Calvin sits down. Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack. Scotty, as per usual, is clueless. \nCALVIN CANDIE How long have you been a member? \nSCOTTY We just joined this weekend. \nCALVIN CANDIE Well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage. Some may consider the dues excessive, but they're necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle we've all become accustomed to. \nSCOTTY Well said, and money well spent. He squeezes Broomhilda's hand. Candie sees this. \nCALVIN CANDIE It would be.my pleasure, your first weekend at the club, to join me and my friends at my table. Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided. But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie. She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off with a, \"Don't be silly.\" We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they join the party. Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress is a little more revealing then the others. They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way. We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel. \nNARRATOR (VO) After excusing herself, she walked across the street to her hotel room. She got her white dress dirty in the mud, but she didn't care, the night was ruined anyway. Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her. She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time. She's gonna scrape every pimple. \n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends. \nNARRATOR (VO) Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly card game. As the game wore on, it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight. Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers something in his ear. \n", "test2_true": "(TO SHEBA) Really? \n(TO SCOTTY) You know what Sheba just tole me? Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says; \nSCOTTY What? \nCANDIE She says she thinks you're cute. \nSCOTTY Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're beautiful. Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear. \nCANDIE Sheba says she'd like to give you a little lip. Want some lip? Scotty, is a little surprised. \nSCOTTY Well, she's your Pony...I mean... \nCANDIE Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar. Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to Calvin's side of the table. The game continues. \nG \nCANDIE Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out brazen me in my own club, and I won't have it. If you're really holding cards, time to pony up. I raise you five hundred. Candie throws in his chips. \nSCOTTY. I see your five hundred... (throws in chips) .and raise you four hundred more. (tosses his last chips) Call. This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night. \nCALVIN CANDIE Not so fast, boy. \n(BEAT) Pot ain't fat enough yet. \nSCOTTY I'm all in. \nCALVIN CANDIE Ain't that too bad. Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his pot, especially with him holding an inside straight. \nSCOTTY I would think a southern gentleman of such renown as yourself, wouldn't have to resort to buying a pot in his own club. Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot. \nCALVIN CANDIE One final raise. Scotty takes the piece of paper, \"What's this?\" \nCALVIN CANDIE It's Sheba's bill of sale. \nSCOTTY What? I don't want her. Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that. \nCALVIN CANDIE You sure didn't look like you didn't want her. More laughter. \nCALVIN CANDIE In Greenville slaves are currency. And Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars. I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or fold? \nSCOTTY I'm all out of money. \nCALVIN CANDIE But we ain't playin' for money no more.. We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal you got. \nSCOTTY I can't bet Broomhilda. \nCALVIN CANDIE In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper and a pencil. Somebody does. \nCALVIN CANDIE Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards. Scotty makes a pressured decision. He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for Broomhilda. \nSCOTTY Let me see your cards! Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH. What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks. \nSCOTTY You cheated me. After Scotty uses the \"C\" word, everybody quiets down. \nCALVIN CANDIE What did you just call me? \nSCOTTY I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch, cause that's what you are! Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty. Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front himself . \nEverybody in The Cleo Club quiets down. \nCALVIN CANDIE Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat in my own club, as a southern gentleman, I challenge you to a duel. (to the Piano \nPLAYER) Piano player, will you hit three separate notes? \n(TO SCOTTY) On the third note, pick up the gun and try to kill me. (to Piano player) Piano player please ... This is all going too fast for slow Scotty. \nSCOTTY Wait a minute ...no! \nFIRST NOTE ... \n", "test3_input": "STEPHEN Why you cryin'? \nBROOMHILDA Because you're scarin' me. \nSTEPHEN Why am I scarin' you? \nBROOMHILDA Because you're scary. Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside. We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say; Dr.SCHULTZ (OS) .to speak German,with Hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching. Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea. \n1ZL His eyes to to Broomhilda. \nSTEPHEN You, stay in the kitchen. Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's just figured it out. \nINT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT Dr.SCHULTZ You indicated earlier you would be willing to part with Hildi? \nCALVIN CANDIE Yes siree bob I did. Dr.SCHULTZ Well in that case allow me to propose another proposition? In full \"Ole Jimmie\" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room, INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz. \nSTEPHEN - Monsieur Candie? \nCALVIN CANDIE Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz. \nSTEPHEN (to Dr.Schultz) Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin' ain't worth a damn these days. \n(TO CANDIE) Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in the kitchen. \nCALVIN CANDIE What, you mean get outta my chair? \nSTEPHEN If you could manage it. It's about dessert. \nCALVIN CANDIE What about dessert? \nSTEPHEN I would rather tell you in private. \nCALVIN CANDIE We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there? \nStephen bends down and whispers in his ear; \nSTEPHEN Meet me in the library. Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. \"Meet me in the library\" is their secret signal. \nCALVIN CANDIE Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily. Stephen exits. Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table. \nCALVIN CANDIE Well as you can see, talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required. If you'll excuse me a moment. Candie exits. \nTNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe. When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter. Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk turkey. \nCALVIN CANDIE What's the matter? \nSTEPHEN Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos. They want that girl. - \nCALVIN CANDIE What the hell you talkin' about? \nSTEPHEN They playin your ass for a fool, that's what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for that girl. \nCALVIN CANDIE What girl, Hildi? \nSTEPHEN Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other. \nCALVIN CANDIE He just bought Eskimo Joe. \nSTEPHEN Did he give you any money? \nCALVIN CANDIE Well not yet, but - \nSTEPHEN - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no how. But he was just about to buy, who he came here to buy, when I interrupted him. Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin. \nCALVIN CANDIE Where you gettin' all this? Why would they go through all that trouble, to. buy a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth five hundred dollars? \nSTEPHEN Well they're doin' it cause Django's in love with Hildi. She's probably his wife. Now why that German gives a fuck about who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know. \nCALVIN CANDIE If she's who they want, why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos? \nSTEPHEN Because you wouldn't pay no never mind to four hundred dollar. But twelve thousand got you real friendly. Calvin thinks ... .as per usual, Stephen's right. \n", "test3_true": "(LOUDER) Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we .gonna have us a Candyland tar and feathering! \nFL5 \nSTEPHEN Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy seein' something like that ... . but why don't you sit down and let's talk about this. \nCALVIN CANDLE I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin' huckster insinuate themselves at my dinner table, and play this whole goddamn plantation for a fool! \nSTEPHEN Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's discuss this. A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair. \nSTEPHEN Now look, you knew, and I knew, there was something up with these two. We just didn't know what. But now we do. They don't want you to know how bad they want that girl. But these ole boys have rode a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull to get this girl. They must want her mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin' changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done changed is the advantage. \n(BEAT) Now we got it. .So let's go back in there and busts these motherfucker's chops. \nINT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the kitchen door. Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon \nSEEING HIM; \nLARA LEE There you are! I was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together. Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he stares down the table at them. \nCALVIN CANDLE That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it Lara Lee? \n(CON'T) \n1Z J \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(CON'T) Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda. Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys. Would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball. That of boy knows everything to know 'bout mandingos, But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'. Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out, Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and Django. \nCALVIN CANDIE Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder? Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun pointing at them. Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand he's holding a big ugly hammer. \nCALVIN CANDIE Now lay your palms flat on the table top. They put their palms on the table. \nCALVIN CANDIE Now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off. There's been a lotta lies said around this table tonight-but that.. .you can believe. \n(BEAT) Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips? Mr.Moguy does. Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court. \nCALVIN CANDIE Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right? Dr.SCHULTZ Right. \nCALVIN CANDIE \n(YELLING TO \nSTEPHEN) Stephen! Bring out Hildi! \nIx? Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol against the side of her head. Django and Schultz react. \nCALVIN CANDIE Now it should be quite clear by now I know you're not here to buy no mandingos. Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me to know how much you want 'er. So instead, you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe horseshit. \n(TO STEPHEN) Stephen, put her in that chair. Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair. With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz silently watch Candie's next move. Candie, still holding the hammer, continues. \nCALVIN CANDIE Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed.. You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville, Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, \"For the Right Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount.\" To which, me myself said, \"What is your definition of ridiculous?\" To which you said, \"Twelve thousand dollars.\" Now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would appear that Broomhilda is, \"The Right Nigger.\" And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars. Dr.SCHULTZ I take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating. Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues. \nCALVIN CANDIE Under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda is my property. And I can do anything with my property I so desire. He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making everybody jump. \nIN \nCALVIN CANDIE And if you think my price for this nigger is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do is, take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it. Right in front of both y'all. He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in. \nCALVIN CANDIE Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price. Dr.SCHULTZ May I lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold? \nCALVIN CANDIE Yes you may. Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit jacket, and says;, Dr.SCHULTZ Easy come, easy go. He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at the seated Schultz, and says; \nCALVIN CANDIE Pleasure doin' business with you. \nTIME CUT \nINT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE. .Moguy signs as a witness. Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her freedom papers. Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed. All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration. For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a runaway \"r\" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred dollars- for twelve thousand. \nStephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else. The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people. Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him. \n"}

SAUL Mr. Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.

BENEDICT You're the guest, sir. 
SAUL And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can you sit in for a hand? 
BENEDICT I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers. 
SAUL That's a shame. You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley. 
BENEDICT No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth. 
CORNER - MOMENT LATER 
Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner. 
SAUL The fight is Saturday, is it not? 
BENEDICT Yes.   I can get you seats... 
SAUL No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me. 
BENEDICT I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you. 
SAUL The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid I need something more secure. 
BENEDICT I can assure you, the house safe is utterly...

SAUL (his looks stops Benedict) I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now: what can you offer me besides the safe? 
Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact. 
109   INT. BELLAGIO - RESTAURANT - SAME TIME                          109 
TESS See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to get away from what happened. How do I get my five years back, Danny? 
DANNY You can't. But what you can do is not throw away another five years. 
TESS You don't know anything about -- 
DANNY (leaning in) Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I'll have to live with that. But not him. 
TESS Spoken like a true ex-husband. 
DANNY I'm not joking, Tess. 
TESS I'm not laughing. (beat) You have to admit there's a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life. 
Danny exhales and leans back.

DANNY Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. 
She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he isn't. She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful. He sees her looking at it. 
TESS Do you remember what I said to you when we first met? 
DANNY You said: you better know what you're doing. 
TESS Do you? Now? Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don't. 
DANNY I know what I'm doing. 
BENEDICT What are you doing? 
Terry Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his meeting with Saul. 
DANNY Catching up. 
TESS Terry, meet my ex-husband... 
DANNY (extending his hand) Danny Ocean. 
BENEDICT (taking it) Mr. Ocean. (to Tess) Forgive me for being late. A guest required my attention. 
TESS Danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me. 
BENEDICT Is that right?

DANNY I was shocked myself.   Imagine the odds. 
BENEDICT 'Of all the gin joints in all the world...' (beat) You've been in prison until recently, isn't that right? How does it feel to be out? 
DANNY About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side. 
BENEDICT There's the human condition for you. 
TESS Terry, Danny was just about to... 
DANNY I just wanted to say hello.   For old time's sake. 
BENEDICT Stay for a drink, if you like. 
TESS He can't -- 
DANNY (simultaneously) -- I can't. 
An awkward silence.    Benedict takes Tess's hand in his. 
BENEDICT Well, then I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean. 
DANNY You never know. 
BENEDICT I know everything that happens in my hotels. 
DANNY So I should put those towels back. 
BENEDICT The towels you can keep.

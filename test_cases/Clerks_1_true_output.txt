A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter. 
SUITED MAN You open? 
DANTE (to MAN) Yes. (to TRAINER) I'm not out of shape. 
SUITED MAN Excuse me, but have you been here all day? 
DANTE What? 
HEATHER (still studying DANTE) He's got those love handles. 
DANTE (to HEATHER) I don't have love handles. 
SUITED MAN Were you working here at about four o'clock? 
DANTE I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why? 
TRAINER (to HEATHER) It's probably from being around all this food every day. 
HEATHER Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too. 
DANTE I'm not out of shape! 
SUITED MAN Can I have your name please? 
DANTE Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about? 
The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook. 
HEATHER You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you! 
TRAINER Because he's out of shape. 
DANTE Do I know you? 
HEATHER You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with... 
DANTE Caitlin Bree. Yeah? 
HEATHER I'm her sister. 
DANTE You're Alyssa's sister? Heather? 
HEATHER Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once. 
TRAINER Did you say Caitlin Bree? 
DANTE Yeah. 
TRAINER Pretty girl, about this girl's height-dark hair-gorgeous body? 
DANTE Yeah? 
TRAINER And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey? 
DANTE How do you know that? 
TRAINER Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her? 
DANTE No, she's getting married. 
TRAINER To you? 
HEATHER To an Asian design major. 
TRAINER Shit! (to DANTE) Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her. 
DANTE What? 
TRAINER While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans-Am. 
HEATHER Oh my God! You're Rick Derris? 
TRAINER Yeah! 
DANTE You know him? 
HEATHER Caitlin used to talk about him all the time. 
TRAINER Really? 
HEATHER Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big... 
DANTE Wait a second! (to TRAINER) You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her? 
TRAINER All the time. That girl was like a rabbit. 
DANTE I...I don't believe this... 
HEATHER (to TRAINER) I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room. 
DANTE THE GLADES MOTEL? 
TRAINER Holy shit! She told you about that! (to DANTE) Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.

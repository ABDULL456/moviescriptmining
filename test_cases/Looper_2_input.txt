SARA What? 
JOE You said you were his mom. 
SARA Uh huh. 
JOE He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it. 
SARA He said that? 
JOE If he's not your son who is he? 
SARA 
(SHARP) He's my son. 
(BEAT) I had Cid when I was twenty two. But I didn't want to give up my life. In the city. The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes. 
SARA (CONT'D) So I dropped Cid with my mom, here. And my sister. And they saw how I was living and they took him. My sister raised him here, she loved him. He called her mom. 
JOE How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers. 
JOE (CONT'D) Cid told me. You have to talk to him about it. Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare. 
SARA I told you one thing, I told you to stay away from my son. 
JOE He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow 
SARA Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away from my son. 
She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She hacks away. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING 
Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in thought. She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette. 
EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING 
A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed. Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205. Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot. Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath. The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping exhausted, up the stairs. And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by. It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face, pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be. He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing. Towards apartment 205. Jesus it can't be. Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes, relieved. She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely indistinct conversation between her and the girl that answers. 
SUZIE Sorry, I know I promised five, you know how it gets. 
GIRL NEIGHBOR Don't worry sugar. She was no problem. Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows... Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters. 
Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to be shitting me.â He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205. Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window. On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap. Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife. Old Joe watches them for a long time. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY 
Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer. The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day. 
INT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER 
Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks. 
INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER 
In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer. 
INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a plastic multiplication table. 
SARA Where does 56 go? Good. 21. 
CID How long can you not sleep? 
SARA I don't know, awhile. That's a good question. Where's it go. Good, there. 32.

GORE Because at higher latitudes, it's short trip. At the North Pole, ou just spin in a circle and you've gone around the world. 
AMELIA So why are you asking? Just to show how smart you are? 
GORE Pretty much.

Now he's grinning.       She just glowers harder. 
G 
ORE (CONT'D) The only way to really fly around he world is to fly the entire circumference of 27,000 miles. Like at the equator. 
AMELIA No one's tried it.    You think I should? No answer. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Dare me. 
GORE Okay. 
AMELIA Okay. Is she serious?       She seems to be. 
GENE Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land est of Honolulu is farther than that. Gore looks to her.       Well? 
AMELIA I'll have to refuel. 
GORE Where? 
AMELIA In the air. One plane to another. The boy is staring at her now.       Staring. 
GORE You're really going to do all this, aren't you? 
AMELIA Well, don't you think I can? A beat. 
GORE I guess we'll find out.

I 
Another. 
AMELIA Pretty much. HOLD on Gene.   He smiles at his kid... 
GENE Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. Okay? The boy knows he's being dismissed. Looks from his dad to Amelia, who steps forward to give him a hug and a kiss. 
AMELIA We'll play some cards before you leave. Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore goes. Gene gestures for Amelia to come with him, away from the mechanics. What's up? But he's already walking to... ...a little folding table, off in a corner.     She follows. Sits. Well...?       G 
ENE You can't refuel in the air. Just like that. 
AMELIA s that an opinion or an order? His rueful smile. 
GENE The only good thing about losing our former relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you're being completely crazy. 
AMELIA Oh, I bet there are more advantages than just that. No one's backing down on this. 
GENE You're not a good enough pilot to o mid-air refueling. You will not be able to control the Electra or that docking maneuver for that amount of time. 
O

AMELIA I've taken bigger risks. 
GENE I've noticed. Don't be so proud of it. He reaches into a pocket. Pulls out a folded sheet of paper. It opens to reveal a MAP of the Pacific. A dot is CIRCLED in red.

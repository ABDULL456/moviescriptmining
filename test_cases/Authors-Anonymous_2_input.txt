HANNAH Oh, c'mon.   You'll -- 
Then -- BAM, Henry, not looking where he's going, slams into Richard accidentally, spilling Richard's drink all over the author. Horrified looks all around. 
108   EXT. OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE - DAY                                       108 
Outside the bookstore, Henry stands on the sidewalk, talking to the camera as he clutches Hannah's book. 
HENRY Well, I did it. I showed up to Hannah's signing. I congratulated her. I supported her, writer to writer. And I finally got introduced to Richard Benedict--formally. Sort of. 
Henry opens up his copy of Hannah's novel. He turns quiet, obviously moved. He holds the book up for the camera to see. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to me. Just like she promised. 
Right beneath the printed dedication For Henry Obert, Hannah has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah. 
Henry studies the book for a second. Snaps it shut. 
109   INT. KELLER OFFICE - DAY                                           109 
Literary agent David Keller being interviewed for the camera in his office. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS on his desk. David pulls one out. 
DAVID This is why I love LA. True story. This guy delivers a pizza to my house one night. Then the very next week, my wife has someone come in and clean the carpets. Guess what? Same guy. Small world, isn't it? So we get talking. He tells me his name's Henry. He's a writer. He's just finished a manuscript. Offers us a discount on the carpets if I'll read ten pages. I like that thinking. So I read ten pages. Wow. I want to read ten more. Before I know it, I've read the entire book. (MORE) 
DAVID (CONT'D) Just loved it. Fresh voice. Interesting characters. And that ending. 
David thumbs through the manuscript. 
DAVID (CONT'D) The washed-up, impotent novelist getting gunned down by Scott, the jealous, underemployed, pizza delivery man. This kid nailed it. It's on the page, know what I mean? So I intend to sign Mr. Henry Obert and get Pizza to Go out there. I predict a best seller. Probably a movie, too. I'll call him with the good news. Or maybe I'll just order a pizza. 
110   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       110 
Henry taking down the rejection letters from his walls and packing them in a cardboard BOX. 
HENRY (V.O.) David Keller did call me. One week later, he sold Pizza to Go to a New York publisher. They decided to rename it A Slice of LA. I did it. I sold my novel. 
Henry puts the last of the rejection letters away. Finally, he picks up a FRAMED PHOTO. INSERT shows the six members of the writing group from happier times--the photo snapped in the restaurant. Full of hope and promise. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) I miss the Tuesday night group. They made me a better writer. They taught me how to handle rejection. 
Henry lingers on the photo before packing it away, as well. 
111   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                           111 
Mostly empty. Henry sits at a booth, alone, a new copy of Gatsby in his hands. He talks to the camera. CUP OF COFFEE in front of him. 
HENRY Hannah was right. The writing must always come first. Everything else waits. Everything. That's what I did finally. Finished my novel. (MORE) 
HENRY (CONT'D) Sold it. Now? Now I'm open. Ready for whatever-- 
WAITRESS stops by the table, refilling Henry's cup. Then setting the pot on the table, she reaches over and snatches the copy of Gatsby. 
Surprised, Henry glances up. 
HENRY (CONT'D) --happens next... 
It's her again. That young waitress with purple streaks in her hair and matching purple glasses thumbs through the book. Henry finally checks out her name tag: Eudora. 
Clutching the book, Eudora recites from memory: 
EUDORA Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-- 
HENRY (Surprised) --Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further... 
Eudora nods. Henry is amazed. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You know Fitzgerald? 
EUDORA Not intimately. He died here, you know. 
HENRY December 21, 1940. 
EUDORA I go by there sometimes. 
HENRY The place on Hayworth.

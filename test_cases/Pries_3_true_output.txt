EXT. OUTPOST 10 - DAWN 
The windmill. Its rusty blades scrape along, the metal catching the first rays of the day. AARON PACE is already up, working on rebuilding his house. He stops, gazing off in the distance. 
ON THE HORIZON A cycle. Two black specs riding it. Hicks and Lucy. Dropping his tools, he runs to meet it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OUTPOST 10 - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - NIGHT 
Time has passed. The moon shines through an open doorway. Lucy lies in bed, Aaron spoon feeding her a warm broth. He smiles, Lucy reluctant to smile back, still uncomfortable with her teeth. But eventually -- for her father...she manages it. 
HICKS Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his way... then shyly looks away. 
AARON I can't thank you enough for what you've done, sheriff. 
T I 
HICKS Just make sure she keeps on the tea. It's a special brew -- lessens the bloodthirst...something my granddad taught me. Aaron nods hopefully, squeezing his. daughter's hand. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OUTPOST 10 - LATER 
A full moon. Hicks stands on the porch, enjoying the breeze as he pops a wad of chaw in his mouth. A MOVEMENT out in the darkness catches his attention. 
IN THE DISTANCE 
A FIGURE Stands astride a motorcycle, shadowed in the moonlight. 
Hicks approaches, the wind kicking up, whistling through the emptiness. Even though he can't see him -- Hicks knows who it is. 
HICKS It doesn't have to be like this. Priest just stands, staring. Hick's hand curls around the revolver. Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the air 
THEN He steps from the bike, advancing towards Hicks. Hicks pulls his gun, leveling it. Priest keeps coming, the wind blowing harder as he approaches. A feeling of inevitability. Hicks stands his ground, cocking his gun. 
HICKS (CONT'D) D= I t- -make dQ this. 
PRIEST Stares into his eyes and -- Something passes between them something so strong and personal it transcends emotion. Hicks FIRES! But Priest is pone. Hicks looks around -- There's no sign of him, not even the bike. 
HICKS (CONT'D) 
(REALIZING) 
SHIT He RACES back to the cabin... 
INT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME 
Hicks BURSTS through the doorway, finding 
LUCY AND AARON 
Sitting peacefully on the bed together, just as he left them. Aaron holds up the cup, turning it over. 
AARON All done.

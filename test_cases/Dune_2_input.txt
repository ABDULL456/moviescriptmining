JESSICA (inner voice) The calming exercise. 
HARKONNEN GUARD #1 The little one! (they laugh) 
Suddenly, Guard #1 reaches around and puts his hand up Jessica's skirt.  He starts breathing hard.  Paul clears his throat. 
PAUL (using The Voice) Remove her gag! 
JESSICA (inner voice) Excellent! 
Guard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag. Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems powerless to stop him.  Once, it's off Jessica smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter floor. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) (The Voice) There's no need to fight over me. 
The two men stare at one another a moment.  Then Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off into a dangerous nose dive. 
HARKONNEN GUARD #1 Now? 
JESSICA (The Voice) First cut my son's bonds. Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield Wall. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) (The Voice) That's it. 
The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's legs.  Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's too late.  The ship falls into the rock. 
130A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT 
The `thopter slides across the rock, shearing off a wing.  Suddenly they are beyond the rock three miles above the great desert and plummeting fast toward the dunes below. 
130. BACK TO SCENE 
Paul pulls desperately on the controls and manages to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep desert. 
JESSICA Oh, my God! 
131. through 131A.  (Deleted) 
131B.     EXT. PALACE - ARRAKEEN - NIGHT 
CU violently burning palm. 
133. BACK TO SCENE 
Nefud exits - TWO HARKONNENS wheel in the stretcher, and swing it round - one of the GUARDS hands Piter his knife back - the Guards exit and the door closes - Piter moves up to Duke Leto and leans over him moving his knife across the Duke's face. 
The Baron flies down to the stretcher. 
BARON Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the insignia off your uniform.  Such carelessness. 
Leto shows no sign that he has heard. PITER It was Feyd. 
Leto's POV:  The Baron and his Mentat are only DIM FARAWAY SHAPES.  Their voices reach Leto as if travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him over. 
BARON It was Feyd? (laughing) It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring. 
PITER The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I... 
BARON You killed the doctor too soon, you fool! 
DUKE LETO (inner voice) Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica safe... the tooth! 
PITER He's coming round, my Lord. 
The Baron moves from behind a table stacked with dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to Leto. 
DUKE LETO (inner voice) Wait... he must be near... 
BARON Where is your ring? 
The Baron's face is now very close to Duke Leto's. 
BARON (CONT'D) You do not answer!

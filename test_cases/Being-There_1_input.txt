PRESIDENT Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner... 
CHANCE (sitting) Yes, I will. 
PRESIDENT (also sits) Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to... 
Chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts. 
CHANCE Yes? 
There is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically, then he continues. 
PRESIDENT I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben. 
RAND Yes, I did. 
PRESIDENT ... Well? 
RAND Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game. 
PRESIDENT Well, Ben... I... 
RAND I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos. 
PRESIDENT That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance. 
CHANCE (again perks up) Yes? 
Once again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look. 
INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING 
Perkins accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF as he checks out the third floor. Riff knocks on each door, looks inside, then moves in. 
INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING 
Allenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for some sort of identification. There is a knock at the door, Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door, looks inside. 
ALLENBY Oh... Hello. 
RIFF (entering) Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret Service. 
ALLENBY ... Yes. Of course. 
Perkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector over Allenby's clothing. 
INT. LIBRARY - MORNING 
The President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He paces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all. 
RAND ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible. 
PRESIDENT It's that serious, huh? 
RAND I'm afraid so. 
The President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns to Chance. 
PRESIDENT Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives? 
CHANCE (a beat) As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden. 
PRESIDENT (a pause) ... In the garden? 
CHANCE That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again... 
PRESIDENT (staring at Chance) ... Spring and summer... (confused) Yes, I see... Fall and winter. (smiles at Chance) Yes, indeed... (a beat) Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner? 
RAND I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy. 
CHANCE Yes. That is correct. 
PRESIDENT (pleased) ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must admit, that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I've heard in a very, very long time. 
The President puts out his cigarette, rises. 
PRESIDENT (CONT'D) ... Many of us forget that nature and society are one! Yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature, we are still a part of it! Like nature, our economic system remains, in the long run, stable and rational. And that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy! (he smiles at Chance, who is absorbed in looking around the room at the books) ... I envy your good, solid sense, Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill. (glances at watch) I must be going. (holds out hand to Chance) Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been enlightening...

STEPHEN (SLURRING) Yes, a magazine subscription. 
SCIAMA Why would you bet against yourself? (PAUSE) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   52 
CONTINUED: SCIAMA (CONT'D) A subscription to what? Nature magazine? 
STEPHEN Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win! 
SCIAMA laughs heartily as - 
- STEPHEN grins, at the same time SPYING - up ahead, TWO ATTRACTIVE UNDER-GRADUATE GIRLS about to enter the LIFT. 
STEPHEN hits the GAS! - and SPEEDS toward the LIFT... 
SCIAMA Penthouse? 
STEPHEN SPEEDS toward the LIFT, whose DOORS ARE READY TO CLOSE. 
SCIAMA winces in expectation of a horrible accident. 
WIDE: it looks suicidal but the chair just flies through the GAP in the last split second before the DOORS CLOSE - the doors shaving the wheels, with a small spark. 
INT. LIFT, DAMTP, G&C COLLEGE - DAY 
STEPHEN, in there with the TWO UNDERGRADUATE GIRLS, SMILES at them. 
INT. LIVING ROOM,WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY 
JANE picks up pieces of a BROKEN POTTED PLANT, dirt spilled over the carpet, then violently VACUUMES as BERYL comes in with a tea-tray. 
BERYL Jane--Jane? Jane? Jane! STOP! 
JANE keeps VACUUMING. BERYL pulls the PLUG on the VACUUM CLEANER. JANE stares at her Mum. 
BERYL (CONT'D) Sit down. Sit. 
BERYL pours TEA for the exhausted JANE. JANE sits. 
BERYL (CONT'D) Now--I'd like to make a suggestion-- it might sound unusual--but I've seen it work wonders. I think--you should consider - (BEAT) - joining the church choir. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   53 
CONTINUED: 
REACTION JANE: Momentarily SPEECHLESS - 
JANE Mum--I think that is possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said. 
BERYL Maybe so. 
JANE I used to love singing. 
BERYL You're very good at it. 
JANE I don't know about that. 
BERYL Go. (pause) It's one hour a week. 
They sip tea in silence. 
INT. CHURCH - EVENING (LATE 70'S-M80'S) 
JANE walks in - and up the AISLE - as we hear CHORAL MUSIC. 
JANE takes a pew, and then her eyes widen slightly as she recognizes the CHOIR MASTER. It's the BEARDED MAN from the supermarket car-park. She studies him, as he gently instructs and then conducts the CHOIR. 
CUT TO: 
After the rehearsal, the CHOIR file past JANE. JONATHAN recognizes her at once. 
JONATHAN Oh, hello. 
JANE Hello. 
JONATHAN Are you here to sing? 
JANE I um--I just came to--

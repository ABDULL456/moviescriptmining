Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression. DAVID Why don't you stay here tonight...? JACK I got my own place... but thanks.                      * Your family's real nice, Dave.                         * (beat)                                          * Like mine.                                             * David nods, climbs in the window.                                 * DAVID See you tomorrow.

What  do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers?

Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly. \nON STAGE David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it.

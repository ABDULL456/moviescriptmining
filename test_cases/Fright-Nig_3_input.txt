JERRY Sorry about the mess, man. I was just telling your mom I'll have the dumpster gone next week. 
CHARLIE Doesn't bother me. 
JANE Jerry does night construction on the strip. 
JERRY (noticing Charlie's shoes) You play ball? I'm always looking for a pick up game. 
CHARLIE 
(BLUFFING) Now and then, you know. 
JANE It's more of a collector thing. The shoes. He's obsessed. (to Jerry/"those teens") They sleep on sidewalks to get them. Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me. 
JERRY Well -- they're bold. I like them. Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious. 
JERRY (CONT'D) So... I'd ask you guys inside, but it's a mess. I've been meaning to. 
JANE Be neighborly. 
JERRY A drink, something. It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles. 
JERRY (CONT'D) Soon, okay? 
JANE You bet. And thank you so much. For the help. 
JERRY Least I could do. Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed. 
AMY Why did you blow him off? Oh my God! 
JANE A guy that good-looking, still single? Bad bet. He's a player. 
CHARLIE 
(IMPRESSED) Mom. Breaking it down. 
JANE I've had enough man trouble. I'm not getting suckered again. Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices. 
JANE (CONT'D) Don't listen to me. Jaded old 
BROAD-- 
CHARLIE 
MOM-- Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it. 
ON THE PHONE A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED "KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!" It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger, prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights. The text message says "10 MINUTES -- OR THIS IS GOING WIDE!" 
ON CHARLIE 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) (alarmed/to Amy) Wow. Okay. I gotta go. Sorry. Call you later. 
AMY Now? 
JANE I have dinner on-- 
CHARLIE I gotta go. I'll eat later. 
JANE Charlie! 
But Charlie's already off and running.

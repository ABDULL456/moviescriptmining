Elizabeth reads To Kill a mockingbird and highlights like crazy. She stops, takes a hit from her bong, and continues. Her roommate, Kirk, enters through the front door, sipping from a Big Gulp. 
ELIZABETH Did you get my Cool Ranch? He tosses her a bag of chips. 
KIRK You owe me two bucks.. Kirk walks into his room and closes the door. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
Elizabeth paces. She has a book of stickers in her hand. 
ELIZABETH Okay, now, what is the significance of the Mockingbird in the novel? What was Harper Lee trying to tell us? No one raises their hand. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) 
(SURPRISINGLY SUPPORTIVE) Come on, you guys know this. This is as close to real teaching as we've seen from Elizabeth. Sasha raises her hand. We see that she already has two gold star stickers on her forehead. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (rolls her eyes) Anyone else? 
Chase raises her hand. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) 
CHASE It's a symbol for, um, equality? Elizabeth puts a sticker on Chase's forehead. 
ELIZABETH Okay, good. Can anyone add to what that girl said? 
JUMP CUT TO: 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
The desks have been arranged into a makeshift courtroom. Spencer presides as the judge. Chase and Shawn are the prosecutors. Garrett is dressed like Boo Radley. Tristan, the bully, addresses the rest of the class -- the "jury." Everyone is clearly into the exercise. REVEAL Principal Snur, clad in a dolphin tie, watching from the back of the class. 
TRISTAN Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the "facts," but come on, you know me. I'm Atticus Finch, baby! The class laughs. 
TRISTAN (CONT'D) Come on, seriously. You're gonna side with Chase and Shawn over me? 
ELIZABETH Use examples from the book. 
SPENCER It doesn't matter what race the defendant is. You've just gotta look at the facts-. Elizabeth nods in agreement. The bell RINGS. 
ELIZABETH Good work today. And don't forget to leave your closing statements on my desk. 
The students all dutifully drop off their papers, placing them in a neat stack next to other ungraded PAPERS. Principal Snur exits, giving Elizabeth a thumbs up. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) 
(CALLING AFTER) Love the tie!

AMY So, you know how I hate to gossip, but I heard that one of the custodians walked in on Omar -- you know, that Arabic boy -- giving...

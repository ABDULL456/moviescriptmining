Cool. \nEMILY Gordon loves Tiger. \nGORDON Best I've ever seen. Ever, hands down. Let's see your form. \nCHRIS Me? I could barely hit the thing. \nGORDON Show me... \nChris does. \nGORDON (CONT'D) If I knew what I know now at your age? Now then I could really play. \nCHRIS It'd be kind of a waste of time travel though. \nThey laugh. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nChris and Rose speak to NELSON DEETS, 82, who's smiles in a wheelchair with his jaw hanging, and LISA DEETS, 54, a loose- lipped trophy wife smiles at Chris in a predatory manner. They have Dutch accents. \nLISA (TO ROSE) How handsome is he? \nROSE Extremely. \nLisa squeezes Chris' bicep. A bit too familiar. \nLISA Not bad huh, Nelson? \nNELSON Eh? \nLISA (TO ROSE) So, is it true? The love making. Is it better? \nRose cackles at the bluntness of the question. Chris almost chokes on his drink. Lisa continues to size Chris up. \nCHRIS Wow. Um.. \nLISA (TO ROSE) I'm being too forward? \nROSE We'll talk later. \nCHRIS Oh, will you now? \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nChris and Rose talk to PARKER DRAY, 60, and APRIL DRAY, 57. They are an overweight, rose-cheeked tipsy wasp couple. Chris and Rose try to mask boredom and annoyance. \nAPRIL Who even cares about skin color? My God. \nCHRIS Right. I mean-- \nPARKER The world cares, April. But it's not a question of physical superiority, it's \"What skin color is more culturally advantageous?\" \nAs Parker drones on Chris looks around the party. Dean schmoozes animatedly with two couples. He quickly scans the party, finds Chris and points him out. The two couples wave and smile giddily. They had all just been talking about him. Chris pretends to not see this. \nROSE \"Advantageous?\" \nSuddenly, Chris sees another black guy walking through the crowd. Relief. It is Andre, the jogger from the first scene, but he's very different than before. \nHe seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter and Georgina, and wears a particularly square ascot and golfing hat. \nPARKER Fairer skin is has been in favor' the last couple of thousands of years, but the pendulum has swung back again hasn't it..? \nCHRIS I'm sorry. I'm going to get another drink. \nChris walks away. \nPARKER I didn't mean to offend him. \n", "test1_true": "PARKER Now, Rose.-- \nEXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER \nAndre stands by the bar and makes himself a Martini. Chris approaches him. \nCHRIS It's good to see another brother around here. \nAndre turns to face Chris neatly. Andre's voice is completely different from the first scene. There is no longer any trace of an urban dialect. He speaks in a lower pitch and slow, enunciating his words precisely. \nANDRE Yes, of course it is. \nChris expects Andre to engage more. He doesn't. He just stares at him smiling. \nCHRIS Who do you know? \nANDRE Why, the Armitage's of course. We're friends of the family. \nPHIL, 65, a craggy effeminate man with manicured eyebrows, cuts between them. \nPHIL (TO ANDRE) There you are. Here, put this somewhere. \nPhil hands his napkin to Andre who pockets it obediently. Phil places his hand on Andre's back possessively. \nPHIL (CONT'D) (TO CHRIS) Oh, hello. I'm Phil... and you are...? \nCHRIS Chris. Rose's boyfriend. \nPHIL Fantastic. Logan and I know Rose very well. \nANDRE I'm sorry, where are my manners. Logan, Logan King. (TO PHIL) Chris was just telling me that he felt more comfortable with my being here. \nChris is let down. Andre isn't what he had hoped. \nPHIL That's nice. Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you. \nANDRE/LOGAN Ah, well it was nice meeting you Chris. \nCHRIS Sure. \nChris holds out his fist for Andre/Logan to bump. Andre/Logan shakes Chris' fist and then, realizing his error fist bumps him like it's the first time. \nAndre/Logan and Phil laugh and walk away. They join a small group of people who applaud Andre's arrival. Andre does a little spin showing off his clothes. \nEXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER \nChris comes back to Rose. He is more creeped out and agitated. \nROSE Where's your drink? \nCHRIS What? Oh, I forgot. \nDean projects over the crowd. \nDEAN Hello! \nEveryone applauds and gives Dean their attention. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Achem! Once again, I want to thank you all for coming. Words cannot express how much it means to us that after all these years we can all still get together and share. I'm reminded of stories of how the knights of old would gather in honor of a new crusade... \nEXT. GAZEBO. DAY. \nDuring Dean's speech, Chris wanders away from the group. \nJIM Ignorant shit... \nChris hadn't seen Jim Hudson, the blind man, who sits in the gazebo with his seeing eye dog. He is close to Chris, but far enough away from the group that no one else hears them. \nCHRIS Who? \nJIM All of them. Ignorant assholes. They have no idea what real people go through. \n", "test1_id": 954, "test2_input": "ROD Hey. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. ROSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nChris is alone in Rose's room. He peers out the window. \nCHRIS Bruh. What's up? \nROD Not much. Sid's chillin'. We eatin' burgers. What's up with you? \nCHRIS Yeah... \nROD Uh oh. That doesn't sound good. \nCHRIS They just got me over here meeting all the family friends. It's like they never met a black dude that doesn't work for them or some shit. \nROD Oh, they got you on display? \nCHRIS Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised last night... \nROD Nigga, what the fuck? Oh, Hell no! \nCHRIS Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose's mom is a hypnotherapist-- \nROD --Nope. I don't give a fuck if she's Dr. Drew up in this bitch. You ain't getting in my head. \nCHRIS (Seeing Rod's point) Right. \nROD Who knows what they'll make you do. You know white people into some crazy sex slave shit. \nChris laughs. \nCHRIS Yeah, I'm like 99% sure they're not a kinky sex family, but- \nROD Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate niggas' heads, but that was after he fucked the heads. \nROD (CONT'D) You think they saw that shit coming? Hell no. (MORE) \nROD (CONT'D) One second they think they just gonna suck some dick, next second they sucking dick but their head isn't on their body Chris. \nCHRIS And thanks for that image, right there. \nROD I saw that on A&E, so that's real life. \nCHRIS It's the black people out here that are the weirdest. The help. It's like they're possessed or... \nROD Hypnotised. \nCHRIS (DRY) HA HA-- \nROD I'm just connecting the dots you presenting me with. The mom puttin' trances on niggas and fuckin' them. It's clear as day and that's fucked up. She hot? \nCHRIS What's fucked up is: You're the first line of defense against terrorism. \nROD This is good shit tho. \nCHRIS Oh, and the one other black guest is like the whitest-most dude at the party. \nRod laughs. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I mean Rod, if you could see what this dude is wearing. \nROD Send me a picture. You are a photographer. (MORE) \nROD (CONT'D) You should be documentin' this shit. \nCHRIS (AMUSED) Aiight. I'll try. \nROD And yo, don't say I didn't warn you `cause my ass sure as Hell ain't coming up to the country to save you from no fuckin' witch coven... Unless the mom's hot. She hot? \nCHRIS Thanks Rod, bye. \n", "test2_true": "GEORGINA Hello. \nCHRIS Hi. \nGeorgina's voice is shaky and careful. \nGEORGINA I owe you an apology. I shouldn't be touching things that don't belong to me. \nCHRIS Oh, no. It's cool. I was just confused. \nGEORGINA I lifted your cellular phone this morning to wipe down the dresser and it accidentally came undone, see? \nCHRIS Yeah, I-- \nGEORGINA Rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way. \nCHRIS Really, it's okay. I didn't mean to rat you out. \nGeorgina eyes get lost for a moment. There's a pain behind her smile. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) ...get you in trouble. \nGEORGINA Oh no, no, no, no, no, no... Aren't you the sweetest thing? Not at all. The Armitages are so good to us; They treat us like family. \nEXT. BACKYARD - AFTERNOON \nChris walks back into the back yard where Dean entertains seven people Chris hasn't met. They turn as Chris approaches smiling eagerly. They all seem to share a private joke. \nDEAN Chris! There you are. I wanted to introduce you to some old friends. We'll do it quickly. Down the line: David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika Walden. \nEach couple - DAVID and MARCIA, RONALD and CELIA, HIROKI, FREDRICH and JESSIKA - waves as they are named. \nCHRIS Too many names to remember but... \nThe couples all laugh nervously. \nHIROKI (to Dean in Japanese) Can we ask him questions? \nDEAN (JAPANESE) Of course. \nHIROKI Do you find that being African American has more advantages or disadvantages in the modern world? \nChris pans the crowd who all give him their undivided attention. The silence is long. Chris sighs. He looks for Rose. She is off talking to someone. \nCHRIS Yeah, I don't know, man. \nThey all smile like hungry vampires. Chris is very uncomfortable with this unprovoked group interrogation. Andre/ Logan and Phil approach. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) That's actually a great question. Logan! They were asking me about the African American experience. Maybe you could take this one. \nAndre/Logan is a little caught off guard but dives in. \nANDRE/LOGAN My life as an African American has been, for the most part, very good. It's hard to be too specific as I haven't much desired to leave the house in a while. \nThe crowd chuckles. Chris takes out his phone. \nPHIL We've become homebodies... \nANDRE/LOGAN (TO PHIL) But recently, even when you go to the city, I've just had no interest. (To the group) The chores are my sanctu-- \nWith the attention on Andre/Logan, Chris subtly backs away from the conversation. He raises his phone toward Andre/Logan and the group and snaps a picture. The FLASH POPS. \nCHRIS Shit. \nEveryone turns to Chris. Andre/Logan steps forward and looks at Chris oddly; His head cocks a little and his peaceful expression drifts slowly to maddened horror. Some of the party guests gasp. \nPHIL Logan? \nAndre/Logan drops his glass and stumbles towards Chris. Chris backs up, but Andre is already up in his space. \nANDRE Get out. \n", "test2_id": 955, "test3_input": "Dean signals \"5, 6.\" Mr. Greene raises his hand. Dean points. \nDean signals \"5, 8.\" Mrs. Deets raises her hand. Dean points. \nDean signals \"6.\" Jim Hudson raises both his hands and signals \"10.\" His chauffeur stands beside him whispering in his ear. Dean points at him. \nDean scans the crowd signalling \"10, 2?\" \"10, 2?\" The crowd looks around. No one is challenging. Dean smiles. Finally Dean bangs his fist onto his open palm and points to Jim Hudson. Jim's chauffeur whispers in his ear. \nThe guests clap in a mixture of delight and disappointment. \nEXT. LAKESIDE - DUSK \nChris and Rose sit watching the sunset over the lake. Chris kisses her hand. He hears the faint APPLAUSE in the distance. He looks in the direction of the house. \nCHRIS I told you about the night my mom died. How I didn't call 911; didn't go out looking for her. \nROSE BABY-- \nCHRIS One hour went by, then two, three... I just sat there... I just watched TV. \nROSE It wasn't your fault-- \nCHRIS I found out later she had survived the initial hit. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) She laid there bleeding by the side of the road all night, cold and alone. And that's how she died in the early morning... Cold and alone. And I was watching TV. (MORE) \nCHRIS (CONT'D) There was time. If someone was looking for her, there was time. But no one was looking. \nChris cries. Rose embraces him. \nROSE You were just a kid. \nCHRIS Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna leave here without you. I`m not going to abandon you. Never. \nThey share a moment of pure love. \nROSE Fuck it. Come on. Let's go back home. \nCHRIS Yeah? \nROSE Yeah. I mean, you're right. This sucks. I'll go back with you. I'll make something up. \nCHRIS I love you. \nROSE I love you too. \nThe two get up and walk back toward the house. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - DUSK \nChris and Rose approach the house as the last of the guests get into their cars and drive off. The fireflies are out. \nCHRIS That was fast. \nROSE Yeah. \nThe guests wave to Dean and Missy, who stand at the front door, and then to Chris and Rose. Lisa Deets, the trophy wife, is tipsy. Nelson is in their car. \nLISA Bye Chris! It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you-- \nChris and Rose wave. \nNELSON Come on, Lisa. Before you say something stupid. \nChris laughs. Walter shuts the car door behind Lisa. Walter stands pleasantly watching the cars leave. He turns to Chris with the same `ol smile. Chris and Rose enter the house. \nINT. ARMITAGE BATHROOM - DUSK \nSink running. Chris washes his hands and looks in the mirror. \nHis phone SIGNALS a text message from Rod. It's picture from the internet of witches in a circle around a man being sacrificed followed by the text message. \"You dead yet?\" Chris texts back. \"Bruh, you have no idea.\" He finds the picture he took of Logan/Andre on his phone and sends it. \nMoments later, his phone vibrates. \n", "test3_true": "INT. CHRIS' APARTMENT - DUSK \nRod is on the phone. \nROD That's Dre. \nCHRIS Dre? \nROD Andre um... Hayworth! Yeah! He used to kick it with Veronica. \nCHRIS Veronica from... \nROD ...Teresa's sister! Worked at the movie theatre on 8th; \nROD (CONT'D) got us into the movie a couple of times; Rush hour 2 and, um Usual Suspect. \nCHRIS Yeah. That is him. But... \nROD ...But what? \nCHRIS This is so fuckin' crazy. He's different now. \nROD Different? How? \nCHRIS Different. Slower... I mean he was street; now he's all like... white- seeming. Oh, plus he's gay! \nROD No, he ain't. \nCHRIS I'm telling you: He's gay, I met his man. He's-- \nROD Chris, you in a fucked up Eyes Wide Shut situation. You need to--. \nThe phone goes dead. No batteries. \nINT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nChris' phone lays on the dresser plugged in. He's in a hurry now. He packs his small bag and looks out the window. One car remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first to have arrived for the party: Jim Hudson's. The driver brings the dog to the back seat. He gets a green envelope from the glove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front door. She accepts it silently. \nThe driver drives away without Jim. \nChris goes to leave Rose's room. Her closet creaks open. Chris sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it. \nHe takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play. \nThe next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie. Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at different ages in different class plays. \nFinally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It's a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the ride up. Under the image are written the words. \"X-mas 2014\" Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy. Underneath, the caption \"Memorial Day 2013\" \nHe continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately. \"Thanksgiving 2009\" Walter looks different in the picture. He isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger. \nROSE (EMOTIONLESS) What are you doing? \nRose stands there in the doorway behind him. Chris subtly drops the pictures back in the shoebox. \nCHRIS Um... Looking for my camera. \nRose points to her desk. He grabs his bag and the camera. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Where are the keys..? I gotta put our bags in the trunk. \nROSE Walter can do that. \nCHRIS Nah, I'll do it. \nRose is truly distant for the first time. A different person. She is methodical and emotionless. The jig is up, and now she is now phoning it in. \nROSE I was just looking for them. I'm such a mess, will you help me? \nChris walks out the door, leaving Rose. \nINT.

{"train": "GET OUT \nWritten by \nJordan Peele \nI appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2 \nEXT.

Ou est le restaurant le plus proche? \nThe driver doesn't repeat. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nAndre, feeling followed, stops to tie his shoe. The car also stops.

They're going to love you. \nINT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY \nRose hums. Chris, in the passengers seat, looks through his camera at the passing trees. He snaps a test shot. \nCHRIS How long has it been? \nROSE 10 months, so a year basically; longest I've ever been away. \nChris takes out another cigarette. Rose promptly grabs it and opens the window. \nCHRIS Whoa... whoa!! Come on! I'm a grown man. If a man says he wants a cigarette, a man should be able TOO- - \nShe throws it out the window. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Okay, so that's like a dollar.

We'll take wow. \nCHRIS I grew up in a one bedroom, so for me, this is ridiculous. \nDEAN It ought to be. Lord knows we've done enough work on it through the years... \nMISSY (To Rose and Chris) How was the ride in? \nROSE We hit a deer. \nDEAN MISSY Oh no! Where? \nROSE (CONT'D) I don't know.

One down... a few hundred thousand to go. \nDean snickers. \nMISSY ROSE Dean. So awful! Dad. \nDEAN (CONT'D) What?! Those things are everywhere up here, Chris; like rats. The damage they've done to the ecology alone... Anyway, are we ready for the grand tour? \nMISSY Let them unload their bags first. \nDEAN Leave `em. Walter will get `em. \nROSE I think we'll manage, Dad. \nINT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \nRose and Chris take their bags upstairs. \nINT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nRose's old room is preserved in the state of a young-minded teenage girl. Lots of pink and dated boy band posters, a stuffed lion. A window overlooks the front lawn. \nRose and Chris place their bags down. \nROSE (SARCASTIC) You think they wish I was still a kid? \nCHRIS I cannot believe they kept it the same. \nChris looks at some pictures posted on her dresser. \nROSE So... \nCHRIS They're great. \nROSE Yay. \nCHRIS No, they're totally sweet. \nROSE I told you they'd love you. \nHe sees a picture of Rose in high school on stage in a production of `The Crucible.' \nCHRIS What?! Is this you? \nROSE \"The Crucible.\" I was Abigail. \nCHRIS I didn't know you acted. \nCHRIS Like mother like daughter. \nDean Cackles. \nINT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY \nCHRIS And you're a surgeon? \nDEAN A neurosurgeon; was. I retired early. Now, I pretty much focus on the house and twiddle my thumbs. \nDean and Chris pass a closed door. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Oh, downstairs is the wine cellar, the games room, some storage. Apparently a black mold issue down there. Almost everything needs to get thrown out; shame. \nINT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - DAY \nDean and Chris continue their walk-through. The kitchen is large, homey and pristine. Large windows overlook the backyard. GEORGINA, African American, 30 stands facing a wall. She is still. \nDEAN My mother loved her kitchen. \nUpon hearing them, Georgina comes alive. She resumes cleaning the kitchen. \nCHRIS That view. \nDEAN Oh, Georgina, this is Chris; Rose's boyfriend. \nGeorgina turns to them. She has the same eerie smile as Walter. Like she's masking something. \nCHRIS Hi. \nGEORGINA Hello.- \nDEAN Ah ha! But now for the piece de resistance... \nDean opens the glass back door. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe yard is huge and the woods beyond it ominous. The wind RUSHES through the trees. Dean leads Chris out through the yard towards a gazebo. \nDEAN Badminton and bocce ball, croquet; we're a family who loves games. Two other families have properties on lake Pontaco, and they're way on the other side. Total privacy. \nChris is distracted by Walter who prepares the lawn mower in the distance. \nDEAN (CONT'D) I know what you're thinking. \nCHRIS Yeah? \nDEAN Well-to-do white family; black servants... \nCHRIS I wasn't gonna go there. \nDEAN You didn't have to. We hired them a few years ago to help care for my parents; they became part of the family. Couldn't bear to let them go. I hate the way it makes us look though... \nCHRIS Hey. People need work. \nDEAN Yeah. \nThey arrive at an outdoor patio. Dean stops Chris from stepping on a dead sparrow. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Well, crap. (CALLING) Walter! \nWalter turns to face them. He has that same eerily mild smile. Vacant in its sincerity. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Another dead bird! (TO CHRIS) Damn things fly into the patio from time to time; break their necks. \nWalter nods slowly. Dean gently kicks the bird's carcass out of their way. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Iced tea? \nEXT. OUTDOOR PATIO - DAY \nDean, Missy, Chris and Rose sit with iced teas. \nMISSY If you change your mind... We're just glad you could join us for the big get-together. \nGeorgina brings the pitcher of iced tea around and refills everyone's glass. Chris tries to thank her with a look. She smiles and avoids eye contact. \nCHRIS The get-together? \nROSE The party tomorrow? I told you. \nCHRIS I must have forgot. \nMISSY Oh, well we host a shindig once a year for our friends. \nDEAN A tradition. Some of my Dad's old social club. Some old patients. Some just friends... \nMISSY Drinks, good food, good people... \nCHRIS Sounds fun. \nGeorgina has been pouring Chris' drink too long and his glass has overflown. \nMISSY Georgina! \nGeorgina snaps out of her daze. She realizes what she's done and starts to clean. \nMISSY (CONT'D) It's fine George, I'll get it. Maybe you need a nap. \nGeorgina nods, smiles and walks away. Chris and Rose look at Dean. That was odd. Dean shrugs. \nA CAR HORN HONKS in front of the house. \nDEAN Jeremy's home. \nJEREMY, 29, rounds the house with open arms. \nHe's \"Rich kid intense\"; handsome and strong with an unpredictable wildness behind his eyes. \nJEREMY Who answers the door around here?! \nINT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - LATER/NIGHT \nEveryone laughs. \nDean pours the remainder of a bottle of wine into Chris' glass. Their meal is done and they are tipsy. Jeremy pops the cork on a new bottle of wine as he energetically holds court. \nJEREMY One more... So, let me set the scene. I'm a junior; Ro's a freshman and she has a crush on this guy Connor-- \nROSE --No. Mom. \nMISSY Jeremy... \nCHRIS No, no... These are good. I wanna hear this. \nDEAN Manners, Rose. Give the guest what he wants. \nJEREMY Yeah, Rose. \nROSE I hate you. \nJEREMY Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse team. Huge guy, like 6'3\", and crazy, just like \"Looney Tunes,\" right? We had thrown a party-- \nROSE You did. \nJEREMY I think my parents were in Greece or something. We had gotten into their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced. \nMISSY No you weren't. Were you? \nJEREMY We put water in the bottles so you wouldn't know. Let me finish. Okay, so I'm upstairs in my parents' bathroom hooking up with Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in our class. \nMISSY Uch. \nROSE You realize you're coming off like a total douche right now, right? \nJEREMY Thanks. All of a sudden Connor starts banging on the bathroom door, right? I open it, and he's got blood gushing out of his mouth and he's screaming \"Your thith-ter bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!\" \nFull moon. CRICKETS. \nINT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRose and Chris make hushed love in her bed. A stuffed lion seems to watch Chris. He turns it away. \nINT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - LATER \nRose sleeps, but Chris is wide awake. There's a buzz in his ear. He smacks his own head and sits up. A soft HOWL of WIND rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open. \nChris' eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out of his camera bag pocket draped on the desk chair. \nINT. ARMITAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT \nChris leaves Rose's room and walks down the dark hallway. A floorboard creaks under his feet. He turns down the stairs. \nINT. ARMITAGE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nChris gets to the bottom of the stairs. He hears the floorboard creek upstairs. He stops and turns, expecting someone to follow him down. Nothing. Chris continues to walk down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen. \nThe basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into it curiously. A stairwell leads down into pitch darkness. Chris shuts the door. A figure now stands at the end of the hallway behind him. He doesn't notice. He just keeps going into... \nINT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nChris walks through the kitchen. He bumps into a bar chair moving it slightly. He keeps walking. He continues out the sliding back door of the house. \nEXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nChris steps out the back door and takes a cigarette out. Chris looks into the vast night around him. The CRICKETS are deafening. \nSuddenly, something DARTS FAST across the yard in the distance. Chris peers out into the darkness. The thing RUNS across the lawn again. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He makes out a shape. It's now running towards him. Chris backs up in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows and into the moonlight. It's Walter, the grounds keeper. He passes Chris without noticing. Chris gathers his breath. \nThe kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chris drops the cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towards the house and finds himself face to face with Georgina, who glares through the window dead in Chris' eyes. He's caught. \nGeorgina doesn't react. Chris it still. Georgina suddenly exposes her teeth in a frightening grimace. Chris backs away slowly. \nINT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGeorgina sucks her teeth. She doesn't actually see Chris at all. She's looking at her teeth in the reflection in the window which, front lit, reflects her and the room around her. Outside is invisible. \nEXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT \nChris realizes he's not caught. Close call. Inside Georgina notices the bar chair has been moved. She moves it back into its original position, and begins cleaning the kitchen cabinets. Chris quietly sneaks around the house. \nINT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nChris sneaks in through the door in the dark dining room. \nINT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nChris moves through the living room towards the stairs, the lamp in the middle of the room turns on startling Chris. Missy sits near him; cat in lap; almost seductively. He's caught; for real this time. \nMISSY Quick fix? \nCHRIS Yeah. Nerves got me I guess. \nMISSY Come. Let's nip this in the bud. \nINT. MISSY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMissy sits in a chair and directs Chris to sit across from her. She pours them both some tea. Chris sits. \nCHRIS I still don't know if this is right for me. \nMISSY There really is no need to be nervous. \nCHRIS I'm good. The dude was running out there. Scared me. \nMISSY Walter starts early every day. He's borderline obsessive compulsive. Tea? \nCHRIS Nah, I'm good. It'll keep me up. \nMissy puts two sugar cubes in her cup. She begins to stir slowly, CLINKING the SPOON softly and rhythmically against the sides of the cup. \nMISSY You said `you knew something was wrong.' What did you do? \nCHRIS Nothing. \nMISSY Nothing? \nCHRIS I just sat there. Watching TV. \nMISSY You didn't call someone? Your Aunt or the police? \nCHRIS No. \nMISSY Why not? \nCHRIS I don't know. I thought if I did, it would make it real. \nMISSY Next is smell and taste. Breathe in and let the scent fill your nose. Smell that place. Taste it. Find it. \nChris is getting emotional. He breathes deep through his nose. \nFLASH BACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT \nYoung Chris finishes inhaling. The rain hits the window sill. \nMISSY (V.O.) Tell me. Tell me when you find it. \nYoung Chris takes sip of a juice box. \nPRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY'S OFFICE. NIGHT \n26 year old Chris sips from an invisible straw. \nCHRIS I found it. \nTING TING. TING TING. \nMISSY Good. Now lastly, you must see it. Let the light flood into your eyes. Every color, every detail. See it. See it. Find it. \nChris' eyelids flutter. He continues to scratch the armchair. \nTING TING. TING TING \nFLASHBACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT \n11-year-old Chris scratches through the wood on his bed, splintering the wood. He watches TV from his bed next to some action figures. \nMISSY (V.O.) Tell me when-- \n11-year-old Chris nods. \nTING TING. TING TING. \nPRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY'S OFFICE. NIGHT \nChris nods and cries. \nCHRIS --Found it. \nMISSY (REALIZING) You think it was your fault. \nChris nods. \nTING TING. TING TING. \nMISSY (CONT'D) I want you to feel that fear again, Chris. \nCHRIS I don't want to. \nMISSY It's okay. I'm here. \nChris trembles anxiously. \nMISSY (CONT'D) Are you afraid now? Paralyzed like that day? \nIts eyes glow and flicker faint blue in its sockets. It MOANS A WRONG SOUNDING MOAN; in hateful anguish. It charges Chris... \nTHUNK THUNK. THUNK THUNK. THUNK THUNK. \nThe bloody deer impales Chris on its antlers. They both MOAN. \nINT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nChris wakes up with a start in Rose's bed sweaty and heaving. He's alone and confused. Bad dream? Headache. \nThe SHOWER RUNS inside Rose's bathroom. SHE HUMS. \nDING DING \nHe's gotten a message. It's a picture of Rod pretending to pour beer in Sid's mouth. Chris smiles. The batteries are low. He plugs his phone in and puts it on the dresser. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAWN \nIt's Golden hour. Beautiful. Chris walks through the yard to the edge of the forest with his camera. \nChris keeps walking. He looks through a long-zoom lens into the wilderness. He sees a bird and snaps a picture. \nHe turns to the house. Georgina can be seen through an upstairs window knitting. He raises his camera. She's beautiful. She stands and begins to remove her wig. Then as if aware she's being watched, she turns towards him. Chris turns away, taking a picture in another direction. He glances back at the window. Georgina is gone. \nBANG. A sparrow slams against the gazebo and falls to the ground. Startling Chris. \nCHRIS Damn. \nHe turns away and is startled even more by Walter smiling serenely at him about 50 feet away in the yard. Embarrassed, Chris gathers himself. He walks towards Walter. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) What's up? \nNo response. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) They working you good out here, huh? \nWalter's voice is soft and methodical. His eyes remain distant as though he his looking through Chris. Chilling. There is a hidden anger behind his pleasantness. \nWALTER Nothing I don't want to be doing. \nCHRIS Ha! \nWalter isn't joking. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I never really got to meet you actually, up close. I'm Chris. \nWALTER I know who you are. You're Rose's friend. \nChris stops walking about 15 feet from Walter. Something doesn't feel right. \nCHRIS Yeah. That's one way to put it. So, where you from originally? \nWALTER She is lovely isn't she? \nCHRIS Rose? Yeah, she is... \nWALTER One of a kind; a real doggone keeper. \nChris is weirded out. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Sorry if I scared you last night. \nCHRIS Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was pretty drunk. (MORE) \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I don't remember much. \nWALTER And the hypnosis? Did it work? \nCHRIS Hypnosis? No, I didn't... \nChris remembers. \nWALTER Well, I should get back to work. \nGORDON Can't quite swing the hips like I used to though. You know, I met Tiger. \nRose and Chris share a subtle smirk. \nROSE CHRIS Wow, that's great. Cool. \nEMILY Gordon loves Tiger. \nGORDON Best I've ever seen. Ever, hands down. Let's see your form. \nCHRIS Me? I could barely hit the thing. \nGORDON Show me... \nChris does. \nGORDON (CONT'D) If I knew what I know now at your age? Now then I could really play. \nCHRIS It'd be kind of a waste of time travel though. \nThey laugh. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nChris and Rose speak to NELSON DEETS, 82, who's smiles in a wheelchair with his jaw hanging, and LISA DEETS, 54, a loose- lipped trophy wife smiles at Chris in a predatory manner. They have Dutch accents. \nLISA (TO ROSE) How handsome is he? \nROSE Extremely. \nLisa squeezes Chris' bicep. A bit too familiar. \nLISA Not bad huh, Nelson? \nNELSON Eh? \nLISA (TO ROSE) So, is it true? The love making. Is it better? \nRose cackles at the bluntness of the question. Chris almost chokes on his drink. Lisa continues to size Chris up. \nCHRIS Wow. Um.. \nLISA (TO ROSE) I'm being too forward? \nROSE We'll talk later. \nCHRIS Oh, will you now? \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nChris and Rose talk to PARKER DRAY, 60, and APRIL DRAY, 57. They are an overweight, rose-cheeked tipsy wasp couple. Chris and Rose try to mask boredom and annoyance. \nAPRIL Who even cares about skin color? My God. \nCHRIS Right. I mean-- \nPARKER The world cares, April. But it's not a question of physical superiority, it's \"What skin color is more culturally advantageous?\" \nAs Parker drones on Chris looks around the party. Dean schmoozes animatedly with two couples. He quickly scans the party, finds Chris and points him out. The two couples wave and smile giddily. They had all just been talking about him. Chris pretends to not see this. \nROSE \"Advantageous?\" \nSuddenly, Chris sees another black guy walking through the crowd. Relief. It is Andre, the jogger from the first scene, but he's very different than before. \nHe seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter and Georgina, and wears a particularly square ascot and golfing hat. \nPARKER Fairer skin is has been in favor' the last couple of thousands of years, but the pendulum has swung back again hasn't it..? \nCHRIS I'm sorry. I'm going to get another drink. \nChris walks away. \nPARKER I didn't mean to offend him. \nCHRIS I guess people only see what's in front of them. \nChris notices his faux pas. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I mean... \nJIM Heh. No, you're right. And usually not even that much. That's people. \nJim holds a glass up. Chris fist bumps the glass. \nJIM (CONT'D) Jim Hudson. \nCHRIS CHRIS- \nJIM I know who you are. I'm an admirer of your work; you have a great eye... \nCHRIS Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson Galleries? \nJim smiles. \nJIM The irony of being a blind art dealer isn't lost on me. \nCHRIS How do you do it? \nJIM I have an assistant describe work to me. You've got something... The images you capture... so brutally melancholic. Powerful stuff. \nCHRIS Thank you. Yeah, I just like finding the beauty in abandoned things. \nJIM I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly. I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn't have \"the eye\" for it; Began dealing. And then, of course, my vision went to shit. \nCHRIS Damn. \nJIM I know. Life can be a sick joke. One day you're working in a dark room, and the next day - BAM. You wake up in the dark. Genetic disease. \nCHRIS Shit ain't fair, man. \nJIM Yeah. \nJeremy comes over with his preppy friend, Derrick, 29. \nJEREMY Chris, we need you... \nCHRIS Yeah, sure. (TO JIM) Nice to meet you. \nJIM Stop by the gallery some time. Bout time you had a solo show. \nCHRIS Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That would be a game changer. \nJIM I think we could do wonderful things together. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nChris and Rose play badminton against Jeremy and Derrick. A gaggle of party guests watch, entertained. Chris is actually having fun. He swings big but misses the shuttlecock. \nJEREMY HA! Come on. You can do better than that! \nCHRIS Not my game, what can I say. \nJEREMY Yeah, I see that. \nROSE Shut up Jeremy. \nJEREMY I'm just saying, if your boy isn't gonna bring his `A' game, we might as well bring Mom up here. \nCHRIS Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin' smack huh? \nChris serves the shuttlecock hard. The following rally is long, captivating the crowd. Chris ends it with an impressive diving swat. Derrick misses the return and the crowd goes wild. Chris throws his arms up in celebration. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Boom! \nROSE Yay, baby! \nJEREMY See, that's what I'm talking about!!! Okay, again! \nROD Hey. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. ROSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nChris is alone in Rose's room. He peers out the window. \nCHRIS Bruh. What's up? \nROD Not much. Sid's chillin'. We eatin' burgers. What's up with you? \nCHRIS Yeah... \nROD Uh oh. That doesn't sound good. \nCHRIS They just got me over here meeting all the family friends. It's like they never met a black dude that doesn't work for them or some shit. \nROD Oh, they got you on display? \nCHRIS Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised last night... \nROD Nigga, what the fuck? Oh, Hell no! \nCHRIS Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose's mom is a hypnotherapist-- \nROD --Nope. I don't give a fuck if she's Dr. Drew up in this bitch. You ain't getting in my head. \nCHRIS (Seeing Rod's point) Right. \nROD Who knows what they'll make you do. You know white people into some crazy sex slave shit. \nChris laughs. \nCHRIS Yeah, I'm like 99% sure they're not a kinky sex family, but- \nROD Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate niggas' heads, but that was after he fucked the heads. \nROD (CONT'D) You think they saw that shit coming? Hell no. (MORE) \nROD (CONT'D) One second they think they just gonna suck some dick, next second they sucking dick but their head isn't on their body Chris. \nCHRIS And thanks for that image, right there. \nROD I saw that on A&E, so that's real life. \nCHRIS It's the black people out here that are the weirdest. The help. It's like they're possessed or... \nROD Hypnotised. \nCHRIS (DRY) HA HA-- \nROD I'm just connecting the dots you presenting me with. The mom puttin' trances on niggas and fuckin' them. It's clear as day and that's fucked up. She hot? \nCHRIS What's fucked up is: You're the first line of defense against terrorism. \nROD This is good shit tho. \nCHRIS Oh, and the one other black guest is like the whitest-most dude at the party. \nRod laughs. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I mean Rod, if you could see what this dude is wearing. \nROD Send me a picture. You are a photographer. (MORE) \nROD (CONT'D) You should be documentin' this shit. \nCHRIS (AMUSED) Aiight. I'll try. \nROD And yo, don't say I didn't warn you `cause my ass sure as Hell ain't coming up to the country to save you from no fuckin' witch coven... Unless the mom's hot. She hot? \nCHRIS Thanks Rod, bye. \nAndre/Logan's voice is higher and scratchy, like it was in the first scene. \nCHRIS Hey, man, I'm sorry, I-- \nAndre/Logan grabs Chris by the shoulders and screams shrilly. Blood trickles out of his nose. \nANDRE GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!! \nPhil and Jeremy grab Andre. They have to pry Andre/Logan's grip off of Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screams bloodcurdlingly. It takes all their strength to bring him into the house. Missy and Dean follow. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nRose sits on the couch. She's been crying. Chris comforts her but is clearly traumatised. A few other concerned guests mill around. Dean enters everyone gives him their attention. \nROSE What the Hell was that? \nDEAN It was a seizure. \nROSE A seizure? \nDEAN Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with him now. Are you okay Chris? \nCHRIS Yeah. Why did he come at me like that? \nROSE Yeah seizures don't make people attack people, I'm sorry. \nDEAN It was an abnormal manifestation but yes, actually, sometimes they do. The flash on your phone must have triggered it. \nAndre/Logan enters with stands with Missy and Phil to a smattering of concerned applause. \nHe addresses a group in his lower pitched \"Logan\" voice. \nANDRE/LOGAN Well, I do believe I owe you all an apology. \nThe group grumbles. \nMISSY We're just glad you're feeling yourself again. \nANDRE/LOGAN Well yes I am. It's quite like being trapped in a dark room and watching my experiences through a window. Thank God you and Dean were here to calm me down. \nDEAN It's a simple glitch of the brain. Nothing to be afraid of. \nANDRE/LOGAN I know I scared you all quite a bit.. especially you Chris. \nCHRIS No, I'm sorry about the flash. I didn't know. \nANDRE/LOGAN Of course. How could you have? \nPHIL (to Andre/Logan) You shouldn't have been drinking either. \nThe group chuckles. \nANDRE/LOGAN As I said I'm feeling much better now, but you'll all have to proceed without the aid of my marvellous wit; the whole thing has left me a quite a bit exhausted. \nDEAN Of course. \nANDRE/LOGAN It was nice meeting you. \nCHRIS Yeah, you too. \nChris is skeptical. Missy shows Phil and Logan out. Andre and Phil leave. \nDEAN Let's do sparklers shall we? Brighten the mood? \nHe gives Chris and Rose sparklers and to other people who light them. \nROSE Let's go. \nRose takes Chris' hand. \nMISSY Anybody need a drink? \nROSE We're going on a walk. \nGARY Hey... two strikes. Go take 10; get it together. \nEXT. AIRPORT - DEPARTURES TERMINAL - DAY \nRod smokes a cigarette and dials Chris. \nCHRIS' VOICEMAIL MESSAGE (V.O.) It's Chris. I'm away from my phone or I just don't want to talk to you. \nROD Sup? Making sure you good. I thought you were coming back yesterday, so hopefully you home already and just sleeping or some shit. Aiight. Let me know. \nINT. CHRIS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRod opens the door. Sid wags his tail hungrily. \nINT. CHRIS' KITCHEN - LATER \nRod opens dog food while he calls Chris. \nCHRIS' VOICEMAIL MESSAGE (V.O.) Hey, it's Chris. I'm away from my phone or I just don't want to talk TO-- \nRod hangs up. He places Sid's bowl down. Sid doesn't eat. Instead Sid looks back up at Rod and WHINES. \nROD Yeah... me too. \nINT. CHRIS' LIVING ROOM - LATER \nRod sits at Chris' desk in front of his laptop. Sid sits on Rod's lap. Rod types \"Andre Hayworth\" into the search engine. Images of Andre come up. \nRod finds an article entitled: \"What Happened to Andre Hayworth?\" under in bold \"Brooklyn Native Goes Missing In Evergreen Hallow.\" \nRod's eyes go wide. \nROD Oh shit. \nINT. GAMES ROOM - LATER \nChris wakes up with a bump on his head. In front of Chris, a deer's head is mounted above an old-school floor-standing television. Behind him, a goat's head is mounted under a taxidermy owl, wings spread. \nHis arms and legs fastened to a leather upholstered chair in the middle of a small dark room full of board games. \nChris pulls at the straps that bind his arms and legs. \nCHRIS Hey. Hey!!!! Rose!!!! \nChris tries to gnaw at the harnesses, but they are too thick. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh shit. The fuck?!?!! Y'all are psycho!? Is that it? Let me out of this chair. \nChris looks around. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) People know I'm here. I told a bunch of people where I was going! You don't know me!!! You don't know me!!!! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!!! \nThe television screen turns on. Chris watches intently. The image of deer walking through woods comes on. The words \n\"YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND by James Taylor\" comes up as the song starts to PLAY. It's a forest-themed karaoke video. \nChris is confused. He tries to slip out of the binds again drawing blood on his wrists. \nINT. CHRIS' LIVING ROOM - DAWN \nSid wakes Rod up with a lick to the face. He's on the sofa. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nRod sits at a desk with Sid on his lap.. DETECTIVE LATOYA 50, African American enters. She looks like she's been doing this way too long. She speaks to someone outside her office. \nDETECTIVE LATOYA ...Then he should've gone back up there and made sure everything was accounted for. (MORE) \nDETECTIVE LATOYA (CONT'D) `Cause hey, look; how about this? If you record the evidence, you're responsible for it. \nLatoya shuts the door and sits at her desk. She begins opening and eating a bag of cashews. \nDETECTIVE LATOYA (CONT'D) Hello Mr... \nLATOYA (to her colleagues) So, I don't want none of you sayin' I don't do nothin' for you... White girls'll get ya every time! \nThey laugh even harder. \nINT. GAMES ROOM - LATER \nThe SONG PLAYS Over and over. Chris is too weak to struggle. \nCHRIS Is this the only song you got? \nINT. GAMES ROOM - LATER \nThe SONG ends. It BEGINS again. \nCHRIS Okay. Okay! What do you want? You tryin' to break me? I won't say shit!! I'll just... I'll do what you say, just answer me! \nINT. CHRIS' LOFT - DUSK \nRod sits by the window with Sid. He looks out over rooftops and thinks. He picks up his phone and calls Chris again. He knows Chris won't answer. Then-- \nROSE Hello? \nRod is taken off guard. He almost drops his phone. \nROSE (CONT'D) Chris? \nROD Yo. Um, Rose? It's Rod. \nROSE Hi. \nROD Where's Chris? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. ARMITAGE HOUSE. DINING ROOM - DUSK \nRose stands by the dining table on Chris' phone. Rose starts to cry. \nROSE He left like two days ago. \nROD He left? \nROSE We got in a fight. He got all paranoid and flipped out; He took a cab home. He forgot his phone. Wait... You haven't seen him? \nROD No. He never made it back here. \nROSE Oh my God. \nROD I've been calling. I went to the police and everything. \nRose is silent. \nROD (CONT'D) Hello? \nROSE What did you say? \nROD I told them he was missing. \nROSE Uh huh... \nROD So... What cab company did he use? \nROSE I don't know. A local one I'm guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so confused... \nROD Hold on a second. \nRod knows she had something to do with it. \nHe opens up `Garage Band' on Chris' computer and puts the phone on speaker, recording her. \nROD (CONT'D) So, last time Chris and I talked, he told me your mom hypnotized him? \nRose is silent. Then... \nJIM They asked me for my favorite song, which was hard; I like all types of music. Turns out they really just needed one I knew all the words to: I went with James Taylor's \"You Got a Friend.\" I hope it hasn't been too torturous; that wasn't the point. The point is that you learn it, and for us to have that knowledge in common. \nCHRIS Who the fuck are you people? \nJIM Oh right. Okay, let me back up and give you the cliff notes. The Armitages and I are a part of a society. A pretty extraordinary society actually. (MORE) \nJIM (CONT'D) One whose sole purpose for many many years has been a search for a very powerful object. Armitage lineage redefined the nature of that search. They proved that the power didn't just exist in that object; You see, with science the Armitage's created a miracle. \nCHRIS You hypnotize me? Break my will..? Make me a slave like the others? This is some crazy racist shit. \nJIM No. Not racist, Chris. We don't hate you. We want to be you... You are not going to be a slave. You're going to be a vessel. \nCHRIS Wait, what? \nJIM Missy's hypnosis was merely to sedate you. Oh, that and to prepare you psychologically... \nCHRIS For what? \nJim smiles. \nJIM For the procedure. \nCHRIS What's the procedure? \nJIM Are you ready...? Drum roll please. Brain transplantation. Some say it could never be done; \nJIM (CONT'D) They experimented for centuries, but it turned out re-linking the brain to a foreign central nervous system was impossible. The nerve connections are far too intricate and delicate. \nCHRIS What the fuck? \nJIM Dean's the only guy who really gets the science. He's the one who discovered that full brain transplantation isn't actually necessary to transfer the soul, and that partial brain transplantation solves the little nerve ending problem. \nCHRIS No. \nJim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. There is a big red part that takes up 80% of the image. The other 20% is blue and located near the lower back of his skull. \nJIM Okay so... You see the blue part? That's the piece of your brain that's all rooted in the nervous system. So that stays; keeping those tricky little connections intact. The rest is discarded. Then they'll remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours. Your \"blue\" and my \"red\" basically absorb each other. And apparently the brain heals surprisingly fast, so assuming everything goes as planned, we should be up and functioning in a couple weeks. \nCHRIS And my brain? \nJIM Your red part? It'll be discarded, but don't worry. You wont be gone. Well not completely. You'll still be in there somewhere; limited consciousness of course; \nJIM (CONT'D) you'll still be able to see and hear but your existence will be as a passenger... an audience. You will live in... \nCHRIS (DEFEATED) ...The Sunken Place. \nJIM Yes. That's what she calls it. Good! So you understand, I'll control the motor functions, the will of our body, effectively MAKING ME-- \nCHRIS Me... You will be me. \nJIM As far as the world is concerned. It's still a pretty new operation. Some kinks. We're supposed to stay away from flashes of light for example. They can trigger a \"momentary lapse in control of motor functions...\" \nCHRIS Why black people? \nJim is disappointed in the question. \nJIM Well, because you get the highest bids. For the last decade or so anyway. I wish it was less simple than that, but it's not. You're in fashion, baby! \nFinal hope sinks from. Chris shoulders. \nJIM (CONT'D) Honestly though, personally..? I couldn't give two shits about race. I don't care if you're black, brown, green, purple... whatever. What I want is so much deeper: Your eye, man. I want those things you see through. \nCHRIS That's crazy. \nJIM Take it as a compliment. \nCHRIS You're not going to get away with this. \nJIM We have and we will. We'll be together soon, brother. \nThe television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying to pry free from his restraints, before his shoulders collapse with exhaustion. He lifts his head to a rip in the leather arm of the chair revealing its cotton stuffing. He looks at the cotton. We see Chris make a difficult decision. \nLATER... \nShe sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the light illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forth in the distance. She turns the light back on again. Chris' reflection is now behind hers. He looks savage; covered in blood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door. \nChris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room table. He goes for it. \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nChris runs through the dining room and finds his cell phone on the dining room table. \nChris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The loading screen comes up. \nChris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him. It's Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding her teacup and spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup... \nTING... \nChris knocks the cup out of her hand spraying hot water on her chest and face. She screams. \nThe cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris' face. Chris punches it out of the air. This has given Missy enough time to grab a knife. She lunges at Chris screaming psychotically. Chris can't pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabs the tea pot and cracks her in the head with it. She falls. He hits her one more time. Done. \nThe cat slinks out an open window. \nINT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nChris runs towards the front door. Before he can open it, he hears a footsteps running upstairs from the basement followed bloodcurdling scream from back in the kitchen: \nJEREMY (O.C.) Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! \nJeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris' back. The two roll around. \nChris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and uses it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter. \nChris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye. Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasp tripping him with an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges at Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his head on the coffee table. He's out. \nEXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT \nChris begins to run but then sees the beige sports car we recognize from the opening scene. He looks at Jeremy downed in the doorway and then at the keys in his hand. \nMoments later... \nINT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT \nChris is in the driver's seat. The tubular metal helmet sits next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turns on. There is a very small amount of batteries. He turns the ignition. The English to French tutorial comes on. \nTUTORIAL I seem to have misplaced my passport. Je crois avoi egare mon passeport. \nChris peels off, driving fast through the field into the night. He dials 911. \n911 OPERATOR 911 emergency, I'm at the home of Dean and Missy Armitage-- \nChris looks in the rearview mirror as the house gets smaller behind him. All of a sudden, BAM! The car slams into and over Georgina, who, in the night, seems to come out of nowhere. The phone falls. \nCHRIS Ahhhh! \nTUTORIAL Can you direct me to the nearest hospital? Pouvez-vous me diriger vers I'hopital le plus proche? \nHe drives on a few more seconds on a flat tire but then stops the car. Chris breathes heavy. \nCHRIS (TO HIMSELF) No... no... Don't do it... Just get the fuck gotta here... Just go! Just... Fuck! \nChris puts the car in reverse and drives backwards beside the motionless bloody heap that is Georgina. \nTUTORIAL Where is the nearest train station? Ou est la gare la plus proche? \nHe looks back at the house which is now filling with smoke. \nChris quickly gets out of the car and lifts what's left of Georgina's mangled unconscious body into the passenger's seat of the car. He shuts the door and gets in the driver's seat. He floors it. \nAfter a moment of driving, Georgina's eyes open and she rises. The wig slides off her head revealing an old surgical scar around the top of her head. Chris hasn't noticed her yet. He reaches for his phone. \nTUTORIAL (CONT'D) Can you please call the police? Pouvez-vous s'il vous plait appelez la police? \nAnnoyed, Chris turns off the sound system just before Georgina grabs his face and scratches it. \nGEORGINA Ahhhhh!! \n", "test1_input": "Chris snaps to. He nods and takes out his phone. \nEXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK ROAD - DAY \nA cop car is now pulled up to where the deer was hit. OFFICER FROSTIE - Caucasian - 33 stands near the deer. Another officer, OFFICER CROW - 40 - Caucasian with a patronizing smirk, stands by the driver's side window of Rose's car which Rose and Chris are both back in. \nINT. ROSE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nOFFICER CROWE So in the future the number to call is Animal Control Services. \nRose doesn't like the way he's looking at them. \nCHRIS Right. That makes sense. \nOFFICER CROWE You two coming up from the city? \nCHRIS Yeah. \nOFFICER CROWE And what brings you up-- \nROSE I'm from here. The Lake Pontaco area? We're going home. \nOFFICER CROWE (TO CHRIS) You got a driver's license? \nCHRIS Oh... yeah. \nChris gives Rose a \"see?\" Look as he gets his license. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I mean, I don't have a driver's license, I have a state I.D. \nROSE I was driving. \nOFFICER CROWE I didn't ask who was driving. I asked him for his I.D. \nROSE My boyfriend shouldn't have to show you his I.D. because he hasn't done anything wrong. \nOFFICER CROWE Ma'am, any time there is an INCIDENT-- \nROSE No, fuck that! \nCHRIS Baby. It's okay-- \nROSE (TO CROWE) It's bullshit, and you know it. \nThere is a tense silence. Officer Crowe's walkie chimes in. \nOFFICER FROST (O.C.) Everything alright up there Crowsie? \nOfficer Crowe stares Rose down. After a moment he presses his walkie button. \nOFFICER CROWE Yeah, I'm all good. \nHe hands Chris his I.D. \nOFFICER CROWE (CONT'D) You guys be careful. \nEXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY \nThe car winds through a thickly wooded road. \nINT. ROSE'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nChris sits in the passenger's seat deep in thought. He watches Rose with a new awe. Rose notices. She shrugs. \nROSE What? I'm not gonna let anyone fuck with my man. \nCHRIS That was some ride or die shit, baby. I like that. \nRose smiles at him. \nROSE We're here. \nEXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - AFTERNOON \n", "test1_true": "As they drive through the large front lawn, Chris sees WALTER, African American 35 in the distance facing away. Walter wears a gardening hat and trims hedges. He works slowly and methodically. \nROSE (TO CHRIS) That's the grounds-keeper... I think his name is Walter. \nRose parks in front of the house, and. He has a pleasant smile. Rose gets out of the car and waves. \nROSE (CONT'D) Hi! \nWalter turns and waves back. Chris gets out and waves too. \nCHRIS (TO WALTER) Hey! What's up? \nWalter waves silently. Odd. \nAs Chris gets the luggage from the trunk, Rose runs to the front door and RINGS the DOORBELL. FOOTSTEPS. The door swings open revealing... \nDEAN ARMITAGE, 59, a tall, balding, barrel-chested, bear hug of a man. Though clearly smart, Dean has an endearing cockiness and a bad case of Dad humor. He is the kind of guy who pronounces garbage, Gar-bahge. \nAnd... MISSY ARMITAGE, 56, A beautiful beacon of intellectual patience. She is poised and warm; relaxed and in control. They stand in the shadows of the doorway smiling. Rose hugs her parents. \nROSE Hi!!! \nDEAN MISSY There's my girl! Hello sweetheart. \nROSE (CONT'D) I miss you guys. \nMISSY We miss you, Ro Ro. \nChris approaches with the bags. \nCHRIS Hi. \nROSE Chris, these are my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Chris. \nCHRIS Good to finally meet you... \nChris holds his hand out. \nDEAN Mr. Armitage will do. \nCHRIS Sure. \nDEAN I got him. (TO CHRIS) Come here. \nDean grabs Chris' arm and pulls Chris in tight. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Call me Dean. We hug around here, Fella. \nCHRIS Alright. \nDEAN My wife Missy. \nCHRIS I've heard so much about you guys. \nMissy holds Chris' shoulders and examines his face and chest. \nMISSY Yes, you'll do just fine. So handsome. \nROSE Can we get inside before you guys start embarrassing me? \nMISSY Of course, come inside, make yourself at home. \nCHRIS I'm fine with the embarrassing by the way; go ahead. \nMissy and Dean laugh. The four enter the house. Missy shuts the door behind them. \nOutside, Walter watches as his smile fades away. He slowly turns and goes back to work. \nINT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY \nA wonderful house looms ahead. The interior is worldly and interesting; clean and homey. Several paintings of castles and medieval battles accent the walls. Taxidermy. One wall is all bookshelf, and there is a fireplace. \n", "test2_input": "Dean signals \"5, 6.\" Mr. Greene raises his hand. Dean points. \nDean signals \"5, 8.\" Mrs. Deets raises her hand. Dean points. \nDean signals \"6.\" Jim Hudson raises both his hands and signals \"10.\" His chauffeur stands beside him whispering in his ear. Dean points at him. \nDean scans the crowd signalling \"10, 2?\" \"10, 2?\" The crowd looks around. No one is challenging. Dean smiles. Finally Dean bangs his fist onto his open palm and points to Jim Hudson. Jim's chauffeur whispers in his ear. \nThe guests clap in a mixture of delight and disappointment. \nEXT. LAKESIDE - DUSK \nChris and Rose sit watching the sunset over the lake. Chris kisses her hand. He hears the faint APPLAUSE in the distance. He looks in the direction of the house. \nCHRIS I told you about the night my mom died. How I didn't call 911; didn't go out looking for her. \nROSE BABY-- \nCHRIS One hour went by, then two, three... I just sat there... I just watched TV. \nROSE It wasn't your fault-- \nCHRIS I found out later she had survived the initial hit. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) She laid there bleeding by the side of the road all night, cold and alone. And that's how she died in the early morning... Cold and alone. And I was watching TV. (MORE) \nCHRIS (CONT'D) There was time. If someone was looking for her, there was time. But no one was looking. \nChris cries. Rose embraces him. \nROSE You were just a kid. \nCHRIS Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna leave here without you. I`m not going to abandon you. Never. \nThey share a moment of pure love. \nROSE Fuck it. Come on. Let's go back home. \nCHRIS Yeah? \nROSE Yeah. I mean, you're right. This sucks. I'll go back with you. I'll make something up. \nCHRIS I love you. \nROSE I love you too. \nThe two get up and walk back toward the house. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - DUSK \nChris and Rose approach the house as the last of the guests get into their cars and drive off. The fireflies are out. \nCHRIS That was fast. \nROSE Yeah. \nThe guests wave to Dean and Missy, who stand at the front door, and then to Chris and Rose. Lisa Deets, the trophy wife, is tipsy. Nelson is in their car. \nLISA Bye Chris! It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you-- \nChris and Rose wave. \nNELSON Come on, Lisa. Before you say something stupid. \nChris laughs. Walter shuts the car door behind Lisa. Walter stands pleasantly watching the cars leave. He turns to Chris with the same `ol smile. Chris and Rose enter the house. \nINT. ARMITAGE BATHROOM - DUSK \nSink running. Chris washes his hands and looks in the mirror. \nHis phone SIGNALS a text message from Rod. It's picture from the internet of witches in a circle around a man being sacrificed followed by the text message. \"You dead yet?\" Chris texts back. \"Bruh, you have no idea.\" He finds the picture he took of Logan/Andre on his phone and sends it. \nMoments later, his phone vibrates. \n", "test2_true": "INT. CHRIS' APARTMENT - DUSK \nRod is on the phone. \nROD That's Dre. \nCHRIS Dre? \nROD Andre um... Hayworth! Yeah! He used to kick it with Veronica. \nCHRIS Veronica from... \nROD ...Teresa's sister! Worked at the movie theatre on 8th; \nROD (CONT'D) got us into the movie a couple of times; Rush hour 2 and, um Usual Suspect. \nCHRIS Yeah. That is him. But... \nROD ...But what? \nCHRIS This is so fuckin' crazy. He's different now. \nROD Different? How? \nCHRIS Different. Slower... I mean he was street; now he's all like... white- seeming.

No batteries. \nINT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nChris' phone lays on the dresser plugged in. He's in a hurry now. He packs his small bag and looks out the window. One car remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first to have arrived for the party: Jim Hudson's. The driver brings the dog to the back seat. He gets a green envelope from the glove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front door. She accepts it silently. \nThe driver drives away without Jim. \nChris goes to leave Rose's room. Her closet creaks open. Chris sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it. \nHe takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play. \nThe next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie. Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at different ages in different class plays. \nFinally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It's a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the ride up. Under the image are written the words. \"X-mas 2014\" Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy. Underneath, the caption \"Memorial Day 2013\" \nHe continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately. \"Thanksgiving 2009\" Walter looks different in the picture. He isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger. \nROSE (EMOTIONLESS) What are you doing? \nRose stands there in the doorway behind him. Chris subtly drops the pictures back in the shoebox. \nCHRIS Um... Looking for my camera. \nRose points to her desk. He grabs his bag and the camera. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Where are the keys..? I gotta put our bags in the trunk. \nROSE Walter can do that. \nCHRIS Nah, I'll do it. \nRose is truly distant for the first time. A different person. She is methodical and emotionless. The jig is up, and now she is now phoning it in. \nROSE I was just looking for them. I'm such a mess, will you help me? \nChris walks out the door, leaving Rose. \nINT. FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test3_input": "Rose follows Chris down the stairs. \nROSE Chris... What's wrong? \nCHRIS Nothing. \nJeremy stands near the front door twirling his lacrosse stick.

The party's just getting started. \nCHRIS I'm going to the car; see if we left the keys in there. \nMISSY I just made tea. \nCHRIS I'm good. \nThe family is silent. Missy's glare pierces Chris. He avoids eye contact. \nROSE Oh, I know where they are. In my bag. Duh. \nMISSY You're leaving us. \nCHRIS Yeah. \nMISSY Is something wrong? \nCHRIS No. Well, yeah...

What is your purpose..? \nCHRIS Right now, it's finding the keys. \nDEAN We've been looking for our purpose for such a long time. Fire has mesmerized man since the Stone Age. It is a reflection of our impermanence in the world. Fire is born, it breathes and then it dies. \nCHRIS Rose... \nRose lamely rummages through her bag. \nROSE I'm looking. \nCHRIS Rose, what is this shit?! \nDEAN There's a reason we worship the Sun, Chris. He who lights the way through the darkness of life. He in all his glory was around long before us and will be here long after we are gone, but he too will die some day! That's right even the Sun God will die. It is no less mortal than we, but it inspires us to defy it! So what do we do?-- \nCHRIS --Rose.-- \nDEAN (UNHINGED) --What do we do?! We baptize ourselves in the firewater! (MORE) \nDEAN (CONT'D) We bathe in his reflection, for one chance to emerge having defied death! \nDEAN (CONT'D) You'd take that baptism wouldn't you, Chris? The baptism of immortality? \nCHRIS I was raised Episcopalian. \nChris starts toward the door, but his path is blocked by Jeremy swinging at air. \nJEREMY Whoa! Be careful, bro. \nMISSY Don't hurt him, Jeremy. \nJEREMY What? I'm not doing anything. \nDEAN Listen, Chris-- \n", "test3_true": "DEAN (Through tears of joyous MADNESS) I'm saying that we've found OUR PURPOSE!!! There must be a sacrifice! Sacrifice is essential for the righteous to achieve our true potential. A vessel must be comprised. A host must be born!!! \nCHRIS Rose! The keys!!! \nRose backs away. \nROSE Oh baby... You know I can't give you the keys. \nChris makes a run for the door. Missy CLINKS the cup with her SPOON. \nTING TING. TING TING. \nThe world instantly blurs around Chris. He begins to fall. He sees a flash. \nINT. DARKNESS \nChris falls through the abyss towards `The Sunken Place' again just like when he was hypnotized. The blue screen above him shows what his open eyes see. It's his own perspective falling to the floor. CRASH! The screen now shows the living room ceiling. Jeremy leans over him. \nJEREMY Oh shit! \nMISSY (O.S.) Is he hurt? \nCHRIS What the fuck? \nJEREMY Did you see him drop? \nDEAN (O.S.) He hit his head pretty good. \nROSE (O.S.) It's just a bump. He's fine. \nCHRIS Rose!!! \nMISSY (O.S.) Why do you push them, Dean? \nDEAN (O.S.) It's important to me that they acknowledge the purpose. \nMISSY (O.S.) Why do you think he ran? \nJEREMY (O.S.) Rose gave it away. \nROSE (O.S.) He already knew. \nMISSY (O.S.) Take him to the games room. Jeremy, get the legs. Dean, help him. \nJEREMY I can take him alone. \nMISSY (O.S.) No. We've already damaged him enough. Dean, please. \nChris continues to fall slowly further from the screen above which continues to show his body's POV as it is being lifted by Dean and Jeremy and carried out of the room. \nCHRIS Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit, shit... \nDEAN You're going to drop him. \nJEREMY No I'm not. \nMISSY (O.S.) Be careful what you say, everyone. He can hear every word. \nCHRIS Rose!!!! \nROSE (O.S.) It doesn't matter any more does it? \nA DOOR CREAKS open. Chris' body is taken downstairs into the darkness. The screen in the abyss goes dark. \nCHRIS No!! Help!!! Help!!!!! Help!!!!!! \nChris sinks, his screams are enveloped by the pitch back. \nINT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK - DAY \nRod sits by the bag x-ray but stares into space distracted by thought. GARY (40) a condescending supervisor snaps his fingers in Rod's face. \n"}

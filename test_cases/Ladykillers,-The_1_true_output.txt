Lump releases the sack. 
We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane. 
It thuds distantly onto the barge. The next sack has been passed up to Lump and is released. 
The cat watches. Its orange eyes blink. Its pupils adjust. 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT 
A PULL BACK shows that the cat is in fact back in the basement. 
Its POV: continued tunneling. 
Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise: 
At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening. 
A whistle from the General and Lump and Clark Pancake scramble from the tunnel. They whip a curtain over its opening and all men grab up their instruments as Dorr, covering with a cough, turns off the CD player. 
The General, his ever-present cigarette smoldering between his lips, tongue-and-lips it up and backwards so that it is inside his mouth, which he now closes. 
Marva Munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs. As the men come into view they are looking up at her, Lump holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and smeared with dirt. 
MRS. MUNSON That's okay, don't stop on account of me. 
Lump looks around, saucer-eyed, then blows gamely into his sackbutt. It sounds like goose farts until Dorr waves him down. 
DORR No no, madam, we were about to take a break anyway. The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and I think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation. 
MRS. MUNSON Huh. I just thought you might like to see-what a you gotten up to, honey? Why you sweatin' like that. 
It is directed at Lump, who looks down at his own sweat- stained undershirt. 
LUMP I, uh... 
GAWAIN That man plays one bitch barrelful a sackbutt. Ain't no one can blow the tenor sackbutt like Lump, hoowee! goes at that thing like it was a pu-- uh, like it was a woman! Goddamn! He-- 
She cuffs him on the head. 
MRS. MUNSON You mind! I don't want that kind of talk in my home, even in the root cellar. This is a Christian house, boy, none of that hippity-hop language. 
DORR Sadly, Gawain is given to-- 
WHAP! She slaps Gawain again. 
MRS. MUNSON Sometimes it's the only way! 
He untenses after what seemed like the final blow, but -- WHAP! -- she slaps him again. 
MRS. MUNSON ...I'm tryin' to help you, son! 
WHAP! 
MRS. MUNSON ...Better yaself! 
DORR As well you should, ma'am. But Gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance as to-- 
MRS. MUNSON Don't make no never-mind he's transported! 
Dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the stairs. 
DORR I understand your-- 
She pulls her elbow away and sniffs. 
MRS. MUNSON You been smokin'? 
DORR Certainly not, madam. I understand your indignation. And I was offering explanation, not excuse. I myself am offended by those who cannot find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to-- 
Gawain calls up the stairs: 
GAWAIN Don't you be explainin' me, dawg! You can't look into my mind, cape man! 
DORR Yes, yes... 
Dorr's tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of the stairs. 
DORR ...A fiery lad! But then Youth is fiery! A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era. 
MRS. MUNSON My youth I was in church, I wasn't walkin' around fiery. Youth ain't no excuse for nothin'! Well, anyway... only came down to show you the fife. 
She hands him a thick, roughly whittled piece of cane. Dorr holds it, looks at it dumbly. He is, for the first time that we have seen anyway, non-plussed. 
MRS. MUNSON ...Othar's fife. He burned his own. 
Dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their backs to the fireplace: 
DORR ...Did he? 
MRS. MUNSON Mm-hm. I thought maybe bein' a musical man you'd be interested.

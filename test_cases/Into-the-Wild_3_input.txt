With Tanaina Plantlore by his side, Chris digs into the soft earth on the berm of the river bank and digs up a wild potato root.

Chris pulls the seeds from the root, noshing on them as he reads from Doctor Zhivago. 
We drift from him reading to the diary/log on the wall. 
The day representing: July 24th 
The diary/log: WILD POTATO ROOT 
We drift back to Chris. Fatigue shows in his eyes as he puts the book down and lays down to sleep.

258   EXT. BUS - MORNING (JULY 30 1992)                         258 
WIDE SHOT of the bus. It's a beautiful July morning. Birds chirp in the trees. A soft breeze sweeping down from the mountains massages the valley below. 
We SLOWLY ZOOM into the bus. CUT TO: 
259   INT./EXT. BUS - SAME                                      259 
The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to his feet. 
Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps. From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest. 
We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him. He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible" beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there might be more. 
The word - POISON 
jumps off the page at him. 
The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato root and warns that those with: lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of wild sweet peas are poisonous. 
The words - ...leading to partial motor paralysis... 
...inhibition of digestion... 
...nausea, starvation... ECU:   ...STARVATION 
CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate plight.

Chris kneels, holding one of the potato seeds to the sunlight and there we see them - 
the lateral veins that indicate poisonous seeds.

Chris, barely able to walk, moves, at the pace of an elderly man, with his rifle, through the underbrush.    He needs food now.

He shoots a squirrel. But as he moves toward what he thinks is his kill, the squirrel makes off with a bleeding tail. Chris fires several desperate shots at the squirrel but misses with each one.

Chris, having a fitful sleep.   Short breaths and mutterings. 
CUT TO: 
265   EXT. CLEARING AROUND BUS - NIGHT                          265 
A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls from the tree. The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days through visions of the nature about in varying light. CUT TO: 
266   EXT. SUSHANA RIVER - DAY                                  266 
Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full. He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening. He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs. It's all he can do just to breath. 
WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the river's edge catching his breath framed against the background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently climbed with ease. 
Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him. 
CU OVER BEAR onto Chris: Chris, passive to the bear's presence. 
ANGLE: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as though he didn't represent enough of anything to eat.

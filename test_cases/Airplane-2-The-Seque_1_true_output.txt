DETECTIVE HALLICK No blood.  No body.  No bones.  No eyes. No ears.  No throats. 
McCROSKY (looking at form) This is $500,000 worth of insurance! 
Kruger, Commissioner, and Hallick all whistle "wow!" 
McCROSKY Just a second.  This is insurance on his car! 
MRS. SALUCCI That's what worries me. 
KRUGER He's impotent. 
COMMISSIONER He's suicidal. 
ALL And he's stupid! 
MUSIC:  DRAMATIC STING. 
ANOTHER AREA 
MR. COFFEE (into radio) This is it, Striker.  You got one shot and one shot only. 
INT. CABIN 
Striker stands over the coffee machine, sweating like mad. The Passengers with cups hang over him. He makes contact with a wire. 
TED (to self) Contact. 
The MACHINE EXPLODES.  Coffee gushes out like an oil well coming in.  The Passengers dance under the gusher of brown liquid, mouths open and cheering. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
McCROSKY How are we going to handle this bomb nut? 
CONTROLLER 2 (rushes up with printouts) Here are the tests we ran on their computer.  I had them Â­xeroxed for you. 
McCROSKY How'd they come out? 
CONTROLLER 2 Upside-down, but I turned each page over and put them in order.  I'm afraid that computer is totally capable of taking control of that ship. 
McCROSKY Let's keep cool.  There's gotta be a way to control it. 
He lights a cigarette. 
CONTROLLER 3 (rushes up with diagrams) These are their position calculations. They've got about ten minutes before they start to burn up. 
McCROSKY Keep calm.  A lot can happen in ten minutes. (to self) What next? 
He sips his coffee. 
CONTROLLER 4 (rushes in) Sir, your headlights are on and your doors are locked! 
McCROSKY (spitting out coffee, Danny Thomas style) Jesus!!  I'll be right back! 
McCrosky races out. 
EXT. SHIP - SPACE 
It heads closer to the sun.  The nose is glowing. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Elaine is checking computer.  The cockpit is steaming now. She unbuttons her uniform just as Ted comes in. 
ELAINE Ted, we've only got ten minutes. 
TED (thinking she wants sex) Not now, Elaine. 
ELAINE I mean until we start to burn up. 
Ted takes his seat and looks at a panel gauge. 
TED We're closer to the sun than I estimated. 
INSERT - GAUGES 
One is labeled "EXACT DISTANCE" and reads, "76.50".  The other is labeled "ESTIMATED DISTANCE" and reads, 
BACK TO SCENE 
KRUGER (V.O.) Come in, Mayflower.  This is Bud Kruger. Over. 
TED (on radio) This is Striker. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
KRUGER (on radio) Look, Striker, I don't know how you got into that driver's seat but I want Simon Kurtz on that radio and I want him now! 
INT. COCKPIT 
TED (on radio) Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program. 
ELAINE That was very well put, Ted. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
Jacobs stands next to Kruger rubbing his forefingers together in the "shame, shame" sign. 
KRUGER (on radio) Striker, you're heading right for the sun, so don't you think it's a little late for that bleeding heart liberal crap now? 
INT. COCKPIT 
ELAINE He's got a point, Ted.

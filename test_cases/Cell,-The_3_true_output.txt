RAMSEY (CONT'D) Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique. 
NOVAK Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked. 
TEDDY LEE The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match. 
NOVAK It's his dog. 
Ramsey holds up a thick list. 
RAMSEY Registered breeders of German Shepherds. 
The list is long and a few of the cops GROAN.  Novak silences them with a fierce look that says, "I will not rest until this man is found and neither should you." 
NOVAK Be thorough, but be fast.  This guy's accelerating. He only waited six days this last time. When he started, two months could pass. 
A DESK SEARGENT enters the room and hands a FAX to Ramsey. Novak is curious about it, but continues. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) This can mean different things.  He thinks we're stupid and can't catch him. He's having fun and needs more.  Or... (thinking it through) This dog hair thing is sloppy.  The body this morning was found in less than three inches of water.  He knew we'd find her.  He wants to be caught.  But if we can't stop him... 
Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room. 
NOVAK (CONT'D) (dreading what's on that fax) ...he can't stop himself. 
INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
Stargher, the awful PAIN eating away at his skull.  He searches the medicine chest. 
DISTORTED VOICE Me god feed on pain. 
The VOICE echoing inside his skull. 
DISTORTED VOICE (CONT'D) Pain good.  Cumm home to meee... 
INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Struggling to stay on his feet, he moves to the KITCHEN. Valentine paces nervously, whimpering concern.  Stargher reaches for a bottle of vodka but falls to the floor. Valentine BARKS, but gets no reaction from master.  We MOVE IN on Stargher's unblinking eyes. 
DISTORTED VOICE Go sleep Carl.  Me god wake up now. 
INT. THE CELL - DAY 
Julia Hickson finds the snack foods, drinking spigot, toilet, shower, and drain.  Her bare feet try to adjust to the tile floor, but it's fucking cold.  She glimpses herself in the mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl. 
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
A TAN SEDAN sits in the driveway of this modest middle-class home.  A VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR sits nearby, a deputy keeping watch. 
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
A distraught middle-aged couple, MR. AND MRS. HICKSON, sit on the couch of their living room.  FAMILY PHOTOS show them with Julia, whose fiancee, John, does his best to comfort the mother.  Novak and Ramsey have the unfortunate task of interviewing them about their daughter's disappearance. 
RAMSEY She was still living at home? 
MR. HICKSON Yes, sir. 
JOHN We were looking at apartments. 
MR. HICKSON (important they know) But nobody was moving in together 'til after the wedding. 
Novak hasn't said much.  Instead, he looks at something in his hands - a plastic evidence bag containing the TOY DOLL. 
RAMSEY John, you came to pick her up when?

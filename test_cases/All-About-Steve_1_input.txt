TNT. KITCHEN - DAY A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second between each one. 
MARY (V.O.) Vita aenigma est. Life is a puzzle. It is. Specifically, life is most like a crossword puzzle. There are a million reasons why, not the least of which is that life, like crosswords, requires the use of your whole entire brain- Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills all over the puzzle. 
MARY Crap. The puzzle answers all run together. 
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty except for one. In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to herself. 
MARY Four letter word for... vomit. She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help. 
MARY Not "barf". For sure not "barf". That's too easy. "Puke" is okay, but maybe a bit pedestrian (that means boring)... I like "hurl". I do. I like the way it rolls off your tongue -- the word, I mean. But my all time favorite is none of those. She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it together. 
MARY Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E- W. Spew... Sp-ew. A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER walks out. A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals to Mary. 
TEACHER We're ready for you now. (a plastic Kroger shopping Mary jumps up, grabs her purse bag). 
MARY Jesus help me. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, "CAREER DAY" written in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the class of 10 year old KIDS. The Teacher reads from her notes. 
TEACHER Here's a treat, students. Our final guest for Career Day, Miss Mary Horowitz, is the crossword constructor for the Atlanta Citizen. You know the crossword puzzles you see every week in the newspaper? It's her job to create them. Isn't that fun? Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers. 
MARY You weren't supposed to tell them. 
TEACHER Pardon me? 
MARY I made a crossword puzzle to help them guess what my job is. You ruined it. 
TEACHER Oh, I'm so sorry. 
Mary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at them like lost puppies. 
TEACHER Maybe you could tell them a bit about what your job is like? watche s hit

MARY People do crossword puzzles all the time but they don't often think of the person who made all the words fit together, and who thought up the clues, and who made sure the little black squares at the top mirror the ones at the bottom. She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile. 
MARY Crossword constructors usually have above average intelligence, with knowledge of just about every subject you can imagine. And it helps if they can spell. The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets serious, sweeps her hand through the air. 
MARY Imagine, for a moment, a world without crossword puzzles. A world- Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her off. 
TEACHER Daniel, you have a question? 
DANIEL You make a living doing that? Just making puzzles? The Atlanta Citizen only comes out on Fridays. One puzzle a week can't make you enough to live on. A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up. 
LARGE KID How do you pay your rent? 
MARY My parents -

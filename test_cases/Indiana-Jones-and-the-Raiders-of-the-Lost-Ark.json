{"train": "\"RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK\" \nScreenplay by \nLawrence Kasdan \nStory by \nGeorge Lucas \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PERU - HIGH JUNGLE - DAY \nThe dense, lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of the Andes, the place known as \"The Eyebrow of the Jungle\". Ragged, jutting canyon walls are half-hidden by the thick mists. \nThe MAIN TITLE is followed by this: \nPERU \nA narrow trail across the green face of the canyon. A group of men make their way along it. At the head of the party is an American, INDIANA JONES. He wears a short leather jacket, a flapped holster, and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather stuck in the band. Behind him come two Spanish Peruvians, SATIPO and BARRANCA. Bringing up the rear are five Yagua INDIANS. They act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily- packed llamas. The Indians become increasingly nervous. They speak to each other in bursts of Quechua. The American, who is known to his friends as Indy, glances back at them. \nBARRANCA (irritated) They're talking about the Curse again! \nHe turns and yells at the Indians in Quechua, his anger giving an indication of his own fears. The party reaches a break in the canyon wall and takes the trail through it. \nWhen they emerge, their destination is revealed to them in the distance. Beyond a thick stand of trees is the vegetation- enshrouded TEMPLE OF THE CHACHAPOYAN WARRIORS. \nThe entire party is struck by the sight. The Indians, terrified now, chatter away. Suddenly the three at the back turn and run, dropping their packs as they go. Barranca yells at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol out. He starts to raise his arm to aim but Indy restrains it in a muscular grip. \nINDY No. \nBarranca looks evilly at Indy's hand upon him. Indy releases him and smiles in a friendly way. \nINDY We don't need them. \nSatipo watches this confrontation with some concern. \nBARRANCA I do not carry supplies. \nINDY We'll leave them. Once we've got it, we'll be able to reach the plane by dusk. \nHe turns back to the trail. Satipo gets the two remaining Indians moving behind Indy. Satipo and Barranca then have a fast, silent communication: Barranca indicates his desire to slit Indy's throat; Satipo gives him a look that says \"Be patient, you idiot\". \nTHE APPROACH TO THE TEMPLE \nThe party fans out to fight their way through the entwined trees that guard the temple. Visibility is cut to five feet in the heavy mist. Satipo extracts a short, native dart from a tree and examines the point gingerly \nSATIPO (showing Indy) The Hovitos are near. The poison is still fresh... three days. They're following us, I tell you. \nINDY If they knew we were here, they would have killed us already. \nThe two Indiana jabber in Quechua, near hysteria. Barranca is sweating profusely, eyes darting. He yells at the Indians in Quechua to \"shut up\". \nIn the undergrowth, there is slithering movement. \nIndian #1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a horrific stone sculpture of a Chachapoyan demon. The Indian is so frightened no sound comes out when he screams. He turns and runs silently away. \nIndian #2 calls to his friend. Getting no response, he steps in that direction. A huge macaw, flushed from the undergrowth, screams and flies away. Indian #2 does exactly the same thing, never to be seen again. \nINDY Forrestal. \nSATIPO (gulps) We can go no further. \nINDY Now, Satipo, we don't want to be discouraged by every little thing. \nIndy steps sideways into the chamber. His back pressed against the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves along the edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the other side. Satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through. \nSTAIRWAY \nIndy and Satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing. Framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing the opening even more. \nINDY (taking torch) Let me see that. \nHe lowers the torch to the floor of the landing. The landing is carpeted with human skeletons, one on top of another, all squashed flat as cardboard. Satipo gasps. Indy looks up at the ceiling of the landing, then steps onto skeletons, which make a cracking noise under his feet. \nINDY Try not to touch the vines. \nFOYER OF THE SANCTUARY \nThe men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long. \nThe door at the end is flooded with sunlight. \nSATIPO Se\u00f1or, I think we are very close. \nIndy stands still looking at the hall. \nSATIPO (impatient) Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear here. \nINDY That's what scares me. \nThey begin walking down the hall side by side. Satipo has inched a little ahead. Suddenly his lead foot comes down and through the floor! As Satipo begins to pitch forward, Indy grabs him by the belt and pulls him back. They both look down at the \"floor\". \nIndy swings his whip across the floor. Fifteen feet of it cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black pit as wide as the hall. The illusory floor was made of dust- covered cobwebs. Satipo picks up a stone and drops it down the pit. No sound. The two men exchange glances. Indy looks up at the high roof of the hall. He swings the whip up around a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings over the pit on the whip. From the other side he swings the whip back to Satipo, who throws Indy the torch. Satipo swings across. When they are both standing on solid floor there is a moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below - SPLASH! Indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves it strung to the beam for quick retreat. \nTHE SANCTUARY \nA large, domed room. Ten evenly-spaced skylights send their shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor: white and black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate pattern. Indy and Satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room at the altar. There, in the supreme hallowed spot, is a tiny jeweled figurine, Indy's real objective. \nTwo torches, many years old, are in holders by the door. Indy takes one down and lights it. He gives the regular torch to Satipo. \nSATIPO There's plenty of light, amigo. \nIndy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out and tap a white tile. It is solid. He taps a black tile. There is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch. Satipo points to the wall nearby: there is a recessed hole there. \nSATIPO From that hole! \nIndy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary. The entire room is honey-comed with the same kind of hole. Satipo sees it too and is properly impressed. \nINDY You wait here. \nSATIPO If you insist, se\u00f1or. \nTorch in hand, Indy begins his careful walk across the sanctuary. Stepping only on the white tiles, he almost appears to be doing a martial arts kata. Before each big move he waves the torch in front of him head to toe, looking at the flame. Halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels to look at it. \nA dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. Its body is riddled with little deadly darts. This has great significance to Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current whips at the flame. Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it. \nSatipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified. \nBELLOQ Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong friends. This time it will cost you. \nBelloq extends his hand. Indy looks at it, then produces the idol and hands it to Belloq. Belloq extends his other hand, smiling. Indy hands over his gun. Belloq sticks it in his jacket. \nBELLOQ And you thought I'd given up. \nINDY (eyeing the Hovitos) Too bad they don't know you like I do, Belloq. \nBELLOQ (smiles) Yes, too bad. You could warn them... if only you spoke Hovitos. \nWith that, Belloq turns dramatically and holds the idol high for all the Hovitos to see and says something in Hovitos. There is a murmur of recognition and all the Indians, including Belloq's escorts, prostrate themselves upon the ground, heads down. \nIndy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the clearing. \nBELLOQ (in Hovitos) Kill him! \nAT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING \nIndy disappears into the foliage. An instant later, the leaves are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears. \nEXT. THE JUNGLE - INDY'S RUN - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY \nIndy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain. And always close behind, a swift gang of angry Hovitos. Occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or spear whizzing past Indy's head. \nEXT. THE URUBAMBA RIVER - DUSK \nAn amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff. Sitting on the wing is JOCK, the British pilot. Indy breaks out of some distant brush and runs along the path at the top of the cliff. \nINDY (yelling) Get it going! Get it going! \nJock hops in and fires up the plane's engines. Indy reaches a spot on the cliff above the place, glances back, them jumps into the river. He comes up, swims to the plane and grabs a strut. \nINDY GO! \nJock starts the plane moving across the water as Indy walks across the wing and falls into the passenger compartment. \nINT. JOCK'S PLANE - DUSK \nIndy relaxes and lies across the seat, a big smile on his face. One hand drops to the floor of the cabin and Indy jumps, hitting his head. On the floor of the cabin is a huge boa constrictor. Indy tries to get his whole body onto the seat. Jock sees what's happening. \nJOCK Don't mind him. That's Reggie. Wouldn't hurt a soul. \nINDY I can't stand snakes. \nJOCK The world's full of them, you know. \nINDY I hate them. \nJOCK Come on now, Sport, show a little of the old backbone. \nEXT. JOCK'S PLANE - TWILIGHT \nIt soars off over the dark jungle. \nINT. INDY'S OFFICE, SMALL EASTERN COLLEGE - DAY \nIt's autumn and the pretty, New England campus out Indy's window reflects it in dazzling color. A few weeks before the start of classes. Activity just picking up. Some students about. \nIndy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks quite different in this setting. His outfit is tweedy, slightly rumpled in the professional style. Part of his attention is focused in a book and he wears glasses to see the fine print. The office is cramped, absolutely inundated with books, maps, etchings and archeological artifacts. In fact, the only neat spot in the room right now is Indy's desk, which has been cleared off expressly for the benefit of - \nEATON (to Musgrove) Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of it. \nAgain the military men have a silent communication, deciding what to reveal. \nMUSGROVE Well... you must understand, Dr. Jones, this is all strictly confidential. \nINDY I understand. \nMUSGROVE Yesterday, one of our European sections intercepted a Nazi communiqu\u00e9 from Cairo to Berlin. We don't quite know what to make of it. \nMusgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase. \nMUSGROVE Here it is - \"Tanis development proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai. Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S.\" \nBrody is excited. He looks at Indy. \nBRODY Tanis. They must have discovered the lost ruins. \nIndy contemplates this big news; he's impressed. \nINDY (to himself) Tanis. Ain't that somethin'! \nEATON Frankly, we're a little suspicious... An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable. \nINDY Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi. \nEATON Then what do they want him for? \nINDY They're looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra. \nMUSGROVE (indicates his sheet) But it says here that's in China. \nINDY Only half of it. Ravenwood had the other half. \nEATON What would the Nazis want with this - this Staff of Ra? \nBRODY I can tell you that. Over the last two years the Nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts. \nMUSGROVE That's right. Hitler's a nut on the subject. Crazy. He's obsessed with the occult. \nEATON What is this Staff of Ra, anyway? \nINDY It all has to do with the Ark of the Covenant. (the Army guys look mystified) The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments. \nNow it's the Army men who are impressed. \nINDY An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark from Jerusalem and took it back to the city of Tanis. A short time later, Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm that lasted a year. But before that, the Pharaoh had had the Ark hidden away in a secret chamber called the Well of the Souls. Which is where the Staff of Ra comes in. \nIndy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch to give a rough idea of the system as he describes it. (and we get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthusiastic teacher he must be). \nINDY Now this was rather clever. The Staff was really just a big stick - oh, I don't know, say like this - (he indicates about six feet) no one really knows for sure. Any way, it was capped by an elaborate headpiece with a carving of the sun at the top. What you had to do was take the Staff to a special map room in Tanis - it had the whole city laid out in miniature on the floor. When you placed the Staff in a certain spot in this room, at a certain time of day, the sun would shine through a hole here in the headpiece and then send a beam of light down here - to the map - giving you the location of the Well of the Souls... \nMUSGROVE ...where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. \nINDY (nods) Which is probably what the Nazis are after. \nEATON What's this Ark look like? \nINDY Look like? Why, it's right here... \nIndy's manner is vigorous, aggressive. \nINDY Okay, here's the way it's gonna be. First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai and get the piece from General Hok. Then I think I know where I can find Ravenwood. If only I can get - \nBRODY General Hok's a tough customer. They don't call him the Wild Boar for nothing. And he's tied in with the Japanese. \nINDY I'll worry about that when the time comes. My only hope is to find the Well of the Souls before the Nazis do. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. IN THE AIR - DAY / NIGHT \nA Pan Am Clipper flies west over the Pacific. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. KEHOE'S CAR (SHANGHAI AIRPORT) - DAY \nIndy is barely into the front seat of a dilapidated Ford as the driver, BUZZ KEHOE, is peeling out into traffic. In the back seat is a Chinese named BANG CHOW. Kehoe zigs crazily through traffic with only his left hand as he reaches over to shake with Indy. \nKEHOE Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You've met Bang Chow. \nINDY What's the hurry? \nKEHOE Some German agents got here two hours ago. Luckily, Bang was able to have them detained at Customs. We'll have to hurry. \nEXT. HOK'S STREET - DAY \nKehoe's car emerges from an alley. Down the block is Tengtu Hok's modest, walled palace. Kehoe's car slows a bit and Bang steps from the moving car with a small black suitcase in his hand. While he heads down the street toward Hok's place, Kehoe's car continues across the street and into an alley on the other side. \nEXT. HOK'S STREET - IN FRONT OF PALACE - DAY \nA Mercedes limousine appears round a corner and squeals to a stop at the front gate of the palace, which is manned by a sturdy Chinese Gateman. There are three Germans inside, one the driver. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOK'S MUSEUM - DAY \nKehoe, alone now, pushes a trash container casually into position to hide a newly created hole in the rear wall of Hok's Museum where several stone blocks have been removed. He looks around and ambles back to the car. \nINT. HOK'S PALACE - ENTRY HALL \nThe three Germans wait impatiently in a magnificent foyer. A chime sounds and huge double doors open to reveal TENGTU HOK, flanked by two uniformed Japanese Soldiers and a robed Chinese Advisor. He wears a fantastic gold ornamental robe. Despite the majesty, however, nothing can disguise the fact that Hok is basically a wild, fat barbarian; an animal. Hok and his escort group bow in what is the beginning of a long welcoming ceremony. The Germans exchange impatient glances but decide they should play it as it comes. They bow. \nINT. HOK'S MUSEUM \nNo person in sight. Instead, we see a magnificent display of ancient artifacts. Glass cases hold the velvet-couched pieces at random spots on the shining marble floor. We hear an odd sound. Near the floor on the rear wall of the museum, a steel ventilation grate moves. A hand slides it gently across the marble. Indy sticks his head out and looks around. \nINT. HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM \nThe three Germans are being served tea and exotic delicacies. A pleased Tengtu Hok watches from a throne-cushion. When the tray of tiny delicacies is presented to him, he takes a massive handful, crushing them together on their way to his smiling mouth. \nINT. HOK'S MUSEUM \nA huge golden gong, seven feet in diameter, is suspended from the ceiling by a hook. An enormous hammer hangs poised above it, from which emanate myriad tiny threads which run up and across the ceiling, then down to the various display cases. Indy looks up at the gong, then continues his quick, quiet foray among the cases. Beyond him, a high window. \nINT. HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM \nHok and his visitors stand to go. The German's pleased expressions make it clear they're finally on their way to the museum. \nINT. HOK'S MUSEUM \nINDY (he's felt better) Great. Got it. \nKehoe guns it, throwing Indy back against the cushions. \nKEHOE What now? \nINDY I've got to get to Nepal. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. DC-3 IN THE AIR - DUSK \nThe plane flies west into the sunset. \nINT. DC-3 - NIGHT \nUnder a meager seat light, Indy is pouring over a journal article by Abner Ravenwood and related map of Nepal. \nA few rows back, across the aisle, a trenchcoated European Spy eyes Indy. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. \"THE RAVEN\" SALOON - PATAN, NEPAL - NIGHT \nA huge stuffed raven, wings spread wide, is mounted behind the long bar in the noisy, crowded saloon. A lively mix of patrons is represented in the late hour tableau: Nepalese natives, fierce Sherpa mountain guides, sleazy international smugglers and fugitives, and, of course, mountain climbers from every corner of the earth. A tall Nepalese, MAHDLO, is the bartender. \nIn a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly between the groups at two neighboring tables. Ferocious representatives from each table - one a wild-looking SHERPA, the other a muscular Australian CLIMBER - jump up to face each other. As the two contenders stand poised for action, their respective supporters shift in their places, fondling lethal ice axes and clubs. \nSHERPA Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik! \nCLIMBER Aye! That'll be your last word. \nThe bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling clarity when - a door behind the bar slams open with a huge BANG! and some Presence, too small to be seen as it moves through the forest of towering patrons, makes a beeline for the troubled corner of the bar. A path clears for it. \nThe Sherpa and the Climber are about to kill each other when the Presence arrives directly between them: she is MARION RAVENWOOD, twenty-five years old, beautiful, if a bit hard- looking. At this moment, however, that look does not hurt. She is not intimidated by the combatants; she jabs accusatory fingers into their chests. She is angry as hell. The patrons shrink under her gaze. \nMARION That does it! I've been patient with you no-goods long enough. I'm not open at 2 o'clock for myself, you know. It's all for you. And how do you repay me: Trouble and noise and blood on my floor! I won't have it. Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed. Closed! Do your killing outside! And don't leave any bodies on the porch! \nThe place clears quickly. Stragglers and grumblers are given special attention by Marion and Mahdlo, who has come from behind the bar carrying a big axe handle. Mahdlo herds the crows out the front door as Marion turns and walks behind the bar. \nA scowl on her lovely face, she has just begun clearing the bar of glasses when she notices one remaining Patron huddled over a glass at the far end of the bar. Grimacing in exasperation, she heads that way like a locomotive. \nMARION Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my place. I don't mean next Easter, I mean now - \nShe is almost on him when Indy looks up smiling. Marion stops, stares, shocked. \nINDY Hello, Marion. \nShe hits him with a solid right to the jaw, knocking him off the barstool on the floor. He rubs his jaw and smiles up at her. \nINDY Nice to see you, too. \nMARION Get up and get out. \nINDY (getting up) Take it easy. I'm looking for your father. \nMARION (bitterly) Well you're two years too late. \nIndy's attitude changes instantly. This is sad news. He is silent for a long time. Mahdlo comes in the front door and hurries forward when he sees Indy with Marion. He looks to her for guidance, but she stays him with a gesture. \nINDY Shut up and listen for a second. I want that piece your father had. I've got money. \nThis stops her. \nMARION How much? \nINDY Enough to get you back to the States. Where are his things? \nMARION Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk. The junk he wasted his life on. \nINDY Everything? \nMarion nods. \nINDY (giving up) That's too bad. \nIndy feels tired, defeated. Marion is pleased. \nMARION You look disappointed. I like that. How's it feel? \nIndy has to smile at her glee. \nMARION (nods at his empty glass) What are you drinking? \nINDY Seltzer. \nMARION (refilling his glass) Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch. And I like bourbon. And vodka and gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm off that. \nShe pours herself another as Indy watches, amused. \nINDY You're a tough broad now, aren't you? \nMARION It's no act, pal. This ain't Schenectady. \nINDY I can only say I'm sorry so many times. \nMarion looks at him thoughtfully, takes a drink. \nMARION You really have money? You don't look rich. (Indy nods) I may be able to locate some of his things. I know who's got them. What do you want? \nINDY A bronze piece, about this size. In the shape of the sun. Probably broken off at the bottom. Has a little hole in it, off-center. Does that sound familiar? \nMarion thinks, nods slowly. \nINDY Do you know where it is? \nMARION Maybe. How much? \nINDY Three thousand. American. \nMARION (negative) That'll get me back, but not in style. This doodad must be pretty important. \nINDY Maybe. \nA huge smile lights up Marion's face. \nMARION I knew it would happen eventually. I knew it. Something had to go my way. (pours herself another drink) I've got to think this out. I'm used to bargaining with yaks. \nINDY Okay, five thousand. That's all I can give you now. I can get you more when you land in the States. \n2.) a trenchcoated SECOND NAZI. \n3.) a ratty-looking NEPALESE and \n4.) a mean MONGOLIAN. The second NAZI and the MONGOLIAN both carry submachine guns. \nBELZIG Good evening, Fraulein. \nMARION The bar's closed. \nBELZIG We are not thirsty. \nThe Mongolian and the Nepalese poke around, checking to make sure there's no one else there. \nDown at the end of the bar, the medallion lies partially hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles. The Second Nazi stops very near it, but turns his back to it to face Belzig and Marion. \nMARION What do you want? \nBELZIG The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted. Surely he told you there would be other interested parties. \nMarion shakes her head. \nBELZIG Ah, the man is nefarious. I hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it. \nMARION Why, are you willing to offer more? \nBELZIG Almost certainly. Do you still have it? \nMARION No. But I know where it is. \nBelzig's smile fades at this news. He's not a patient sort. Marion is chilled by the look. She turns and moves to the shelf of bottles behind her, reaching high for one, very near the large stuffed raven. He hand lingers there a moment and we see - \nFrom an angle behind the stuffed raven, that the left wing spread hides a Baretta automatic pistol. Marion's hand is very near it, but withdraws with only a whiskey bottle as the Mongolian walks toward her behind the bar. \nMarion opens the bottle before Belzig, who watches her intently. \nMARION How 'bout a drink for you and your men? \nThe Second Nazi lights up at this suggestion. Belzig gives him a withering look. \nBELZIG We will stick to the business at hand, Fraulein. \nMARION (tough) Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow when Jones is here and we'll have an auction? \nBelzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over toward the fireplace. As soon as his back is turned, the Second Nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick pull. In so doing, he leaves the medallion completely exposed. Marion is aware of this as she looks at him. But he quickly puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medallion, when Belzig speaks from the fireplace. \nBELZIG I'm afraid an auction is not possible. (pause) Your fire is dying here, Fraulein. (a beat, then threatening) Why don't you tell us where the piece is right now? \nMARION Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who you're used to dealing with, but no one tells me what to do in my place. \nBelzig, still looking in the fire, sneers and shakes his head. \nBELZIG Americans! You're all alike. Fraulein Ravenwood. I'll show you want I'm used to. \nHe motions with his hand. The Mongolian moves up behind Marion and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar, knocking over bottles and spilling liquor. He deposits her on the other side, where the Nepalese and the Second Nazi flank her and hold her cruelly, arms behind her back. Marion raises a ruckus. \nBelzig turns from the fireplace. In his hand is the poker, its end glowing orange. He advances on Marion. Marion stops yelling, her eyes widen in terror. \nMARION Wait! I can be reasonable - \nBelzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow. Now he withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night like a wounded animal. \nINT. \"THE RAVEN\" - NIGHT \nMarion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box with the five grand. She finds the remains of the box and its contents: a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood. \nMARION Unbelievable! \nAt the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life. He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and pulls out a Mauser pistol. \nIndy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and the huge creature goes down. \nThe Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame at Indy. Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead. \nMarion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta. \nIndy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the floor. He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat. He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion moving among the burning furniture. \nINDY Let's get out of here! \nMARION Not without that piece you want! \nINDY It's here? \nMarion nods, kicks aside a burning chair. Another burning beam falls from the roof. Indy pulls Marion close to him protectively. \nINDY Forget it! I want you out of here. Now! \nHe begins dragging her out. \nMARION (pointing) There! \nShe breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse. \nINDY Let's go! \nMARION (looking around) You burned down my place! \nINDY (figuratively) I owe you plenty! \nMARION (literally) You owe me plenty! \nINDY (smiles) You're something! \nMARION I am something. And I'll tell you exactly what - \nShe holds up the medallion possessively. \nMARION I'm your partner! \nEXT. CAIRO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY \nFirst we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the ancient skyline. Then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic streets, teeming with life: fierce-looking men in tattered galabiyas, black-gowned women with veiled faces, ragged, barefoot children. \nINT. DINING ROOM - SALLAH'S HOUSE (OLD CAIRO) \nIndy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18). Fayah, a huge, imposing woman, appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house. Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties defers to his wife in all matters of little importance. Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the adults. \nFAYAH Silence! (there is silence) Why do you forget yourselves? \nThere's a certain amount of truth to this; the recognition of it flickers across Indy's bleary eyes. Belloq sees it there. \nBELLOQ You know it to be true! How nice. And how ironic the timing. \nBelloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different. \nBELLOQ Do you realize what the Ark is? (very intense) It's a transmitter. A radio for talking to God! And now it is within my grasp. \nINDY What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I thought he was waiting to take possession. \nBelloq glances into the gloom at the German Henchmen. \nBELLOQ (quieter) When the time is right. When I am finished with it. \nINDY I hope your friends are patient. Dangerous work, Belloq. \nBELLOQ Yes. Very. You may consider yourself fortunate that your involvement concludes here. \nINDY Tell me, did you get away with the idol? \nBELLOQ (negative) I was lucky to get away with my life. The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded about the whole matter. \nIndy takes a drink. \nINDY You know, if it's God you want to talk to, maybe I can arrange it. \nBELLOQ (smiles) You have not changed. But, please, do not reach for your weapon until you are ready to die. \nThe front door of the bar slams open and all nine of SALLAH'S CHILDREN scamper in and over to a surprised Indy. Two of the smallest hop into his lap. \nLITTLE SON Uncle Indy, we have been looking for you. \nLITTLE DAUGHTER Come home now, Uncle. Hurry! \nSuddenly the Arab patrons of the bar take an intense interest in the situation, shifting their weapons. \nINDY Yes. Yes, I'll come now. \nIndy stands up. The German Henchmen and poised. Belloq eyes the Arab patrons and signals for the Henchmen to relax. \nBELLOQ Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take more than children to save you. \nThe children usher Indy out. \nINT. SALLAH'S TRUCK - IN FRONT OF ARAB BAR - NIGHT \nIndy climbs into the cab of Sallah's truck with a smiling Sallah as the children pile into the back. Sallah pulls out. \nSALLAH I thought we would find you there. (indicating the kids) Better than the United States Marines, eh? \nINDY (nods) Thanks you. (grave) Marion's dead. \nSALLAH Yes, I know. I am sorry. (pause) More reason than ever to beat the bastards. (he touches Indy) Life goes on, Indy. (indicates the kids again) There is the proof. \nIndy looks back there, nods. \nSALLAH I have much to tell you, Indy. \nINT. SALLAH'S HOUSE \nTwo old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto the flat surface of the desert. \nFurther out into the desert, the one in the lead, Sallah's truck, stops and the second one, Omar's truck, pulls up beside it. There are half dozen Arab Diggers in Omar's truck. Indy, dressed as an Arab, gets out of the cab of Sallah's truck and moves over to confer with OMAR, another old friend. They point off into the desert and reach some conclusion. Indy gives him a pat on the back; Omar turns off the road and drives into the desert with his workers. Indy hops back in the cab of Sallah's truck with Sallah. As they move down the road we see that the back of the truck holds three other Arab Diggers. \nEXT. RISE ABOVE THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING \nIndy and Sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at the top of the rise looking down on the Tanis Digs. Down behind them, Sallah's truck is parked with the three Arab Diggers. \nINDY My God! They aren't kidding! \nWHAT HE SEES \nThe Tanis Digs are laid out below like a painting. Trucks, bulldozers, Arab workers and German supervisors are everywhere. The excavations themselves are extensive and somewhat random-holes have been dug and then abandoned, foundations and passageways unearthed and then deserted. Beyond the main digs, a crude airstrip has been created. Sallah points to what appears to be a mound of dirt with a hole in it near the center of the activity. \nSALLAH There! That is the map room! \nINDY What time does the sun hit the map? \nSALLAH Just after eight. \nINDY We haven't got much time. Where are the Germans digging for the Well of the Souls? \nSallah points out into the desert a short way beyond the main area of activity. The desert turns to sand dunes out there, the surface undulating into the distance. Several trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is lumbering noisily toward it. \nINDY Okay. Let's go. \nEXT. THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING \nSallah's truck drives through the camp, one of the Arab Diggers at the wheel. Indy and Sallah are in the back and look just like the other two Arab Diggers. Sallah's truck does behind a tent and when it appears on the other side, Indy and Sallah are gone. \nEXT. AMONG THE TENTS - MORNING \nIndy and Sallah move stealthily among the tents. Indy carries a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall. They stop between two tents and look across a path at the entrance to the map room. What appeared to be a mound of dirt is actually the roof on the ancient building. The hole/entrance is a five-foot square skylight. Indy looks around, then walks casually to the edge of the hole and looks inside. Sallah joins him, producing a length of rope from his robes. Indy drops the staff into the unseen map room as Sallah ties the rope around on oil drum. When it's secure, Indy wastes no time disappearing down it into the map room. \nINT. MAP ROOM \nIndy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in seconds. He tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled up. Indy looks around with real wonder and excitement. The room is lovely, with elaborate wall carvings and frescoes, all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding in from above. This beam of light leads Indy's eye to the far end, and the room's truly remarkable feature: built into the floor in meticulous relief is a miniature stone model of the ancient city of Tanis. Already, the sunlight has worked its way down the far wall and is edging onto the miniature of the city. On the floor, to the skylight side of the miniature, is an elaborate line created by embedded mosaic tiles. The evenly spaced slots in the line, each accompanied by a symbol of a time of year, are for the base of the staff. Indy pulls the headpiece from his robes - it has been welded together - and reaches for the staff. \nEXT. ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY \nAn extremely nervous Sallah has the gathered rope in his hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back toward the oil drum. There is now a good bit of activity going on up here. \nJEEP GERMAN (O.S.) Hey! You, the skinny one! \nSallah jumps about three feet. The JEEP GERMAN is standing in an open space ten yards away looking at Sallah. \nJEEP GERMAN Yes, you. What are you doing there? \nSallah gestures his innocence. \nJEEP GERMAN Well bring that rope over here, you cur. \nThe Jeep German starts back toward his major concern: his jeep is stuck in some sand beyond the next tent. Some Arab Workers are trying in vain to budge it. Now another German has backed his truck up to it. Sallah can think of nothing to do expect obey. With a worried glance at the map room, be begins untying the rope from the oil drum. \nINT. THE MAP ROOM \nIndy is examining the results of Belloq's work. Red paint marks one of the miniature buildings in the layout and a white calibrated tape has been strung from that building back to a miniature of the map room. Now Indy begins examining the mosaic base line for the staff. Sunlight has moves further down across the miniature. \nEXT. IN THE CAMP - DAY \nMARION I swear to you, I know nothing more. I have no loyalty to Jones. He's brought me only trouble. \nHe wants to believe her. \nBELLOQ I cannot control them. \nMarion's frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance of the tent. There are new arrivals there - Shliemann, Gobler and Belzig. Belzig carries a black leather case. He steps forward and smiles at Marion. \nBELZIG We meet again, Fraulein. \nEXT. INDY'S DIG - JUST BEFORE DAWN \nThe sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to the east, making dangerously obvious the thin column of smoke rising from the entrance to the Well. Omar and his men are peering through the smoke down into the Well. \nINT. THE WELL OF THE SOULS \nIndy and Sallah are on the altar. Pushing together with all their strength, the heavy stone top of the protective chest begins to slide away. Indy and Sallah exchange slightly wary but very excited looks, then continue to push. As the Ark begins to be exposed, the air seems to almost vibrate, to become electrostatically charged. We hear what sounds like a low HUM. The sea of snakes around the altar draws back further from this presence. \nAs the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and slams down beside it, we see THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT. It is awesomely beautiful, breathtaking. 4 feet long, 2.5 feet wide and 2.5 feet high. It's height, however, is increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing each other on the top. Though the body of the Ark is acacia wood, it has been overlaid with gold. An elaborate gold crown surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are attached to each corner. \nSallah is mesmerized by the sight. His hand starts to reach out and touch one of the angels, but Indy grabs it. \nINDY Don't touch it! Never touch it! \nThe wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest. Now Indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins fitting them through the rings in the Ark. This takes some maneuvering by the two men, but soon they are able to lift the Ark clear of the stone chest and into the wooden crate. They extract the poles, fasten the top of the crate and stick the poles through the rings of the wooden crate. They start back toward the space under the hole. \nThe fire strips have begun to dwindle, as have some of the torches. The snakes move slowly in toward the clear spaces. Indy and Sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along with their heavy load. Under the hole, they hurriedly attach ropes to the wooden crate and it is pulled up. Indy's concentration is on the tide of snakes. \nINDY Hurry up! Why did it have to be snakes? \nSallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the Well. Indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a pool of snakes who are too close for his comfort. He turns and takes hold of the exit rope. He gives it a first tug and it falls down into the Well, landing partly beyond the ring of fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of angry, hissing asps. Indy looks up at the hole. \nINDY What the - \nSmiling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler. \nBELLOQ Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place? \nBelloq and the Germans laugh. \nINDY Why don't you fellows come down here? I'll show you. \nBELLOQ No thank you, my friend. (he glances around him) I think we are all very comfortable up here. \nEXT. INDY'S DIG - DAWN \nSunlight is flooding this tableau: Sallah, Omar and his men are being held at bay by ten armed Nazis. The wooden crate sits safely nearby. Belzig and another Nazi have the gagged Marion held in their rough grasp. \nBELLOQ (down to Indy) After all these years, it is most considerate of you to aid me in this way. \nAs Belloq speaks, Shliemann exchanges a look with Belzig. Belzig smiles and takes the gag from Marion's mouth. \nINT. WELLS OF THE SOULS \nShliemann smiles down at Indy. \nSHLIEMANN I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin. But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place... (he give a sign) ...all alone. \nBelzig and the Nazi move Marion to the hole and, to Belloq's surprise, push her in. Marion falls thirty feet screaming. Indy drops his torch, braces, and catches her! Her weight knocks him to the ground, almost into the snakes. She looks around at the snakes, clinging to him more desperately as he struggles to his feet trying to unload her. \nSnakes are moving in force up the pillar toward Indy's dwindling torch. Indy grasps the pillar for dear life, grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with all he's got. The pillar begins to break loose of the ceiling, then stops. Indy's eyes are on the torch. It is just a spot of flame now. Snakes are sliding up toward his hands. Indy again pushes against the wall and the torch falls out of his mouth. \nThe pillar goes! In the dim light, we see it fall like a tree directly at Marion. Indy rides it down. The top hits the wall three feet from a cringing Marion and smashes through to a black chamber beyond. Indy flies off into the darkness. Gone. Marion clutches her torch at the black hole. \nMARION Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord! \nThere is a moment that seems an eternity, then Indy appears like an apparition out of the void. \nINDY Come on! \nHe grabs her and helps her over the remains of the wall into - \nINT. THE CATACOMBS \nThe winding string of connected chambers is revealed to them only a few feet at a time as their torch lights the way. \nMARION The snakes... are they here? \nINDY I guess not. I think I'd be dead. \nMARION Do you know where you're going? \nINDY Absolutely. \nMARION Thank god. Where? \nINDY Out. \nThey round a corner and flush a covey of bats. Marion screams. \nINDY Don't do that. It scares me. \nMarion gives him a look. They round a corner and begin a walk through a maze of chambers that present for their inspection: moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi; a room decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall crawling with huge scarabaeid beetles. Marion is quite naturally a nervous wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her suddenly and points. \nINDY Look! \nWHAT THEY SEE \nThere, coming through the crack in the corner of the next chamber, is white blessed sunlight. \nEXT. THE TANIS DIGS - NEAR AIRSTRIP - DAY \nIndy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows of an abandoned excavation. Before them is the improvised airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply depot, two fuel tank trucks. Down by the fuel trucks a German Mechanic is looking skyward. Now Indy and Marion look there too, drawn by the roaring sound of - \nA Flying Wing, which is circling over the digs in preparation to landing. \nNow a new figure approaches the German Mechanic. It is Gobler; he yells to the mechanic, indicating the plane. \nGOBLER Get is gassed immediately! It has an important cargo to take out! \nIn the distance, the Flying Wing lands and rolls toward the men. Gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp, which is hidden from view by a rise. Indy and Marion watch him go. \nINDY When the Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on that plane. \nThe Flying Wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks. The German Mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires as the engines continue to roar. \nIndy and Marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to the plane, near the supply tent. Suddenly, a Second German Mechanic appears behind them. He is as surprised as they are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at Indy. Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out into the open, wrestling. Marion remains hidden, moving fast among the crates. \nThe first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left - right - left combination. He turns to find the first German Mechanic flying at him. The roll toward the rear of the Flying Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers. \nINDY You two get back to Cairo quick and get us transportation to England - a plane, a ship, anything. \nMARION What about you? \nINDY I'm going to get that truck. I'll meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me. \nSallah nods. Marion looks at him like he's nuts. Indy jumps up, looks around desperately. \nMARION How are you going to get that truck? \nINDY (still searching) I don't know. I'm making this up as I go. \nHe runs away between two tents. \nEXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE DIGS - DAY \nFrom among the tents, Indy suddenly bursts into view, happily astride a magnificent white Arabian stallion. He gallops off across the desert. \nEXT. THE DESERT (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY \nIndy cuts cross-country avoiding the road the convoy has taken. He leaps gullies, climbs dunes, slides down slopes. Soon the convoy comes into view far below him. He tears along a parallel ridge, like an Indian shadowing a wagon train. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nThe convoy is entering rougher country. The narrow mountain road we've seen earlier ascends ahead. To the side of the road are tall boulders. Suddenly, Indy shoots out from between two rocks and rides directly for the truck. The Armed Nazis in the back of the truck can see nothing because the canvas hides their view. But Gobler, Belzig and the Gunner in the rear staff car have a brief line on him. Belzig points and the Gunner fires away and Indy, the bullets kicking up sand near Indy's horse. \nThe Armed Guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see what's happening. Indy has been riding alongside. Now he stands on the horse and leaps to the cab. In a second, he has flipped the Armed Guard out of the truck. He slides into the cab and begins grappling with the Truck Driver. The Truck Driver tries to hit the brakes, but Indy kicks his foot away and floors the gas pedal. The truck doubles its speed and shoots onto the steep mountain road. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nThe Blond Driver of the front staff car sees the truck move up on him in the rearview mirror and speeds up. Belloq, Shliemann and the Armed Guard in the car twist around to look at the struggle in the truck. The Blond Driver begins what will be a continuing preview of the twists in the road. He turns his wheel sharply and takes the lead car around a bend. \nIn the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver stop their fight temporarily and cooperate in turning the steering wheel. The truck barely stays on the road. \nA full view reveals the incredible geography of this ride. The convoy in tiny against the spectacular mountainside, the cliffs drop hundreds of feet. \nAt the wheel of the rear car, Gobler swerves to stay on the road and accidentally sideswipes a boulder. The Gunner perched in the back is flipped head over heels out of the car. Gobler and Belzig are having trouble seeing the road through all the dust the convoy is kicking up. \nThe lead staff car reaches the summit of the road and barely makes the hairpin turn there, delivering a destructive blow to the guard rail that has been placed there. The guard rail is now bent. \nIn the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver again stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate the turn together. The bumper of the truck hits the broken guard rail and sends it flying off the cliff. The truck, however, holds the road. \nIn the rear car, Gobler and Belzig are trying to see through the thick clouds of dust. Suddenly is clears completely. Unfortunately for them, this happens because their car has shot out into space at the hairpin turn. They are flying to their final reward. Belzig, eyes wide behind his evil spectacles, screams as he goes. \nIn the cab of the truck, the Truck Driver is distracted by the sight of the flying staff car. Indy plasters him and he tumbles out. \nFar, far below, Belzig's staff car explodes on the rocks. \nIn the back of the truck, a TOUGH SERGEANT takes command of the situation. He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions for them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to the cab. With some trepidation the lucky ones begin that maneuver. The truck is swerving like crazy. \nIn the front staff car, the Armed Guard aims his submachine guns back at Indy, alone now in the truck's cab. Shliemann knocks the barrel roughly away. \nSHLIEMANN (yelling) If anything happens to that Ark, we're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will see to it! \nIndy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up, putting even more pressure on the Blond Driver. \nAlong the back of the truck, Armed Nazis are edging up toward the cab, three on each side. They hang on as the truck rounds a corner and goes into a straightaway that leads through a short tunnel. \nIn the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff car. Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side. A quick glance to the other mirror reveals the others. As the truck sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his steering wheel - he is going to sideswipe the walls of the tunnel \nMARION (after a long pause) Nothing. That is the way it is. \nHe watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts it down. \nINDY Did I ever say I was sorry I burned down your tavern? \nShe turns so their lips are very close. \nMARION No. Then again, I burned up that plane. \nINDY You saved my life. \nMARION And you saved mine. \nINDY Seems things have worked out kind of even. \nMARION That's the way I like them. \nINDY Maybe we should consider all past accounts closed. \nMarion thinks about this a long time. \nMARION No. Not yet. \nINDY What else? \nShe looks into his eyes. A smile jumps from her lips to his. He kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot. \nINT. IN THE HOLD \nThe ship's rats are agitated. They tremble and chatter at the edges of the compartment, darting about. Out in the center of the hold, sitting all by itself, is the crated Ark. HUM-M- M-M. \nINT. INDY'S CABIN - DAY \nMarion awakes with a start, alone in the cot. Something's wrong. The ship is quiet. Indy is strapping on his holster. He pulls his ship and jacket from a hook. \nMARION What is it? \nINDY The engines have shut down. \nMARION Why? \nINDY I'm going to find out. \nEXT. LOWER DECK - DAY \nIndy runs toward the bow, then climbs some steps four at a time. A MESSENGER PIRATE is hurrying to get him, but flies by him on the steps. By the time the Pirate stops himself, Indy is gone. \nMESSENGER PIRATE Mister Jones! The Captain he say - \nEXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY \nCaptain Katanga is looking with concern ahead of the ship. Indy appears behind him. \nINDY What's wrong? \nKATANGA You have most important friends. \nKatanga turns quickly, pointing with a sweeping hand. Indy looks. Arrayed in a rough semicircle around the ship are ten German Wolf Submarines. All of their deck guns are manned and trained on the Bantu Wind. Worse, at least five heavily- armed boarding parties in rafts are closing quickly on the ship. \nIn the folds of the Tabernacle, the silk of the tents undulating around him. The light is even stranger, the scene almost dreamlike. With the help of the Tall Captain, Belloq lets an extraordinary, gold-embroidered, ceremonial robe fall over his head and onto his body. Belloq looks transported, possessed. The Tall Captain unlatches a wooden case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long, elaborately engraved. Belloq takes it from him, turns and slips back through the silk. The Tall Captain stays in the folds. \nBack in the central area, Shliemann and the other Nazis are taken aback by Belloq's appearance in the robe. They exchange looks. From one knot of men there is muttering about \"Juden\" and such, but when Belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there is immediate silence. Shliemann looks uncertain in this presence. \nBelloq approaches the Ark. He stops a few feet from it and begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew. After a few moments of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself. The end of the rod is an inch from the notch when - \nIndy steps into the Tabernacle. On his shoulder is a bazooka and it is aimed directly at the Ark. \nINDY Hold it. (the Nazi react) One move from anybody and I blow that box back to Moses. \nShliemann makes it clear to the other Nazis that Indy is to be obeyed. \nBELLOQ Jones, your persistence surprises even me. You are going to give mercenaries a bad name. \nINDY What about you? Talked to God yet? (Belloq's eyes flash) Where's the girl? \nSHLIEMANN Doctor Jones, surely you don't think you can escape from this base. \nINDY That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want is the girl. We'll keep possession of the Ark only till we've got safe transport to England. Then it's all yours. \nSHLIEMANN If we refuse? \nINDY Then the Ark and some of us are going up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler would like that a bit. Now I don't want to talk about this anymore. Show me that girl in five seconds or - \nThe Tall Captain flies out of the silk and takes Indy down by the neck. The bazooka clatters across the cement floor as two other Nazis help subdue Indy. The three Nazis take Indy's pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp. \nSHLIEMANN Jones, this is the second time I have seen you looking very foolish. \nINDY It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break it. \nShliemann draws his Luger. \nSHLIEMANN I'll help you. This time I'll kill you myself. \nShliemann raises the pistol. \nBELLOQ No! Not in the presence of the Ark! Take him outside. \nShliemann eyes Belloq, then the Ark. He lowers the pistol, motions for the Nazis to take Indy out ahead of him. They stop a moment only when Belloq speaks. \nBELLOQ Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am even a little sorry you will miss this moment. \nINDY Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him I'm on my way up. \nShliemann motions them out and follows. Belloq turns back to the Ark, raising the ivory rod. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nShliemann, the Tall Captain, Indy and the two Nazis holding him emerge from the Tabernacle. Shliemann points to a nearby wall and the group starts that way with Shliemann and the Tall Captain slightly ahead. \nINT. THE TABERNACLE \nBelloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the lid of the Ark. He utters a short phrase in Hebrew and begins to press down on his end of the rod. The lid of the Ark begins to lift. It's difficult work. Belloq puts his whole weight into one big press on his end and the lid opens two feet. \nInside the Ark of the Covenant is a preview of the end of the world. A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a charge so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to compare to it. It's as though this magnificent golden box has been gathering electric energy for three thousand years, waiting for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one fast, cleansing explosion of pure force. \nBlinding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the white silk to flame. But it is Belloq in his obsession who takes the full blast. His whole body seems lit by a million volt current and, for a moment, his complete form is white, then blue, then maybe green, but it is hard to tell because our eyes are blinded now too. Two aspects of this ghastly, beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos, although the communication is subliminal. First, that Belloq, in the instant of his destruction, has experienced some kind of sublime, transcendental knowledge. If a death's-head can smile and look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandescent face would be described. Secondly, this event is accompanied by a sound like no other. A sound so intense and so odd and so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine it were the whisper of God. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nOut in the court, Shliemann has regained his eyesight. Now he crouches, scanning the scene desperately for Indy. He looks into the remains of the Tabernacle and spots the empty altar. Beyond it, the unoccupied posts where Marion was bound. \nAt the entrance to the second train tunnel, Indy and Marion struggle to lift the Ark into a mine car. Marion has the submachine gun slung over her back. The Ark drops heavily into the bottom of the car. The noise attracts the attention of five water-carrying Nazis. They see what's going on and reach for their side-arms. Indy grabs Marion, pulls her in front of him - as though to use her as a shield - and flips the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the Nazis. \nHe opens fire, turning Marion's body so he can mow all five down. \nShliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance. He points at Indy and Marion, who have just hopped into the mine car with the Ark. \nSHLIEMANN Stop them! Kill them! \nA dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car. Marion is just leveling the submachine gun. Indy pushes forward the throttle and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed. As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Marion and Indy both open up, peppering the area with lead. As the mine car is about to disappear into the tunnel - \nINDY (to Marion) Get down! \nAs the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the tunnel. Shliemann runs up with three Nazis. They jump into the next mine car and take off, disappearing into the tunnel. \nOver at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire- fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes. The wooden boxes immediately start burning. Many of the Nazis just want to get out of there, but a couple of disciplined OFFICERS are trying to salvage the situation. They point to the far side of the court, the walls are lines with oil and gas drums. \nOFFICER We must cover the drums! Protect them from the bullets! \nINTERCUTTING INDY AND MARION WITH SHLIEMANN AND THE NAZIS \nWe see a most extraordinary pursuit. This tunnel is of identical design to the first, except more twisty. This early section goes slightly uphill, as though headed for the summit of a rollercoaster. The low cross beams and the higher sections in between are causing the Nazis to alternately stand and duck in their efforts to get a clear shot at the lead car. One German times it wrong and gets whacked. Indy in unhappy with the speed of his car and he's right, the Nazis are moving faster and gaining. When both cars are in the same high section, the Nazis blast away at them. The noise is deafening, with barking guns, splintering rock, and twanging ricochets contributing to the din. As Marion fires a return volley low over the Ark, Indy kicks at the throttle, convinced it is jammed. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nThe Officers are directing the placement of every moveable item in front of the oil drums. Desks, crates, chairs, food, all are heaped in front of the fuel. All the workers cast frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes across the court. Suddenly the worst begins to happen at the cartridge boxes. Hundreds of thousands of live cartridges begin exploding, flying around the court like shrapnel. Hot lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel drums, leaving big dents. \nINT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY \nThe car with Indy and Marion looks almost sluggish compared to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way into an usually long straightaway. Marion discards her empty submachine gun as Indy kicks at his throttle and casts a worried look back at Shliemann. \nShliemann, sensing victory, smiles evilly and carefully takes aim. Indy and Marion will be easy targets until they reach that approaching low cross beam, which is the crest of the rising tunnel. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER - CLOSE ON FUEL DRUM \nA fuel drum, already pocked by bullets is finally penetrated by high velocity hot lead. It explodes in a ball of flame. And then its neighbor. Then all is exploding flame. \nINT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY \nShliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them and look back that way. \nIndy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes! Their car doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam at the same instant as - \nA huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the tunnel behind the Nazis, catches their car and incinerates Shliemann and his men. The tunnel collapses in this section, burying the fried Nazis forever. \nINT. TRAIN TUNNEL \nIndy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the last tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling rock and dirt. They look at each other, then turn their attention back to their own predicament. Their mine car is going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section of wildly twisting tunnel. \nMARION Slow it down! \nIndy is already pulling the throttle. It moves easily. Unfortunately, it is no longer attached to the motor. The mine car is out of control. After several moments, far ahead, appears a circle of bright daylight - the end of the tunnel! It approaches at a frightening rate. Indy reaches out and grasps Marion's hand. They exchange looks and then turn to look ahead. \nTHEIR POV \nWe're taking this last stretch with them. It's a familiar nightmare. It has to do with a rollercoaster that ends suddenly and disastrously. The shocking brightness of sunlight rushes up to engulf us, blinding us in its glare. \nEXT. THE ISLAND - END OF TRACKS, DOCK \n", "test1_input": "MARION (looking disappointed) Hey! Hey!... where're you going? \nINDY (dragging Marion on) He'll be OK. Come on. Come on. \nEXT. ANOTHER CAIRO STREET - DAY \nThe Monkey is seen running around another corner and jumps into the waiting arms of MONKEY MAN, who appears to be like a beggar with a dirty turban and an eye patch. Monkey Man immediately hurries down the street and passes into a building. In the building are two GERMAN AGENTS. Monkey Man and the Monkey both give the Heil Hitler salute and engage in quick talk. \nMonkey Man quickly leaves the two German Agents and gets back to the street. He is obviously shadowing Indy and Marion. Indy and Marion are just now passing by the Monkey Man ducks back behind some baskets. \nEXT. ANOTHER BUSY CAIRO STREET - DAY \nIndy and Marion are passing under a balcony where a lone GERMAN AGENT stands watch. After they pass, the Agent nods to some BAD ARABS who are hiding in the shadows of the street. In a moment, Indy and Marion pass by the break. Monkey Man turns and looks up at a roof further down the alley. He waves with his hand. Someone up there waves back. \nEXT. A SMALL BAZAAR - DAY \nIndy and Marion have reached a tiny square, made even more cramped by its use as a small bazaar. They have started working their way through the crowd when several Bad Arabs and a German Agent begin to converge on them. Indy immediately sees what's happening and pulls the bull whip from his jacket. The first Bad Arab to reach them gets hit in the mouth by the handle of the whip. Now all hell breaks loose, with Bad Arabs, Innocent Shoppers, baskets of fruit and tables of goods flying every which way in the constricted space. \nINDY (to Marion) Run! Get out of here! \nIndy catches a dagger-wielding Bad Arab around the legs with the whip and flips him. Marion is reluctant to leave Indy. \nINDY Go, dammit! Go! \nMarion goes. She runs off between two buildings. A Bad Arab takes off after her. Monkey Man, now standing at the edge of the square, points at Marion. The Monkey jumps off his shoulder and follows Marion. \nEXT. BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY \nMarion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a five foot wall. She flops over it. The Bad Arab is right on her heels. He reaches the wall and vaults over. On the other side of the wall, the Bad Arab lands in a crouch, looks ahead and doesn't see Marion. Immediately a heavy earthen pot smashes over his head, putting him out. Marion steps from an alcove and starts to run toward the street at the other end of the walkway. Suddenly another Bad Arab and a new German Agent appear in the street at that end. Before they can spot her, Marion retreats to the alcove again. There is a huge rattan basket sitting there. Marion climbs in and closes the top above her. \nThe only witness: The Monkey, who is now perched on the fire foot wall. \nEXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY \nChaos. An entire booth of pots and pans collapses on a Bad Arab and a German Agent as Indy whips away a support. \nEXT. BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY \nThe chattering Monkey leads a German Agent and two Bad Arabs to Marion's hiding place, gesturing maniacally. \nEXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY \nIndy ducks under the swinging blade of a huge Arabian sword and kicks the Bad Arab Swordsman in the groin. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - DAY \nThe German Agent leads the way as the two Bad Arabs carry the huge basket above their heads. The basket top has been fastened closed, but Marion is making a fuss inside. At the place where the street cuts across the far side of the bazaar, Marion is able to wedge the top open one inch and screams - \nMARION Indy-y-y-y! \nEXT. THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY \nIndy has heard her. He looks across the square as the basket and its escorts disappear beyond a building. One last Bad Arab rises before him. Indy's whip flashes and the Bad Arab's robe falls down to his ankles. Indy frantically pushes his way through the panicked mass of humanity in the direction the basket has gone. \nEXT. THE FOOT CHASE - INTERCUTTING INDY AND THE MOVING BASKET - DAY \nThe Bad Guys move the basket as fast as they can through streets, alleys and passageways thick with people. Indy always seems to round a corner just in time to catch a glimpse of the basket before it disappears around a new corner. Indy must fight a flow of humanity as powerful as an ocean riptide. Finally, at the head of one particularly crowded alley, Indy leaps up onto a wall for a clearer view. Whatever he sees gives him an idea and he cuts between two buildings rather than following the basket. \nEXT. DESERTED ALLEY - DAY \n", "test1_true": "EXT. DESERTED SQUARE - DAY \nIndy rounds the corner and is immediately driven back by machine gun fire. Taking cover, he gets quick, intermittent glimpses of this scene: At the far corner of the large, deserted square is a canvas-covered truck. Two Bad Arabs are hurrying toward is with a large rattan basket between them, Marion screaming inside. A German Agent is covering their retreat with a machine gun from the cab of the truck. Indy runs up to see the rattan basket being heaved into the back of the truck. \nEXT. BACK OF THE TRUCK - DAY \nWhat Indy cannot see is that the basket lands among an ominous load of German munitions, dynamite and firearms. The truck immediately peels out. \nEXT. DESERTED SQUARE - DAY \nThe German Agent has stopped firing in order to drive. He floors it, aiming for a street at the corner of the square. Indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the German Agent's profile and fire off three careful shots. The German Agent is hit, blasted dead against the steering wheel. The speeding truck swerves, hits a wall, rolls over and explodes in an enormous, multi-leveled eruption as its contents ignite. Several surrounding buildings are leveled. \nIndy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and horror-stricken. \nINDY Marion. \nINT. ARAB BAR - NIGHT \nA dark, smoke-filled den on iniquity. The patrons, almost all fearsome Arabs, sit in small shadowy groups around the room. Indy stands at the bar finishing off a fifth of bourbon. He is drunk. The ARAB BARTENDER places a new bottle of expensive bourbon in front of him. Indy eyes is queerly. \nARAB BARTENDER The gentleman in the corner sent it. He would like you to join him. \nINDY (doesn't even look) Too bad. I'm drinking alone. \nThe Arab Bartender does a take, looking at the three, tough GERMAN HENCHMEN who have surrounded Indy from out of the smoke, their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pockets. Indy notices them now with a bleary glance. He decides he's in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them across the room, taking his bottle with him. The Arab patrons take this in and mind their own business. \nThe occupant of the smoke-shrouded corner table becomes visible only as Indy reaches there: it is Emile Belloq. He is drinking wine. \nINDY Belloq. \nBELLOQ Good evening, Dr. Jones. \nINDY I ought to kill you right now. \nBELLOQ It was not I who brought the girl into this dirty business. \nIndy knows its true; that's what's tearing him up. \nBELLOQ Sit down, please, before you fall down. We can behave as civilized people. I'm afraid it will be your last opportunity. \nIndy sits, glancing at the German Henchmen, who settle nearby, just out of earshot. \nINDY Not a very private place for a murder. \nBELLOQ (looking around) These Arabs will not interfere in the white man's business. They do not care if we kill each other off. (takes a sip of wine, refers to it) Terribly difficult finding a decent vintage here. You were quite vigorous in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend the Wild Boar had taken the precaution of making several copies of the piece. \nIndy registers this as he takes a drink. Belloq watches him with disdainful amusement. \nBELLOQ How odd that is should end this way for us, after so many... stimulating encounters. I almost regret it. Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level? \nINDY Try the local sewer. \nBELLOQ I know you despise me. We always hate in others that which we most fear in ourselves. And you and I are very much alike. \nINDY Now you're getting nasty. \nBELLOQ We have always done the same kind of work. Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy reflection of you. But it would have taken only a nudge to make you the same as me, to push you out of the light. \n", "test2_input": "INDY I though you were dead. \nMARION They were throwing me around like a rag doll. \nINDY They must have switched baskets. Thank god for that! Bless those bastards. Have they hurt you? \nMARION No. Not since I got here. They just asked about you - what you knew. The Frenchman's got the hot's for me. I've been playing that along. Oh, Indy, get me out of here. \nIndy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly, thinking. \nMARION What's wrong? \nINDY (putting the knife away) I have to leave you here for a little while. I know where the Ark is. If I take you out of here they'll start combing the place for us. \nMARION (louder) Cut me loose! \nINDY Keep your voice down. \nMARION (screaming) I said get me out of - \nIndy pops the gag back in her mouth. Her eyes widen in fury and she grunts obscenities at him. \nINDY Look, you don't know how glad I am to see you. And I don't like doing this. But the whole thing will be shot if you don't just sit here quietly. They haven't hurt you in the last twenty-four hours, they aren't going to start now. I'll be back to get you in no time. \nHe kisses her forehead, jumps up and hurries out of the tent. \nEXT. SAND DUNE OUTSIDE DIGS - DAY \nWith the digs behind them, Indy and Sallah run up to the ridge of the dune and over the top. At the bottom of the far side, Omar's truck is parked. Omar and his men are waiting. \nEXT. DIFFERENT DUNE - DAY \nThis new spot gives Indy a higher, better view of the whole scene. Indy is using a surveyor's instrument to take a reading - \nWHAT HE SEES \nLooking through the instrument, Indy gets a line from the map room through the site where the Nazis are digging in the dunes to a spot several dunes over. We focus on that virgin spot of well-hidden sand as - \nINDY There! \nEXT. INDY'S DIG - DAY \nOmar's truck is parked at the spot just viewed from afar. Dunes rise on either side. One of Omar's men has been posted as a lookout up on a ridge. Everybody else - Indy, Sallah, Omar, and his men - have begun digging for the Wells of the Souls. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSAME SCENE - NIGHT \nThey continue to dig furiously, all of them drenched in sweat. The hole has grown but this is slow, back-breaking work. \nINT. COMMAND TENT - TANIS DIGS - NIGHT \nBelloq, SHLIEMANN the ranking Nazi, and Shliemann's Aide, GOBLER, come into the tent, which is full of charts and maps, drawings of the Ark, radio equipment, liquor and food. The men have been out digging for the Well all day. They are tired, discouraged, testy. In all matters, Gobler shows his alliance with Shliemann against Belloq with small looks and body language. The Frenchman has disappointed them and he is feeling the isolation of a scapegoat. Belloq gets himself a drink as Shliemann towels off his face. \nBELLOQ I cautioned you about being premature with that communiqu\u00e9 to Berlin. Archeology is not an exact science. If does not adhere to time schedules. \nSHLIEMANN The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He demands constant reports and he expects progress. You led me to believe - \nBELLOQ Nothing. I have made no promises. I said only that it looked very favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still be found in an adjoining chamber. Based on the information in our possession, my calculations were correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence still eludes us. Perhaps \n", "test2_true": "Belloq shoots him an angry look. \nSHLIEMANN My feeling exactly. She was in possession of the original piece for years. She may know much. (really evil) If properly motivated... \nBELLOQ I tell you, she knows nothing useful. \nSHLIEMANN I'm surprised to find you squeamish. That is not your reputation. But it needn't concern you. I have the perfect man for this kind of work. \nShliemann signals Gobler, who steps outside the tent a moment, calls someone and then reappears. Belloq looks warily at the entrance. After a moment Belzig enters, reeking villainy. When his eyes find Shliemann, his superior, he snaps a crisp \"Heil, Hitler!\" at him, holding his palm rigid a long time, exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun medallion. \nEXT. INDY'S DIG - NIGHT \nIn the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight, Indy and the other men step back in awe of their discovery: there, flush with the bottom of their pit, is a heavy stone entry door to an underground chamber. Special prying tools are produced. With two men assigned to each of the two long tools, they work in unison to open the vault. They open it a foot and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door completely open. Down inside, only blackness. \nThe men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of the entry to look inside. Indy and Sallah each take a torch and hold them down the hole. \nWHAT THEY SEE \nThe Well of the Souls is a spooky chamber thirty feet deep. The walls are covered with hieroglyphics and carvings. The roof is supported intermittently by stone pillars, the closest of which hits the roof very near the entry hole. The Well is quite large; as Indy and Sallah wave their torches, more and more of the room is revealed. Now the far end of the chamber comes into view. There is a stone altar down there and on this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest, big enough to enclose the Lost Ark and protect it from the ravages of time. This altar appears to be the only place on the floor of the Well that is not covered by a strange, dark carpet of some kind. \nINDY The Ark must be in that stone case. What's that gray stuff all over the floor - \nHe breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is. He blanches. Indiana Jones blanches. \nIndy drops his torch to the floor of the Well. This is answered by the most horrific HISSING imaginable. \nWHAT HE SEES \nThat think dark carpet is moving. It's alive. It's thousands and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes - Egyptian asps. And the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this venomous groundcover is the altar. The snakes ebb and flow near it, but never encroach on it, as though repelled by some invisible force. \nIndy shakes his head and talks to himself. \nINDY Why snakes? Why did it have to be snakes? Anything else. \nAfter a moment of this, he stops. He gathers his energy and resolve and gets back to the task. \nSALLAH Asps. Very dangerous. \nWhere Indy's torch had landed is a circle of snake-free floor. The snakes hate the flame; they stay away. \nINDY Lots of torches. And oil. I want a landing strip down there. \nINT. THE WELL OF THE SOULS \nFifteen torches have been dropped to the floor of the chamber, combining to make a good-sized clear zone. Smoke begins to fill the room. Several canisters of oil have been lowered into this space. Now, a large wooden crate is lowered slowly by rope. Rope handles are attached to each end of the crate. \nUp at the hole, Indy gives Sallah a reassuring pat, takes a breath, and swings carefully onto a rope hanging from the hole. Despite his care, he swings a bit and his feet hit the stone pillar which is so near the entry. Surprisingly, the pillar actually moves a bit, showering a light rain of crumbled stone to the floor below. \nIndy lands on the floor of the Well. He looks at the altar over a sea of undulating death. He picks up an oil canister and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them. A path six feet wide begins to open to the altar. Behind Indy, Sallah comes quickly down the rope. \nWe begin to INTERCUT all the action in the Well from here on with insert shots of the snakes outside the flames. Snakes and snakes. We see: snakes piled and entwined six inches deep; mother snakes laying snake eggs; snake eggs hatching little snakes; snakes cannibalizing other snakes. \nINT. MARION'S TENT \nBelloq has been talking to the still-bound Marion. He has removed her gag. He is impatient, angry, uncomfortable. Caught between two forces. \nBELLOQ Believe me, you made a mistake. If you would just give me something to placate them. Some bit of information. \n", "test3_input": "THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN (earnestly) I think not, Colonel. Nothing is to be gained. We are not at war. \nShliemann mulls this, then turns to the hatch. \nSHLIEMANN ...yet. Let the vermin live. We must be on our way. \nShliemann disappears down the hatch. The Captain is very pleased. A Radioman speaks into his headset, then follows the other Aides down the hatch. In the distance the other subs begin to move away from the ship. The Captain, alone on the bridge, looks once more at Katanga. \nOn the Bantu Wind, Katanga executes what might be taken for a salute. \nThe Wurrfler's Captain smiles, salutes crisply, then goes below, pulling the hatch closed. Immediately, the Wurrfler begins to move. And as it does, we see the rail at the aft of the main deck. From nowhere, a wet sleeve appears and a hand grabs the rail! \nIndy pulls his dripping body onto the sub's main deck. He has lost his felt hat once and for all. Other than that, his outfit is the same as always, just wetter. Suddenly, water is washing over his feet; the Wurrfler is beginning to submerge. Indy runs through quickly deepening water toward the haven of the conning tower. Halfway there, he slips and goes down. Only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light does he keep from being swept away. He struggles to his feet and sloshes through knee-deep water to the base of the conning tower. \nIndy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower and looks down. The water is rising toward his fast. Indy climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself between the two uprights there - the 7 foot radio mast and the 20 foot periscope. Still the ocean comes up to meet him. Soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast is disappearing. Indy shifts his grip to the periscope, working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the ocean whips at his body. The periscope is quickly going under. Indy hangs on to the top three feet, all that remains above. \nThe forward movement of the sub continues, but, to Indy's slowly dawning delight, the dive stops. No more of the periscope goes under. Indy smiles; it's a pretty good smile, too, given the circumstances. Indy pulls out his bullwhip and begins tying himself to the periscope. \nEXT. THE PERISCOPE - AFTERNOON \nThe sun warms that part of his body Indy has contrived to keep out of the water. The rest floats out behind. Indy isn't comfortable, but all in all, it's not as terrible as he might have feared. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE PERISCOPE - DUSK \nIt's as terrible as Indy might have feared. He looks wasted. Waterlogged and exhausted. The wet leather of the whip is contracting and he must struggle constantly to keep it from cutting into his skin. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT \nSeveral shark fins cut the surface, appearing and disappearing in the bright moonlight. They are shadowing - \nEXT. THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT \nIndy looks through barely open eyes at the sharks running alongside. There is nothing to be done. His eyes close. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT \nThe submarine has stopped. The water is calm. The moon is bright. A gentle swell splashes Indy awake. He blinks, tries to regain his senses. He makes an inventory of his body. Surprised to find himself intact, his spirits lift. Some hidden reserve of energy flows through him. He frees his aching arms from the wet leather of his whip, leaving only one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub. He rubs his hands and stretches. Once again, he has survived. To fight again. He looks around. \nWHAT HE SEES \nA lovely island. No sign of man's presence. The sub has stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely ringed by tall white rock cliffs. Suddenly the sub begins to move again. It is headed directly toward the center of the cliffs. Indy holds on, mystified, alert. When the cliffs are very close, the sub begins to dive. \nINDY Damn! \nHe thinks hard. Inspiration hits just before the water. Indy flips his leather jacket up over his head and holds the jacket out in front of him. His head is hidden by the jacket as he goes under water. \nINT. THE UNDERWATER TUNNEL - NIGHT \nThe sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into the cliffs. Indy is held to the periscope by his crossed legs and the whip. His impromptu air bubble is working, but it's a struggle to maintain it. \nThe sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation. Each dangling growth pulls at Indy's body and slaps at his leather bubble. Now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the leather out of his hands and his bubble of air rises away. Indy hangs on, holding his breath, but the vegetation gets denser. Finally, it pulls him off the periscope. The sub moves on, disappearing ahead. \n", "test3_true": "Indy dives, stroking deep into the tunnel. When he has descended 15 feet, he grabs a vine and steadies himself. His eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel. He sees his last hope in the distance - a small blue circle, an air pocket. He swims for it. \nIn the air pocket, Indy's head breaks the surface and smashes into rock again. The pocket is only six inches deep. No matter. Indy loves it. He'd like to move in. He gulps air. \nINT. THE SUB BASE - DOCKING BAY \nThe Wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built in the hollow interior of the island. This chamber, with the docking bay, is almost all water. A huge natural cavern, it has been reinforced and enlarged by the Germans. \nThe Wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock. The Ark has been unloaded and placed on a cart. Shliemann, Belloq and Marion have just disembarked and been met by a Nazi contingent from the base. Marion looks worse for the trip. Her white nightgown is now ripped and smudged. \nOne of the greeting Nazis, a TALL CAPTAIN, salutes Shliemann and Belloq. As he speaks to them, we notice that right behind this group, just above a great deal of sub unloading activity, Indy's whip hangs from the periscope. Working Nazis pass within feet of it unaware; the Tall Captain would see it in a moment if he were not so focused on the new arrivals. \nTALL CAPTAIN (to Belloq) The tents have been arranged in accordance with your radioed instructions, sir. \nBELLOQ Good. We must take the Ark there now. \nShliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange, but says nothing. The group moves swiftly toward the end of a mine train arrangement. The train, consisting of small, separate, electric-powered cars, sits on a track which disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock. \nOn the turret of the Wurrfler, the Wurrfler's Captain lights a cigarette as he watches the mine train disappear, then returns his attention to the activity on the dock. He leans idly against the periscope, his head two feet below Indy's dangling whip. Something catches his eye, he yells an order and climbs down from the turret to deal with the matter. We hold on the whip for a long moment, until its owner's hand appears and quickly reclaims it. \nINT. TRAIN TUNNEL \nThe Ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight dark tunnel, their way lit by intermittent lanterns. The tunnel is irregular, but generally about 7 feet wide. It's height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where support beams cross the track. The result is that there is only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those points; passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the head. Shliemann, looking worried, and Belloq, very excited, are focused on the Ark in the car ahead. \nSHLIEMANN I am uncomfortable with the thought of this - (spitting it out) Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's necessary? \nBELLOQ (playing him) Let me ask you this - Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding out only then if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside? Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission and obtained the one, true Ark? \nShliemann doesn't like any of his alternatives. He looks at Belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright light. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nA second natural cavern, even bigger than the first, has been worked over by the Germans into a rectangular, three- story high supply center around a huge, open, center court. Uniformed Nazi Soldiers are everywhere, wrangling supplies and ammunition, monitoring electronic equipment. At the far end of the court, a second train tunnel disappears into the rock. \nAcross the open court, Belloq sees his destination: a large, brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst of all this hardware. It looks incongruous, and more than a little eerie. It is the Tabernacle. \nINT. TRAIN TUNNEL \nIndy is making his way up the tunnel. He hears cars coming from up ahead and steps into the shadows. A mine car passes with several laughing Nazis. Indy continues on his way. \nINT. THE TABERNACLE \nThe light in here is lovely, unearthly. Oil lamps burn. The Tabernacle is really several concentric, silk tents, which creates a flowing maze effect. The innermost tent has at its center a 3-foot high, tapestry-covered altar. Belloq watches with gleaming, obsessed eyes as two Nazis carefully lift the actual Ark out of its crate by means of the long poles. The Ark dazzles the eye, seeming to glow gold in this strange light. The two Nazis place it carefully on the altar. Shliemann and some Aides hang back. Marion is nowhere to be seen. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER - END OF TUNNEL \nIndy makes a fast break from the shadows of the tunnel to the protection of a high stack of supplies. He climbs the back of the stack, peeks over and surveys the area. \nWHAT HE SEES \nIn addition to the Tabernacle, the second train tunnel entrance, and all the activity, Indy's glance rests momentarily on a large, heavy metal door halfway down one wall toward the Tabernacle. It bears the words, in German: \"DANGER - MUNITIONS\" \nIndy continues to scan the scene. \nINT. THE TABERNACLE \nIn the central area with the Ark, Shliemann and the other Nazis wait impatiently, eyeing the Ark with some discomfort. Belloq is not visible, because at the moment he is - \n"}

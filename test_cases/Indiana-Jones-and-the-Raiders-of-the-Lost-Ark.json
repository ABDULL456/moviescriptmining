{"test1_input": "Belzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow. Now he withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night like a wounded animal. \nINT. \"THE RAVEN\" - NIGHT \nMarion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box with the five grand. She finds the remains of the box and its contents: a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood. \nMARION Unbelievable! \nAt the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life. He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and pulls out a Mauser pistol. \nIndy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and the huge creature goes down. \nThe Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame at Indy. Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead. \nMarion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta. \nIndy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the floor. He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat. He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion moving among the burning furniture. \nINDY Let's get out of here! \nMARION Not without that piece you want! \nINDY It's here? \nMarion nods, kicks aside a burning chair. Another burning beam falls from the roof. Indy pulls Marion close to him protectively. \nINDY Forget it! I want you out of here. Now! \nHe begins dragging her out. \nMARION (pointing) There! \nShe breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse. \nINDY Let's go! \nMARION (looking around) You burned down my place! \nINDY (figuratively) I owe you plenty! \nMARION (literally) You owe me plenty! \nINDY (smiles) You're something! \nMARION I am something. And I'll tell you exactly what - \nShe holds up the medallion possessively. \nMARION I'm your partner! \nEXT. CAIRO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY \nFirst we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the ancient skyline. Then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic streets, teeming with life: fierce-looking men in tattered galabiyas, black-gowned women with veiled faces, ragged, barefoot children. \nINT. DINING ROOM - SALLAH'S HOUSE (OLD CAIRO) \nIndy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18). Fayah, a huge, imposing woman, appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house. Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties defers to his wife in all matters of little importance. Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the adults. \nFAYAH Silence! (there is silence) Why do you forget yourselves? \n", "test1_true": "FAYAH What is this? Who brought this animal in? \nAll the children chatter their innocence at once. The Monkey chatters too; it's an entertainer. The Monkey jumps from the children's table to the adults' and struts slowly up toward Marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing she ever saw. When it reaches her, it takes off its turban and does a deep, grand bow to her. She is delighted and takes the Monkey into her arms. The Monkey kisses her cheek. The children laugh. \nMARION Why, thank you. I like you too. \nFAYAH Then it shall be welcome in our house. \nMARION Oh, no! You don't have to have it around if you don't want it - \nSALLAH (cheerfully) All of Allah's creatures are welcome here. You please us by letting us please you. \nEXT. COURTYARD - SALLAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIndy and Sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard. Sallah holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medallion and the base, and has for the first time fitted them together. They fit perfectly and complete the headpiece. He peruses the markings on the headpiece quizzically. Indy is cleaning and loading a .45 automatic. \nINDY I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah. They couldn't have an excavation in the desert without the best digger in Egypt. \nSALLAH All Arabs look alike to them, Indy. \nINDY Tell me about the map room at Tanis. \nSALLAH We found it three days ago. I broke through myself. \nINDY Those Nazis are moving awfully fast. \nSALLAH The Frenchman is helping them. \nIndy reacts. \nINDY Belloq. So he got away from the Indians. This is going to be more interesting that I thought. \nSALLAH I'm afraid this has put the Germans close to finding the Well of the Souls. \nINDY (indicates the headpiece) Even Belloq won't be able to find it without that. Can you make anything of those markings? They're nothing I'm familiar with. \nSALLAH (shakes his head \"no\") But I know someone who might. You can go to see him tomorrow. (a worried expression) Indy... something bothers me. \nINDY What is it, my friend? \nSallah finds it hard to say. When he finally speaks, his words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush of wind through the courtyard. Just a coincidence we might suppose. \nSALLAH It is the Ark. If it is there, at Tanis... It is not something man was meant to disturb... Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth. \nThe wind dies down. Indy shakes off a chill and stares thoughtfully at his friend. \nEXT. HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CAIRO STREET - DAY \nIndy and Marion are briskly walking along one of Cairo's busy bazaar streets. Vendors with fine cloth, pottery, baskets, jewelry, etc line the street. Marion has the Monkey from Sallah's house on her shoulder. \nINDY Do you really need that monkey? \nMARION I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking that way about our baby. He's got your looks, too. \nINDY And your brains. \nAs Indy and Marion turn a corner, the Monkey seems to notice something and immediately jumps from Marion's shoulder and hurries off at a frantic pace down the street. \n", "test1_id": 804, "test2_input": "Snakes are moving in force up the pillar toward Indy's dwindling torch. Indy grasps the pillar for dear life, grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with all he's got. The pillar begins to break loose of the ceiling, then stops. Indy's eyes are on the torch. It is just a spot of flame now. Snakes are sliding up toward his hands. Indy again pushes against the wall and the torch falls out of his mouth. \nThe pillar goes! In the dim light, we see it fall like a tree directly at Marion. Indy rides it down. The top hits the wall three feet from a cringing Marion and smashes through to a black chamber beyond. Indy flies off into the darkness. Gone. Marion clutches her torch at the black hole. \nMARION Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord! \nThere is a moment that seems an eternity, then Indy appears like an apparition out of the void. \nINDY Come on! \nHe grabs her and helps her over the remains of the wall into - \nINT. THE CATACOMBS \nThe winding string of connected chambers is revealed to them only a few feet at a time as their torch lights the way. \nMARION The snakes... are they here? \nINDY I guess not. I think I'd be dead. \nMARION Do you know where you're going? \nINDY Absolutely. \nMARION Thank god. Where? \nINDY Out. \nThey round a corner and flush a covey of bats. Marion screams. \nINDY Don't do that. It scares me. \nMarion gives him a look. They round a corner and begin a walk through a maze of chambers that present for their inspection: moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi; a room decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall crawling with huge scarabaeid beetles. Marion is quite naturally a nervous wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her suddenly and points. \nINDY Look! \nWHAT THEY SEE \nThere, coming through the crack in the corner of the next chamber, is white blessed sunlight. \nEXT. THE TANIS DIGS - NEAR AIRSTRIP - DAY \nIndy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows of an abandoned excavation. Before them is the improvised airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply depot, two fuel tank trucks. Down by the fuel trucks a German Mechanic is looking skyward. Now Indy and Marion look there too, drawn by the roaring sound of - \nA Flying Wing, which is circling over the digs in preparation to landing. \nNow a new figure approaches the German Mechanic. It is Gobler; he yells to the mechanic, indicating the plane. \nGOBLER Get is gassed immediately! It has an important cargo to take out! \nIn the distance, the Flying Wing lands and rolls toward the men. Gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp, which is hidden from view by a rise. Indy and Marion watch him go. \nINDY When the Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on that plane. \nThe Flying Wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks. The German Mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires as the engines continue to roar. \nIndy and Marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to the plane, near the supply tent. Suddenly, a Second German Mechanic appears behind them. He is as surprised as they are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at Indy. Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out into the open, wrestling. Marion remains hidden, moving fast among the crates. \nThe first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left - right - left combination. He turns to find the first German Mechanic flying at him. The roll toward the rear of the Flying Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers. \n", "test2_true": "The fistfight between Indy and the German Mechanic has taken on a new stomach-tightening dimension. The men are fighting and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the back of the plane's wings. Each man comes within inches of becoming instant mincemeat. \nThe Pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up. He pulls a Luger from his side and points it, waiting for a clear shot at Indy. The German Mechanic kicks Indy away from him and the Pilot aims his pistol. Suddenly, Marion appears behind the Pilot, standing on the opposite wing, and bashes him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding the tires. The Pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body falling on the throttle. The engines roar louder, revving up. The plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still- blocked set of tires. Marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep from slipping into the props. She bends into the cockpit, trying to pull the Pilot's body off the throttle. No luck. She grimaces and climbs inside. Her shoulder bumps the top of the cockpit; it slides tightly shut above her. \nUnder the moving wing, Indy delivers a knockout rightcross to the German Mechanic which sends him staggering back toward a roaring propeller. Indy's grimace registers the man's demise and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him. Indy spins toward the sound of crumpling metal and sees - \nThe other prop of the Flying Wing slice into a tank truck. The airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement, surrounding the plane. Indy backpedals away from the plane, his eyes searching the scene for Marion. Suddenly, he is shocked to see her in the cockpit. He runs toward her, skidding through the gasoline. \nINDY Get out! Get out! \nMarion is struggling with the top of the cockpit. She can't budge it. She's trapped. \nEXT. THE COMMAND TENT - DAY \nThree Armed Nazis stand guard around the wooden crate containing the Ark. It is sitting near the flopped-open entrance to the Command Tent and there is furious activity going on here. Belloq, Shliemann, Gobler, Belzig and assorted Aides are packing up all the papers and personal items in preparation for a hasty departure. \nA large crowd of Arab Diggers is milling about among the tents. They all want to get a look at the Ark. Sallah is among them. All at once, there is a earthshaking explosion. Al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip. A huge fireball floats into view over there. Everyone starts running toward it. Shliemann yells at Belzig and the Armed Nazis. \nSHLIEMANN Stay with the Ark! \nEXT. THE RISE ABOVE AIRSTRIP - DAY \nAlmost all the Arabs and Germans in the digs have congregated here and are staring at the burning remains of the Flying Wing. Belloq and Shliemann arrive just as the second fuel truck blows up. The concussion knocks many of the observers flat. Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler watch the scene in alarm. \nSHLIEMANN Sabotage! \nBELLOQ We must get the Ark away from this place immediately! \nSHLIEMANN (to Gobler) Have it put on the truck. We'll fly out of Cairo. \nGobler snaps his heels, turns to go. \nSHLIEMANN And Gobler - (Gobler stops) I want plenty of protection. \nGobler nods and runs off. Shliemann heads back toward camp. Belloq hesitates a long moment, studying the burning wreckage with an odd, suspicious look. Finally, he turns and leaves, passing a nearby stack of barrels. When he has passed, Sallah appears from among the barrels. He searches the crowd for his people and starts a broken field run along some tents to avoid a group of Germans and is running flat-out when someone sticks out a leg and sends him flipping. Sallah, dust all over his face, looks angrily toward the concealed culprit. At once, a flashing white grin splits his darkened face. Indy and Marion, splotched with soot and oil, are hiding in the flap of a tent. Sallah runs into their arms and the three embrace warmly. When they break - \nSALLAH Holy smoke, my friends! I am so pleased you are not dead. \nMARION Us too. \nSALLAH (suddenly remembering) The Ark! They're taking it on a truck to Cairo. \nINDY Where is it? \nSallah gestures to follow and all three run off stealthily through the mostly deserted camp. \nEXT. AMONG THE TENTS - DAY \nSallah, Indy and Marion run into a hiding spot behind some water barrels near the Command Tent. They peek out at this activity - \nIn the big space near the Command Tent is parked an open German staff car; inside is a Blond Driver and an Armed Guard. Directly behind it is a canvas-topped troop truck. At this moment, Belloq and Shliemann are supervising the careful placement of the crated Ark in the back of the truck. When it is securely placed inside, we hear an ominous marching sound and Nine Armed Nazis appear at a trot from between some tents and climb into the back of the truck with the Ark. \nBehind the water barrels, Sallah and Marion exchange hapless looks, But Indy just concentrates on - \nThe scene by the truck: Belloq and Shliemann are about to climb into the front staff car when they pause to check out the final component of the convoy. Rolling into place behind the truck is another open staff car. But this one is special - mounted in the back is a big, black machine gun, manned by a Gunner. At the wheel of the car is Gobler and next to him sits Belzig. \nSallah and Marion look at Indy. Belloq and Shliemann climb in the back seat of the front car and the caravan pulls out. Indy watches it go, thinking hard. \n", "test2_id": 805, "test3_input": "In the folds of the Tabernacle, the silk of the tents undulating around him. The light is even stranger, the scene almost dreamlike. With the help of the Tall Captain, Belloq lets an extraordinary, gold-embroidered, ceremonial robe fall over his head and onto his body. Belloq looks transported, possessed. The Tall Captain unlatches a wooden case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long, elaborately engraved. Belloq takes it from him, turns and slips back through the silk. The Tall Captain stays in the folds. \nBack in the central area, Shliemann and the other Nazis are taken aback by Belloq's appearance in the robe. They exchange looks. From one knot of men there is muttering about \"Juden\" and such, but when Belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there is immediate silence. Shliemann looks uncertain in this presence. \nBelloq approaches the Ark. He stops a few feet from it and begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew. After a few moments of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself. The end of the rod is an inch from the notch when - \nIndy steps into the Tabernacle. On his shoulder is a bazooka and it is aimed directly at the Ark. \nINDY Hold it. (the Nazi react) One move from anybody and I blow that box back to Moses. \nShliemann makes it clear to the other Nazis that Indy is to be obeyed. \nBELLOQ Jones, your persistence surprises even me. You are going to give mercenaries a bad name. \nINDY What about you? Talked to God yet? (Belloq's eyes flash) Where's the girl? \nSHLIEMANN Doctor Jones, surely you don't think you can escape from this base. \nINDY That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want is the girl. We'll keep possession of the Ark only till we've got safe transport to England. Then it's all yours. \nSHLIEMANN If we refuse? \nINDY Then the Ark and some of us are going up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler would like that a bit. Now I don't want to talk about this anymore. Show me that girl in five seconds or - \nThe Tall Captain flies out of the silk and takes Indy down by the neck. The bazooka clatters across the cement floor as two other Nazis help subdue Indy. The three Nazis take Indy's pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp. \nSHLIEMANN Jones, this is the second time I have seen you looking very foolish. \nINDY It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break it. \nShliemann draws his Luger. \nSHLIEMANN I'll help you. This time I'll kill you myself. \nShliemann raises the pistol. \nBELLOQ No! Not in the presence of the Ark! Take him outside. \nShliemann eyes Belloq, then the Ark. He lowers the pistol, motions for the Nazis to take Indy out ahead of him. They stop a moment only when Belloq speaks. \nBELLOQ Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am even a little sorry you will miss this moment. \nINDY Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him I'm on my way up. \nShliemann motions them out and follows. Belloq turns back to the Ark, raising the ivory rod. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nShliemann, the Tall Captain, Indy and the two Nazis holding him emerge from the Tabernacle. Shliemann points to a nearby wall and the group starts that way with Shliemann and the Tall Captain slightly ahead. \nINT. THE TABERNACLE \nBelloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the lid of the Ark. He utters a short phrase in Hebrew and begins to press down on his end of the rod. The lid of the Ark begins to lift. It's difficult work. Belloq puts his whole weight into one big press on his end and the lid opens two feet. \nInside the Ark of the Covenant is a preview of the end of the world. A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a charge so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to compare to it. It's as though this magnificent golden box has been gathering electric energy for three thousand years, waiting for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one fast, cleansing explosion of pure force. \nBlinding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the white silk to flame. But it is Belloq in his obsession who takes the full blast. His whole body seems lit by a million volt current and, for a moment, his complete form is white, then blue, then maybe green, but it is hard to tell because our eyes are blinded now too. Two aspects of this ghastly, beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos, although the communication is subliminal. First, that Belloq, in the instant of his destruction, has experienced some kind of sublime, transcendental knowledge. If a death's-head can smile and look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandescent face would be described. Secondly, this event is accompanied by a sound like no other. A sound so intense and so odd and so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine it were the whisper of God. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \n", "test3_true": "Shliemann, hand on his eyes, aims his Luger blindly at the scuffle. Indy pushes the Tall Captain at Shliemann, who fires on impact, killing the Tall Captain. Indy knocks out Shliemann. \nBehind Indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the Ark have suddenly ceased, but the Tabernacle is ablaze and the fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side. Smoke is already starting to fill the cavern. Nazis are running around, yelling for firefighting water. A burning crate at the side of the Tabernacle is pushed over, only to knock over a drum of heavy black oil. A river of flame shoots across the cement. \nIndy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body of one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming Tabernacle. \nINT. THE TABERNACLE \nIndy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of fire. He looks around at the dead bodies, then at the Ark. The lid has slammed down shut again and the Ark shines gold in the flames. Before it, where Belloq once stood, is a pile of ash and charred debris. Indy registers this, then continues to scan the scene. \nINDY Marion! Marion, can you hear me? \nSuddenly, Indy looks as - \nThe far side of the Tabernacle burns completely away, revealing Marion, tied spread-eagle between two upright posts. Her nightgown is now in tatters, black with soot. She is gagged, but her eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet. \nIndy rushes toward her, unaware of a uniformed Nazi who has appeared from the flames. Marion looks up to see Indy and the Nazi leveling his submachine gun at Indy. She motions desperately with her eyes. Indy dives and rolls through the flames just as the Nazi opens fire. From the floor, Indy blasts the Nazi. \nThe river of burning oil is only a foot from Marion. \nIndy jumps up and runs toward the bound Marion, his bayonet aimed directly at her. Her wide eyes flash between the flames and the shining blade. Expertly, Indy slashes down both sides at Marion, cutting all four bindings. Marion falls backwards, away from the flames, but before she hits the ground, Indy is there, catching her in his arms. \nThey embrace. They kiss. They break. \nINDY Hi. \nMARION Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here. \nINDY Glad I could make it. \nIndy rises, pulling her up with him. The Tabernacle is burning away so fast that soon Indy and Marion will be completely exposed. Indy rushes over and grabs the submachine gun and a Luger from the dead Nazi. \nINDY Let's get out of here. \nMARION What about the Ark? \nIndy stops, startled by her spunky attitude. He's considering their changes. \nINDY Are you game? \nMARION Hell yes! We've made it this far. \nINDY (grins at her) Okay. Let's do it. \nThey approach the altar through the dying flames, Indy slinging the submachine gun over his back. The long carrying poles are still in place. \nINDY Whatever you do, don't touch it. Let's put it on the floor. \nMarion nods. Each taking an end with the poles, they lift the Ark from the altar and lower it to the floor. Marion grunts under the weight. Indy registers this, hands her the submachine gun. He pulls out his whip, motions her back, and sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the Ark. The whip wraps snugly around the plaiting and Indy ties it off. The Ark is now harnessed to the whip handle. Indy gives it an experimental pull and the Ark slides across the smooth cement. Indy indicates the direction of the second train tunnel. \nINDY We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone who looks at us crosseyed. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER \nTwo huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the Nazis are having trouble getting water to them. The Nazis main concern at this point is an enormous, neat stack of wooden cartridge boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already blazing, and now teetering, stacks of general goods. Nervous Nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is close. \nIndy and Marion make their way along the side of the center court, Indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the Ark. One Nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them queerly. Indy knocks him out with the butt of his Luger just as Marion is about to fire. \n", "test3_id": 806}

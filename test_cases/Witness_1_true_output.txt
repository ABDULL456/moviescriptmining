SCHAEFFER Ah... no. 
UNDERSHERIFF (frowns) Maybe a road or route number? 
SCHAEFFER Sorry. 
The Undersheriff is not impressed. 
UNDERSHERIFF Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third Amishman around here is named Lapp. That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler. (and) Chief, if the Amish have taken your man in, I wouldn't want to hang from a rope until you find him. 
ANGLE 
Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury: 
SCHAEFFER Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an education. 
He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then he glances up. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY 
A bright, sunny afternoon. 
SAMUEL 
Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. Visitors. 
ANGLE IN SICKROOM 
Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room. 
BOOK'S POV  CLERGY 
PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in German. 
These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat apart. 
ANGLE 
Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes. 
Tschantz rumbles in German. 
SUBTITLES OVER. 
TSCHANTZ Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to your credit. 
STOLTZFUS He was touched by God's hand. 
Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with him. 
Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, smiles. 
RACHEL Hello. 
Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen. 
BOOK (closing his eyes) Who are they? 
RACHEL The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life. 
BOOK Can I have something to drink? 
Rachel brings him tea. 
BOOK Does anybody know I'm here? 
RACHEL Only the elders. 
BOOK How long? 
RACHEL What? 
BOOK How long have I been here? 
RACHEL Two days. 
BOOK (a beat) Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go. 
RACHEL (frowns) But you can't. 
He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the sheet.

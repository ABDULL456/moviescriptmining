The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly. The air is thick with smoke. Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the fire.  He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her. 
TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical. When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide. 
C.U. - REESE, very intense. 
REESE Come with me if you want to live. 
She looks where he is pointing.

PANAGLIDE FOLLOWING REESE AND SARAH, running headlong through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back hallway.  Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to her feet without slowing. 
He hits a closed door, which crashes open. Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor. Slams and blot-latches it. An instant later an impact from the far side tears the latch-screws half out of the wall. They run on.

DOLLYING AHEAD OF TERMINATOR, very fast, as he runs full- throttle.  Behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles down the narrow hallway.  He clears the outer door an instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley. 
CUT TO: 
103     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STOKER'S - NIGHT               103 
Vukovich's plain car arrives, slewing to a stop in the glass-littered street in front of the blazing building. He leaps out, Traxler right in behind him. 
VUKOVICH (shouting) What the fuck is going on? 
TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them.  He motions to the nearest one.

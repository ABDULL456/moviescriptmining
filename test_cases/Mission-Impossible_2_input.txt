ETHAN Why not? 
PHELPS Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 
CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to be the reference point in the following exchange: 
ETHAN How was Chicago? 
PHELPS Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!" 
PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is in his line of sight. 
PHELPS (CONT'D) Boy, you really are grim. Come here, take a look. 
He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. 
EXT. PRAGUE - DAY 
ETHAN's POV of Embassy. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY 
ETHAN nods. 
PHELPS (CONT'D) Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them.  If they're exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over here.  Take a lock at this. 
CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is playing. 
ETHAN is distracted by it. 
INSERT - TELEVISION 
SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, is holding forth: 
SENATOR WALTZER I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one -- who are these people?!  We were living in a democracy the last time I checked. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ETHAN looks back at JIM. 
ETHAN You're going to use Walter? 
PHELPS He's our guy. 
ETHAN Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 
PHELPS Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 
ETHAN He won't be back in a hurry? 
PHELPS No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work? 
ETHAN Sure.  If the main character does. 
PHELPS If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? 
JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum. 
JACK Sorry, am I interrupting? 
ETHAN Always. 
JACK shows the gum to ETHAN. 
JACK Stick of gum. If you come up against a lock you can't pick -- 
Half the gum is red, the other half is green. 
JACK (CONT'D) Red light.  Green light.  Mash them together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on you -- you have five seconds. 
He offers the gum to ETHAN. 
PHELPS Are you gonna take it? 
CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. 
ETHAN (relenting) Give me the God damn gum.

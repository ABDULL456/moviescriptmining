SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown. 
RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS) Kids are asleep, doc. 
LOUIS Great. 
He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just two good people in all the big darkness of their new house. 
RACHEL You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you? 
LOUIS Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and--- 
RACHEL ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- 
LOUIS Did you see his shirt? 
RACHEL (giggles) Sure. Bruce Springsteen. 
LOUIS I really do have a million questions about the area...but the thing I'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the Boss. 
She laughs. 
EXT.  THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT 
Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge. 
JUD (voice) That you, doc? 
EXT.  THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE 
We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman earphones. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
LOUIS It's me. 
INT.  THE PORCH, WITH JUD 
The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the headphones casually around his neck, like a kid. 
JUD Well, come on up and have a beer. 
INT.  THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT 
LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS. 
JUD You need a glass? 
LOUIS Not at all. 
JUD Good for you. 
LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught. 
LOUIS God, that's fine. 
JUD Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself. 
LOUIS What were you listening to? 
JUD Allman Brothers. 
LOUIS What? 
JUD The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. 
He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the Walkman's PLAY button. 
SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats. 
LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head. 
JUD I'm sorry. Wait. 
He turns it down. 
JUD Try that. 
LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments. It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off. 
LOUIS Nice. 
JUD I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause) One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. 
LOUIS (great sincerity) Thank you, Mr. Crandall. 
He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look toward: 
EXT/INT.  THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN) 
One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too-- sweeps by in a blast of air. 
INT.  THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD 
LOUIS (wincing) Jesus! 
JUD (lights a cigarette) That's one mean road, all right--you remember that path your wife commented on? 
LOUIS The one that goes into the woods--sure. 
JUD That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there. 
LOUIS What's at the end of it? 
JUD (smiles) Another day--after you get settled in a bit. Meantime, doc--- 
Here JUD raises his glass in a toast. 
JUD (continues) Here's to your bones. 
LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S. 
LOUIS And yours. 
They drink. 
EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT 
LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his attention the other way...toward the path. 
He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.

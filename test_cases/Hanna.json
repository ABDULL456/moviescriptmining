{"test1_input": "SEB (CONT'D) Here goes nothing. He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around. SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He passes ISAACS on his way round. \nSEB (CONT'D) Excuse me. Sir? ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her mirrors. SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea who he is. \nINSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT - HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry. \n114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114 \nDark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast. A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with the exertion. Water dripping from his body. He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He approaches the beach car park. A POLICE CAR swings into the car park. ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on him. He stops and turns towards the police car. TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He watches them very carefully. \n115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115 \nThe FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains. \n116 INT. VAN - DAY 116 \nHANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged landscape. Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold evening light. HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a little water spills down his front. SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's. \n117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117 \nISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach. \nISAACS Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we have a situation here... \n118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118 \nISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a number of scenes with no luck until he notices: The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and boarding the van. \n119 INT. VAN - DAY 119 \nHANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and they stare at the huge, granite mountain range... She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's shoulder. \n120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120 \nMARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats freshly sliced. \nLEWIS The Danish authorities are taking this very seriously. They've doubled the number of officers on the ground. We've sent up spotter planes over the channel. \n(MORE) \nLEWIS (CONT'D) They're appealing for witnesses through the local media... MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her. \nLEWIS (CONT'D) You think he really swam it? MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she walks away. \nMARISSA Keep me posted. \n121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121 \nThe campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage, borders and rules. Families come here from cities across Europe and bring their whole lives with them. The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious looking FRENCH family with quad bikes. SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment. \nGERMAN CAMPER. Guten tag. \nHANNA Guten Morgen. \nGERMAN CAMPER. Wie geht es Ihnen? \nHANNA Gutm und Ihnen? \nGERMAN CAMPER. Jah, gut, gut... A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them. \nFRENCH CAMPER. Bonjour. Ca va? \nHANNA Ca va. Oui. Bien... HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties complicated knots. RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses. \n", "test1_true": "SOPHIE No thanks. HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight. \n122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122 \nHANNA turns a display unit of postcards. Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE \nBOYS. One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S not used to this feeling of being looked at. While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a postcard and a book of stamps. \n123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123 \nHANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mission accomplished' HANNA gets up and posts the card. \n124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124 \nRACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above them the evening chorus is in full song. \nRACHEL I just feel connected when I'm in the countryside. The city stifles me... emotionally, creatively. HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in the undergrowth. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Anyway, I was very young when I... Seb and I.... He was so impressive. HANNA suddenly runs into the woods. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Hanna?! \n125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125 \nThe FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred veggie sausages. \nSOPHIE It's probably just a bunch of Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly going to be out all night. \nRACHEL You're not going, Sophie. No way, Jose. HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS. She lays them in front of the family. \nHANNA Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might be. \nMILES That's gross. \n126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126 \nThe girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does HANNA'S make-up. \nSOPHIE I don't know why I'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me. \nHANNA What do you mean? \nSOPHIE Though quite frankly I don't need more digits than I've got right now. Loads. Loads and loads. HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't look right on her. \nHANNA It's like paint. \nSOPHIE Don't lick it off. SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) You're gorgeous. \n127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127 \nSOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited, SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience. \nHANNA I can't walk in this. \nSOPHIE You look hot. \nHANNA Where are we going? \nSOPHIE Shhhhh! HANNA uncomfortable with the situation. \nHANNA I shouldn't take unnecessary risks. \n", "test1_id": 2241, "test2_input": "147 EXT/INT. CAR/CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 147 \nThe van slowly pulls in at the side of the road. RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls in behind the van. On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's building blocks. \nRACHEL Why won't that car pass? He has his lights on high beam, I was doing everything I could to get out of the way... SOPHIE wakes up in the back. \nSOPHIE Are we stopped? I need to pee. \nRACHEL Well, I don't want you going too far right now. \nHANNA I think you should stay where you are, Sophie. HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make the first move. \nRACHEL Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake up. \nHANNA Please. \nSOPHIE This is creepy. You're creeping me out. \nSEB \n(GROGGY) Are we in Lille? \nHANNA I'm sorry. But you really mustn't get out of the van. HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to \nSOPHIE. \nHANNA (CONT'D) What ever you do, don't follow me. Promise not to follow me. \nSOPHIE I promise. \nRACHEL Hanna, tell me what's going on or Seb will go over to that car and find out. \nSEB Like fuck I will. Everyone stay put. Where's my phone? \nHANNA \n(TO SOPHIE) Thank you for being my friend. HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car doors open. In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts from the van. \nRACHEL Hanna! RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA. The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his gun at her head. RACHEL screams. \n148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148 \nHANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative safety of the container park. ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed. HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers. ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA. HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way and that. ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze. \nISAACS (O.S.) Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You need to come with me now. I know where your papa is. She listens. \nCUT TO: ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again. \nISAACS (CONT'D) He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He misses you. \nCUT TO: The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double- kicks him in the chest. \nHANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the containers when she reaches a gap. The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too. A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up higher, now four containers high. ISAACS follow below. HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right over the head of ISAACS. HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to land on a lower container on the other side. HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground. She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to the ground. She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the containers. She stops at a \u00e2\u0080\u0098T' junction, unsure which way to go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the third. She's trapped. \nISAACS (CONT'D) Just take it easy. HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS. He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her. She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he crashes to the ground. She rolls and springs to her feet. The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick. \n149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149 \nHANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of waste. HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the scrap metal is unloaded. \nA large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a tarpaulin. \n150 INT. HOLDING CELLS.

You need to help us find her. \nSOPHIE I don't know where to find her!

You smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gain \nENTRY - \nRACHEL She said she lived in Leipzig. She went to the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. \nMARISSA There is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. It closed five years ago. Shock on Rachel's face. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) Did she give any idea of where she was going? Rachel wracks her brains. \nRACHEL She said she was going home, to Leipzig. She seemed lost. Like she needed taking care of. (woman to woman) You understand. MARISSA shows her the photograph of JOANNA ZADEK. \nMARISSA This was Hanna's mother, Joanna Zadek. Fifteen years ago Hanna's father shot her to death on a camping holiday by the Baltic. RACHEL swallows, goes pale. \nCUT TO: MARISSA now in SEB'S cell. \nSEB She was odd. I'll give you that. Disconnected. I mean I get on with most kids, you know, have a rapport. But, this one - \nMARISSA You know, Mr Lyall, it's days like these that I really hate my job. \nSEB I'm sure you do. \nMARISSA It's a very, very difficult thing to do. \nSEB Absolutely. \nMARISSA But sometimes children are bad people too. \nCUT TO: \nMARISSA in MILES'S cell. MILES is terrified of MARISSA. She puts her hand out and strokes his hair. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) I'm not going to hurt you. MILES shrinks from her touch. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) Miles is a nice name. Are you a nice boy? She strokes MILES' hair and immediately he starts crying loudly. SEB pounds on the wall from his cell. \nSEB Hey what's going on in there? We don't have to put up with this! We're in the EU, Goddammit! \n151 EXT. BARGE. RURAL FRANCE INTO GERMANY. DAWN 151 \nHANNA watches as the sun rises over the misty fields either side be the canal. It's a beautiful sight. HANNA is strangely peaceful. \n152 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 152 \nNow the whole family are reunited in MILES' cell. He sniffs and plays with his Nintendo.

KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 174 \nPROJECT - DAY HANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and approaches the kitchen window. She peers through. On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood splattered across the glass. \nHANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the glass. \n175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175 \nHANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies. HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain that spreads across the cheap lino floor. HANNA steps back and gags. She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and goes through into the lounge. The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by MARISSA'S hunt for information. HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters. The room had been turned into a home office, there are newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the truth behind her daughters murder. HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will help her understand who she is and where she came from. Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice. \nERIK (V.O.) You won't find anything. HANNA turns in shock. \nERIK Marissa would have been much too careful for that. HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER. \nERIK (CONT'D) Sit down Hanna. \nHANNA Are you my father? \nERIK Sit down. \nHANNA Are you my father? \nERIK Please. \nHANNA Are you? Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing but she knows the answer is no. \nERIK I was going to tell you. HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast. \nHANNA What's wrong with me? ERIK flinches slightly. \nERIK Nothing. \nHANNA Where was I born? ERIK knows he has to tell the truth. \nERIK At Galinka. \nHANNA What's that? \nERIK It was a secret CIA research programme in rural Poland. \nHANNA What kind of research? \nERIK Children. HANNA stares at ERIK. \nERIK (CONT'D) It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The science came from the old East Germany. The money from the CIA. The intention was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos... to improve \nTHEM \nHANNA CONT'D) Improve? ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost. \nERIK Reduce capacity for fear. For pity. Increase muscle strength. Heighten senses. Anything that might make a better soldier. HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about. \nHANNA How did you know about it? ERIK's stares right at her. \nERIK I worked for it. She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his pocket. \nERIK (CONT'D) This is what you were looking for. HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995. An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller. \n", "test3_true": "ERIK (CONT'D) I had recruited twenty women. She was the last.

You worked. \nHANNA You mean I'm a killer? \nERIK No... no.. He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent repulsion. \nHANNA Don't touch me. \nERIK We have a new identity for you. A new life. A new beginning. She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener. \nERIK (CONT'D) Don't. She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers him, has a knife to his throat. \nHANNA Let me go. He releases her. She goes to the door. \nERIK I tried to prepare you for what your life would be. \nHANNA You didn't prepare me for this. And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down the fire escape. ERIK calls after her. \nERIK Hanna wait. He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars coming across the estate scrubland. ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs through the destroyed living room, and out through the front door. \nDAY ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA. \n177 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. CONT. 177 \nMARISSA's car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight into HANNA when suddenly... MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block. She speaks to ISAACS. \nMARISSA That's him. And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them. \n178 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN. 178 \nHELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking to finish it off. Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway. \nMARISSA (O.C.) Drop it. MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him. There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER drops his gun. Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye. \nERIK So go ahead. She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can for him. \nMARISSA You know I'll find her. \nERIK Don't under estimate what you created. \nMARISSA What we created, together. \n179 EXT.

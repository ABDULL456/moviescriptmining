{"train": "HANNA \nWritten by \nSeth Lochead \n1 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1 \nWinter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running. HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice, glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost completely into the landscape of trees and snow. She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air. Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of an arrow piercing its skin. The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam pouring from its nostrils. HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her knees. She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face. She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound. \nHANNA I just missed your heart. She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist holster. She fires two shots directly at CAMERA. \nCUT TO TITLE: HANNA \n2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2 \nA knife enters the deer near its anus. \nHANNA \n(WHISPER) Remove the penis and scrotum, make a deep, circular cut around the rectum. HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket. \nHANNA (CONT'D) \n(WHISPER) Cut from the rear to the brisket. She works calmly without expression. \n3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3 \nThe deer lies on it's side. HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver. She freezes, sensing danger. Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out into the still forest. No sound. ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands behind her like a ghost. \nERIK You're dead. Right now. I've killed you. HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow. She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away. \nERIK (CONT'D) Use your hands! She goes for the gun again and again he stops her. He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and tossing it deep into the forest. HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground. She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap... ... but she can't. He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow. ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows a touch of frustration. He plods into the forest. \nERIK (CONT'D) Drag it back yourself. HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its dead face. \n4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4 \nHANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on to a stick. No sign she was ever there. \n5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5 \nHANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts her knees high and moves at a steady pace. Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching her. \n6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6 \nA log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss. \n7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7 \nAlmost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions that have been brought in from the outside world are old and worn. HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to some dried leaves. \n8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8 \nHANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed in furs. HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a mouthful, watches HANNA not eating. \nERIK What's wrong? Are you hurt? She keeps swirling her spoon. \nERIK (CONT'D) You were half asleep. \nHANNA I'll do better next time. \nERIK German. \nERIK It's difficult to explain. \nHANNA Try. He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and reads. \nERIK \n(READING) \u00e2\u0080\u0098Music. A combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion'. \nHANNA But how does it feel? Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions. \nERIK Good. It feels good. It's, uh, nice. \nHANNA Tell me properly. Can you play music? \nERIK Your mother could. She used to sing very well. \nHANNA I'd like to hear it for myself. \nERIK You will soon enough. \nHANNA How soon? Erik looks away from her questioning eyes. \nERIK When you're ready. \nHANNA I'm ready. I'm ready already. They look at each other- he weighs it up. \nERIK Just go to sleep now. I'll see you in the morning. \nHanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment and leaves the room. HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes like hers - her MOTHER, JOANNA ZADEK. \n10 EXT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 10 \nThe morning sunlight slants through the forest. ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires. The tree breaks apart. \n11 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - MORNING 11 \nHANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT. She is still holding her mothers photgraph. HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out of bed. \n12 EXT. LOG CABIN. SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12 \nAnother GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart. Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and fires. She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires. ERIK watching. \n13 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 13 \nHANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends easily. \nERIK Again. They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. \nERIK (CONT'D) Again. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes are solid. \n14 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 14 \nA medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin acts as a chin-up bar. Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined. \n15 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 15 \nERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting. \nHANNA I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I have a dog called Trudi. \n16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16 \nHANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in. \nERIK It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. He looks at her, a hint of a challenge. \nERIK (CONT'D) When you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch. She approaches the box and places a single finger on the small red switch. \nERIK (CONT'D) But once it's done, there'll be no going back. She'll never give up until you're dead, or she is. You understand? I wont be there to hold your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's what you really want. \nHANNA You're not scaring me. He looks at her disbelievingly. She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away from the switch. He softens towards her. \nERIK It's here. There's no rush. Take your time. HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking another look at it over her shoulder. \n26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26 \nHANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from the encyclopedia. \nERIK Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957. Scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. \nHANNA That's sad. ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject. \nERIK When a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars. HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that might be. \n27 INT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 27 \nERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts. \nERIK Will you hunt with me? Hanna is sweeping the ground. \nHANNA If you want. \nERIK It's up to you. \nHANNA Me? \nERIK Yes. HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her. \nHANNA I'll stay. \nERIK Fine. ERIK leaves abruptly. HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the box. She turns and walks out of the cabin. \n28 EXT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28 \nHANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk. She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere. \nHANNA (whispering to herself) Marissa Wiegler. \n29 INT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 29 \nCLOSE ON - the metal box, the switch catches the light from the door as HANNA enters to confront it. The room is still and quiet. HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her hand. \nHANNA \n(WHISPER) Come and find me. CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to flash. An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to - \n30 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - EARLY MORNING 30 \nCLOSE ON - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly. MARISSA WIEGLER, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off. She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children. She's made choices in her life and lives without looking back. She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror. She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth in a snarl as she brushes them. Her gums bleed a little. \n31 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 31 \nHANNA tends to boiling pots. She's cooking a feast. ERIK enters. He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door. He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's sad. \nERIK You were lucky to grab that deer. There was nothing out there today. ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing. \nERIK (CONT'D) Smells good. He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the hug is over. \nBOB He's right. This has nothing to do with us. I don't understand. \nMARISSA You don't have to. I'm making the call. BOB and WALT exchange a look. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be all. The video screen flickers off, people take their files and start to leave. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness. \n35 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 35 \nHANNA sits in her bed reading her encyclopaedia. ERIK, dressed incongruously in the suit and tie, enters and sits on the edge of her bed. She doesn't look up from her book. His face shows more emotion than we've seen before. \nERIK Hanna... HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear. \nERIK (CONT'D) Tell me again? \nHANNA Marissa Weigler. \nERIK Then? \nHANNA Postcard. \nERIK Then? \nHANNA What? \nERIK The address where we meet. \nHANNA Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks at her with paternal care. \nERIK Good night my sweet girl. He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him. \nHANNA Father... He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation. \nERIK You can do this. You're ready. Just remember what I've taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him. \nHANNA I'll see you there. \n36 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT. 36 \nERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath. \n37 INT/EXT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 37 \nHANNA gets out of bed and goes to the small window. \nShe watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last time. \n38 EXT. EDGE OF NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT. 38 \nDusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of impending night on the snow. Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil down to the ground. \n39 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 39 \nHANNA is doing push-ups on her bedroom floor. \n40 EXT. FOREST/CABIN - NIGHT 40 \nInfra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest wearing night vision-goggles. The Leader of the Operation follows the tracker signal. \nSPECIAL OPS Is this guy one of ours? \nHEAD OF OPS Used to be. Tread carefully, he's been in there a long time, he's damaged goods, and he knows we're coming. We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the pitch blackness. The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the breathing of men in the icy cold. \n41 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 41 \nBURTON This must all be very strange for you. You've been in the forest a long time. But I want you to know no one's going to hurt you. We just want to talk to you about your father. HANNA seems to be staring up at the ceiling. \nBURTON (CONT'D) Hanna? He follows her eye-line to the CCTV camera above them. \nHANNA Is that a camera? \nBURTON Ah, yes, that's a camera. To keep a record. \nHANNA Camera obscura, it's Latin for \"dark chamber\". \n47 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. 47 \nLEWIS sits with the MONITOR, watching HANNA watching him. \nLEWIS Plug the CCTV through to Langley. Extension 247. MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and speaks into it. \nLEWIS (CONT'D) You should have visual on the psych evaluation now. \n48 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 48 \nMARISSA, alone in a Langley OBS ROOM. No one else there. Late at night in America. Something secret about Marissa here. On the screen she sees HANNA in the Interrogation Room. Her screen tells she is watching CAMP G - Interrogation Room 3. MARISSA watches HANNA intently. \nHANNA It was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021. \nMARISSA What's she saying? \nLEWIS (O.S.) Gobbledygook. \n49 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 49 \nMARISSA stares at her screen, at the blank face of the fourteen year old HANNA. Focus in on MARISSA's face as she studies this strange young woman. The sense that MARISSA knows more about this girl than she is letting on. On the screen BURTON continues to probe. \nBURTON Can I get you something? What do you like? Music? Magazines? Just say. Anything at all. \n50 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 50 \nHANNA leans forward. Looks at BURTON, who encourages her with his eyes. She whispers. \nHANNA I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler. \n51 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 51 \nMARISSA sits in stunned silence. \nLEWIS (O.S.) Did you hear that? MARISSA pauses before she answers. \nMARISSA Tell her I'll be there tonight. \nLEWIS But... \nMARISSA Just do it. \n52 INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. 52 \nA white space with specialist lighting and the hum of specialised air pressurizes. A protected environment - this is the DNA lab. A MILITARY DOCTOR is looking at the result of something on a computer. It has shocked and intrigued him. He calls across to another doctor. \nMILITARY DOCTOR 1 John come and take a look at this kid's blood sample. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees the sample on the screen. \nMILITARY DOCTOR 2. Is that right? That can't be right. \nMILITARY DOCTOR 1 And I got a sample of her hair. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results, baffled. \nMILITARY DOCTOR 2 That must be contamination. \nMARISSA Send the results straight to me. On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA. \nFALSE MARISSA Did he tell you where he was going? We're all worried about him. On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She begins to cry, holds out her arms to be held. \n61 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 61 \nThe MONITOR sees her cry and turns to LEWIS who is still half- embroiled in the tests discussion. \nMONITOR Sir look. LEWIS looks at HANNA. \n62 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 62 \nThe FALSE MARISSA tentatively takes HANNA in her arms. \nFALSE MARISSA It's OK. It's OK. HANNA coils her thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA'S neck, clinging to her like a monkey. The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly concerned. Hanna wriggles in her arms, to get a better grip... \n63 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 63 \nMARISSA watches this strange image of her false self hugging this young girl. HANNA begins to weep more and more, burrowing her face into the FALSE MARISSA. On the CCTV we hear. \nBURTON (V.O.) You want me to give her something? \n64 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 64 \nHANNA clutching on to FALSE MARISSA, nestles close, weeping. \nFALSE MARISSA I think it might be necessary. \n65 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. CONT. 65 \nMARISSA watches, now concerned. Something is wrong. \nMARISSA Get her out of there. \n66 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 66 \nBurton comes rushing down the corridor filling a syringe as he goes. He arrives at HANNA'S door. \nBURTON Open up. The first guard opens HANNA'S door. \nLEWIS (V.O.) Abort. I repeat. Abort. \n67 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 67 \nHanna hugs, weeping, on to the FALSE MARISSA. BURTON hears the instruction to abort but too late... ...as suddenly and with total efficiency HANNA SNAPS the FALSE MARISSA's neck. \n68 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. DAY. CONT. 68 \nMARISSA stares in shock as her false self slumps dead to the floor. Then she watches as HANNA grabs the first GUARDS handgun from his holster and fires two rounds into Burton's skull. And two more into the first GUARD's chest. \n69 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 69 \nLEWIS immediately presses the Alarm Bell. \nLEWIS Jee-sus wept! On another screen LEWIS watches as the other Guard tries to drag the metal door shut. He hits a fleshy door jam - Burton. Hanna is upon him. Two shots. \n70 INT. LANGLEY. OPERATIONAL HQ. CONT. 70 \nMARISSA watches HANNA aim straight at camera. HANNA'S fierce eyes looking at her, MARISSA cant help but pull away from the screen. HANNA fires and the screen goes blank. \n71 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 71 \nLEWIS watches as, one after another, his camera's go down. But still there's no sign of HANNA. \n83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83 \nThe truck moves off a short distance and stops again. Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away. One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness. The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice. \nMILITARY VOICE Can you confirm your position 473? Banks? Banks can you hear me? \nOnce BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that. He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars. Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the radio. \nBANKS. I'm at a perimeter opening at the far east wing. Something's not quite right... He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air- conditioning duct is empty. \nCUT TO: As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle, hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor flashing beneath her. The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune. HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune. HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and looks around herself. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea where she might be. \n84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84 \nMARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing clothes, underwear, another power suit. Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the safe Marissa retrieves a blue file. MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters: \nGALINKA. \n85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85 \nFLASHBACK to 1995. A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses it. \nThere is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare. MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks through binoculars at the car. She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward. JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA stops dead. Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood. MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement and throws himself to the ground. Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest, MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives into the forest. \n86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86 \nPRESENT DAY. MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire to the file in the sink. When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish mop. \n87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87 \nThe sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are longer, but the heat is still intense. HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea where she might be. \nHANNA \n(MUTTERING) I live in Leipzig. German city... 0.7 Million people... I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium... literature and sport... I have a dog called Trudi. \nHANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun. HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun. The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL. \nSOPHIE Hello. HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks in the distance. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) All right? HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) Don't you speak English? HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) That can't be helped. You look terrible. At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old, rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA while talking to SOPHIE. \nMILES Who's she? \nSOPHIE I don't know. I just found her. \nMILES What's her name? \nSOPHIE She can't talk. \nHANNA Hanna. \nMILES She talked. \nHANNA I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. \nMILES \n(RE' HANNA) She's weird. \nHOTEL OWNER Where's your family? \nHANNA Are you Arab? \nHOTEL OWNER I'm Moroccan. \nHANNA Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira. Religion Islam. Language Arabic (in Arabic w/ English \nSUBTITLES) I like Arabic very much. It's like Japanese. It's big. The HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock. \nHOTEL OWNER (in Arabic w/ English \nSUBTITLES) You speak Arabic? \nHANNA (in Arabic w/ English \nSUBTITLES) Yes, of course. \nHOTEL OWNER (in Arabic w/ English \nSUBTITLES) Where's your family? \nHANNA (in Arabic w/ English \nSUBTITLES) I need a room for one night. Can you help? I don't have any money. \n92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92 \nThe HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel room with twin beds. They speak in Arabic with English subtitles. \nHOTEL OWNER It's the best we've got. \nHANNA Thank you. HANNA stares at the light switch. \nHANNA (CONT'D) Do you have one of these in every room? \nHOTEL OWNER Of course. All mod cons. \nHANNA It's electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance. \nHOTEL OWNER Yes. \nHANNA I know a little bit about electricity. They say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin? \nHOTEL OWNER Some American, I'm sure. He picks up an electric kettle. \nHOTEL OWNER (CONT'D) Electric kettle for the English - they like to make their own tea. He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily. He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on the edge of the bed. \nHANNA What is it? \nHOTEL OWNER It's the best we can do. She stares at the picture, bemused. \nHOTEL OWNER (CONT'D) Where do you come from? Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard. \nHANNA The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this strange encounter, and leaves. She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to increase. Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle violently. \nHANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing HANNA even more. On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East, the sound of gunfire. The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air like a helicopter. A telephone beside the bed starts to ring. Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo. HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls through the bathroom door straight into the shower, inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her. HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom. In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum, the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone still shouting. HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls through the door and into the corridor. \n93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93 \nSilence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her breath. A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from their bedroom. \nMILES Look. It's that girl. He nudges SOPHIE. HANNA eyes them suspiciously. \nMARISSA Sure, just as soon as she's done breaking peoples necks. You get her sectioned, if you can catch her. The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) Right now she's in Morocco but she'll be trying to get out of the country. Find her and bring her to me. Quietly. \nISAACS I'll need funds. MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table. \nMARISSA Don't spend it all on candy. She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark. ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is already walking out the door. \n95 EXT. NIGHT MARKET RESTAURANT. OASIS TOWN - NIGHT 95 \nHANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all eating falafel while HANNA eats meat. SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to their ideals of autonomy and social liberation. SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she picks at her food. \nSOPHIE She's beautiful. I wish I had a body like hers. She's really cool too. She's married to a footballer and really loves him - \nMeanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) - only the papers found out he was shagging like loads of other girls so she went and got all successful in her own right and now does a make-over show where she turns right dogs into real babes. I could do you a make-over if you'd like? \nRACHEL Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make- over, sweetie. SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to \nHANNA. \nSOPHIE Rachel doesn't believe in making the best of yourself. \nRACHEL No Sophie, I just don't believe fourteen year-old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars. It objectifies them. \nSOPHIE \n(TO HANNA) Do you shave your armpits yet? \nHANNA I don't think so. \nRACHEL Good. Keep it that way. \nSOPHIE That's SOOO gross. \nRACHEL Do you often travel on your own, Hanna? \nHANNA My father encourages me to be independent. \nSEB And your mother? \nHANNA She's dead. \nSEB Oh, I'm sorry. \nSOPHIE Nice one, Dad. \nHANNA People die. \nMILES What did she die of? \nHANNA Three bullets. \nRACHEL Oh. God. How terrible. SOPHIE is weirdly impressed. \n96 EXT/INT. BUTCHERS SHOP. SOUTH SWEDEN - NIGHT 96 \nERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on the counter. \nHELLER Three pounds of goose fat if you please. \n97 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 97 \nISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry from behind his dark glasses. He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything. \n106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106 \nCars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces - it's chaos. SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the while. \nSEB Typical. Get me back to the European Union. \nRACHEL Don't be rude. They get out, taking with them anything they might need - knapsacks, computer games, suit cases. They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing ISAACS on their way. ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks. He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE. \n107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107 \nInside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor - inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there. HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its locked. She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin, the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks. She climbs out. \n108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108 \nHANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat. A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams. SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself. \nRACHEL What has got into you? Oh my God, look over there. They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA. \nSOPHIE It's her. \nSEB You think she... you don't think she... Rachel, the sunroof? \nRACHEL You think we should say something? \nSEB What's there to say? \nRACHEL Maybe she's in trouble. \nSEB Maybe she's a hooker. Or a terrorist. There's a lot of them in Germany. \nSOPHIE Hookers or terrorists? \nRACHEL I'll go over. \nSEB Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting here. I'm putting my foot down... RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows. \nCUT TO: SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either side of her. \nSOPHIE All right? \nHANNA Did you know that 71 percent of the earths surface is covered in water? \nSOPHIE My father thinks you're a stowaway. He thinks you broke our sunroof too, which puts you in deep shit. \nRACHEL Sophie just - I'll handle this. \n(TO HANNA) Where's your father? No reply. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) I really think it might help if you told us the, you know, the truth and all that. Have you run away from somewhere? \nSOPHIE Are you okay? \nHANNA I'm fine. \nRACHEL I'm worried about you. \nSOPHIE She said she's fine. \nRACHEL You have to understand this really is a problem for us. \nSOPHIE You know what? Why don't I stay here with her and you go off and be with dad? He's looking kind of tense. \nSOPHIE Says who? SOPHIE heads off down the road. HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to catch up with SOPHIE. \n128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128 \nA loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre. SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled. Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird. \nCUT TO: The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's forced to mime and shout her order over the music. \nSOPHIE Vodka. Two. \nThe bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of water. \nBARTENDER Water only. No booze. Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is staring at her again. SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to \nHANNA. \nHANNA What do they call this music? \nSOPHIE Banging. HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it - SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music. HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE. \nCUT TO: ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They split up and start to survey the crowd. Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking place. ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER, thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway. \nISAACS What you got? \nDEALER (in Spanish w/ English \nSUBTITLES) Nothing man. That guys just a friend. ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white powder. ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot. \nDEALER (CONT'D) (in Spanish w/ English \nSUBTITLES) Hey, you're not police. What the fuck? ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips. \nISAACS Ssh. \nCUT TO: Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops. \nSPANISH BOY (in Spanish w/ English \nSUBTITLES) Where are you from? The girls just look at each other. \nSPANISH BOY (CONT'D) English? American? You like to party? They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and leads HANNA away. \nHANNA Will you teach me to do dancing? \nSOPHIE It's easy. HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to dance. HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and expressive. \nCUT TO: ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies around him greedily. He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his gums. \nCUT TO: Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing. FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND. THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating their way in. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) He's after you. \nHANNA How can you tell? \nSOPHIE Duh, look at the way he's looking at you. He's gorgeous. FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking either. \nFELICIANO'S FRIEND What's your name? \nSOPHIE Sophie. \nFELICIANO'S FRIEND Have you come here before? \nSOPHIE All the time. \n136 INT. ISAACS' BMW - CONTINUOUS 136 \nISAACS holds onto the dash. \nISAACS Keep your distance. \n137 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - DAY 137 \nThe RECEPTIONIST picks up the phone and dials. \nRECEPTIONIST Is that the police? Yes, I don't want to trouble you but I have a new guest you may wish to know about. \n138 EXT. VESTERBROGADE STATION/COPENHAGEN. DAY. 138 \nA commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd. \nPOV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform. On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not right. He moves off and enters a small bar. The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway, the other rushes downstairs to give chase too. HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE EXIT and walks out through it. \n139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139 \nHELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself behind a skip of empty bottles. As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the corner into the goods yard. From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter. The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee in the groin of another. There's a brief exchange of blows. One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun. HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun. He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground squealing. HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his \nCELLPHONE. HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg. He falters but limps off behind the towering containers. \n140 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 140 \nThe FAMILY van is making its way up through France. \nFollowing in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his HENCHMEN are biding their time. \n141 INT. VAN/FRENCH ROAD - EVENING 141 \nRACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat keeping her entertained. \nHANNA ...they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food. Imagine that, nine months. \nRACHEL Why do you know so much about fleas? \nHANNA I read it in my Encyclopaedia. HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW and frowns, she's seen it before. \nHANNA (CONT'D) Also, they can jump around 200 times their own body length, which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals except for the froghopper. Now they can really jump. RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious. \nRACHEL Everything all right? \nHANNA I think so. But HANNA'S face betrays her concern. \nJOANNA (V.O.) Mama, I know you're disappointed in me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama. But I have found maybe a way to make it better... \n142 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 142 \nCLOSE ON - a portable casette machine playing one of the tapes MARISSA discovered at KATRIN ZADEK'S. \nJOANNA (V.O.) I'm in a program now... a program to make babies stronger. In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a snarl. \nJOANNA (V.O.) An American program. It's very scientific. Important scientific work. Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and presses fast forward. Then play - \nJOANNA (V.O.) Erik says he can get these tapes to \nYOU - \nMARISSA \n(MUTTERS) Bastard. \n147 EXT/INT. CAR/CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 147 \nThe van slowly pulls in at the side of the road. RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls in behind the van. On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's building blocks. \nRACHEL Why won't that car pass? He has his lights on high beam, I was doing everything I could to get out of the way... SOPHIE wakes up in the back. \nSOPHIE Are we stopped? I need to pee. \nRACHEL Well, I don't want you going too far right now. \nHANNA I think you should stay where you are, Sophie. HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make the first move. \nRACHEL Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake up. \nHANNA Please. \nSOPHIE This is creepy. You're creeping me out. \nSEB \n(GROGGY) Are we in Lille? \nHANNA I'm sorry. But you really mustn't get out of the van. HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to \nSOPHIE. \nHANNA (CONT'D) What ever you do, don't follow me. Promise not to follow me. \nSOPHIE I promise. \nRACHEL Hanna, tell me what's going on or Seb will go over to that car and find out. \nSEB Like fuck I will. Everyone stay put. Where's my phone? \nHANNA \n(TO SOPHIE) Thank you for being my friend. HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car doors open. In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts from the van. \nRACHEL Hanna! RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA. The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his gun at her head. RACHEL screams. \n148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148 \nHANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative safety of the container park. ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed. HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers. ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA. HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way and that. ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze. \nISAACS (O.S.) Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You need to come with me now. I know where your papa is. She listens. \nCUT TO: ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again. \nISAACS (CONT'D) He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He misses you. \nCUT TO: The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double- kicks him in the chest. \nHANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the containers when she reaches a gap. The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too. A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up higher, now four containers high. ISAACS follow below. HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right over the head of ISAACS. HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to land on a lower container on the other side. HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground. She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to the ground. She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the containers. She stops at a \u00e2\u0080\u0098T' junction, unsure which way to go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the third. She's trapped. \nISAACS (CONT'D) Just take it easy. HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS. He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her. She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he crashes to the ground. She rolls and springs to her feet. The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick. \n149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149 \nHANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of waste. HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the scrap metal is unloaded. \nA large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a tarpaulin. \n150 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 150 \n161 INT. RECEPTION. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 161 \nKNEPFLER points HANNA towards a set of stairs that lead up from the reception. \nKNEPFLER Upstairs. There's a knock at the door. HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches the front door. There's another knock at the door. \n162 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 162 \nHANNA enters a room that's been designed to look like Grandma's bedroom from Little Red Riding Hood. HANNA hurriedly slides under the bed. Breathing as quietly as she can. She can hear the sound of ISAAC'S MEN starting to spread through the house. \nKNEPFLER (O.O.V) Listen to me, listen. There is no one here. There is nobody up there... \nMARISSA (O.C.) Check the attic. Footsteps to the attic. \n163 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE/STARS - DAY 163 \nMARISSA has KNEPFLER cornered on the stairs. \nMARISSA Erik Heller? Do you know him? \nKNEPFLER I have never heard of him. \nMARISSA Really? MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER outside the house. \nKNEPFLER I don't know these people. \nMARISSA Think very carefully He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks in gasps. \nKNEPFLER He called me. She's coming soon. To meet him. \nMARISSA When? \nKNEPFLER Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning. MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS. \nMARISSA Take him in there. Find out what he knows. \n164 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 164 \nThe sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room, the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are in sight, nothing else. The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes as she hears her call. \nMARISSA Lewis. It's Marissa. HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) You got anything? He's coming here. I can smell it. Double the men. But, Lewis, I want to talk to him. HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the room. Male. ISAACS. \nISAACS His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used to send Heller's things from Berlin before the Communists were kicked out of Prague. \nMARISSA How much does he know about the programme? \nISAACS Everything. He knew Johanna. \nMARISSA What does he know about the child? \nISAACS He also thinks Erik's the father. \nMARISSA Well that's good. \nISAACS Everybody thinks Erik's her father. Erik probably thinks he's her father. They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely control her breath. \nMARISSA Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him yet? \nISAACS Let's see what else Knepfler has to offer. He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe. MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door. They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid- air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes. Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a window. \n165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165 \nSUBTITLES) Excuse me. I'm looking for Joanna Zadek's house. Can you help? The KURDISH WOMAN wont look HANNA in the eye as she passes. She mutters her response. \nKURDISH WOMAN (In Kurdish w/ English \nSUBTITLES) I don't speak German. HANNA kicks at the door but knows it won't be answered so doesn't wait. \n174 EXT/INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 174 \nPROJECT - DAY HANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and approaches the kitchen window. She peers through. On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood splattered across the glass. \nHANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the glass. \n175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175 \nHANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies. HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain that spreads across the cheap lino floor. HANNA steps back and gags. She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and goes through into the lounge. The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by MARISSA'S hunt for information. HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters. The room had been turned into a home office, there are newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the truth behind her daughters murder. HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will help her understand who she is and where she came from. Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice. \nERIK (V.O.) You won't find anything. HANNA turns in shock. \nERIK Marissa would have been much too careful for that. HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER. \nERIK (CONT'D) Sit down Hanna. \nHANNA Are you my father? \nERIK Sit down. \nHANNA Are you my father? \nERIK Please. \nHANNA Are you? Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing but she knows the answer is no. \nERIK I was going to tell you. HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast. \nHANNA What's wrong with me? ERIK flinches slightly. \nERIK Nothing. \nHANNA Where was I born? ERIK knows he has to tell the truth. \nERIK At Galinka. \nHANNA What's that? \nERIK It was a secret CIA research programme in rural Poland. \nHANNA What kind of research? \nERIK Children. HANNA stares at ERIK. \nERIK (CONT'D) It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The science came from the old East Germany. The money from the CIA. The intention was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos... to improve \nTHEM \nHANNA CONT'D) Improve? ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost. \nERIK Reduce capacity for fear. For pity. Increase muscle strength. Heighten senses. Anything that might make a better soldier. HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about. \nHANNA How did you know about it? ERIK's stares right at her. \nERIK I worked for it. She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his pocket. \nERIK (CONT'D) This is what you were looking for. HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995. An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller. \n181 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181 \nCLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away. She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means. An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent. Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto- pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and she is on board. \n182 EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN. 182 \nMARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER. \nMARISSA Leave him here. And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin dirt. \n183 INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183 \nHANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death, bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address. Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland. HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was born. She must find out who she is. \n184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184 \nMARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door. \nISAACS They had a fight. \nMARISSA She must know the truth. \nISAACS Where do you think she's gone? \nMARISSA Where would you go? MARISSA turns to ISAACS. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) I'm closing the CIA operation down. Heller is dead, that's all that matters to them. This we do alone. \n185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185 \nHANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted, many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing resolution. In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The peace of the innocent. \n186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186 \nThe train entering a Polish train station. The town is called Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits, approaches a station guard. \nHANNA I am looking for a train to Galinka. \nGUARD Galinka is a small village. No trains. You must wait for bus in the morning. \nHANNA Where can I stay? He points. HANNA sees the hotel. \n187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187 \nHANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV. Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh. She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off. Leaves the room. \n188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188 \nHANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard- drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands there, drinking. \nHANNA Do you have a sandwich? \nBARMAN Kitchen is closed. The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German. \nBUSINESSMAN Get her something. Poor girl's hungry. The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits. \nBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) I'm from Leipzig. HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig. \nBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) You? \nHANNA The same. \nBUSINESSMAN Business? He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives. It's grim. She leaves it, walks out. \nHANNA Sorry. \nMARISSA It's okay. Are you in trouble? HANNA nods. She fights the tears. MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) What sort of trouble? \nHANNA (though her tears) I don't know what to do. Nothing is what I thought it would be. It's... ugly and cruel and I don't know where to go, or... I'm stupid. I don't know what I expected... MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth. \nMARISSA Sometimes I feel the same way. \nHANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman. MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe. \nHANNA I like music. \nMARISSA Sleep why don't you? You look very tired. It will take half an hour on this road. HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the window. She is asleep. Vulnerable. \n192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192 \nSoft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road. \n193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193 \nMARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House. HANNA is jolted awake. \nHANNA Where are we? MARISSA calms herself instantly. \nMARISSA Nearly there. HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES. \n194 EXT. GALINKA 194 \nMARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet. \nMARISSA (V.O.) This is it. \n195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195 \nHANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is confused. \nHANNA It's so small. \nMARISSA Yes. Just a few cottages. And the old bunker. HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions. \nHANNA Thank you for the ride. You're very kind. \nMARISSA I wish there was more I could do for you. MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) Here, take this. HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) I hope you find what you're looking for. \nHANNA Thank you. She gets out and shuts the door behind her. \n196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196 \nHANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then drives off. HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not used for many years. She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a long time. She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and, exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up the narrow tree-lined driveway. \n197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197 \nHANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker. She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it on and walks into the darkness. \n198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198 \nWith only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of daylight recedes slowly to nothing. The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her. HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go. She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe. HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red shoe, its buckle rusted. She walks on into the dark. HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff, but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of a gap to squeeze through. \n", "test1_input": "SEB (CONT'D) Here goes nothing. He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around. SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He passes ISAACS on his way round. \nSEB (CONT'D) Excuse me. Sir? ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her mirrors. SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea who he is. \nINSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT - HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry. \n114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114 \nDark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast. A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with the exertion. Water dripping from his body. He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He approaches the beach car park. A POLICE CAR swings into the car park. ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on him. He stops and turns towards the police car. TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He watches them very carefully. \n115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115 \nThe FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains. \n116 INT. VAN - DAY 116 \nHANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged landscape. Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold evening light. HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a little water spills down his front. SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's. \n117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117 \nISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach. \nISAACS Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we have a situation here... \n118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118 \nISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a number of scenes with no luck until he notices: The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and boarding the van. \n119 INT. VAN - DAY 119 \nHANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and they stare at the huge, granite mountain range... She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's shoulder. \n120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120 \nMARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats freshly sliced. \nLEWIS The Danish authorities are taking this very seriously. They've doubled the number of officers on the ground. We've sent up spotter planes over the channel. \n(MORE) \nLEWIS (CONT'D) They're appealing for witnesses through the local media... MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her. \nLEWIS (CONT'D) You think he really swam it? MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she walks away. \nMARISSA Keep me posted. \n121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121 \nThe campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage, borders and rules. Families come here from cities across Europe and bring their whole lives with them. The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious looking FRENCH family with quad bikes. SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment. \nGERMAN CAMPER. Guten tag. \nHANNA Guten Morgen. \nGERMAN CAMPER. Wie geht es Ihnen? \nHANNA Gutm und Ihnen? \nGERMAN CAMPER. Jah, gut, gut... A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them. \nFRENCH CAMPER. Bonjour. Ca va? \nHANNA Ca va. Oui. Bien... HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties complicated knots. RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses. \n", "test1_true": "SOPHIE No thanks. HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight. \n122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122 \nHANNA turns a display unit of postcards. Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE \nBOYS. One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S not used to this feeling of being looked at. While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a postcard and a book of stamps. \n123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123 \nHANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mission accomplished' HANNA gets up and posts the card. \n124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124 \nRACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above them the evening chorus is in full song. \nRACHEL I just feel connected when I'm in the countryside. The city stifles me... emotionally, creatively. HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in the undergrowth. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Anyway, I was very young when I... Seb and I.... He was so impressive. HANNA suddenly runs into the woods. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Hanna?! \n125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125 \nThe FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred veggie sausages. \nSOPHIE It's probably just a bunch of Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly going to be out all night. \nRACHEL You're not going, Sophie. No way, Jose. HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS. She lays them in front of the family. \nHANNA Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might be. \nMILES That's gross. \n126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126 \nThe girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does HANNA'S make-up. \nSOPHIE I don't know why I'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me. \nHANNA What do you mean? \nSOPHIE Though quite frankly I don't need more digits than I've got right now. Loads. Loads and loads. HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't look right on her. \nHANNA It's like paint. \nSOPHIE Don't lick it off. SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) You're gorgeous. \n127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127 \nSOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited, SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience. \nHANNA I can't walk in this. \nSOPHIE You look hot. \nHANNA Where are we going? \nSOPHIE Shhhhh! HANNA uncomfortable with the situation. \nHANNA I shouldn't take unnecessary risks. \n", "test1_id": 2241, "test2_input": "MARISSA - What's in the past, stays in the past, right? \nKATRIN Something like that. \nMARISSA So why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in? \nKATRIN You'd understand if you had kids. She turns her back on MARISSA. \nMARISSA Kid's, they fuck you up, don't they? \nMARISSA stands up, puts a 9mm to the back KATRIN'S head and pulls the trigger. KATRIN drops to the floor revealing a framed, blood splattered, photograph of KATRIN ZADEK'S daughter - JOANNA. \n131 INT. TENT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. EARLY DAWN. 131 \nHANNA and SOPHIE lie next to each other in sleeping bags with a torch between them. \nSOPHIE Can't you sleep? \nHANNA No. \nSOPHIE Me neither. SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) Hanna? \nHANNA Yes? \nSOPHIE Where do you really come from? \nHANNA Leipzig, I live in Leipzig - SOPHIE looses her patience. \nSOPHIE If we're going to be friends you have to be honest with me. Them's the rules. HANNA is taken aback. \nHANNA Are we friends? \nSOPHIE Yes. I like you. \nHANNA I'd like to have a friend. \nSOPHIE I mean you're a freak and everything, but I like you. \nHANNA I like you too. I really do. But there are things I can't tell you. Do you understand? \nSOPHIE Yes... Actually, no, I don't. \nHANNA There are people that want to harm me. Bad people. \nSOPHIE I see. \nHANNA And they wont stop. \nSOPHIE Right. \nHANNA So for your own safety... HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes. \nHANNA (CONT'D) Can we still be friends? \nSOPHIE I don't know. I mean, I don't really know who you are. Do I? \nHANNA That's just it. Neither do I. She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal. \nSOPHIE What is it? \nHANNA I think it's about me. DNA is kind of how we're made I think. I mean who we are. They look at it. \n", "test2_true": "HANNA I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet my father at the house of Wilhelm Grimm. \nSOPHIE As in \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrimm's Fairytales\u00e2\u0080\u009d? \nHANNA That's right. SOPHIE sighs at HANNA. \nSOPHIE If you say so. \nHANNA Did I say the wrong thing again? SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her. \nSOPHIE Keep this. To remember me. HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE. \nSOPHIE (CONT'D) It's a friendship bracelet. \nHANNA Thank you. HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair. Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness. \n132 INT. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 132 \nMARISSA is searching the apartment. She's thorough and fast. She rips cushions and throws books from their shelves. Her actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the destruction. She finds more and more photograph's of JOANNA. The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her. She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare bedroom that had been turned into home office. Every available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and photographs relating JOANNA'S murder. On the floor MARISSA finds a box of old casette tapes. She stops to inspect one of the tapes. A label reads: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Joanna no. \n133 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - MORNING. 133 \nERIK HELLER walks into a small, long-established family hotel on a Danish road near the coast. \nHe is in the slightly dated suit he wore when he left the forest and looks a little dishevelled and odd. A sixtyish Danish woman stands behind the counter, scrutinising him. They speak in Danish with English subtitles. \nERIK (SIGHS, EXHAUSTED) I need a room. \nRECEPTIONIST Yes of course. \nERIK I stayed here fifteen years ago. It hasn't changed. \nRECEPTIONIST We don't much like change here. \nERIK Neither do I. \nRECEPTIONIST Name? \nERIK Olsson. Peter Olsson. \nRECEPTIONIST You have some post. She turns and retrieves HANNA'S POSTCARD from the mail rack and hands it to him. \nERIK Thank you. ERIK reads: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMission accomplished\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nRECEPTIONIST Have you heard about the manhunt? A man has killed two coastguards. Everybody is being asked to keep an eye out. \nERIK For what exactly? \nRECEPTIONIST I don't know. He smiles. She takes a closer look and notices goose fat smeared behind his ear.. and blood on a shirt cuff... \n134 INT. VAN/SPANISH CAMPSITE - MORNING 134 \nThe FAMILY have checked out and are leaving the campsite. \nHANNA How long until you drop me off? \nRACHEL We should have you there by dinner time. From Lille you can get a train to Berlin. Leipzig's just a few hours further. HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look. \n135 EXT. RECEPTION. SPANISH CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS 135 \nThe FAMILY van passes through the campsite gates to reveal ISAACS coming out of the reception hut. He sees the van, recognises it. He sees the kids in the back. Bingo. He runs to a black BMW where two of his HENCHMEN are waiting for him. \nISAACS Wake up. It's them. He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the engine. The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly avoiding a collision. \n", "test2_id": 2242, "test3_input": "MARISSA Three days ago Hanna's father killed two Danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife. \nSEB Where is he now? \nMARISSA He's still at large and he's still very dangerous. We need to find Hanna before he does. Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices. \nMARISSA (CONT'D) If you know anything at all, it's vital you tell us for her own safety. We are now very worried about her. \nBut SOPHIE doesn't say a word. \nRACHEL Sophie? Still nothing. They all look at her. MILES suddenly speaks. \nMILES She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm's house. \nSOPHIE (TO MILES) You little bastard! \nRACHEL How did you know that? \nSOPHIE You fuckwad! SOPHIE slaps MILES over the back of the head but SEB pushes her back. \nSEB Hey hey hey! Sophie for God's sake. \n153 EXT. BERLIN CANALS - DAY 153 \nHANNA'S sits on the prow of the barge as it makes it's slow progress into Berlin. \n154 INT/EXT. CAR/STREET - DAY 154 \nMARISSA looks out at a school playground as she waits in the back of her car. The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in. \nISAACS I've looked through Heller's contacts from the 1980's. There's no one called Wilhelm. \nMARISSA Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He died two hundred years ago. MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment. The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'S \nBROTHERS HOUSE OF FUN. \nISAACS What the hell is this? MARISSA smiles slightly. \nMARISSA Wilhelm's house. (to the DRIVER) Drive on. \n155 EXT. BERLIN STREETS - DAY 155 \nHANNA wanders through the skyscrapers and glass constructions of Berlin. People swarm around her but pay her no mind. \n156 INT. TRAM - DAY 156 \nHANNA is riding a tram to the outskirts of town. \n157 EXT. ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157 \nHANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise. HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE. The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fun House'. It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its roof. HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of work clown. \nKNEPFLER Excuse me young lady? It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small, with a wiry intensity. \nHANNA Are you Wilhelm Grimm? \nKNEPFLER Not exactly, but it'll do for now. Come this way. He leads her inside. \n158 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 158 \nThey come inside - it's old and full of hoarded junk, antiques, boxes, books, dusty china, lamps, figurines, but still functional - an old man's home. He stops to look at her. \nKNEPFLER So you are Hanna. He puts out his hand to shake. \n", "test3_true": "KNEPFLER (CONT'D) My real name is Knepfler. Herr Knepfler. I'm an old friend of your father's. I am a sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaretaker\u00e2\u0080\u009d here. \nHANNA What happened to it? \nKNEPFLER No car park. You need a car park these days, otherwise people wont come. But somebody has to watch over it... \nHANNA It's beautiful. \nKNEPFLER I like it too. Erik used to come here a great deal. \nHANNA Have you heard from him? He nods. \nKNEPFLER You must wait. He will be here soon. HANNA stares, not quite believing. \nHANNA stares out the window, thinking all this through. KNEPFLER leads HANNA through a reception area and under a spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down kitchen. \n159 INT. KITCHEN. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 159 \nHANNA follows KNEPFLER into the kitchen. \nKNEPFLER Please, sit down. HANNA sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench, while KNEPFLER goes to the stove. \nKNEPFLER (CONT'D) Would you like an egg? They're fresh. \nHANNA Please. HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw. KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks inside - some money, a passport, ID cards. \nKNEPFLER You'll need a fresh photograph. Don't get it wet. HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE ELKAN. She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending. \nHANNA I don't really understand. \nKNEPFLER ID. Identity. It tells people who you are. She stares at the passport with the blank space for her photo. \nKNEPFLER (CONT'D) There is an apartment ready for you in the south. Erik will come and the car will take you there today. You will live there now. \nHANNA Do I have to? \nKNEPFLER Don't you want to? \nHANNA I don't know. I miss the forest. I miss my home. \nKNEPFLER That's to be expected. But the city is so exciting, don't you think? \nHANNA I suppose. She drinks her water, thinking. \nHANNA (CONT'D) Did you know my mother? \nKNEPFLER I did. \nHANNA What was she like? \nKNEPFLER She was very gentle, she was very funny, very talented - a singer - did you know that? \nHANNA Yes... \nKNEPFLER She had your eyes. He smiles at her. She here's a noise outside and runs to look out the window. She sees ISAACS BMW pull up outside the house followed by a second car. \nHANNA It's him. \nKNEPFLER Quick. KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the kitchen. \n160 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 160 \nThe driver of the second car gets out and opens the back door for MARISSA. She gets out and looks up at the house. \n", "test3_id": 2243}

VOICE (from above) Step away from him, ma'am. 
She waves the voice off, trying to listen to Harry. 
HARRY And I   needed you to know this one other   thing about me, because I don't   want to withhold anything from   you anymore... JOAN Oh God, I don't want to know, Harry. What is it? HARRY My real name's not Harry.    It's Eugene. JOAN (profoundly relieved) Oh. (saying it lovingly) 'Eugene.' I love that name. 
Eugene puts his arms around her. The "ET RESSUREXIT" from Bach's B-Minor Mass BEGINS OVER the sound of the ROTORS. 
The CAMERA MOVES TO a REMOTE ANGLE, REVEALING them bathed in a celestial cone of light from above, making intimately emotional declarations and explanations to one another.

As though someone had just addressed her by her rightful name, she suddenly turns to look IN the CAMERA, and happy to be noticed, she lays the spatula down and begins to do a hula dance.

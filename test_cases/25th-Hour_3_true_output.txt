MARGUERITE 
(Colombian accent) You are very handsome. Are you an actor ? 
Monty zips his fly. 
MONTY 
Yeah. I'm a star. 
INT. CLUB ROOM -- LATER 
The club room is decorated to look like the library of an English country manor : dark wood paneling, bookshelves stacked with leather-bound books, flickering sconce lights. Slattery sits on a stool at the bar, rolling a glass of whiskey between his palms. His eyes are red, from crying or exhaustion or both. 
Naturelle walks into the room and spots Slattery. She goes over to him and squeezes the back of his neck before sitting on the neighboring stool. He sits up straight and smiles. 
NATURELLE 
Why are you all alone? 
SLATTERY 
I couldn't sit in that goddamn red room anymore. I don't know anyone in there . These are Monty's friends?-- 
NATURELLE 
I guess so . They're around a lot, anywayv Slattery drains his whiskey. He signals for another and the bartender pours it . He's clearly getting drunk, though Slattery is a man who can handle his liquor. He checks his watch. 
SLATTERY 
I'm supposed to be at work in a couple hours. Christ, I can't even imagine working today. You just gave me the flu, okay? I'm calling in sick. 
NATURELLE 
I wish Monty could call in sick. Have you seen him around? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SLATTERY 
He's probably saying goodbye to everyone. 
NATURELLE 
Can you do me a favor? 
SLATTERY 
What's that? Slattery catches himself looking at Naturelle's cleavage and looks away. 
NATURELLE 
Keep an eye on Monty tonight, would you? Try to stick with him. 
SLATTERY 
What's wrong? 
NATURELLE 
He's just acting really strange. You don't think he's acting strange? 
SLATTERY 
He's going to prison in a few hours, Nat. How do you want him to act? 
NATURELLE 
I want him to act like he's scared. 
SLATTERY 
He is scared. 
NATURELLE 
I don't want him to hurt himself. Will you watch him for me?   ..-TO«.,,,,,..«--. Slattery nods. For a while they are quiet. 
NATURELLE (CONT'D) 
I don't think he wants me here. 
SLATTERY 
That's not true. He's just -- 
NATURELLE 
You see the way he looks at me these days. It's like he doesn't trust me . 
SLATTERY 
Why wouldn't he trust you? Naturelle is quiet for a moment. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
NATURELLE 
I'm going uptown. When you see him, tell him I'm waiting for him back home, okay? She stands and smooths out the wrinkles in her silver dress . Again, Slattery has to turn away from the sight of her . 
SLATTERY 
This is all so stupid. It's so stupid. He's got so much going on, he's so smart, and what does he do? He throws it al l away. An d here I am, his friend -- I mean , right? I'm his oldest friend? 
NATURELLE 
He loves you, Frank. You know that. 
SLATTERY 
His oldest friend, and what do I do to stop it? Nothing, never a word. When he started selling pot to kids in Campbell - Sawyer, did I say anything? When everyone's talking about buying from Monty, the whole school, and I knew they were going to nail him, knew it, did I say a word? The last ten years I watc h him get deeper and deeper, and these friends of his, these fucks you wouldn't want petting your dog, did I say, "Careful now, Monty, better get out of this. " No . Nothing, not a word. His bes t friend. Goddamn, Naturelle, I'm his bes t friend and I just sat there and watched him ruin his life. And you did, too . Both of-us.,., all -of us , we just sat there and let him . Naturelle runs a fingernail down her forearm an d inspects the faint white trail . 
NATURELLE 
Keep an eye on him, okay? 
Slattery watches her walk away. A moment later Jakob hurries in, sweating and frantic. 
JAKOB 
I've been looking all over for you. Can we get out of here?

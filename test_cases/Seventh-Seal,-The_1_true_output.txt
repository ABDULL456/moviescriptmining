RAVAL Can't you have pity on me? Help me! At least talk to me. 
No one answers. The trees sigh. RAVAL begins to cry. 
RAVAL I am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to me! Can no one console me? Haven't you any compassion? Can't you see that I ... 
His words are choked off by a gurgling sound. He disappears in the darkness behind the fallen tree. It becomes quiet for a few moments. 
RAVAL (whispers) Can't anyone ... only a little water. 
Suddenly the GIRL gets up with a quick movement, snatches JONS'S water bag and runs a few steps. JONS grabs her and holds her fast. 
JONS It's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no use. It's meaningless. It's totally meaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. Can't you hear that I'm consoling you? 
RAVEL Help me, help me! 
No one answers, no one moves. RAVAL'S sobs are dry and convulsive, like a frightened child's. His sudden scream is cut off in the middle. Then it becomes quiet. 
The GIRL sinks down and hides her face in her hands. JONS places his hand on her shoulder. 
The KNIGHT is no longer alone. DEATH has come to him and he raises his hand. 
DEATH Shall we play our game to the end? 
KNIGHT Your move! 
DEATH raises his hand and strikes the KNIGHT'S queen. Antonius Block looks at DEATH. 
DEATH Now I take your queen. 
KNIGHT I didn't notice that. 
The KNIGHT leans over the game. The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, which seem to have a life of their own. 
JOF has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. Then he sees the KNIGHT and DEATH together. He becomes very frightened and awakens MIA. 
JOF Mia! 
MIA Yes, what is it? 
JOF I see something terrible. Something I almost can't talk about.

MAN Goodbye, Mr. Wells. 
EXT. EAGLE PASS TOWN SQUARE - DUSK 
Moss is getting out of the station wagon with his duffle and document case. 
It is a town square. Among the old buildings is the Hotel Eagle, identified by a neon above the front door. 
INT. HOTEL EAGLE LOBBY - NIGHT 
Moss enters. Behind the front desk an older man sits reading Ring magazine. He has a hand-rolled cigarette. 
MOSS One room, one night. 
CLERK That's twenty-six dollars. 
MOSS You on all night? 
CLERK Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning. Moss pushes a hundred along with smaller bills across the desk. 
MOSS For you. I ain't asking you to do anything illegal. The clerk looks at the hundred-dollar bill without reaching. 
CLERK I'm waitin' to hear your description of that. 
MOSS There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. 
INT. SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Moss is mounting the stairs from the lobby. The carpeted hallway is lined by transom-topped doors. Moss goes to a door halfway down on his left. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Moss enters a room with old oak furniture and high ceilings. He sets the document case next to the bed. He unzips the duffel and takes out the shotgun which he lays on the bed, and then goes to the window. He parts the curtain to look down. The street is empty. Mexican music floats up faintly from a bar somewhere not far away. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER 
The room is dark. The music is gone. We are looking straight down on Moss lying, clothed, on the bed. We are booming straight down toward him. After a beat he shakes his head. He opens his eyes, grimacing. 
MOSS There just ain't no way. He sits up and turns on the bedside lamp. The shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed. Moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it and upends the money onto the bed. He feels the bottom of the case, squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand out, looking for a false bottom. He eyeballs the case, turning it over and around. He starts riffling money packets. He finds one that binds. It has hundreds on the outside but ones inside with the centers cut out. In the hollow is a sending unit the size of a Zippo lighter. 
He holds the sender, staring at it. A long beat. 
From somewhere, a dull chug. The sound is hard to read-a compressor going on, a door thud, maybe something else. The sound has brought Moss's look up. He sits listening. No further sound. Moss reaches to uncradle the rotary phone by the bed. He dials 0. We hear ringing filtered through the handset. Also, faintly, offset, we hear the ring direct from downstairs. After five rings Moss cradles the phone. He goes to the door, reaches for the knob, but hesitates. 
He gets down on his hands and knees and listens at the crack under the door. An open airy sound like a seashell put to your ear. Moss rises and turns to the bed. He piles money back into the document case but freezes suddenly-for no reason we can see. A long beat on his motionless back. We gradually become aware of a faint high-frequency beeping, barely audible. Its source is indeterminate. Moss clasps the document case, picks up his shotgun and eases himself to a sitting position on the bed, facing the door. He looks at the line of light under it. The beeps approach, though still not loud. A long wait. At length a soft shadow appears in the line of light below the door. It lingers there. The beeping-stops. A beat. Now the soft shadow becomes more focused. It resolves into two columns of dark: feet planted before the door. Moss raises his shotgun toward the door. A long beat. Moss adjusts his grip on the shotgun and his finger tightens on the trigger. The shadow moves, unhurriedly, rightward. The band of light beneath the door is once again unshadowed. Quiet. Moss stares. 
The band of light under the door. Moss stares. Silently, the light goes out. Something for Moss to think about. He stares. The hallway behind the door is now dark. The door is defined only from his side, by streetlight-spill through the window. Moss stares. He shifts, starts to rise, doesn't. A beat. A report -- not a gunshot, but a stamping sound, followed by a pneumatic hiss. 
It brings a dull impact and Moss recoils, hit. He winces, feeling his chest. The door is shuddering creakily in. It is all strange. Moss gropes in his lap and picks something up. The lock cylinder. The creaking door comes to rest, ajar. Moss fires. The shotgun blast roars in the confined space and for an instant turns the room orange. The chewed-up door wobbles back against the jamb and creakily bounces in again. Moss has already risen and is hoisting the document case. 
FROM OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW Moss finishes draping his shotgun by its strap across his back and climbs out onto the ledge with the document case. He swings the document case out and drops it. The bracketing for the hotel's sign gives Moss a handhold. He grabs it as inside the room the door is kicked open. Moss swings down as, with a muted thump, orange muzzleflash strobes the room. Moss drops.

{"test1_input": "KUNG FU PANDA \nWritten By \nJonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger \nFINAL DRAFT June 3, 2008 \nEXT. VALLEY -- DAY \nA MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff of legend. \nThe warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) He traveled the land in search of worthy foes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BAR \nThe warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and surrounds him. \nGANG BOSS (to warrior) I see you like to CHEW! (beat) Maybe you should chew on my FIST!! \nThe Boss punches the table. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full. Then, he swallowed. \nHe swallows. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then, he spoke. \nWARRIOR (dubbed hero voice) Enough talk. Let's FIGHT! SHASHABOOEY! \nWHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes flying. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness. \nThe gang members blindly flail about. \nNINJA CAT MY EYES! \nGATOR HE'S TOO AWESOME! \nONLOOKERS swoon. \nSMITTEN BUNNY And ATTRACTIVE! \nGRATEFUL BUNNY How can we repay you?? \nWARRIOR There is no charge for awesomeness, or attractiveness. \nONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas. \nWARRIOR KABLOOEY! \n", "test1_true": "EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky. Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) It mattered not how many foes he faced. They were no match for his bodacity. \nThe warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final blow while doing a split between two trees. \nThe warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god- rays shine down upon him. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) Never before had a panda been so feared... and so loved. (MORE) \nNARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master. \nMONKEY We should hang out. \nWARRIOR Agreed. \nAs the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain into the sea of bandits. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) But hanging out would have to wait. `Cause when you're facing the ten thousand demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters. And that's-- \nIn mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice. \nMONKEY Po! Get up! \nTIGRESS You'll be late for work! \nPO Whu? \nINT. PO'S ROOM - DAY \nPo lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and wake up. \nPO'S DAD (O.S.) Po! Get up! \nWe see his room is filled with various kung fu posters (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs, and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green sword). \nPo SIGHS. \nHe attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly is too worthy a foe. \nPO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D) Po! What are you doing up there? \nPO Uh, nothing! \nPo hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures. \nPO (CONT'D) Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress! Rowrrrr... \nOUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight. \nPO'S DAD (O.S.) Po! Let's go! You're late for work! \nPO Coming! \nHe takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall. It bounces off. \nHe throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of the way. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nPo falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda- shaped shadow looms over Po. \n", "test1_id": 1839, "test2_input": "BUNNY FAN #1 Yippee! \nBUNNY FAN #2 I'm a Kung Fu warrior! \nBUNNY FAN #1 Me too! \nWhere's Po? \nPAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the daunting task before him. \nPo struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs. \nThe sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward. Climbing. Climbing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VALLEY SQUARE - LATER \nPo is still struggling up the stairs. \nPO Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost there... \nHe stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath. \nWIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps. \nPO (CONT'D) What? No! Oh No! \nTwo Pigs pass by. \nKG SHAW Sorry, Po. \nJR SHAW We'll bring you back a souvenir. \nPo watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This is his heroic moment. \nPO No. I'll bring me back a souvenir. \nPo tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the stairs. \nEXT. JADE PALACE - ARENA PLATFORM \nOogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace Pig bangs a gong. \nSHIFU It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway? \nOOGWAY Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready? \nSHIFU Yes, Master Oogway. \nOOGWAY Now know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the Valley, but also to you. \nAs Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong. \nANNOUNCER Let the tournament begin! \nEXT. VALLEY SQUARE - DAY \nThrongs of Villagers are streaming into the arena. \nEXT. TOP OF STAIRS - DAY \nPo gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step, laughing victoriously. \n", "test2_true": "The doors to the palace arena begin to close. \nPO (CONT'D) Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming! \nPo runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door. \nPO (CONT'D) Hey! Open the door! \nDRUMS inside drown out Po's pounding. He yells. \nPO (CONT'D) Let me in! \nInside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling. \nPo panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and weakly struggles to pull himself up. \nPo struggles to peek through the window. \nINT. PALACE ARENA - CONTINUOUS \nSHIFU Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five! \nThe Five jump into the middle of the ring. \nPO The Furious Five! \nPo manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window. \nSHIFU Warriors prepare! \nPo runs over to a crack in the wall. \nPO Peeky-hole! \nSHIFU Ready for battle! \nInside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads his wings. \nPO Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of Fire! \nOne of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his view. \nPIG FAN Whoa! Look at that. \nPO Hey, get out of the way! \nPo backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and accidentally falls down the stairs. \nPo climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it. \nMONTAGE: \nPo tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He slumps to the ground. \nPO (CONT'D) Ow... \nPo attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole whips around and hits him into the arena wall. \nPo rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd CHEERS. \nPo sits atop the stairs. Alone. \nSHIFU And finally...Master Tigress! \n", "test2_id": 1840, "test3_input": "SHIFU Don't cry. \nPO Okay. \nPo sniffs the tears back and smiles. \nEXT. FIELD - LATER \nShifu leads Po out into an open field. \nSHIFU When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate...you stink. \nPo scowls. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you is with this! \nShifu produces a bowl of dumplings. \nPO Oh great, `cause I'm hungry. \nSHIFU Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin. \nEXT. FIELD - LATER \nPo's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance tests, push ups, sit ups, climbing, etc. Through it all, he never gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu. \nEXT. CLEARING - A MOMENT LATER \nShifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder. \nSHIFU After you, panda. \nPo stops short, suspicious. \nPO Just like that? No situps? No ten mile hike? \nSHIFU I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat. \nPo grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Enjoy. \nPo raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself. \nPO Hey! \nSHIFU I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. \nPo reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks the dumpling into the air. \nPO Hey! \nShifu eats it and Po scowls. \nSHIFU You are free to eat! \nPO (upset) Am I? \nSHIFU (challenging) Are you?! \nPo and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one left. \nShifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with his bamboo staff. \n", "test3_true": "Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test. \nBut then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand. \nPO I'm not hungry... master. \nMaster and pupil bow to each other. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN PASS \nThe Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain peaks. \nTai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and races toward them. \nTIGRESS Cut it! \nThe others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life. \nTAI LUNG Where's the Dragon Warrior? \nTIGRESS How do you know you're not looking at her? \nTai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls. \nTAI LUNG You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you! \nThe Five exchange quick, worried looks. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) (nodding confidently) I heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire, that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen. \nThe Five exchange quick, confused looks. \nMONKEY Po? \nTAI LUNG So that is his name -- Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary! \nTigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper. \nMONKEY We've got this. Help her! \nViper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's \"throat\". \nVIPER Monkey! \nANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the rope by himself. \nMANTIS Go! (then) Ack! What was I thinking?! \nMonkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single strand of rope. \nTIGRESS Mantis! \nMantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance. \nTIGRESS (CONT'D) Now! \nWorking as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist. Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies safely to the mountain. \nThe Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived... \nTigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there. \n", "test3_id": 1841}

{"train": "KUNG FU PANDA \nWritten By \nJonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger \nFINAL DRAFT June 3, 2008 \nEXT. VALLEY -- DAY \nA MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff of legend. \nThe warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) He traveled the land in search of worthy foes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BAR \nThe warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and surrounds him. \nGANG BOSS (to warrior) I see you like to CHEW! (beat) Maybe you should chew on my FIST!! \nThe Boss punches the table. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full. Then, he swallowed. \nHe swallows. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then, he spoke. \nWARRIOR (dubbed hero voice) Enough talk. Let's FIGHT! SHASHABOOEY! \nWHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes flying. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness. \nThe gang members blindly flail about. \nNINJA CAT MY EYES! \nGATOR HE'S TOO AWESOME! \nONLOOKERS swoon. \nSMITTEN BUNNY And ATTRACTIVE! \nGRATEFUL BUNNY How can we repay you?? \nWARRIOR There is no charge for awesomeness, or attractiveness. \nONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas. \nWARRIOR KABLOOEY! \nReveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise. \nOOGWAY Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend? \nSHIFU So... nothing's wrong? \nOOGWAY Well, I didn't say that. \nShifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and blows out a candle. And another candle. And another. \nFinally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway smiles knowingly. \nSHIFU You were saying? \nOOGWAY I have had a vision... Tai Lung will return. \nShifu looks stricken. \nFLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM \nQuick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large, shadowy figure (Tai Lung). \nPRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM \nShifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his composure. \nSHIFU That is impossible. He is in prison. \nOOGWAY Nothing is impossible. \nShifu makes a split decision. \nSHIFU Zeng! \nHe comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. Double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison! \nZENG Yes, Master Shifu. \nThe goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from Shifu. \nOOGWAY One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. \nSHIFU We have to do something. We can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! He'll, he'll-- \nOogway looks into the water of the moon pool. \nOOGWAY Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear. \nShifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth. \nSHIFU The Dragon Scroll... \nOOGWAY It is time. \nSHIFU But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become...the Dragon Warrior?! \nDramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then... \nOOGWAY I don't know. \nINT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY \nBUNNY FAN #1 Yippee! \nBUNNY FAN #2 I'm a Kung Fu warrior! \nBUNNY FAN #1 Me too! \nWhere's Po? \nPAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the daunting task before him. \nPo struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs. \nThe sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward. Climbing. Climbing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VALLEY SQUARE - LATER \nPo is still struggling up the stairs. \nPO Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost there... \nHe stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath. \nWIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps. \nPO (CONT'D) What? No! Oh No! \nTwo Pigs pass by. \nKG SHAW Sorry, Po. \nJR SHAW We'll bring you back a souvenir. \nPo watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This is his heroic moment. \nPO No. I'll bring me back a souvenir. \nPo tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the stairs. \nEXT. JADE PALACE - ARENA PLATFORM \nOogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace Pig bangs a gong. \nSHIFU It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway? \nOOGWAY Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready? \nSHIFU Yes, Master Oogway. \nOOGWAY Now know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the Valley, but also to you. \nAs Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong. \nANNOUNCER Let the tournament begin! \nEXT. VALLEY SQUARE - DAY \nThrongs of Villagers are streaming into the arena. \nEXT. TOP OF STAIRS - DAY \nPo gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step, laughing victoriously. \nPo snaps to attention. \nPo pulls on a rope tied to a tree. \nSHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D) And believe me citizens, you have not seen anything yet! \nPO I KNOW!! \nSHIFU (O.S.) Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death! \nTigress sets up to deliver her move. \nPo launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move. \nPo lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent. \nINT. TOURNAMENT RING - DAY \nOogway senses something. He raises his hand and the crowd hushes. \nOOGWAY I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us. \nShifu motions for the Five to gather in the center of the ring. \nSHIFU Citizens of the Valley of Peace! Master Oogway will now choose... the Dragon Warrior! \nEXT. TOURNAMENT RING - DAY \nPo comes to. \nPO Huh? Oh no! Wait! \nHe sees the fireworks and has an idea. \nPO (CONT'D) Yeah! \nINT. TOURNAMENT RING - DAY \nOogway closes his eyes and raises his hand as ceremonial DRUMS start to play. \nEXT. TOURNAMENT RING - DAY \nPo struggles with something, his back turned to us. Reveal he has tied a load of fireworks to a chair. He hops on and lights the fuse. \nPO'S DAD (O.S.) Po?! \nPo's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse. \nPO'S DAD (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nPO What does it look like I'm doing? Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior! \nPO'S DAD But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream. \nPo looks uneasy. \nPO I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad! \nHe looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for liftoff. \nPO (CONT'D) I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu- \nPo finally opens his eyes... \nThe crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls! A palanquin is carried past Shifu. \nSHIFU Stop! Wait! Who told you to--? \nPo stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. He is abruptly lifted up out of shot. \nCut to the Palace Geese straining. \nPo is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the thronging crowd to get to Oogway. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Master Oogway, wait! That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem. You were about to point at Tigress. That thing fell in front of her. That was just an accident! \nOOGWAY There are no accidents. \nOogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH! \nThe camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed under Po. \nShifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles. \nA squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin, and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go. \nBehind him, the Five approach and bow. \nTIGRESS Forgive us, Master. We have failed you. \nShifu spins around. \nSHIFU No. If the panda has not quit by morning, then I will have failed you. \nConfetti flutters through the air as the celebration continues around them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PRISON -- NIGHT \nA huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain. Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door -- locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor patrol the perimeter. \nZeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him. \nZENG Wait wait wait! I bring a message from Master Shifu. \nCLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON -- A MOMENT LATER \nCOMMANDER What?!?! (reading) \"Double the guard?! Extra precautions?! Your prison may not be adequate!\" \nThe Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him, staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut. \nCOMMANDER (CONT'D) You doubt my prison's security? \nZENG Absolutely not. (then) Shifu does. I'm just the messenger. \nCOMMANDER I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu. \nON A BRIDGE \nCOMMANDER Escape from Chogun Prison is impossible! \nThe Goose is awed by the cavernous prison. \nThe Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose hurries after him. \nThe goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung. \nHIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail. \nINT. JADE PALACE - HALLWAY \nThe palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds of villagers behind him. \nCROWD (chanting) Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! \nPo is ushered in and the doors close. He is alone. He runs back to the closed palace doors. \nPO Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh... \nPo finally realizes where he is. \nPO (CONT'D) Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors. No way! Would you look at this place! \nHe rushes up to a display of armor. \nPO (CONT'D) (GASP) Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With authentic battle damage! \nHe rushes up to a green sword, making sure not to touch it. \nPO (CONT'D) (GASP) The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW! \nHe stares at a black sopt on the wall. \nPO (CONT'D) (GASP) The Invisible Trident of Destiny!? \nHe admires a painting. \nPO (CONT'D) (GASP) I've only seen paintings of that painting... \nPo runs around the room, amazed by all the ancient kung fu artifacts. Something special catches Po's eye. \nPO (CONT'D) (loudly) Nooo! Ohhhh! \nHe runs over to it. \nPO (CONT'D) The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors! Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army. (calling into vase) Hellooo? \nSHIFU Have you finished sight-seeing? \nPo GASPS. \nPO (to vase) Sorry. I should've come to see you first. \nSHIFU My patience is wearing thin. \nPO (to vase) Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere. \nSHIFU Would you turn around? \nPO Sure. \nPo turns and sees Shifu. \nPO (CONT'D) Hey, how's it going? \nPo turns back to the vase. \nSHIFU Oh, then you must know what happens when I flex my pinky. \nPo nervously eyes his finger locked in Shifu's grip and nods quickly. \nPO No no no! \nSHIFU You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards... \nPO Okay! Okay! Take it easy... \nSHIFU Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't. Are we clear? \nPO Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We are so clear. \nSHIFU Good. I can't wait to get started. \nINT. TRAINING HALL \nThe doors open, revealing Po nursing his wounded finger. Shifu steps out of the way and Po's face goes into shock. The Five are performing death-defying kung fu moves in the training hall. Tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of wood. ANGLE ON AN AWESTRUCK PO, as shards of wood blast into his face. Po is intimidated and overwhelmed. \nShifu scowls at Po. \nSHIFU Let's begin. \nHe gestures to the gauntlet. Po's eyes go wide. \nPO Wait wait wait...What? Now? \nSHIFU Yes...now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior. \nPO Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I can do all of those moves. \nShifu walks away and Po half-heartedly follows. \nSHIFU Well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we? \nPO Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level. \nSHIFU And what level is that? \nPO Well, ya know...I'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero. \nSHIFU There is no such thing as level zero. \nPO Hey! Maybe I can start with that. \nPo points at a rather friendly-looking dummy. \nSHIFU That? We use that for training children. And for propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist... \nRelieved, Po turns to the dummy. The Five gather around him. \nPO Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis. You're about the same. \nMantis gives him a look. \nSHIFU Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do. \nPO Um, are they gonna watch? Or should I just wait until they get back to work or something... \nSHIFU Hit it. \nPO Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting... So my kung fu might not be as good as later on. \nCRANE Yeah, or could at least touch his toes. \nMONKEY Or even see his toes. \nAs the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing everything. \nHe attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls over. \nHe gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE \nPo peeks around the corner. \nPO Okay. \nHe tip-toes into the hall. \nSQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK. \nPO (CONT'D) (whispering) Great. \nPo takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK! THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom door. \nCrane is staring back at him. \nPO (CONT'D) Oh hey...hi. You're up. \nCRANE Am now. \nPO I was just uh... Some day huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Your biceps sore? \nCrane looks at his wing. \nCRANE Um...I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I should probably get to sleep now. \nPO Yeah yeah yeah, of course. \nCRANE (relieved) Okay, thanks. \nPO It's just...I'm such a big fan. \nCRANE Oop. \nPO You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just... HI-YAH! \nPo does a spastic series of Kung Fu moves. We hear a RIP, and reveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall. \nPO (CONT'D) Ooo, sorry about that. \nCRANE Look, you don't belong here. \nPo looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes. \nPO I know. I know. You're right. I just - my whole life I've dreamed of- \nCrane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more. \nCRANE No no no... I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Crane. \nPo is mortified, but covers. \nPO Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you want to get to sleep. \nOogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a peach falls into Po's open hand. \nINT. PRISON -- NIGHT \nUsing the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS free from his armor. \nAn ALARM RINGS OUT! \nThe Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him. \nZENG What's happening?! \nThe Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom of the pit. \nTai Lung struggles with his shackles. \nCOMMANDER Fire Crossbows! \nTai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls, creating a makeshift staircase. \nZENG Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu! \nThe Commander shuts the Goose up. \nCOMMANDER You're not going anywhere. And neither is he. \nZENG Let go of me! \nCOMMANDER (to guards) Bring it up! \nThe winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino guard tries to reach it, but just misses. \nRHINO GUARD #1 Wait! Bring it back! \nZENG He's coming this way! \nCOMMANDER He won't get far. (to guards) Archers! \nLeaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as the volley of arrows flies down past him. \nThe guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit. \nTai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the next tier, disappearing into the shadows. \nTai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the Rhino army await. \nZENG We're dead. So very, very dead. \nThe Commander hushes the Goose. \nCOMMANDER (to Goose) Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now! \nArchers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs maniacally. \nOn his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern. \nGrabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it ahead of him at the guards. \nZENG Can we run now? \nCOMMANDER Yes. \nEXT. PRISON \nCrane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him up by flapping his wings. \nPO Maybe on three. One. Two- \nCrane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back. \nPO (CONT'D) Threeeee. Thank you. \nCRANE Don't mention it. \nPO No really, I appreci-- \nCRANE --EVER. \nSHIFU You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat. \nShifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck. As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around Po, knocking him on the head. \nPo collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu notices and steps forward. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones. \nPO Yeah, excellent! \nHe laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu. \nSHIFU Let's get started. \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE \nShifu snaps his fingers. Viper and Po face off. \nVIPER Are you ready? \nPO I was born ready-- \nViper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back down on his head. \nPO (CONT'D) Eaghhh... \nVIPER I'm sorry, brother! I thought you said you were ready! \nPO That was awesome! Let's go again. (salutes) \nShifu snaps. \nMonkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a comical beating. \nShifu snaps. \nPo and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup. \nShifu snaps. \nWe see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be... Mantis. \nShifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu has had it. \nSHIFU I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more! Your next opponent... will be me. \nPo looks excited. \n...But Mantis is now on his other shoulder. He jabs another needle into Po. \nPO Ow! \nVIPER Maybe you should take a look at this again. \nViper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda.) \nMANTIS (re: diagram) Oh! Okay. \nQuick cuts to Monkey meditating in his room and Crane doing calligraphy in his. Po's yelps distract them. \nPO Ow! Don't... (laughing) Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me. \nPo chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle awkwardly. \nMANTIS I know he can seem kind of heartless-- \nHe violently jabs another needle in Po. \nMANTIS (CONT'D) But, ya know, he wasn't always like that. \nVIPER According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile. \nPO No. \nMANTIS Yes. \nCut to Tigress out in the hallway. She can hear them talking. \nVIPER But that was before... \nPO Before what? \nTigress enters. \nTIGRESS Before Tai Lung. \nCrane's shadow is silhouetted on the wall. \nCRANE Uh yeah, we're not really supposed to talk about him. \nTIGRESS Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know. \nPO (trying to ease the tension) Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung. \nTigress turns to Po. \nPO (CONT'D) He was a student, the first ever to master the thousand... \nTigress approaches Po and leans in towards him. \nPO (CONT'D) (nervously trailing off) ...scrolls of... kung fu... and... then he turned bad... and now he's in jail. \nTigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance. \nTIGRESS He wasn't just a student. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TRAINING HALL \nFLASHBACK. Shifu peeks out of the Training Hall and finds a baby leopard cub on the steps. \nCRANE Wow, you're a really good cook. \nMANTIS I wish my mouth was bigger. \nThe others laugh. But not Tigress. \nMONKEY Tigress, you gotta try this. \nTigress looks up from her meal. \nTIGRESS It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe. \nOn the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs. \nPO I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice. \nPo laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face -- it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers. \nPO (CONT'D) What? \nMANTIS Oh, nothing... Master Shifu! \nThe rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle moustache. He plays it up. \nPO (imitating Shifu) You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth! \nThe Five LAUGH. \nPO (CONT'D) (imitating Shifu) What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! \nThe Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty bowls and holds them up like ears. \nPO (CONT'D) (imitating Shifu) Work hard, Panda. And maybe, someday... you will have ears like mine. \nAs the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing. \nReveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's staff. \nPO (CONT'D) (normal) Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good. \nPo looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet. \nMONKEY It's Shifu. \nPO Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? \nHe finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn. Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a bra. \nPO (CONT'D) Ooh! Master Shifu! \nPo slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but snicker. \nSHIFU You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children! \nPO What? \nSHIFU He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him. \nThe bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts to laugh. \nPO And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna stop Tai... \nShifu just stares at him, deadly serious. \nSHIFU Don't cry. \nPO Okay. \nPo sniffs the tears back and smiles. \nEXT. FIELD - LATER \nShifu leads Po out into an open field. \nSHIFU When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate...you stink. \nPo scowls. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you is with this! \nShifu produces a bowl of dumplings. \nPO Oh great, `cause I'm hungry. \nSHIFU Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin. \nEXT. FIELD - LATER \nPo's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance tests, push ups, sit ups, climbing, etc. Through it all, he never gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu. \nEXT. CLEARING - A MOMENT LATER \nShifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder. \nSHIFU After you, panda. \nPo stops short, suspicious. \nPO Just like that? No situps? No ten mile hike? \nSHIFU I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat. \nPo grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Enjoy. \nPo raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself. \nPO Hey! \nSHIFU I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. \nPo reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks the dumpling into the air. \nPO Hey! \nShifu eats it and Po scowls. \nSHIFU You are free to eat! \nPO (upset) Am I? \nSHIFU (challenging) Are you?! \nPo and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one left. \nShifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with his bamboo staff. \nWith a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five. \nTAI LUNG Shifu taught you well... \nTai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) But he didn't teach you everything. \nTai lung lunges toward the rest. \nEXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING \nShifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an easy spring in his step. \nSHIFU You have done well, Panda. \nPO Done well? Done well?! I've done awesome! \nHe swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance. \nShifu staggers back, regaining his dignity. \nSHIFU The mark of a true hero is humility! \nAfter a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po - \nSHIFU (CONT'D) But yes...you have done awesome. \nAnd he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind them. IT'S CRANE! \nCrane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a heap. \nPO Huh? Guys? Guys! \nPo throws his backpack aside and runs over to them. \nPO (CONT'D) They're dead? No, they're breathing! They're asleep?! No, their eyes are open. \nCrane struggles to lift his head. \nCRANE We were no match for his nerve attack. \nHis head collapses to the ground. \nSHIFU He has gotten stronger. \nPO Who? Tai Lung? Stronger? \nShifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis - \nMONKEY He's too fast! \nHe delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly realizes where he is. \nMONKEY (CONT'D) Sorry, Po. \nShifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her. \nTIGRESS I thought we could stop him. \nSHIFU He could have killed you. \nMANTIS Why didn't he? \nSHIFU What? \nPO Here! Look! \nPo tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and turns his head away. \nSHIFU No! I am forbidden to look upon-- \nBut he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it and opens it again, astonished. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Blank? I don't...I don't understand. \nShifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean? \nPO Okay. So like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all? \nSHIFU No. Oogway was wiser than us all. \nPo sits heavily on the floor, dejected. \nPO Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding? \nThe Five don't argue. \nTIGRESS But who will stop Tai Lung? \nCRANE He'll destroy everything...and everyone. \nShifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He looks oddly calm as he turns around. \nSHIFU No, evacuate the Valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage. \nTIGRESS What about you master? \nSHIFU I will fight him. \nPO What? \nSHIFU I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape. \nPO But Shifu, he'll kill you. \nSHIFU Then I will finally have paid for my mistake. \nThe Five and Po look devastated. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master. \nShifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away. \nPo resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VALLEY \nThe Five arrive at the base of the stairs. \nTIGRESS We've got to get them out safely. \nMonkey picks up a small child. \nMONKEY Come, little one. Let's find your mama. \nPO There is no secret ingredient... \nPo turns back to look at the palace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN \nAt the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley, awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears before him. \nTAI LUNG I have come home, Master. \nSHIFU This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master. \nTAI LUNG Yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this...Po? Did I scare him off? \nSHIFU This battle is between you and me. \nTAI LUNG So. That is how it's going to be? \nSHIFU That is how it must be. \nThey fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the doors of the Jade Palace. \nTai Lung enters. \nTAI LUNG I rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness! \nSHIFU Obeying your master is not weakness! \nTAI LUNG You knew I was the Dragon Warrior! You always knew... \nDissolve to FLASHBACK. \nA young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head. \nTAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D) But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do? What did you do?! \nTai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) NOTHING! \nShifu takes a Kung Fu stance. \nSHIFU You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault! \nTAI LUNG NOT YOUR FAULT?! \nEnraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and throws them at Shifu. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?! WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY DESTINY?! \nShifu dodges each attack. \nSHIFU It was never my decision to make! \nTai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine. \nTAI LUNG It is now. \nThey fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) Give me the scroll! \nUp and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the street. \nAs Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll. \nPO Lightning! \nTai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river. \nPo gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the fireworks-filled sky. \nPo slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie- vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is shocked. \nTAI LUNG The scroll has given him power. (then) NOOO0!! \nHe takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting shockwave collapses the building. \nAmazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating punch. \nAs the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the impact crater. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) (out of breath) Finally... oh yes... the power of the Dragon Scroll... is mine! \nTai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls. \nTAI LUNG (CONT'D) It's NOTHING!! \nPo stirs. \nPO It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either. \nTAI LUNG (disbelief) What? \nPo gets to his feet. \nPO There is no secret ingredient. It's just you. \nTai Lung snarls and lunges at Po. \nTAI LUNG RRRAAAH! \nPO AAAAGGGHH! \nTai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling. \nPO (CONT'D) Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't! \nTai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly. \nThe shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what he just did. \nTai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY! He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground. \nTai Lung is battered, but still defiant. \nTAI LUNG (heavy breathing) You... can't defeat me. You're just a big, fat panda! \nSCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide. \nPO I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda. \nPo's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps. \nTAI LUNG The Wuxi Finger Hold! \n", "test1_input": "PO Sorry, Dad. \nPO'S DAD Sorry doesn't make the noodles. \nReveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work, which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a panda his size. \nPO'S DAD (CONT'D) What were you doing up there? All that noise. \nPO Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy dream. \nHe gets back to work. \nPO'S DAD About what? \nPO Huh? \nPO'S DAD The dream. What were you dreaming about? \nPO What was I... eh, I was dreaming about uh... heh... \nPush in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his throwing star behind his back. \nPO (CONT'D) Noodles. \nTHOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables. \nPO'S DAD Noodles. You were really dreaming about noodles? \nPO Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about? \nPo hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his throwing star is sitting in it. \nPO (CONT'D) (to customer) Careful, that soup is... sharp! \nPO'S DAD Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream! \nHe throws his arms around Po. \nPO'S DAD (CONT'D) You don't know how long I have been waiting for this moment. \nWhen Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle apron. \nPO'S DAD (CONT'D) This is a sign, Po! \nPo looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself into? \nPO Uh...a sign of what? \nPO'S DAD You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my \"Secret Ingredient Soup.\" And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant, just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong. \nPO Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream. \nPO'S DAD No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins. \nPO But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno, want to do something else? Something besides noodles? \nPO'S DAD Actually... \nPo looks surprised. \nPO'S DAD (CONT'D) When I was young and crazy... \nDad gets a wistful look in his eyes. \n", "test1_true": "PO So why didn't you?! \nPO'S DAD Oh, because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine, me making tofu? (laughs at the thought) No. We all have our place in this world. Mine is here. And yours is-- \nPO I know. Is here. \nPO'S DAD No, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve. \nHe loads Po's arms with bowls of soup. \nPO'S DAD (CONT'D) Service with a smile! \nA GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the distant JADE PALACE. \nEXT. JADE PALACE - DAY \nSLAM ZOOM in towards Palace. \nEnd next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle between the Palace buildings. \nWider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark shapes move in the foreground. \nBack on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious. \nFive figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously, diving on Shifu. \nShifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers go flying - \nThey roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who is now standing - poised - ready for their next move. \nSHIFU Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me. \nHe uses his flute to correct the Five's technique. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Tigress, you need more ferocity. Monkey, greater speed. \nEach of the Five bows respectfully as their name is mentioned. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Crane - height. Viper - subtlety. Mantis-- \nShifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE. \nZENG Master Shifu! \nSHIFU (impatiently) What?! \nZENG (startled) Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you. \nShifu looks up, concerned. \nINT. HALLWAY \nShifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined with palace geese. \nINT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY \nCandles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters. \nSHIFU Master Oogway? You summoned me. \nHe bows. Then looks up without unbowing. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Is something wrong? \n", "test2_input": "Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his meditation. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Inner... \nBOOM. Zeng drops in from the ceiling. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now. \nZENG Uh... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JADE PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING \nOogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated. \nSHIFU Master! Master! \nOOGWAY Hmmm? \nSHIFU (out of breath) I have-- it's-- it's very bad news. \nOOGWAY Ah, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad. \nSHIFU Master, your vision...your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way! \nOOGWAY That is bad news... \nHe turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised. \nOOGWAY (CONT'D) ...If you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him. \nSHIFU The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. (MORE) \nSHIFU (CONT'D) He wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident! \nOOGWAY There are no accidents. \nSHIFU Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice. \nOOGWAY Well, that was no accident either. \nSHIFU Thrice. \nOOGWAY My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control. \nSHIFU Illusion? \nOOGWAY Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time. \nSHIFU But there are things we can control. \nShifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) I can control when the fruit will fall. \nA peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) And I can control-- \nShifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed in it. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) --where to plant the seed. That is no illusion, Master. \n", "test2_true": "SHIFU But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! \nOOGWAY Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it, to nurture it. To believe in it. \nOogway covers the seed with dirt. \nSHIFU But how? How? I need your help, Master. \nOOGWAY No, you just need to believe. Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe. \nSHIFU I... I will try. \nOogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to Shifu. \nOOGWAY Good. My time has come. You must continue your journey without me. \nHe hands his staff to a confused Shifu. \nSHIFU What... what are you..? \nOogway backs away into the swirling fog. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Master, you can't leave me! \nThe petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge. \nOOGWAY You must believe. \nSHIFU Master! \nShifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms. As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge of a cliff. \nOogway is gone. \nWe pan across to the bunkhouse. \nPO (O.S.) ...So I'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province... \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nReveal Po is cooking for the Five.   He chops some veggies mid- air. \nPO ...but you're a lousy tipper. \nCRANE (incredulous) Really? So... how'd you get out of there alive? \nPO I mean, I didn't actually say that, but I thought it... in my mind. \nPo flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm. He ladles soup into them. \nPO (CONT'D) (covering) If he... could read my mind, he'd have been like, \"What?\" (then) Order up! \nPo looks around expectantly and the Five (minus Tigress) dig in. \nPO (CONT'D) Hope you like it. \nMANTIS This is really good. \nPO (bashful) No, c'mon. (MORE) \nPO (CONT'D) You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient. \nVIPER What are you talking about? This is amazing. \n", "test3_input": "PO That's what I thought. \nShifu walks away, leaving the path open to Po. \nEXT. JADE PALACE - NIGHT \nTigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace. She has seen what just transpired between Shifu and Po. \nShe turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and LEAPS. \nShe flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in the valley below. She looks back up at the palace. \nTIGRESS This is what you trained me for. \nShe takes off running. \nThe other four are right behind her. \nVIPER Tigress! \nShe keeps going and they give chase. \nTIGRESS Don't try and stop me! \nThe chase continues through the village. \nVIPER We're not trying to stop you! \nTIGRESS What? \nVIPER We're coming with you! \nThen...the others join her. Tigress smiles. They leap off into the night. \nEXT. JADE PALACE - EVENING \nNight dissolves to dawn. Shifu sits under the peach tree. He stirs, hearing KUNG FU NOISES from the training hall. He goes to investigate. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRAINING HALL - DAWN \nShifu looks inside -- it's empty. The NOISES continue from somewhere else -- the bunkhouse. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAWN \nAs Shifu turns the corner he sees Po's shadow as he performs some amazing Kung Fu. \nEntering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch. \nIn silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room -- broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches. \nPO (mouth full) What? I eat when I'm upset, okay? \nShifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea. \nSHIFU Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf. \nShifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway, waiting to see if his hunch is correct. \nKLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his mouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in. \n", "test3_true": "He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a wise smile. \nSHIFU Look at you. \nPO Yeah, I know. I disgust you. \nSHIFU No no, I mean... how did you get up there? \nPO I don't know. I guess I-- I don't know. I was getting a cookie... \nHe looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it. \nSHIFU And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split. \nPO No, this... this is just an accident. \nHe and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over to Shifu. He picks it up. \nSHIFU There are no accidents. Come with me. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN \nShifu leads Po through the mountains. \nPO I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y, but could you at least tell me where we're going? \nShifu just continues walking. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - LATER \nShifu is sitting beneath a tree. Winded and wheezing, Po slowly works his way up the hill. \nPo sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the morning mist as Po approaches. \nPO You dragged me all the way out here for a bath?! \nPo begins to pat his armpits with water. \nSHIFU Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears. \nPo quickly stops. Realizing. \nPO (in awe) The pool of... \nSHIFU This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace of Kung Fu. \nThe camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol. \nAs the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a vision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves. \nFLASH FRAME -- Shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks down at Po. \nSHIFU (CONT'D) Do you want to learn Kung Fu? \nPO (awestruck) Yeah... \nSHIFU Then I am your master! \nPO Okay! \nTears of joy well up in Po's eyes. \n"}

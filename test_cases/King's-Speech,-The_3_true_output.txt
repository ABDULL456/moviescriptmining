LIONEL I was there. 
BERTIE Then you knew from the start I was hopeless?! 
LIONEL My son, Valentine, asked, "Could you help that poor man?" I replied, "He's too old for me to manage a complete cure, but I could very nearly do it, I'm sure of that." 
BERTIE Lying bastard! 
LIONEL I knew I could help you. You refuse to believe? 
BERTIE In you?! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    100. 
LIONEL In yourself. 
BERTIE Who the hell do you think you are?! 
LIONEL A failed actor. 
BERTIE Actor? 
LIONEL Father wanted me to be a doctor, but I couldn't cut flesh. So I worked in the mines, recited in pubs... 
BERTIE An actor?! 
LIONEL When the war came, by the time I was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest. Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I found I had to go deeper, as you might well imagine. 
BERTIE I know nothing of those poor men! 
LIONEL I think you do. They had cried out, and the universe had not listened. So they'd lost faith in their voice. My job was to make them shout in righteous anger: "I have the right to be heard!" 
BERTIE I suppose that helped them, did it? 
LIONEL Make inquiries. 
BERTIE Inquiries have been made! No credentials. 
LIONEL But a lot of success. No training was given. (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    101. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Not in Western Australia, not at that time. I simply knew what to do. When the war was over I kept being a therapist to earn a living. When the lads were old enough, I thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go." I pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage. 
BERTIE To Harley Street?! 
LIONEL Cashed in our return tickets. I had three months rent. 
BERTIE So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor? Harley Street, don't you know, is for doctors! 
LIONEL The plaque says, `L. Logue. Speech Specialist'. No mention of a medical degree. No mention of any degree. Some of the diggers I'd helped had come to England. They made referrals. My practice flourished. My acting, however, did not. 
BERTIE Well enough to deceive me. 
LIONEL Lock me in the Tower. 
BERTIE I would if I could! 
LIONEL What crime? 
BERTIE You've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King. Destroyed the happiness of my family...all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist! 
Lionel sits down on the chair of Edward the Confessor. Leaning against it is the great two-handed sword of St. George. 
BERTIE (CONT'D) What're you doing? Get up! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    102. 
LIONEL I'm tired. 
BERTIE You can't sit there! 
LIONEL Why not? It's a chair. 
BERTIE It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor! The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned. 
LIONEL It's falling apart. People have carved their initials into it. Needs a stone to keep from blowing away. 
BERTIE That's the Stone of Scone! The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow. 
LIONEL You believe such ballocks I don't care how many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a building block with handles attached. You're just like me, an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real. 
BERTIE Listen to me... ! 
LIONEL Listen to you?! By what right? 
BERTIE Divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!! 
LIONEL Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself. Said you didn't want it. So why should I listen to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put one word after another? Why waste my time listening to you?

An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it. 
REBECCA I figured if we have to talk all day we might as well do it someplace nice. 
(looks at the cabin) Isn't it beautiful? 
DULANEY Yeah. 
REBECCA (sadly) Andrew loved this old cabin. (fondly remembering) He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. (a sad smile) I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it. 
Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant memory. 
REBECCA (snapping out of it) Sorry. 
DULANEY It's okay. 
EXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK 
Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows through her hair. 
DULANEY Tell me about Doctor Paley? 
REBECCA I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me. 
DULANEY It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off. 
REBECCA (confidently) It won't be that hard. 
She walks off. 
EXT.  CABIN - DUSK 
Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing. 
REBECCA Did you always want to be a lawyer? 
DULANEY No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player. 
REBECCA Really? 
DULANEY Yeah. 
REBECCA That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened? 
DULANEY I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream. 
REBECCA It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want? 
Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away. 
EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING 
Rebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out. 
REBECCA I'm going to put the car away.  You can let yourself in.  There's a key under the flower pot. 
Rebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens the door and goes inside. 
ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET 
Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad. 
INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Rebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move. 
REBECCA Yes -- it would be nice. 
DULANEY What would?

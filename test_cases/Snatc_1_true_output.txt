BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Do you know what Nemesis means? 
There is a pause 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
A righteous infliction of retribution ·by. an appropriate agent, personified in this case by a horrible cunt. Me. Brick Top stands and opens the door. We can see that a coupl of ropes have been slung over the rafters and a couple of buckets are underneath them. SIX VERY LARGE MEN (including Errol and John) are standing around wanting to get busy. - Tyrone is with them, all trussed up.

ERROL 
Is this how you want him gov? 
BRICK TOP 
No spin him round, I want him sunny side up. 
SOL 
Mr Mclean I kid you not. Why do you think we have a dead man, missing an arm in our office? Give us four days and we'11 bring you a stone the size of a home. Brick Top considers this, and has a look at Errol who is more than enthusiastic to get on with the job at hand. 
BRICK TOP 
What do you think Errol? 
ERROL.

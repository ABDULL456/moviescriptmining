Elizabeth paces outside the door of the library, waiting. After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth walks in. Her father is in a state of shock. 
MR BENNET Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man. 
ELIZABETH No, Papa. 
MR BENNET He is rich, to be sure, and you will have more fine carriages than Jane. But will that make you happy? 
ELIZABETH 
(UNCOMFORTABLE) Have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference? 
MR BENNET None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but this would be nothing if you really liked him. 
ELIZABETH (tears in her eyes) I do like him! 
(WITH PASSION) I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's been prejudiced, who didn't realize ... You don't know him, Papa...if I told you what he's really like. What he's done. 
MR BENNET What has he done? 
CUT TO: 
132 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 132 
Darcy, in an agony, paces up and down the lawn. He looks at the library window. 
CUT BACK TO: 
â¢ 133 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 133 
Mr Bennet stares at his daughter. 
MR BENNET Good Lord. I must pay him back. 
ELIZABETH (shakes her head) No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't want it. 
(PAUSE) We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In every way,not just in this matter. I've been so blind. He's been so blind! About Jane, about so many things. Then so have 
I... 
(BREATHLESS PAUSE) You see, he and I are so similiar...we're both so stubborn... 
(SHAKY LAUGH) Oh Papa... Mr Bennet gazes at his daughter-. He still can't quite take it in. 
MR BENNET You do love him, don't you? Elizabeth nods. 
ELIZABETH â¢ Very much. He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no doubt. 
MR BENNET I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I heartily give my consent. Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him. 
MR BENNET I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to any one less worthy. 
ELIZABETH Oh thank you! She starts to rush out. 
MR BENNET (calls out after her) And if any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at â¢ leisure. 
â¢ 134 EXT. PEMBERLY - NIGHT. 134 
We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham are missing. Let everyone have an end. Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park. Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to Elizabeth and smiles. 
DARCY Allow me, Mrs Darcy. He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley. 
ELIZABETH How did it begin? 
DARCY I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or 
the look. It was too long ago and I was in the middle before I knew it had begun. 
ELIZABETH Now be sincere, did you admire me for my impertinenc? 
DARCY For the liveliness of your mind, I did. 
ELIZABETH You may as well call it impertinence, though make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate - them as much as possible. And, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe... and I shall begin directly... We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter and fainter, the sound of music and laughter... 
135 FADE TO BLACK... 135

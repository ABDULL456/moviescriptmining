DANNY Fine. 
SWEENEY Adjusting okay? 
DANNY Yeah. 
SWEENEY He was a student of mine. Honors English. He was a great student... like you...but he hung out with scumbags. Also like you. That's why he ended up in the pen, hunh? 
No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper. 
SWEENEY Great writing. I can't correct it though. It wreaks too much of shit. 
DANNY Come on, man! I followed directions and wrote an "A" paper. It's got nothing to do with Derek. 
SWEENEY Everything you do now has something to do with Derek. Who told you to do this? 
DANNY Let us get on with our lives, man! 
SWEENEY Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he can take care of himself.  I'm worried about his little brother. (softly) Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you! 
DANNY Do it. What?  You don't think I could handle it? 
SWEENEY (smiling in disbelief) The street would kill you, Danny. You're not tough. The second a brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll be holierin' for Doris. (pondering to himself) So here's the drill. Take it or leave it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm your history teacher from here on out. We're gonna deal with shit happening right now. Call it American History...X. I see your ass once a day. Any more, any less, and you're a memory at Venice High. Clear? 
DANNY It took me a week to read Mein Kampf. Come on, Sweeney. 
SWEENEY My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a another paper on my desk tomorrow. 
DANNY What am I doing it on then? 
SWEENEY It'S not a "what", it's a "who." (after a beat) Derek. 
SMASH TO: 
EXT. VENICE SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A series of intercuts shows activity in and around the pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster. OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia. A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and boxers. 
TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk, performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit, recovers, and looks off into the distance. 
DANNY (V/O) People look at me...and they see my brother. That's how things have gone since the murder of our father. 
EXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURT 
From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold glance. 
DANNY (V/O) Little Henry Hastings and his older brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline Crip...Henry's on his way. 
Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing. 
DANNY (V/O) Venice Beach, man. It didn't always look like this. I mean...our Dad used to take us down here to run...and it was cool. Derek fucking owned this place.        Since then though...the gangs, man-- 
TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he takes a drag off his Marlboro Red. 
DANNY (V/O) --they've moved west from Inglewood and South Central and have really just...taken over. Especially at my high school. The Venice Locos are big too but they hang out in bumluck Mar Vista. It's scary. (then) And then there's The Disciples of Christ. The D.O.C. 
Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra players and spectators. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACK 
DANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3 blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1 Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better, predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed on his head. 
JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON. Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on the bleachers. 
LAWRENCE Seven-six. Let's go!  Set some picks! 
SETH Bring it on, boy. 
Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court. 
LAWRENCE Boy? 
Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers. 
SETH Lucky piece of shit! I'm through "monkeying" around with your ass! 
Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.

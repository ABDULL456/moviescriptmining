TUNA I don't know about you, but I think we're gonna like it here. 
EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer, music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day, George and Tuna have a hundred new friends. 
GEORGE (V.O.) California was like nothing I'd ever experienced.  The people were liberated and independent and full of new ideas. 
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) They used words like "right on," "groovy," and "solid."  The women are all beautiful and seemed to share the same occupation. 
WOMAN #1 I'm a flight attendant. 
WOMAN #2 I'm a flight attendant. 
WOMAN #3 I'm a flight attendant. 
The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints. Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass, grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a huge shotgun. 
INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door wakes them up.  It's Tuna. 
TUNA Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you something. 
George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag. 
TUNA (CONT'D) Figured it out. 
GEORGE Figured what out? 
TUNA You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out. 
Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana. 
Barbara examines the reefer. 
BARBARA Tuna, this is crap. 
TUNA I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial. 
BARBARA It's garbage. 
GEORGE It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? 
TUNA We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything. 
BARBARA You can't sell this to your friends. 
TUNA Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical. 
BARBARA Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy. 
EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door. 
GEORGE Are you sure this guy is cool? 
BARBARA You'll see for yourself. 
TUNA A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty queer. 
They walk in. 
INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS 
George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures, manicures. 
GEORGE Nothing like this back home. 
BARBARA Derek! 
DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate, especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut and runs to embrace her. 
DEREK Barbie! 
Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all around. 
DEREK (CONT'D) So, this is the new man, huh?  He's cute!

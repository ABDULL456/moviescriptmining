BILL All right, look, I'm not going to be held hostage here while you attack me. And her name is Cindy. 
BARBARA I know her stupid name -- do me the courtesy of recognizing when I'm demeaning you. 
BILL Violet really has a way of putting you in attack mode, you know that? You feel such rage for her you can't help dishing it -- 
BARBARA Psychoanalyze me right now, I skin you. 
BILL You may not agree with my methods, but you know I'm right -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   41. 27   CONTINUED:                                                   27 
BARBARA "Your methods." Thank you, Doctor, but I actually don't need any help from my mother to feel rage. 
BILL You want to argue? Is that what you need to do? Pick a subject, alright, let me know what it is, so I have a fighting -- 
BARBARA The subject is me! I am the subject, you narcissistic motherfucker! I am in pain! I need help! 
Barbara heads into the yard to get away from him. 
28   INT. WESTON HOUSE, UPSTAIRS ROOM - CONTINUOUS                28 
Jean's on the small bed in the darkened room. Staring at the ceiling, listening to her parents argue. 
29   EXT. WESTON HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT                        29 
Bill chases Barbara into the yard. 
BILL I've copped to being a narcissist. We're the products of a narcissistic generation. 
BARBARA You can't do it, can you? You can't talk about me for two seconds -- 
BILL You called me a narcissist! 
BARBARA You do understand that it hurts, to go from sharing a bed with you for twenty-three years to sleeping by myself. 
BILL I'm here, now. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   42. 29   CONTINUED:                                                      29 
BARBARA Oh, men always say shit like that, as if the past and the future don't exist. 
Jean listens in the dark to her parents fighting -- as she has many times before. Heads out into the hallway to screen door leading to the upstairs porch. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) It's just horseshit, to avoid talking about the things they're afraid to say. 
BILL I'm not necessarily keen on the notion of saying things that would hurt you. 
BARBARA Like what? 
BILL We have enough on our hands with your parents right now, let's not revisit this. 
BARBARA When did we visit this to begin with? I still don't know what happened. Do I bore you, intimidate you, disgust you? Is this just about the pleasures of young flesh, teenage pussy? I really need to know. 
BILL You need to know now? With Beverly missing, and your mother crazy as a loon? You want to do this now? 
BARBARA You're right. I'll just hunker down for a cozy night's sleep upstairs. Next to my husband. 
BILL This discussion deserves our   care. And patience. We'll both be    in a better frame of mind to talk   about this once your father's come   home. 
Bill turns, starts back for the house. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft      43. 
30      INT. WESTON HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT                             30 
Jean sees her father coming, hears his footsteps approaching across the wooden porch below, the screen door opens quietly. She slips back into her room and bed, but he doesn't stop. 
Jean waits, listening for her mother.   She doesn't come. 
31      EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE - NIGHT                                    31 
We're on the old wooden dock, watching a man walking away from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the dock in the moonlight. He leans down to untie the boat, looks back at us, directly into camera -- Beverly. 
Now we're traveling BELOW the surface of the lake, through its dark, tenebrous waters on the moonlit night. The rhythmic SLAP of gentle waves. We're underwater, light fractures and scatters above us. We've been here before as -- 
A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision.   It's aluminum bottom cuts through the calm above. 
Oars dip on either side, propelling the small craft. It slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch -- 
Until, suddenly, something hits the surface above, exploding the calm, coming at us fast, sinking. 
32      INT. THE ATTIC - NIGHT                                        32 
Johnna wakes with a start. Sits up, listens intently. 
33      EXT. WESTON HOUSE - NIGHT                                     33 
Johnna steps out onto the second floor porch balcony, finds a police car approaching in the distance, headlights cutting through the dark country night. 
34/35   INT. WESTON HOUSE STAIRWAY - NIGHT                        34/35 
Barefoot, Johnna quietly descends the stairs. Approaches the front door, left open to let in the cool night air. Undoes the screen door latch. Steps outside. 
Watches the car arrive. The driver's door opens, a sheriff gets out, silhouetted against the police flashers behind him. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   44. 
36   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                       36 
Barbara, bleary-eyed, moves quickly down the dark hall in her robe. Bill follows in his boxers and T-shirt, pulling on pants. Barb goes to Vi's door, KNOCKS.

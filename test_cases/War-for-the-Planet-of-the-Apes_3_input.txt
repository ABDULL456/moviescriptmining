Mesmerized, Red watches motionless as Caesar charges fearlessly through the chaos toward the TANKER directly beneath gunners on the wall! 
Caesar continues through the smoke and debris -- finally grabbing one of the grenades from the bandolier -- eyes fixed on the tanker just 30 feet away -- rearing back, about to pull the pin -- WHEN SUDDENLY -- 
CAESAR DROPS, CLUTCHING HIS SIDE -- TUMBLING TO THE GROUND! 
Shocked, Red watches as Caesar, in agony, touches his abdomen, discovering BLOOD; Caesar reaches behind him to find he's been shot in the back with a CROSSBOW ARROW... 
Red looks up to see -- PREACHER stalking through the haze and snow, out of the pen area, almost shocked himself at what he has just done -- he nervously loads another arrow, in turmoil as he moves toward Caesar. 
Gasping in pain, Caesar SNAPS the arrow from his side, and turns, seeing Preacher too... 
Red stands frozen, gripped by the sight of Caesar lying there helpless -- 
GUNNER (O.S.) (CONT'D) GODAMMIT!!! 
Red turns, startled, to find the Gunner screaming at him, momentarily turned from the battle -- 
GUNNER (CONT'D) YOU STUPID DONKEY!!! WHERE'S MY LAUNCHER!?! 
Red suddenly looks at the weapon in his hands, remembering what he was ordered to do -- still returning to his senses, he nods to the Gunner -- who immediately turns back to the battle, FIRING RELENTLESSLY at the apes... 
CUT TO: 
CAESAR ON THE GROUND 
as he sees Preacher anxiously closing in... Caesar's eyes frantically dart for an avenue of escape, but there is none. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
His pained gaze returns to Preacher who comes to a stop just 25 feet away, hesitating, torn -- then, finally steeling himself, he raises the LOADED CROSSBOW -- when -- 
FSSSSSSST--KABLOOM! Preacher DISAPPEARS in a HUGE BLAST!!! AND EVERYTHING GOES INSTANTLY SILENT, THE SOUND REPLACED BY A QUIET RINGING -- 
Stunned, disoriented, Caesar looks around him, deafened, finally peering up to discover -- 
RED ON THE WALL holding the SMOKING LAUNCHER, looking down stoically. 
Caesar can't believe it... He gazes up in shock at -- 
RED, who just gazes back, calmly holding the weapon, almost in a state of peace -- while BEHIND HIM -- 
THE GUNNER turns, suddenly realizing what Red has just done, freaking out, his SCREAMING INAUDIBLE to Caesar's ringing ears -- the Gunner pulls out his PISTOL -- pointing it at Red, who doesn't even react -- we see just a split-second of his SILENT MUZZLE FLASH -- when we CUT -- 
CLOSE ON CAESAR 
as he takes in the grim sight, pained -- THEN -- 
THE GUNNER turns and takes aim at CAESAR! 
Caesar scrambles, the sounds around him (and us) suddenly starting to return -- as -- he SNATCHES UP THE GRENADE from the ground beside him -- jumping to his feet -- 
-- narrowly dodging the Gunner's bullets tearing up earth around him -- as he PULLS THE PIN from the grenade, desperately LAUNCHING it straight for the tanker beneath the wall -- 
The Gunner's alarmed eyes suddenly whip toward the tanker -- as Caesar takes off, sprinting in the opposite direction -- 
-- when the grenade EXPLODES and THE TANKER ERUPTS -- ENGULFING the WALL beside it, and consuming all the Gunners above in its INCREDIBLE BLAST!!! 
Caesar races into the adult pen -- as behind him, FLAMES CLIMB HIGH INTO THE SKY -- when SUDDENLY -- THE TRAIN CAR NEXT TO THE TANKER EXPLODES TOO! 
Still running, Caesar steals a startled look back -- as ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He DIVES down into the hole -- as -- 
WE CUT WIDE OVER THE CAMP -- AND THE CHAIN REACTION CONTINUES -- CARS ERUPTING ONE AFTER ANOTHER -- BLASTING THE CAMP APART -- HEADING BACK ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD THE DEPOT AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN -- A CATACLYSMIC DISPLAY OF DESTRUCTION SO LARGE, IT'S STAGGERING!!! 
SMASH TO: 
CAESAR RUNNING THROUGH THE TUNNELS BELOW 
AS THE SHOCKWAVES CONTINUE, THE TUNNELS GIVING WAY, BEGINNING TO COLLAPSE BEHIND HIM! 
CAESAR RACES FOR LIGHT AT THE TUNNEL'S END -- LEAPING FOR THE LADDER -- SCRAMBLING UP -- WHEN THE WHOOSH OF DEBRIS SUDDENLY SWEEPS AROUND HIM -- AND HE EMERGES -- TUMBLING OUT -- 
THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING 
And flat onto his stomach! 
Finally, he lifts his head to see the feet of apes all around, their backs to him -- as he rises, he finds them all staring out beyond the outcropping in awe... 
He slowly presses his way through the crowd, climbing higher on the rocks... to discover their eyes all fixed on... 
THE UTTERLY DECIMATED PRISON, engulfed in a massive conflagration as a STORM OF DEBRIS RAINS DOWN FROM THE SKY... 
Now seeing Caesar, Rocket and Bad Ape turn, stunned at the sight of him -- Caesar and Rocket begin to exchange emotional looks -- 
-- when MECHANICAL GROANS beside them make them all turn to see -- 
THE REMAINING ARMADA as it finally arrives, braking to a stop just 20 yards away... SOLDIERS, FACES ALL OBSCURED in heavy parkas and BALACLAVAS, are packed onto troop carriers, trucks and humvees, gazing in shock at the fiery camp -- when ONE notices... the apes. Others start to see them too... A moment suspended in time as ape and man all stare silently at each other... 
Then, the anonymous soldiers slowly begin to raise their weapons -- Caesar and the apes remaining totally still -- when --

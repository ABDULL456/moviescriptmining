{"train": "THOR \nWritten by \nAshley Miller & Zack Stentz \nFADE IN: \nOn the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars. Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come. \n1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1 \nA main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves down the street and heads out of town. \n2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2 \nThe SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices. \nJANE Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as well, rubbing his head. \nJANE (CONT'D) Oh-- watch your head. \nSELVIG Thanks. So what's this \"anomaly\"\u009d of yours supposed to look like? \nJANE It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon-- \nSELVIG \n(GENTLY TEASING) \"Racing \"\u0098round Orion?\"\u009d I've always said you should have been a poet. Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A. \nJANE Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin. \nJANE (CONT'D) Not until you see it! \nSELVIG (re: the gloves) I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile. \nJANE Thank you. \nSELVIG For what? \nJANE The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2. \nJANE (CONT'D) It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat. \nDARCY (O.S.) Can I turn on the radio? \nJANE (an edge to her voice) Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, \"All agriculture, all the time.\"\u009d Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle. \n3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3 \nThe SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the frustrated Jane with sympathy. \nJANE The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns. \nJANE (CONT'D) The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert. \nDARCY Jane? Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate. \nJANE There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A. \nDARCY I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3. They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane. \nDARCY (CONT'D) Jane? \nJANE What?! \nDARCY I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over the desert -- \nMASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded. \nJANE Holy. Shatner. \nSELVIG That's your \"subtle\"\u009d aurora?! \nJANE No-- yes! Let's go! \n4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4 \nSIF Keep your mouth shut. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12. \n19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19 \nImposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready, stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath the palace. A cold BREEZE blows past them. \n19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A \nThor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety. \nFRIGGA It's all right to be nervous. \nTHOR Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous! \nFRIGGA You may be able to fool the rest of \nASGARD -- \nTHOR ...but never you. I know. \nFRIGGA Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had. \nTHOR And what is that? \nFRIGGA Me for a mother. She smiles. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) Now don't keep your father waiting. Frigga leaves. \n20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20 \nSif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into formation. They part to reveal -- \nODIN \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A. Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall, casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A murmur spreads through the crowd. \nVOLSTAGG (sotto, to Loki) Where is he? \nLOKI He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval. \nVOLSTAGG What? \nSIF He wants to make an entrance. \nFANDRAL Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens. \nLOKI I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13. Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level -- \nMJOLNIR Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy. \nSIF Oh, please. Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display. \n21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21 \nAs the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing something's not right. They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a pedestal. LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons. \n22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22 \nThor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority. He raises Gungnir before him. \nODIN Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born. \n(MORE) \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A. \nODIN (CONT'D) So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14. \n23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23 \nThe bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large and BLUE-SKINNED. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM. \n24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24 \nThe Ceremony continues. \nODIN Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall. Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son with pride. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15. \nTHOR As King of Asgard, I would-- \nODIN You are not King. Not yet. Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin watches him go. \n26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26 \nThor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the massive tables. From across the room, Loki watches him. \nAT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in search of his dinner. \nSIF Redecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast. \nVOLSTAGG What's this -- ?! \nHOGUN I told you they'd cancel it. \nFANDRAL We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing. \nVOLSTAGG All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart! Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki calmly moves towards him. \nTHOR It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18. \nLOKI Who said I was wise? \nTHOR (re: the empty hall) This was to be my day of triumph. \nLOKI It will come. In time. \n(ADMITS) If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army? \nTHOR Yes, exactly! \nLOKI But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned. \nLOKI (CONT'D) No... stop there! I know that look! \nTHOR It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders. \nLOKI It's madness! \nVOLSTAGG Madness? What sort of madness? \nLOKI Nothing! Thor was making a jest! \nTHOR The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19. \nFANDRAL What?! \nSIF Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break. Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings. \nFANDRAL This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim. \nVOLSTAGG And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will! \nTHOR My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers. \nSIF It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction. \nTHOR My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil? \nFANDRAL You did. \nTHOR \n(TO HOGUN) Who led you into the most glorious of battles... \n(TO VOLSTAGG) ...and to delicacies so succulent, you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A. \nVOLSTAGG/HOGUN You did. / You did. He turns to Sif. \nTHOR And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known? \nSIF I did. \nTHOR \n(QUICKLY) True. But I supported you... (then, to the others) My friends, trust me now. We must do this. The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no convincing him. \nThor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the Observatory. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23. \nHEIMDALL Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim. \nTHOR I have no plans to die today. \nHEIMDALL None do. Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up. \n31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31 \nThe Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into the Observatory. \n32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32 \nHeimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and his five comrades stand. \nHEIMDALL All is ready. You may pass. \nVOLSTAGG Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us? \nHEIMDALL To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it. \nVOLSTAGG Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A. \nTHOR Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex. \n33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33 \nA hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24. Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond. \nTHOR Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims: \nVOLSTAGG This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing! \nFANDRAL You bathe? Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance. \nHOGUN We shouldn't be here. \nTHOR Too late now. \nFANDRAL Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious. \nLOKI Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother. \nTHOR For what? \nLOKI To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25. \nVOLSTAGG I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part. \nTHOR We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow. \nSIF He's just got to swing his hammer... \n34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34 \nThe group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers. Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades. \nTHOR It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world? \nFANDRAL Adventuring? Is that what we're doing? \nTHOR What would you call it? \nFANDRAL Freezing. \nVOLSTAGG Starving. \nSIF Whining. \nTHOR How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan. \nHOGUN No, not that! \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A. \nSIF Please don't make us sing again! \nCUT TO BLACK. \n37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37 \nThor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS into him, as we: \nCUT TO BLACK. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36. After a beat, we hear familiar voices. \nDARCY (V.O.) I think that was legally your fault. \nJANE (V.O.) Get the first aid kit. \n(THEN) Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. \nTHOR'S POV Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful. \nDARCY (O.S.) Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. \nEND THOR'S POV \nTIME CUT TO: Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her. \nJANE \n(TO SELVIG) Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise. Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength. \nJANE (CONT'D) Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground. \nTHOR Hammer... \nDARCY Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines her flashlight down at the sand. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A. \nJANE Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away. \nJANE (CONT'D) We've got to move fast before anything changes. \n(MORE) \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37. \nJANE (CONT'D) We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky. \nSELVIG Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister. \nJANE Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain. \nJANE (CONT'D) \n(RE: THOR) Look at him, he's fine. Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily. \nTHOR Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge! \nJANE (off Selvig's look) Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here. \nSELVIG You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated. \nTHOR You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor. \nSELVIG It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A. \nTHOR Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38. \nJANE Erik, just back away... \nSELVIG (to Thor, calming) You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo. \nTHOR What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim? \nDARCY Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it. \nTHOR You dare threaten Thor with so puny \nA-- Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked. \nDARCY What? He was freaking me out. \n38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38 \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A. The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater. We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object, tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts, strains with all his might, with no luck. He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious object. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41. \nTOWNIE (CONT'D) Huh. \n45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45 \nThe distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light. Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment. A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall. Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed. He notices a monitor which displays a complex program entitled \"J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS\"\u009d. He looks proud. The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement. \nJANE Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me. \nSELVIG We might want to perform a spectral analysis. \nJANE \"We?\"\u009d \nSELVIG I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server. \nJANE You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO? \nSELVIG She was more than a friend. \nJANE Could you call in a favor? \nSELVIG You don't think this was just a magnetic storm? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A. \nJANE If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event. \nSELVIG Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows. \nJANE Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger. \nSELVIG How \"big\"\u009d are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars. \nJANE I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. \nDARCY A what? \nSELVIG I thought you were a science major. \nDARCY Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs. \nJANE She was the only applicant. \nSELVIG \n(TO DARCY) An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a \"theoretical\"\u009d connection between two different points of space-time. Darcy stares blankly. \nJANE \n(TO DARCY) A wormhole. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B. Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the monitor. \nJANE (CONT'D) Erik, look... \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42. Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen through the \"bubble\"\u009d in the clouds. \nJANE (CONT'D) What do you see here? \nSELVIG Stars. \nJANE Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement. \nJANE (CONT'D) This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye. \nDARCY Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed. \nSELVIG Is that...? \nJANE I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN. \n45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A \nAt the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin, looking out over Asgard. \n46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46 \nFrigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A. \nFRIGGA How could you have done this? \nTHOR Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it? \nDARCY I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many. \nJANE \n(TO THOR) Let's get you some clothes. \n53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53 \nSif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a ROARING central fire. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades, the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch. Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound. Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant. Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to its normal color. \nVOLSTAGG We should never have let him go. \nSIF There was no stopping him. \nFANDRAL At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone. \nVOLSTAGG How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm. \nLOKI I told him. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A. \nFANDRAL What? \nLOKI I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46. \nVOLSTAGG You told the guard? \nLOKI I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did. \nSIF Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind! \nLOKI And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him. \nSIF He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor. \nVOLSTAGG True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives. \nHOGUN Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun. \nFANDRAL Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous? \nHOGUN A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication. \nVOLSTAGG No! Surely not! \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A. \nFANDRAL Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47. \nSIF Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow? \nVOLSTAGG The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King. \nSIF We should go to the Allfather. \nFANDRAL And tell him what? \"Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!\"\u009d \nSIF It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger. \n54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54 \nLoki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters sitting on its stand. He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48. \nODIN (O.S.) Stop! Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin eyes Loki with dismay. \nLOKI Am I cursed? \nODIN No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father. \nLOKI What am I? \nODIN You're my son. \nLOKI What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth. \nLOKI (CONT'D) The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer. \nJANE (CONT'D) My ex. Thor stares at her a beat. \nJANE (CONT'D) They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry. \nTHOR They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall. \nJANE You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo. \nJANE (CONT'D) What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive. \nTHOR What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious. \nSELVIG (amused, skeptical) The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book. \nJANE What exactly is the Bifrost? \nTHOR \n(IGNORING HER) This mortal form has grown weak. \nJANE \nBUT-- \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52A. \nJANE (CONT'D) Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart. \n61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61 \nFrigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight. Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks softly to him. \nFRIGGA I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family. \nLOKI So why did he lie? \nFRIGGA He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that. Loki takes this in, stares at Odin. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) \n(RE: ODIN) You can speak to him. He can see and hear us, even now. \nLOKI How long will it last? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53. \nFRIGGA I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared. \nLOKI I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored. \nFRIGGA But he's put it off for so long now, I fear... Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) You're a good son. Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he really feels. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. Loki looks to Frigga, concerned. \nLOKI What hope is there for Thor? \nFRIGGA There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching. \nTHE EINHERJAR GUARD Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is baffled. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A. The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels before Loki, offers the spear to him. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) Make your father proud. Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the feel of it in his hand. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54. \n62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62 \nThor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates -- pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him. Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready. \nJANE Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away. \nJANE (CONT'D) Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud. \nDARCY And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry. Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of coffee. \nTHOR (re: coffee mug) This drink. I like it. \nDARCY (to Thor, re: coffee) Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town. Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it. \nTHOR \nTHOR Yes. He stops walking. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57. \nTHOR (CONT'D) If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know. \nJANE Everything? \nTHOR All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others. \nDARCY \"Myeu-muh?\"\u009d What's \"Myeu-muh?\"\u009d Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed, \nWHEN: \nSELVIG Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him. \nSELVIG (CONT'D) \n(TO JANE) Please don't do this. \nJANE You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater. \nSELVIG I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him. \nJANE He's promised us answers. \nSELVIG He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! \"Thor.\"\u009d \"Bifrost.\"\u009d \"Mjolnir.\"\u009d These are the stories I grew up with as a child! \nJANE I'd just be driving him out there, that's all. \nSELVIG It's dangerous. He's dangerous. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58. After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and Darcy. \nJANE I'm sorry. I can't take you. \nTHOR I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it. \nJANE That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them. \nTHOR Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved. \nSELVIG Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street. \n64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64 \nSif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne Room. \n65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65 \nTwo EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59. \nSIF Allfather, we must speak with you \nURGENTLY-- But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see -- \nLOKI Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them. \nVOLSTAGG What is this? \nLOKI My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard. \nFANDRAL Where is Odin? \nLOKI Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again. \nSIF We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices. \nLOKI She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your \"urgent\"\u009d matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly. \nSIF We would ask you to end Thor's banishment. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60. \nLOKI My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this. \nLOKI (CONT'D) All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard. \nFANDRAL Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki stares after them. \n66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66 \nJane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices, partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine from her lab. \nTHOR I need a horse. \nPET STORE CLERK Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just dogs, cats, birds. \nTHOR Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63. \nJANE You still want a lift? \n68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A \nIt's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book -- \"THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS\"\u009d -- to a group of kids. \nLIBRARIAN \n(READING) \"And though they're large, giants can be quiet. You have to listen carefully for the sound of their footsteps -- because they may be closer than you think.\"\u009d Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid pleasantly. \nLIBRARIAN (CONT'D) Joshua, come sit down. It's story time. The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading -- \n\"MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.\"\u009d He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on Scandinavian Mythology. It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group of VIKINGS kneel reverently. He eyes the illustration, pondering. \n69 OMITTED 69 \n70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70 \nJane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky. \n71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71 \nJane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A. \nJANE I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement. \nTHOR Many times. You're brave to do it. \nJANE They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose. \nTHOR But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm. \nJANE \"This Realm?\"\u009d Why do you talk like that? \nTHOR You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself. \nJANE Yeah. Just a little. \nTHOR Good strange or bad strange? \nJANE I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car. \nJANE (CONT'D) Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined. \nJANE (CONT'D) Who are you? Really? \nTHOR You'll see soon enough. \nJANE You promised me answers. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B. Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence. \nTHOR What you seek -- it's a bridge. \nJANE A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge? \nTHOR More like a rainbow bridge. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64. A beat. \nJANE God, I hope you're not crazy. \n71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A \nAs the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside, revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move closer, we see the glow comes from -- \nA MASSIVE SHIELD BASE Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the complex. Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the crater. Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work. Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir. \n72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72 \nJane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base. \nJANE That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her. \nTHOR You're going to need this. \nSITWELL (to the Techie) Get Coulson. Sitwell punches an alarm. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A. \n78 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 78 \nAs Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life. \n78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A \nA spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight. She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's recorded message. \nSELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE) You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently. \nJANE Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base. \nJANE (CONT'D) But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up. \n79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79 \nCoulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the lit up site uneasily. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67. \n80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80 \nA SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him. As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the ground. Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it. Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance. \n80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A \nThe ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches the crater lip. The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the tunnel, sending sparks everywhere. The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67A. \n81 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 81 \nJane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert. Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her. \n82 OMITTED 82 \n82A OMITTED 82A \n82B EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 82B \nCoulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash. He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour. \n82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C \nAs SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads inside. \n82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D \nThor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS round the corner. Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him. Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase. Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to tunnels to find a way towards it. \n82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E \nCoulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor. Coulson activates his radio. \nCOULSON I want eyes up high. With a gun. Now! \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67B. 82E.a INT. SHIELD TRAILER 82E.a A SNIPER, dressed in black tactical gear and high-tech NIGHTVISION EQUIPMENT, picks up a rifle, slings it over his shoulder and heads out. His name is BARTON. 82E.b EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 82E.b Lightning CRACKLES around the camp. 82E.c EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - CRANE SITE 82E.c Barton approaches a CRANE BUCKET. He leaps in, and the bucket lifts into the air. \n82F EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - TUNNEL 82F \nThrough the translucent plastic, we see Thor racing through the tubing. \n82G INT. TUNNEL 82G \nAs Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him, on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him. Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him into the approaching Agents, scattering them. Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents give chase. \n82H EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 82H \nJane looks down at the crater through binoculars, frustrated that she can't clearly see what's happening. \n82I EXT. CRATER 82I \nCoulson watches the commotion in the tunnel complex. He heads off for the command trailer to enter the tunnels. \n82J OMITTED 82J \n82K EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 82K \nThe crane basket ascends into the high winds as Barton readies his sniper rifle. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67C. \nCoulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the hammer doesn't move. Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm and lightning above him. Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them. But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy. Coulson looks on, disappointed. SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him. Coulson activates his radio. \nCOULSON Ground units, move in. Show's over. As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the rain -- a man broken, lost. From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive damage Thor's done to it during the melee. \n85 OMITTED 85 \n86 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 86 \nJane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad to worse. She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him. Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her. With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69A. \n87 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - NIGHT 87 \nHeimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers his head. \n88 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 88 \nJane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab. Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library, looks through it. \nJANE I can't just leave him there. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70. \nSELVIG Why not? \nJANE You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book. \nDARCY Hey! Myeu-muh! Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig knowingly. \nJANE \n(RE: BOOK) Where did you find this? Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it. \nSELVIG In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was. Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe. \nJANE Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities? \nSELVIG I was talking about science, not magic! \nJANE Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke. \nSELVIG Who wrote science fiction. \nJANE The precursor of science fact. \nSELVIG In some cases. \nJANE If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side. \n(MORE) \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70A. \nJANE (CONT'D) Advanced beings could have come through it before. \nSELVIG Jane... \nDARCY A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities. They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her, grateful for the support. \nJANE Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71. \nSELVIG Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time. \nDARCY I'll help you. Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no stopping her. He sighs. \n89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89 \nThor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed behind him. Coulson stands across from him. \nCOULSON It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful. \n(THEN) The men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals, and in my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Would you like to tell me where you received your training? Thor sits silently. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. What was it, South Africa? Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Certain groups pay well for a good mercenary. Especially HYDRA. Coulson waits for a response, but gets none. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Who are you? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72. \nTHOR Just a man. \nCOULSON That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security. Selvig shrugs. \nSELVIG Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A. On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New York pops up reading \"DR. DONALD BLAKE\"\u009d. The license photo is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her cellphone. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75. The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, \"SHIELD SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS.\"\u009d Coulson eyes the screen. After a beat, he turns back to Selvig. \nCOULSON It says here he's an M.D. \nSELVIG He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really. \n(THEN) If you would just release him to me, I promise to keep an eye on him. Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to an AGENT nearby. \nCOULSON Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here. The Techie looks to him, surprised. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) \n(TO SELVIG) Make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again. Selvig shakes his hand. \nSELVIG Thank you. \n92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A \nSelvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a seated Thor. \nSELVIG Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug. \nSELVIG (CONT'D) It's going to be all right, my friend. Come on, I'm taking you home. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A. He leads the bewildered Thor out the door. \n92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B \nAs Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand- written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes it from the pile and pockets it. \n92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C \nCoulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV record. A security warning over the image clearly reads \"SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA.\"\u009d He knows it's been a ruse all along. He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security Room, then follows them outside. \n93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93 \nCoulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig. \nCOULSON Just keep him away from the bars. \nSELVIG I will! \nTHOR \n(TO SELVIG) Where are we going? Selvig drops his cool demeanor. \nSELVIG To get a drink. Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE. \nCOULSON Follow them. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76. \n94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94 \nLoki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy surface of the planet. \n95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95 \nDarkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling. Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides. Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly. \nLAUFEY Tell me why I shouldn't kill you. \nLOKI I've come alone and unarmed. \nLAUFEY To what end? \nLOKI To make you another proposition. \nLAUFEY \n(REALIZING) So you're the one who let us into Asgard. \nLOKI You're welcome. \nLAUFEY My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground. \nLOKI You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins. \nLOKI (CONT'D) Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son. \nDRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) You were in the diner with that hot girl. Thor doesn't like where this is going. \nDRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me. He laughs. Thor is annoyed. \nTHOR I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A. \nDRUNK TOWNIE And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting. \nTHOR I will not fight him. \nDRUNK TOWNIE Then it'll be easy to kick your ass. Selvig stands, steps between the two men. \nSELVIG Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81. \nSELVIG (CONT'D) \n(TO THOR) Another drink? \n98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98 \nThor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically in time with the song. \nTHOR/SELVIG \n(SINGING) \"The mood is good, our hearts are full, there's magic in the air. / It's all because we're here tonight, and haven't got a care. / So raise a glass, and toast to life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed!\"\u009d Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap. Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a straight dead weight with a CLUNK. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to walk up the street towards Jane's trailer. \n99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99 \nThe small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it to find -- \nTHOR Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder. \nJANE Erik! \n(TO THOR) Is he all right? \nTHOR He's fine. Not injured at all. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A. As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway. Selvig GROANS. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Sorry, my friend. \nJANE What happened? \nTHOR We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82. \nJANE Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes. \nSELVIG I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder. \n(THEN) But you ought to be. Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him. Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around. \nTHOR These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her. \nJANE Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away. \nJANE (CONT'D) Can we go outside? \n100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100 \nThor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set up, a couple chairs, some blankets. \nJANE I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy. \n(THEN) I come up here a lot, now that I think about it. Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A. \nJANE (CONT'D) I'm glad you're safe. \nTHOR You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve. \nJANE I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her \nNOTEBOOK. \nJANE (CONT'D) I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful. \nTHOR It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86. \n108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108 \nOn a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link, turns to Cale. \nAGENT GARRETT They want an update. \nAGENT CALE Tell them he's eating eggs. \nAGENT GARRETT Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him. \nAGENT CALE \n(INTO COMM-LINK) Target is eating eggs, sir. We'll keep you posted. \n108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA \nAs the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his hand, gets an idea. \nTHOR \n(RE: MUG) May I have this? \nDARCY Sure. \nTHOR Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves. \n108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A \nIn front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day. (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch. She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him suspiciously. He offers her a MUG. \nTHOR To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A. She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him. \nISABEL Okay. Thank you. \nTHOR If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your \"coffee.\"\u009d \nISABEL Any time. He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs. \nISABEL (CONT'D) She could do worse. \n109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109 \nSif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's controls. He glares at them accusingly. \nVOLSTAGG Good Heimdall, less us explain-- \nHEIMDALL You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances. \nSIF Yes, but-- \nHEIMDALL Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say? \nVOLSTAGG So you'll help us? \nHEIMDALL I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory. The others exchange puzzled looks. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B. \nFANDRAL Complicated fellow, isn't he? \nVOLSTAGG Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something. \nSIF Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up. \n110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110 \nCoulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor. \nCOULSON What the hell was that? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87. \nTECHIE I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest. \nCOULSON Let's go take a look. \n111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111 \nAmidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them. \nVOLSTAGG He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints. \nJANE That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe? \nVOLSTAGG Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us! Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder. \nTHOR My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come. \nFANDRAL We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving. \nTHOR You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks. \nSIF Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation. \n119 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 119 \nA few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings. Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an Agent. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 92. \nCOULSON Get somebody from Linguistics out here. Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom. \n120 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 119 120 \n121 INT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 121 \nThor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the distance. \nDARCY Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground. \n122 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 122 \nFrom behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it moves towards them. \nSHIELD AGENT \n(RE: DESTROYER) Is that one of Stark's? \nCOULSON I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93. Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the Destroyer. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Hello! You're using unregistered weapons technology. Please identify yourself. We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up inside. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Incoming! As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return fire. \n123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123 \nTownspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as Thor turns to Jane. \nTHOR Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety. \nJANE What about you? \nTHOR I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor. \nTHOR (CONT'D) I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side. \nVOLSTAGG You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed! \nFANDRAL Or one of us, trying to protect you. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94. \nSIF The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us. Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the oncoming threat. \nTHOR \n(TO SIF) You're right. Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer. \n124 OMITTED 124 \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 95. \n125 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 125 \nLaufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant apparatus slows to a stop. \nLOKI Father. Welcome to Asgard. \n125A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 125A \nThe site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about. \n126 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 126 \n149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149 \nThor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting pools below. \n150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150 \nLoki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory. \n151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151 \nLoki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret spins, points. \n152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152 \nThor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He looks to where the Bifrost is aimed. \nTHOR Jotunheim... \n153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153 \nThor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory. He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway. \n154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154 \nThor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A. He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it. \nLOKI All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107. \nLOKI (CONT'D) You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart. \nTHOR Why have you done this? \nLOKI To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done. \nTHOR He won't! You can't kill an entire race! \nLOKI What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands. \nTHOR I've changed. \nLOKI So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir. \nLOKI (CONT'D) Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended. \nTHOR Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become? \nLOKI I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me! \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108. With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground. Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki. \nTHOR I will not fight you, brother. \nLOKI I am not your brother. I never was. \nTHOR Loki, this is madness... Loki grins. \nLOKI Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet. \nLOKI (CONT'D) What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right. \nLOKI (CONT'D) It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself. \n155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155 \nIt's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart. JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking ice. \n156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156 \nJane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around it. \nSELVIG Jane? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A. \nJANE Something's wrong. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109. \n157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157 \nThor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his hand. The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides towards the Bifrost. \n", "test1_input": "SELVIG Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her. \nJANE Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into: \n13 EXT. SPACE 13 \nEARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard. \nHEIMDALL (V.O.) Questions, they've always asked questions -- this race called man, on this planet they call earth. Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6. We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our galaxy. \nHEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) In ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity. We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil... We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense, sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching out into the black void of space. \nHEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in a universe of wonder, beauty, and terror that they barely comprehended. We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like a galaxy, slowly spinning before us. \nHEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) But for all their thirst for knowledge, they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams. Where did he come from? He came from us, the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen. He came from this -- the greatest Realm the universe has ever known. We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal what's on the other side: \nHEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D) He came... from Asgard! \n14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14 \nBeautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city, modern yet timeless. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A. \n15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15 \nThe palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled out before it. We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE \nSTANDS -- \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7. \nODIN ALLFATHER Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony, land at his side. \n16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16 \nOdin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror. \nODIN Do you think he's ready? \nFRIGGA He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence. \nODIN He'll need his father's wisdom. \nFRIGGA And his humility? Odin reacts. \nFRIGGA (CONT'D) Thor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons. \nODIN Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8. Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own. \nODIN (CONT'D) \n(QUIETLY) ...if we only had more time. \nFRIGGA For once, our son needs something we cannot provide. \nODIN I can fight it a little longer... \nFRIGGA No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you. He touches her cheek. \nODIN I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me? \nFRIGGA Always. \nODIN Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss. \n17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17 \nDirectly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the fire lit room. Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder. Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform. An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine. He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly below. \nTHOR Another! \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A. The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall. We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room. \nLOKI \n(TO THOR) Nervous, brother? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9. \nTHOR Have you ever known me to be nervous? \n", "test1_true": "THOR That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor. \nLOKI As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape. \nTHOR Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Now that was just a waste of good wine. \nLOKI Just a bit of fun. (to the Attendant) Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED \nHELMET. \nLOKI (CONT'D) (re: Thor's helmet) Nice feathers. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A. \nTHOR You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow? \nLOKI I was being sincere! \nTHOR You're incapable of sincerity. \nLOKI Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost. \nLOKI (CONT'D) I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10. Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his brother's shoulder. \nTHOR Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then: \nLOKI Give us a kiss. \nTHOR Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear. \nTHOR (CONT'D) How do I look? \nLOKI Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN. \nLOKI (CONT'D) It's time. \nTHOR You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look. \nTHOR (CONT'D) I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother. \n17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A \nVOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on dreamily. \nFANDRAL Thank you, love. (to the Maidens) \n(MORE) \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A. \nFANDRAL (CONT'D) Now who'd like to polish my sword for me? The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons on the table. \nSIF (to the weapons) I'll miss you. \n18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18 \nColorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement. Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the hall. They are: \nTHE WARRIORS THREE VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed. HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his side. With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor, a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled with. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11. \nVOLSTAGG I hope this goes quickly. I'm famished. \nFANDRAL \n(FEIGNED DISBELIEF) Noooo! \nVOLSTAGG Are you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be. \nFANDRAL (to the others) My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him. \nFANDRAL (CONT'D) Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one smile. Hogun stares at him grimly. \nFANDRAL (CONT'D) All right, half a smile. Look, forget the smile, just show some teeth. \nSIF Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge? \nFANDRAL Name it, Lady Sif. \n", "test1_id": 3069, "test2_input": "4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp. \nTHOR (CONT'D) (re: the fallen Brute) Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead. \nSIF (to Hogun, re: knife) I'm so glad I taught him how to do that! Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in. \nVOLSTAGG You may want to put some ice on that! The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) You may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying. Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) It's not too late for you to surrender. Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C. Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's ice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells to his comrades. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Don't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle. Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) (on his belly) Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him! \nSIF Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29. A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes. \nVOLSTAGG Hang on! Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs. \nHOGUN Watch the legs! \nVOLSTAGG \n(REALIZING) Right. Sorry. Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally freeing Hogun's feet. Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant. \nFANDRAL You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away. \nFANDRAL (CONT'D) Fair enough. Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half. \nFANDRAL (CONT'D) Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon. The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A. Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights them off. Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral. \nVOLSTAGG That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade. \nFANDRAL I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it? \nVOLSTAGG Just try not to bleed. \nFANDRAL How's the face? \nVOLSTAGG Flawless. Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30. Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts the Jotuns around him. \nTHOR Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet. \nLOKI That can't be good. \nVOLSTAGG Yes, it could! Might be an early spring! They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31. \nLOKI Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle. \nTHOR Then go! \nSIF There are too many of them! \nTHOR I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them. \nSIF Thor! But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting. \nVOLSTAGG Run! Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a \nMOMENT -- \nTHOR'S FIST Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32. But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground beneath them, exposing the black void of space below. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) What's Thor done? \nLOKI Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades. \n35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A \nThor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists. \n", "test2_true": "VOLSTAGG \n(TO LOKI) Actually, could you bring the mists back, please? Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead. The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes -- \nODIN ALLFATHER Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A. The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians. Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with Odin. Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's about to happen. Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of earshot of the others. \nODIN Laufey. End this. \nLAUFEY Your boy sought this out. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33. \nODIN You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm. \nLAUFEY We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined. \nODIN So be it. Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight. \nTHOR Now! We'll finish them together! \nODIN Silence! Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. Laufey stares up after them contemptuously. \n36 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36 \nHeimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him. Heimdall backs away. \nTHOR Why did you bring us back? \nODIN Do you realize what you've done? What you've started? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A. \nTHOR I was protecting my home. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34. \nODIN You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Odin turns to the others. \nODIN (CONT'D) \n(RE: FANDRAL) Get him to the healing room! Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the room. \nTHOR There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt. \nODIN That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning? \nTHOR While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls! \nODIN You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy! \nTHOR And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words. \nODIN A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready. Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34A. \nLOKI \nFATHER-- Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his tracks. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35. \nODIN Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son. \nODIN (CONT'D) You are unworthy of this Realm... Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest. \nODIN (CONT'D) ...unworthy of your title... He rips away Thor's cloak. \nODIN (CONT'D) ...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed. I hereby take from you your powers. Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand. \nODIN (CONT'D) In the name of my father... A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor, disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece. \nODIN (CONT'D) ...and of his father before... Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor, including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor. \nODIN (CONT'D) I cast you out! Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and disappears in the vortex. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A. Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something quietly. \nODIN (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERING) Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into the Bifrost. \n", "test2_id": 3070, "test3_input": "THOR But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99. Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK of breaking bones as Thor goes flying. Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy. The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street, a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back. \nSELVIG Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene -- \n133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133 \nOdin lies in the Odinsleep. A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100. \n134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134 \nThor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to unleash its fiery blast. \n135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135 \nInside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear, burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up. Clouds form in the sky above. Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air like a rocket. \n136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136 \nThe Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when -- \nKRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see -- \nJANE Oh. My. God. \nTHE MIGHTY THOR Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand -- the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir down onto the ground. \nKRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101. It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the Destroyer. Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS. \nCOULSON Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me. \n137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137 \nThor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS. Darcy turns to Volstagg. \nDARCY So, how can you speak our language? \nVOLSTAGG Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky. \nTHOR Heimdall! Open the Bifrost! \n138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138 \nHeimdall stands frozen. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102. \n139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139 \nThor looks to the others with concern. \nTHOR He would open it if he could. I fear the worst. \nVOLSTAGG Then we're trapped here forever. \nFANDRAL Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm. \nFANDRAL (CONT'D) Are all earth maidens as fair as you? Darcy enjoys the attention. \nDARCY No. Thor shouts back up to the sky. \nTHOR Heimdall! \n140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140 \nFrom inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him. Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice. Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the Observatory. \n141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141 \nThe Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD Agent's machine gun. \nVOLSTAGG Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy. \n", "test3_true": "FANDRAL Sorry, my love. These things happen. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103. He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to Coulson. \nTHOR Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally. \n(THEN) If you return the items you have stolen from Jane Foster. \nCOULSON Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) You'll get your equipment back. You're going to need it to continue your research... which, after today's events, SHIELD would like to fully sponsor. If that's all right with you. Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him again. \nTHOR Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost. \n142 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 142 \nThe Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall slumped over his controls. \nTHOR (to the others) Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104. Thor bolts out the door. \n143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143 \nOdin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga grabs a sword. A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard, cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily. Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter. Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed. \n144 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 144 \nThor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the palace. \n145 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 145 \nThe Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing the moment. He forms an ICE BLADE. \n146 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 146 \nThor races through the entrance to the palace. \n147 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 147 \nLaufey stands before the sleeping Odin. \nLAUFEY It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey. He raises his blade above Odin's body, when -- \nA BLAST OF ENERGY Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground, we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding Gungnir. \nLOKI And your death came by the son of Odin. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A. Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall, taking him out. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105. The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground, \nREVEALING -- \nFRIGGA Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She looks to Loki, takes him in her arms. \nLOKI (CONT'D) I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever! He looks to Odin. \nLOKI (CONT'D) And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams. \nFRIGGA Thor! She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand. \nLOKI Found its way back to you, did it? \nTHOR No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons. \nFRIGGA What? \nTHOR Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused. \nLOKI It must have been enforcing Father's last command. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106. \nTHOR You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been. \nLOKI \n(SMILES) It's good to have you back. \n(DEAD SERIOUS) Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to destroy Jotunheim. Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor. Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber walls, into... \n148 INT.

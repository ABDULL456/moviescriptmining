He reaches for the object, tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts, strains with all his might, with no luck. He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious object. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41. \nTOWNIE (CONT'D) Huh. \n45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45 \nThe distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light. Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment. A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall. Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed. He notices a monitor which displays a complex program entitled \"J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS\"\u009d. He looks proud. The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement. \nJANE Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me. \nSELVIG We might want to perform a spectral analysis. \nJANE \"We?\"\u009d \nSELVIG I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server. \nJANE You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO? \nSELVIG She was more than a friend. \nJANE Could you call in a favor? \nSELVIG You don't think this was just a magnetic storm? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A. \nJANE If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event. \nSELVIG Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows. \nJANE Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger. \nSELVIG How \"big\"\u009d are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars. \nJANE I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. \nDARCY A what? \nSELVIG I thought you were a science major. \nDARCY Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs. \nJANE She was the only applicant. \nSELVIG \n(TO DARCY) An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a \"theoretical\"\u009d connection between two different points of space-time. Darcy stares blankly. \nJANE \n(TO DARCY) A wormhole. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B. Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the monitor. \nJANE (CONT'D) Erik, look... \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42. Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen through the \"bubble\"\u009d in the clouds. \nJANE (CONT'D) What do you see here? \nSELVIG Stars. \nJANE Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement. \nJANE (CONT'D) This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye. \nDARCY Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed. \nSELVIG Is that...? \nJANE I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN. \n45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A \nAt the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin, looking out over Asgard. \n46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46 \nFrigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A. \nFRIGGA How could you have done this? \n", "test1_true": "FRIGGA But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son! \nODIN What would you have done? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43. \nFRIGGA I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty! \nODIN That is why I'm King. \n(THEN) I, too, grieve the loss of our son. But there are some things that even I cannot undo. \nFRIGGA You can bring him back. \nODIN No. His fate is in his own hands now. \n47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47 \nThor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no avail. \nTHOR It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint. \n47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A \nJane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy nearby. \nADMISSIONS NURSE I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients. \nJANE \n(THINKING FAST) But... I'm his wife. Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful. \nADMISSIONS NURSE I thought you said you didn't know him. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A. \nJANE I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway? \nADMISSIONS NURSE None of us, dear. He's in Room \n48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48 \nJane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44. They enter Thor's room. \n49 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 49 \nThey step inside to find Thor's bed empty. \n50 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 50 \nJane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV. \n51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51 \nJane starts the car, frustrated. \nJANE Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence. \nDARCY So now what? \nJANE We find him. \nSELVIG Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea. \nJANE I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice. \nDARCY Oo-kay. She pulls out her taser and a can of mace. \nSELVIG So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him? \nJANE However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when -- \nBAM! She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A. \n52 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 52 \nJane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet. \nJANE I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45. Thor looks up at the sky. \n", "test1_id": 3069, "test2_input": "Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the hammer doesn't move. Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm and lightning above him. Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them. But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy. Coulson looks on, disappointed. SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him. Coulson activates his radio. \nCOULSON Ground units, move in. Show's over. As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the rain -- a man broken, lost. From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive damage Thor's done to it during the melee. \n85 OMITTED 85 \n86 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 86 \nJane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad to worse. She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him. Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her. With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69A. \n87 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - NIGHT 87 \nHeimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers his head. \n88 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 88 \nJane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab. Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library, looks through it. \nJANE I can't just leave him there. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70. \nSELVIG Why not? \nJANE You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book. \nDARCY Hey! Myeu-muh! Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig knowingly. \nJANE \n(RE: BOOK) Where did you find this? Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it. \nSELVIG In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was. Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe. \nJANE Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities? \nSELVIG I was talking about science, not magic! \nJANE Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke. \nSELVIG Who wrote science fiction. \nJANE The precursor of science fact. \nSELVIG In some cases. \nJANE If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side. \n(MORE) \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70A. \nJANE (CONT'D) Advanced beings could have come through it before. \nSELVIG Jane... \nDARCY A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities. They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her, grateful for the support. \nJANE Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71. \nSELVIG Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time. \nDARCY I'll help you. Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no stopping her. He sighs. \n89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89 \nThor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed behind him. Coulson stands across from him. \nCOULSON It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful. \n(THEN) The men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals, and in my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Would you like to tell me where you received your training? Thor sits silently. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. What was it, South Africa? Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Certain groups pay well for a good mercenary. Especially HYDRA. Coulson waits for a response, but gets none. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Who are you? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72. \nTHOR Just a man. \n", "test2_true": "LOKI (O.S.) I thought he'd never leave. Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed in 21st century attire. \nTHOR Loki? What are you doing here? \nLOKI I had to see you. \nTHOR What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to \nFATHER-- \nLOKI Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned. \nTHOR What? \nLOKI Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly. \nLOKI (CONT'D) You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. \n(MORE) \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73. \nLOKI (CONT'D) \n(THEN) It was cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing you could never lift it. Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss. \nLOKI (CONT'D) The burden of the throne has fallen to me now. \nTHOR Can I come home? \nLOKI The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile. \nTHOR But couldn't we find a way to-- \nLOKI Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten. \nLOKI (CONT'D) This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry. \nTHOR No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here. \nLOKI Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki. \nLOKI (CONT'D) Fare well, brother. \nTHOR Good-bye. \nCOULSON Good-bye? I just got back. Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone. \nCOULSON (CONT'D) Now. Where did we leave off? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73A. \n90 EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 90 \nAgents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he do it? He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away. He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears. \n91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91 \nSitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson. \nSITWELL \n(RE: THOR) Sir... he's got a visitor. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74. \n92 INT. SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 92 \nCoulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from Erik Selvig. \nCOULSON \"Donald Blake?\"\u009d \nSELVIG Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team. \nCOULSON You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig. \nSELVIG Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest. \nCOULSON Uh-huh. You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity? \nSELVIG Certainly. The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name. \nSELVIG (CONT'D) You can understand how a man could go off like that. I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property... \n(THEN) ...is how he described it. \n", "test2_id": 3070, "test3_input": "4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86. \n108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108 \nOn a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link, turns to Cale. \nAGENT GARRETT They want an update. \nAGENT CALE Tell them he's eating eggs. \nAGENT GARRETT Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him. \nAGENT CALE \n(INTO COMM-LINK) Target is eating eggs, sir. We'll keep you posted. \n108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA \nAs the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his hand, gets an idea. \nTHOR \n(RE: MUG) May I have this? \nDARCY Sure. \nTHOR Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves. \n108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A \nIn front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day. (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch. She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him suspiciously. He offers her a MUG. \nTHOR To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A. She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him. \nISABEL Okay. Thank you. \nTHOR If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your \"coffee.\"\u009d \nISABEL Any time. He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs. \nISABEL (CONT'D) She could do worse. \n109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109 \nSif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's controls. He glares at them accusingly. \nVOLSTAGG Good Heimdall, less us explain-- \nHEIMDALL You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances. \nSIF Yes, but-- \nHEIMDALL Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say? \nVOLSTAGG So you'll help us? \nHEIMDALL I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory. The others exchange puzzled looks. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B. \nFANDRAL Complicated fellow, isn't he? \nVOLSTAGG Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something. \nSIF Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up. \n110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110 \nCoulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor. \nCOULSON What the hell was that? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87. \nTECHIE I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest. \nCOULSON Let's go take a look. \n111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111 \nAmidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them. \nVOLSTAGG He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints. \n", "test3_true": "SIF Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised. \nFANDRAL It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town. \n112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112 \nTownsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor. \n113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113 \nA BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car up with one hand. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88. Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. \nVOLSTAGG There you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head off. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you? \nSIF It has been a thousand years... \nVOLSTAGG Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Perhaps we should split up. \n114 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO - ROOFTOP - DAY 114 \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89. Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking down the street. \nAGENT GARRETT Is there a Renaissance Faire in town? \nAGENT CALE Call it in. But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes their heads together. They're out. \nVOLSTAGG Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite. He likes what he tastes. \nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D) Exquisite. \n115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115 \nLoki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath. \nEINHERJAR GUARD My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing. Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible. \n116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116 \nLoki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge. \nHEIMDALL Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard? \nLOKI You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King. \n(THEN) And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper. And you are no longer a citizen of Asgard. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90. \nHEIMDALL Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki. Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is -- \nTHE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS. The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching. From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried. Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him. \n117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117 \nLoki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns its head toward its King. \nLOKI Ensure my brother does not return. \n118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118 \nJane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and utensils away. The door opens. \nVOLSTAGG (O.S.) Found you! Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see -- \nSIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying dishes in mortal clothing. Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor. \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90A. \nTHOR My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder. \nSELVIG I don't believe it... \nDARCY Who are they? \n4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 91. \nVOLSTAGG Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte?

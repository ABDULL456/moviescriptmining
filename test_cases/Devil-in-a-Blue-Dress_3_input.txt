112   INT. STAIRWAY                                                  112 
He takes the steps two at a time, pulling the stocking down over his face as he reaches the top and bursts through the open door leading into 
113   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               113 
He charges through the raucous laughter of the half-full room right up to the bar. 
Joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face. 
EASY Come on, Joppy. Let's go! 
Joppy hesitates, recognizing the voice. 
EASY You heard me.  I'll blow your head off! 
And he cocks the hammer, causing Joppy to get a move on from behind the bar. 
Easy shoves him through the door, calling back to the startled crowd on his way out. 
113    CONTINUED:                                                     113 
EASY Don't follow me, goddammit! 
And he's gone. 
114    INT. JOPPY'S BAR - NIGHT                                       114 
Easy hides the piece in his coat pocket as he bum rushes Joppy to the car. 
JOPPY Easy, what the hell you-- 
EASY Shut up! 
And he shoves Joppy into the back seat, getting in next to him. 
EASY Drive this damn thing, Mouse! 
Mouse pulls off, around the corner, down the street into an alley. 
A115   INT. EASY'S CAR - IN THE ALLEY                                A115 
Mouse pulls to a stop. 
EASY (to Joppy) Albright's got the girl. He's gonna kill her. Where would he take her? And you better get it right. 
JOPPY Man, I don't-- 
EASY (screaming, pressing the gun) Don't fool with me, man! 
JOPPY There's a cabin out in Malibu on Route 9... 
EASY Make a right, Mouse! 
B115   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                             B115 
The car roars down the alley and turns right onto the street. 
115    INT. CAR - INDUSTRIAL STREET - NIGHT                           115 
EASY (to Joppy) You sure 'bout this place? 
JOPPY I guess so. He's done this kinda thing out there before. 
MOUSE Easy, what's done got into you? Thought y'all was friends. 
EASY He killed Dupree's girlfriend. 
MOUSE You lyin'. 
EASY Naw. 
MOUSE Son-of-a-bitch! 
And he pulls out his pistol, aiming it back over the seat at Joppy as he drives. KABLAAM! The bullet slams through the rear window just to the side of Joppy's head. 
EASY Mouse!   What're you doin'? 
KABLAAM! This one digs out a chunk of upholstery between Joppy and Easy. 
EASY Hey!   Watch out! 
The car screeches to a halt and Mouse tries to aim again. But Easy struggles with Mouse's gun hand still holding a pistol on Joppy. 
EASY Mouse, we need him to lead the way! 
KABLAAM!   This one rips through the roof. 
Joppy's yelling, afraid that Easy's gun will go off. 
115   CONTINUED:                                                    115 
EASY Mouse, the girl offered me seven thousand dollars for the pictures.

And sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as- 
The red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the atmospheric levels reaching green. 
Ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the figure, who straps into the seat next to her. He unlocks the ring around his collar and- 
TAKES OFF HIS HELMET. 
COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC escapes into the cabin. 
MATT Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped. 
The figure glances around. 
MATT (CONT'D) Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light? 
He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms: 
Matt. 
Ryan stares, mouth agape. 
RYAN How did you? 
MATT Trust me, it's a hell of a story. RYAN But how did you? 
He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent. 
MATT That's better. 
RYAN How? 
Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how- 
MATT I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka? 
RYAN You never told me where. 
Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the cap... 
MATT Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje. 
...and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head. 
RYAN No. 
He studies her. 
MATT No? Right, let's get out of here. 
He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen. 
MATT (CONT'D) We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive. 
RYAN We can't. 
MATT Course we can. RYAN There's no fuel. I tried everything. 
MATT Well, there's always something we can do. 
RYAN I tried everything. 
MATT Did you try the soft landing jets? 
RYAN They're for landing so. 
MATT Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training? 
RYAN I never got to land the simulator, I told you. 
MATT But you know about it. 
RYAN And I crashed it every time. 
Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off. 
MATT Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody. 
Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off. 
MATT (CONT'D) There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living? 
When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan. MATT (CONT'D) Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan.

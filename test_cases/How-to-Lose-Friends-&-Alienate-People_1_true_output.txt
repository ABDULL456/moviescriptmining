5 MOMENTS LATER 5 Sidney and the Pig are being "escorted" away from the red carpet by the Security. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) The Looky-Loos dream is that one day they will somehow get to mingle with the stars. But the Industry can't allow any mingling. Stars have to be kept away from civilians, have to be quarantined, so they don't become normal. Like us. They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney stares after her, longingly. 
6 INT. SANDERSON HOTEL - EVENING 6 
TRACKING through the doors and into the lobby of the exclusive hotel. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) But after the awards come the parties - the Miramax Party, the London Records Party and, best of all - the Sharps Magazine Party, so exclusive that there are no pass-alongs, no plus-ones, no press. We find Sidney checking in at the desk. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (to Receptionist, 
HORRIFIED) How much? I only want to stay for one night! 
7 INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 7 
Sidney stands in the rising elevator, suit bag in his hand, holdall at his feet. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) 
This is where the movie stars can finally relax, secure in the knowledge they are among their own kind. We see the PIG'S SNOUT poking out of the zip of the holdall. 
8 INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 8 
Sidney turns from the mirror to face us. He is wearing a WAITER'S UNIFORM of white shirt, waistcoat, and bow tie. He is also wearing a WIG and FALSE MOUSTACHE. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) And that is when I strike. He picks up a tray of canapés from the bed and looks down to where the Pig watches him from the floor. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I want you in bed by ten. And no porn. He tosses the pig one of the canapés. 
9 INT. HOTEL - EVENING 9 
Sidney, tray in hand, peers around the corner to the entrance to the hotel's roofed COURTYARD. The Older PR Woman we saw earlier stands at the door, a formidable presence. As we watch she greets an approaching CELEBRITY gushingly. Seizing his chance Sidney darts towards the door and, tray held aloft to cover his face, slips through into the courtyard beyond. 
10 INT. HOTEL COURTYARD - SHARPS MAGAZINE PARTY - MOMENTS 10 
LATER ...as Sidney emerges from the washrooms, now dressed only in the white shirt and black trousers. He scoops up a passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned skin, diamonds, beautiful dresses, beautiful suits, champagne. He stands surveying the crowd of A-list celebrities in front of him, dazed. 
SIDNEY 
(TO HIMSELF) You can do this. You belong here. You're a star. You're a big, bright shining star... 
11 INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 11 
The room is trashed - furniture over-turned, mini-bar open and broken bottles all over the floor. A weird squealing which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.) Hello? Sir? The squealing stops. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER (CONT'D) Is everything alright? The door opens and the Assistant Manager walks in and stands staring around him in horror. Behind him the pig emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door, across the corridor and straight into the open lift... 
12 INT. SHARPS PARTY - EVENING 12 
Sidney is talking to a very famous and very drunk Hollywood 
ACTRESS. 
SIDNEY No, when I'm in L.A. I stay at the Sunset Marquis, when I'm here I always stay at the Sanderson. It's, you know, I don't feel at home these days unless I'm in a hotel. 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS So what do you do? 
SIDNEY Oh, I'm a writer. Movie writer. 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS Oh great. 
SIDNEY Yeah. Got one in pre-production now. You know it's really weird running into you like this because just the other day I was telling the producer I thought you'd be perfect for the lead. She starts to laugh. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) No, seriously, you would, because, you know, you have this mixture of intelligence and beauty and fragility that we're looking for and, uh... 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 
(SMILING) What's the film?

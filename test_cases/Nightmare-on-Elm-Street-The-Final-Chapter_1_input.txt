Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, battered and, unfortunately, alive.  He climbs up to the edge of the crater.  He looks back a the remnants of his home. 
Then something starts to happen. 
Something his growing from the crater - spreading out.  It's not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.  Even though it's night, this darkness is darker.  It creeps out from the hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.  What it covers doesn't disappear.  It becomes GLOOMY.  The shroud is getting bigger. 
And it's getting faster.  Jacob runs. 
WITH JACOB - RUNNING 
He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic. He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its gloominess covering houses.  Then whole blocks. 
Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW. 
AT THE STREET CORNER 
Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.  He stops and yells at her. 
JACOB Get the hell out of here!  It's coming! 
WOMAN What's coming? 
Jacob points down the street.  The shroud is swooping down the road - browning out street lights in its wake.  And the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.  Jacob screams at her. 
JACOB Don't you see it? 
WOMAN See what? 
And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.  The Woman is totally oblivious to the danger.  Jacob shakes his head -- stumbles away. 
The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER. She sighs. 
And begins to MUTATE.  Her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which she DOESN'T seem to notice. 
She just shrugs her twisted shoulders. 
WOMAN (cont'd) Kids...watcha gonna do? 
She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and two heads. 
BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING 
Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters. 
A VOICE booms out from nowhere. 
FREDDY (O.S.) Jacob!  You're too old to run away from home! 
Jacob covers his ears and races out of town. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.  He rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.  most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom. 
Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its source: 
HIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN 
The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over almost all of it now.  The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD. POPULATION... 
And the numbers after the word "population" are changing. They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then "tens", then... 
CLINK - the count stops at "1".  Springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud.  There is a pause. 
CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.  It vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the highway. 
BACK ON THE STREET 
Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.  The tar in front of Jacob becomes molten.  It bubbles and pops. 
Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt. 
It's a hat. 
The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.  Four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side.  A head is up now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - hiding the face.  The body beneath the head ascends.  The veil of asphalt parts: 
It's FREDDY KRUEGER.  Jacob SCREAMS. 
Freddy LAUGHS.  He shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of Springwood.  A look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face. 
FREDDY Payback time...

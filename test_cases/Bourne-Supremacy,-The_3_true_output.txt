Whatever Nevins is being told, it's concerning.    BOURNE watching him. Knows exactly what this is. 
CLOSE ON NEVINS as he steps away, listening intently. His hand just starting to move toward his shoulder holster. 
NEVINS (cont'd) Okay, I'll call you right back. 
NEVINS flips shut his phone.   He reaches for his gun, even as he turns, and -- 
BOURNE is right there in his face. WHUMP! Momentum and gravity reaching mutual agreement as NEVINS hits the deck. 
CARABINIERI barely clears his holster before -- CHOP -- CHOP -- BOURNE has him down in a heap. 
BOURNE is back, silent and effective. 
Fin   ding NEVIN   S cellpho   ne, BOURNE reac   hes into h   is bag. He hol   ds the pho   ne next t   o a larger, dia   gnostic MO   BILE UNIT -- the    "confirm"    light bl   inks -- Nevins'    phone has    been clo   ned. BOUR    NE puts t   he phone back i   n NEVINS c   oat, takes his    gun and C   ARABINIER   I'S gun and rad   io and put   s them in his    duffle.     We're sta   rting to realiz   e there's    a plan at wor   k here. 
FINALLY 
BOURNE -- exits the door, wedging a desk under the handle so it cannot be opened from the inside and calmly walks away like nothing ever happened -- 
124       EXT. NAPLES FERRY BUILDING -- NIGHT                                  124 
And now we see the old BOURNE, in his long black coat, purposely striding out of the building. He pauses long enough for the security camera to get a good look at him. 
THE RONIN returns. 
125       EXT. NAPLES FERRY PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               125 
BOURNE crosses the street and approaches a man putting his suitcase in the trunk of a green Peugeot. BOURNE reaches into his bag, pulls out some cash. 
126       DELETED                                                              126     * 
127       INT. FERRY/SECURITY HOLDING ROOM -- NIGHT NEVINS stirring, the CARABINIERI still out. A phone starts to RING. Nevins' phone. Finally sitting up, he answers. 
NEVINS Hello? 
128-129   DELETED                                                          128-129

NEVINS/PHONE Who's this? 
PAMELA/PHONE Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?                     * 
A130   INT. FERRY/SECURITY HOLDING ROOM -- NIGHT                     A130 
Nevins barely knows where he is. 
131    EXT. NAPLES STREET -- NIGHT                                    131 
BOURNE sits in the dark car. Headphones. A nest of cool gadgetry -- on the passenger seat. Listening in --                    * recording -- 
He writes: Pamela Landy -- circles it. 
NEVINS/PHONE I think... I think he got away.                             * 
PAMELA looks at the faces waiting around the table.          Shakes her head no...                                                        * 
PAMELA                                          * Have you locked down the area?                              * 
NEVINS/PHONE Ah, we're in Italy. They don't exactly                      * "lock down" real quick... 
INTERCUT -- BOURNE -- NEVINS -- PAMELA -- PAMELA/PHONE How long have you worked for the agency? 
NEVINS/PHONE Me?    Four years. 
PAMELA/PHONE If    you ever    want to make it    to five, you   're gonna    listen to me r   eal close. Jas   on Bourne    is armed and e   xtremely dan   gerous.

We'   re TOTALLY ON BOURNE at this point -- sitting there in the    dark car, struggling to make sense of this -- what the fuc   k is she talking about? -- Berlin? -- He writes it, cir   cles it. 
PAMELA/PHONE (CONT'D) I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??                                               *

BOURNE already turning the key in the ignition -- THE PEUGEOT ROARING TO LIFE, as he writes the number.                         * 
Dropping the car into gear, BOURNE pulls briskly away from the curb. 
A131   INT. C.I.A. SITUATION ROOM -- DAY                                  A131 
PAMELA finishes, hangs up.

{"test1_input": "(CONTINUED) 16 CONTINUED: 16 \nThe armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more respect now. \n17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17 \nThere's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is still playing. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Three thirteen left on the clock. Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the Clippers by one... \nThe passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car approaching in the opposite direction. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans. This game really is too close to call... \nThe two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala headed South on Broadway and Pico...Couldn't get a look at her license plates...Appears to be only one occupant... \nIn the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the police dispatch to respond. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...1 David 16...why don't you check her out... \nAs soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next street. \n18 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ SIDESTREET OFF BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 18 \nDriver guns around the block now, building up speed. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...This is 1 David 16...We lost the suspect somewhere between Broadway and Grand...Possible evasive action...Request airship and additional units... \n19 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ WEST PICO BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 19 \nDriver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...1 David 11...suspect headed West on Pico... \nDriver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position. \nDriver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around him as he guns down Figueroa. \nPOLICE SCANNER All units...pursuit in progress...silver Impala...Headed North on Figueroa... \nEven now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the basketball game. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY Thornton pulls up from behind the arc, misses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to play... \nDriver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the Staples Centre. \n20 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE/ PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 20 \nThe terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a ticket and roars into the parking lot. \n21 INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 21 \nThe Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls into a free parking space. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Thirty seconds remaining and all the Knicks have to do is run out the clock... \nDriver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic. \n(CONTINUED) 21 CONTINUED: 21 \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Gordon back to Davis...Davis for three...This is unbelievable!... \nThe jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed for most of the game, the Clippers have shown incredible resilience... \nDriver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the Impala himself and heads towards another car. \n22 EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 22 \nOutside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making his getaway. \n", "test1_true": "23 EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 23 \nDriver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs, reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set. \nDriver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR O/S I need you guys to sign this contract... \nDriver takes the form along with all the other stuntmen and signs it without a glance. \n24 EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 24 \nShannon is discussing a car stunt with another AD, using two toy cars on the hood of a cop car to demonstrate the danger. \n(CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 \nSHANNON ...This is a whole new thing. He taps the fender any faster than fifty not only will she roll, she'll roll all the way to Baja. \nDriver heads off, disinterested in the negotiations. \nSHANNON A high risk stunt like that's worth at least a thousand five. \nAD They won't go higher than a thousand. \nSHANNON Done. \nFor all his charm we sense something of the hustler about Shannon. \n25 EXT. CRAFT TABLE/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 25 \nDriver approaches a buffet table laid out with food. He's about to help himself when JACK, the caterer, stops him. \nJACK Sorry, that's for the director... \n26 INT/ EXT. POLICE CAR/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO - DAY. 26 \nDriver sits at the wheel of the Black-and-White while a STUNT SUPERVISOR checks his harness. Shannon leans into the window with a smile. \nSHANNON I managed to get them up to five hundred. \nDriver doesn't seem to care, focussed on the job. \n2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S Camera ready, sound ready... \nShannon joins the rest of the crew, looking on. \n2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S ...ACTION!... \nDriver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the main road. \nIn his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on cue, bearing down on him. \n(CONTINUED) 26 CONTINUED: 26 \nDriver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black Charger keeps coming at speed. \nDriver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection. \nThe Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel. \nDriver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips end over end. \nUp ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop. \n2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S ...And CUT!... \nSome clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot lists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and helping him out of his battered Black-and-White. \nSHANNON Nice work, officer... \nDriver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered windscreen. \n", "test1_id": 3123, "test2_input": "77 EXT. PARKING LOT/ EAST LA - DAY. 77 \nThe midday sun beats down on a maze of cars. Driver strolls past rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model Mustang. \n78 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 78 \nDriver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife. \nSTANDARD ...I was such a jerk the first time we met. We're at this party and I see the most beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'... (HE LAUGHS) It took me like a minute to get it... \n(CONTINUED) 78 CONTINUED: 78 \nIrene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager to please his dad. \nSTANDARD You don't get it either do you, Benicio? Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains. \nHe ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver. \nIRENE Would you like some more chicken? \nDRIVER Thanks... \nTheir eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass and tuck into his food. \nSTANDARD Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken. Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant together once I raise the money. That's why she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure out how it's done. She's got more ambition than anyone I know, more smarts too... (He raises his glass) We're gonna drive all those fucking Mexicans out of business - \nIRENE STANDARD - \nSTANDARD Excuse my language, Benicio... \nIRENE (Changing the subject) How's the movie going?... \nDRIVER Fine... \nIrene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink. \nIRENE Don't you think that's enough? \nSTANDARD Come on, we're celebrating. I've got my family around me and our new friend... \n(CONTINUED) 78 CONTINUED: (2) 78 \nHe raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on someone his wife clearly admires. \nIRENE Are you working on anything else? \nSTANDARD Stop asking the poor guy all these QUESTIONS - \nIRENE (LOSING PATIENCE) Then why don't you go ahead and talk for all of us. \nSTANDARD All right, I will. This time next week I'm gonna take you and Benicio away with me... \nIrene stops and looks at him in surprise. \nSTANDARD Where you wanna go, Benicio?... \nHis quiet confidence concerns her even more. \nBENICIO Disneyland. \nSTANDARD Forget Disneyland. I'm gonna take you and your mother away from this bullshit city - \nIRENE Benicio, it's time for bed - \nSTANDARD Your papa's got it all figured out - \nIRENE Benicio, you heard me - \nSTANDARD It's okay. I'll take him... \nStandard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son. Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver. \nIRENE I'm sorry. \n", "test2_true": "DRIVER Don't worry... \nShe hesitates, torn, then looks up at him again, needing to confide in someone. \nIRENE Every time he makes that speech about taking me and Benicio away from here he's in some kind of trouble... \nDriver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates. \n79 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 79 \nDriver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car. \n80 INT. CAR/ UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 80 \nDriver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He stares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick, finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual. \n81 EXT. PAWN SHOP/ TARAZANA/ LA - DAY. 81 \nThe pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside, another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling. Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense. \nDRIVER You don't have to do this. \nSTANDARD (Forcing a smile) What are you talking about? \nHe tries to make light of it but doesn't sound convincing. Out of his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the pawn shop and looks even more nervous now. \nSTANDARD Irene and Benicio think the world of you, you know that, right?... \nDriver glances at him, sensing his anxiety. \nSTANDARD Say something happens to me, you think you could find a way to take care of them?... \nStandard's still staring ahead, but Driver can sense his fear. \n(CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: 81 \nDRIVER It's not too late... \nStandard considers a moment, then shakes his head. \nSTANDARD I gotta do this for them... \nHe forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens the door. \nDRIVER You got five minutes... \nSTANDARD (GRINNING) I'll see you in four... \nDriver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away. \nHe casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of overlooking buildings. \nThe white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop windows, hiding everything inside. \nThe police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting. \nHe pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something. Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out. For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers and racing tires. \nDriver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment. \nBut there's no sign of them. \nThe seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene. \nSuddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop, Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand. \n(CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: (2) 81 \nHe smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on his face as he spins around. \nA GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The force of the bullets sends Standard flying. \n", "test2_id": 3124, "test3_input": "116 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 116 \nTwo big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask. He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria. \n117 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 117 \nSeveral of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them recognize him. \nNINO'S GUY We're closed... \nDriver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out again. \n118 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - NIGHT. 118 \nNino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the white Lincolns. \nNINO (To one of his men) I'm going to pick up my wife.

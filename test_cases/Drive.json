{"train": "DRIVE \nWritten by \nHossein Amini \nBased on the novel by \nJames Sallis \n1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1 \nWe're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over the image we hear a voice talking on a phone. \nDRIVER O/S ...hundred thousand streets in this city, you don't need to know the route. You give me a time and place, I give you a five minute window. Those five minutes I'm yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute either side you're on your own... \nAs the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO: \n2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2 \nA map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different routes marked in pencil. The voice continues - \nDRIVER O/S ...One last thing. You won't be able to reach me at this number again... \nDRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks. \n3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3 \nDriver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle \n4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4 \nThe Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes. Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives carefully, letting other cars overtake. \n5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5 \nDriver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment block. \n6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6 \nClutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes meet briefly, before Driver walks on. \n7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7 \nDriver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean, sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again. \n8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8 \nDriver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse - vintage cars. \n9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9 \nSHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver follows him past rows of vintage cars. \nSHANNON ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside. You get any sleep? \nDRIVER Not this week. \nAs Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them. \nSHANNON I can offer you some Halcyon. \nDRIVER Won't work. \nThey head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they arrive at a plain looking Impala. \nSHANNON There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular car in the state of California... \nDriver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds out his hand for the keys. \n10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10 \nThe basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter. Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's 9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street. \n(CONTINUED) 16 CONTINUED: 16 \nThe armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more respect now. \n17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17 \nThere's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is still playing. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Three thirteen left on the clock. Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the Clippers by one... \nThe passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car approaching in the opposite direction. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans. This game really is too close to call... \nThe two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala headed South on Broadway and Pico...Couldn't get a look at her license plates...Appears to be only one occupant... \nIn the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the police dispatch to respond. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...1 David 16...why don't you check her out... \nAs soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next street. \n18 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ SIDESTREET OFF BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 18 \nDriver guns around the block now, building up speed. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...This is 1 David 16...We lost the suspect somewhere between Broadway and Grand...Possible evasive action...Request airship and additional units... \n19 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ WEST PICO BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 19 \nDriver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase. \nPOLICE SCANNER ...1 David 11...suspect headed West on Pico... \nDriver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position. \nDriver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around him as he guns down Figueroa. \nPOLICE SCANNER All units...pursuit in progress...silver Impala...Headed North on Figueroa... \nEven now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the basketball game. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY Thornton pulls up from behind the arc, misses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to play... \nDriver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the Staples Centre. \n20 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE/ PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 20 \nThe terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a ticket and roars into the parking lot. \n21 INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 21 \nThe Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls into a free parking space. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Thirty seconds remaining and all the Knicks have to do is run out the clock... \nDriver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic. \n(CONTINUED) 21 CONTINUED: 21 \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...Gordon back to Davis...Davis for three...This is unbelievable!... \nThe jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places. \nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY ...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed for most of the game, the Clippers have shown incredible resilience... \nDriver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the Impala himself and heads towards another car. \n22 EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 22 \nOutside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making his getaway. \n27 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - DAY. 27 \nA New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE. \nWAITER Here you go, Mr. Rose. (Taking out the white boxes) Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor shrimp and Peking duck. \nBERNIE ROSE Did they remember the chop sticks? \nWAITER Doesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and get the guy. \nFrom the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their conversation. \n(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: 27 \nBERNIE ROSE ...You run a perfectly good business. Why would you want to change now? \nSHANNON You know how much my business made last year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to build a car and a couple of seconds for these jerks to write it off on a stunt that doesn't even make it into the movie. \nBernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon. \nBERNIE ROSE How much do you need? \nSHANNON Let me talk you through it first. \nBERNIE ROSE That sounds like a lot. \nSHANNON Doesn't have to be. The big money teams burn through three, four million a year but that's `cause they're using half a dozen test drivers and a stable of cars. \nBERNIE ROSE I don't know anything about car racing but I assume there's a reason for that? \nSHANNON Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need is a hard-used stock car. We start off with the small-town action then work our way up. There's close to two thousand events out there and once we make the Show we're talking millions. \nBERNIE ROSE `Millions'? \nSHANNON There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship. TV deals. We'll even name the team after you. \nBernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks. \nBERNIE ROSE Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any of this? \n(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: (2) 27 \nSHANNON No, thanks. \nBernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues. \nBERNIE ROSE You still haven't given me a number? \nShannon hesitates but only for a second. \nSHANNON Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars. \nBernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve. \nSHANNON Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was sure about this. \nBERNIE ROSE Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What have you got these big money teams don't have? \nSHANNON I got a driver. \nBERNIE ROSE And they got half a dozen Drivers you told me. \nSHANNON Not like this one. \nHe stares at his friend with quiet conviction. \nSHANNON I been working with this guy a long time - I've never seen anything like it. I had the money I'd back him myself... \nBernie Rose considers him quietly. \nBERNIE ROSE But you don't have the money. \nSHANNON Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell my Bullit car the other day just to pay the gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this kid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't do. \nSTOCK CAR OWNER Told you she was a beauty... \nSHANNON (Playing hard to get) Maybe where you come from... \nBernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop. \n33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33 \nDriver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS, and Bernie Rose. \nSHANNON Looks a little long in the tooth to me. Think we should take her home?... \nDriver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now. \nSHANNON Bernie, this is the driver I been telling you about... \nOne look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes. \nSHANNON Bernie's thinking of investing in our race team... \nThe old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze. \nDRIVER My hands are a little dirty. \nBERNIE ROSE Don't worry. So are mine... \n(CONTINUED) 33 CONTINUED: 33 \nHe gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up. Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch. \nSTOCK CAR OWNER Couldn't see much wrong with that. You beat the fastest lap by more than half a second. \nDRIVER You might wanna take a look at the suspension before we go again. (Turning back to Bernie) Nice to meet you... \nBernie's still studying him. \nBERNIE ROSE You too... \nTheir eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's getting interested. \nSHANNON You gonna give me the four? \nBERNIE ROSE I'll give you three for seventy percent... \n34 INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 34 \nTinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself. \n35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35 \nDriver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park. Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine. She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix. Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful. \n(CONTINUED) 35 CONTINUED: 35 \nDriver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help. \nIrene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now. \n35a INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 35a \nDriver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator, Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags. \n36 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 36 \nDriver carries Irene's grocery bags into the kitchen for her. \nDRIVER Where do you want me to put them? \nIRENE Just over there. Thanks... \nDriver places the bags on the kitchen counter. \nIRENE Would you like something to drink? \nDRIVER Reseda Boulevard. \nIRENE You should tell Benicio you're a stunt guy. \nDRIVER He interested in that kind of stuff? \nIRENE Aren't all little boys? \nShe smiles softly and he realizes she's teasing him. \nBENICIO O/S Mama, I don't like this... \nIrene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver watches her quietly, then drains his glass of water. \nIRENE Would you like another glass? \nDRIVER I should get going... \nHe catches the disappointment in her eyes, but she covers it with another good humored smile. \n(CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: (3) 37 \nIRENE Well, thank you for your help. \nDRIVER Thank you for the drink... \nShe takes his empty glass and walks him to the door. \n38 EXT/INT. STREET/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 38 \nPassing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball. \nDriver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing gently on a cup of coffee. \n39 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 39 \nThe reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards. \n40 EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING. 40 \nIt's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly. Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass. \n41 EXT/ INT. BUFFALO BAR AND GRILL/ LA - MORNING. 41 \nJukebox music plays in the bar and grill. Driver sits on his own, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs. \nBEARDED REDNECK OFFSCREEN Mind if I cut in?... \nDriver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat opposite him. \nBEARDED REDNECK You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last year. You drove me and my brother back from Palm Springs... \n(CONTINUED) 41 CONTINUED: 41 \nDriver stares into the redneck's coked-up eyes, then looks back down at his food. \nBEARDED REDNECK Next run we hired another wheelman - I spent six months in jail, my brother got himself killed... (He grins through yellowing teeth) He wasn't much, mind you, just family... \nDriver doesn't seem to hear him. \nBEARDED REDNECK Thing is - \nDRIVER I'm not interested... \nDriver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a moment, then decides against it, standing up. \nBEARDED REDNECK Well, it's good to see you again... \nDriver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist. \n42 EXT. FORECOURT/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 42 \nThe loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the second hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine. \nDriver and Benicio sit in the Chevelle, driving in silence. \nDRIVER Your mom said you like movies? \nBENICIO Sometimes. \nDRIVER Ever see the Terminator? \nBENICIO No. \nDRIVER Grease? \nBenicio shakes his head. \nDRIVER Wanna see where it was shot? \n45 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 45 \nShannon's got his tool kit out, examining the Olds. Irene looks at the forecourt but there's no sign of Driver and her son. \n(CONTINUED) 45 CONTINUED: 45 \nIRENE How long has he been working for you? \nSHANNON Don't worry, ma'am, your son'll be fine. \nIRENE I didn't mean it like that... \nShannon smiles to himself, sensing her interest in Driver. \nSHANNON We been together about five years now. He showed up out of the blue one day, no references or nothin', asking me for a job. I offered him half the wages I normally pay and he didn't even blink. Been exploiting him ever since... (HE GRINS) Only thing he knows is cars... \n46 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA RIVER - DAY. 46 \nThe car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and shredded tires, picking up speed all the time. \n47 EXT. LA RIVER - DAY. 47 \nDriver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal which looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft rock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree. \n48 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE - NIGHT. 48 \nBenicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his eyes fixed on the road. \n49 INT. BENICIO'S BEDROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.49 \nCradling the sleeping Benicio in his arms Driver lays him down on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his pyjamas, careful not to wake him. Driver slips out of the room, uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son. \n50 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 50 \nIrene walks out of the bedroom, smiling at Driver gratefully. \nIRENE Thank you for today. He had a great time... \n(CONTINUED) 50 CONTINUED: 50 \nDRIVER I'm glad... \nHe stares back at her in the silence, both of them looking a little uncertain. \nIRENE I'm sorry if I put you on the spot, you know, just showing up like that... \nDRIVER Don't worry... \nTheir eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds him back. Instead he just offers his help. \nDRIVER You need a ride anywhere over the weekend I'm not doing much... \n50a INT. DENTISTS/ NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY. 50a \nBenicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax. \n51 EXT. DENTISTS/ NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY. 51 \nIRENE'S FRIEND It's 8:30. Teeth. Pyjamas. TV off. \nBENICIO It's not the TV. It's a DVD... \nDriver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing a smile but still looking distracted. \n55 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 55 \nIrene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park. \n(CONTINUED) 55 CONTINUED: 55 \nIRENE I've never come this way before... \nDRIVER It's a short cut... \nIRENE The park looks pretty at night... \nShe looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away again. \nDRIVER You okay?... \nIrene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the window. \nIRENE That was my husband's lawyer on the phone. He's getting an early release... \nShe tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even though it hits him like a sledgehammer. \nDRIVER That's great... \nIRENE I'm happy for Benicio... \nDriver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say anything, driving in silence. \nUp ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a stop. \nInside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light, something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness. \nShe hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his. \nThe gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her hand, as if nothing's happened. \nOutside the lights change to green. \n56 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 56 \nThe sound of laughter. A sign over the door says, Welcome home Dad. Inside the apartment there's a small party going on. \n(CONTINUED) 56 CONTINUED: 56 \nIrene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests. \nSTANDARD ...I'm touched and grateful that you're all here today -- even though I know it's probably for the food not me... \nHis self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable. \nSTANDARD ...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA in catering from Chino Business School... (MORE LAUGHTER) Irene, Benicio and I are finally going to get our lives back together... \nHe raises his glass to her. \nSTANDARD I'd like to thank my wife for being the smartest, most beautiful, most patient and loyal woman I know... \nMore applause. Irene stares back at Standard's handsome face, feeling even more uncomfortable. \n57 INT. DRIVER'S BEDROOM/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 57 \nDriver lies on his bed, gazing up at the ceiling, listening to the sound of the party echoing down the corridor. \n58 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 58 \nIt's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music. \nSTANDARD I'm sorry, I can't hear you... \nSTANDARD Must be pretty good? \nDRIVER I get by. \nSTANDARD Not like a nine to five gig, huh?... \n(CONTINUED) 60 CONTINUED: (2) 60 \nHe's still smiling but there's a slight edge to his voice. Irene looks uncomfortable. \nIRENE You want me to take that? \nSTANDARD No, we got it. \nHis eyes are still fixed on Driver. \nSTANDARD You want to come in, join us for a drink? \nDRIVER I've got some things to do. \nSTANDARD At this hour of night? \nIRENE Standard, he's busy... \nStandard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze. \nSTANDARD Well, if we're still going by the time you're back you know where we are. It's good to meet you... \nHe slips his arm around his son now and continues down the corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash. Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension. \n61 EXT/ INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA - NIGHT. 61 \nBrooding movie stars look down from the billboards. Driver is in his car now, soft rock playing on the radio. \n62 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 62 \nStandard is helping his son get ready for school, interacting with him affectionately. Irene watches them from the doorway, looking thoughtful. \n63 EXT/ INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA - DAY. 63 \nAnonymous streets roll by, Driver's eyes fixed on the road. \n64 INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE RESTAURANT/ LA - NIGHT. 64 \nStandard, Irene and Benicio are having dinner at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son. \n65 OMITTED 65 \n66 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 66 \nA noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his investment. \nNINO ...We paid three hundred fucking grand for this? \nBERNIE ROSE I paid for it. Out of my own pocket. Anyway, that's just the shell. You start with the shell, then you build the frame, then the motor. (Pointing to an engine nearby) I paid three hundred for that. The money goes on the inside not the outside. \nNINO Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go waste your money on something else... \nShannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his deal with Bernie. \nNINO (Pointing to a Thunderbird) ...How about that fucking pussy mobile over there. \nBERNIE ROSE You buy it. Shannon sell him the car... \nAt the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat. \nSHANNON Try her out. She's more comfortable than a water bed. \n(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: 66 \nNINO I already got a fucking water bed. \nHe sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all the control buttons as if he wants to break them. \nDRIVER Call it fifty. \nStandard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his eyes lowered. \nSTANDARD I was thinking of trading her in for a new car. Something fast and cheap. \nDRIVER You can't have both. \nSTANDARD Alright then, fast. \nEven though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on his handsome face. \nDRIVER (Pointing to a car) Something like that Buick over there'll cost you nine grand but there isn't much point in a city where you can't drive faster than sixty five. \nStandard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering him, then looks back at Driver. \nSTANDARD You must think I'm an asshole? \nDriver isn't sure what he's getting at. \nDRIVER I wouldn't know. \nSTANDARD Well, I am. Six months inside for holding somebody else's stolen shit... \nHe smiles ironically, his gaze still fixed on Driver. \n(CONTINUED) 67 CONTINUED: (2) 67 \nSTANDARD I appreciate what you did for my family when I was away but I don't plan to fuck up a second time... \nIt's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay. Driver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out. \nSHANNON Hey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money people are leaving!... \nDriver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then Driver breaks off. \nDRIVER Excuse me. \nSTANDARD See you around... \nDriver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts. Shannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches. \nSHANNON Who was that? \nDRIVER Irene's husband. \nSHANNON (GRINNING) What did I tell you about married women? \nNino can't resist another dig at Shannon. \nNINO What the fuck do you know about married women? \nBERNIE ROSE Can you for once say something without the word fuck in it? \nAs they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard. He's walking back to his car, dialling someone on his cell phone. \n68 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 68 \nPassing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her waitress's uniform. \n(CONTINUED) 68 CONTINUED: 68 \nDriver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car. \n69 INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 69 \nIrene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over. \nIRENE Hi... \nDRIVER Hi... \nTheir eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise. \n77 EXT. PARKING LOT/ EAST LA - DAY. 77 \nThe midday sun beats down on a maze of cars. Driver strolls past rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model Mustang. \n78 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 78 \nDriver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife. \nSTANDARD ...I was such a jerk the first time we met. We're at this party and I see the most beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'... (HE LAUGHS) It took me like a minute to get it... \n(CONTINUED) 78 CONTINUED: 78 \nIrene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager to please his dad. \nSTANDARD You don't get it either do you, Benicio? Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains. \nHe ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver. \nIRENE Would you like some more chicken? \nDRIVER Thanks... \nTheir eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass and tuck into his food. \nSTANDARD Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken. Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant together once I raise the money. That's why she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure out how it's done. She's got more ambition than anyone I know, more smarts too... (He raises his glass) We're gonna drive all those fucking Mexicans out of business - \nIRENE STANDARD - \nSTANDARD Excuse my language, Benicio... \nIRENE (Changing the subject) How's the movie going?... \nDRIVER Fine... \nIrene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink. \nIRENE Don't you think that's enough? \nSTANDARD Come on, we're celebrating. I've got my family around me and our new friend... \n(CONTINUED) 78 CONTINUED: (2) 78 \nHe raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on someone his wife clearly admires. \nIRENE Are you working on anything else? \nSTANDARD Stop asking the poor guy all these QUESTIONS - \nIRENE (LOSING PATIENCE) Then why don't you go ahead and talk for all of us. \nSTANDARD All right, I will. This time next week I'm gonna take you and Benicio away with me... \nIrene stops and looks at him in surprise. \nSTANDARD Where you wanna go, Benicio?... \nHis quiet confidence concerns her even more. \nBENICIO Disneyland. \nSTANDARD Forget Disneyland. I'm gonna take you and your mother away from this bullshit city - \nIRENE Benicio, it's time for bed - \nSTANDARD Your papa's got it all figured out - \nIRENE Benicio, you heard me - \nSTANDARD It's okay. I'll take him... \nStandard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son. Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver. \nIRENE I'm sorry. \nDriver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots crack behind him. \nAs Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly comes to life, pulling out of its parking place. \n82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82 \nDriver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips open the gym bag, then stares in shock. \nBLANCHE ...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this much money!... \nThere are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror, but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight. \nBLANCHE Move for Chrissakes!... \nDriver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at speed. \nThe Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit. \nDriver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for move, staying on his tail. \nIn the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in. \n(CONTINUED) 49A 82 CONTINUED: 82 \nDriver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make the same turn. It gets close enough to \"pit\" Driver, its nose pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. \nDriver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and regains control of his car. \nThe Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment. \nNow the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road, Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang closing fast. \nIt rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated for an instant. \nThe Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again... \nDriver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going, spinning 270 degrees. \nThe Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a corner he can't control. \nThe Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a sickening crunch of metal on metal. \nDriver guns the motor and speeds away. \n83 EXT. MOTEL/ LA - DAY. 83 \nPurple neon spills onto the forecourt of a seedy motel. \n84 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 84 \nThe black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale. \nDRIVER How much did Cook tell you you could expect to net? \nBLANCHE Forty Grand... \nShe glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is. Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery yet. He zips up the bag and heads out. \nDRIVER Stay here. Don't answer the door... \nBlanche nods, too shaken to protest. \n85 EXT. MOTEL/ LA - DAY. 85 \nDriver hesitates, then dials a number on his cell-phone. Benicio answers. \nBENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Hello?... \nDriver hears the tremor in his voice. \nDRIVER Benicio?... \nBENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Yeah?... \nAs she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped open as if she's called someone recently. \nDriver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom. \nDriver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door. He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way. \n87 INT. BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 87 \nDriver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom window where he just shot her. \nDriver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes. \nDriver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the hitman and grabs his shotgun. \n88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88 \nIn the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open. Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time -- firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag doll. \nThe startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet. \nDriver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys. \n89 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 89 \nShannon stands in his office, listening silently on the phone, looking like he's been punched in the gut. \n(CONTINUED) 89 CONTINUED: 89 \nSHANNON Why didn't you tell me?... \nAll he hears is silence on the other end. \nSHANNON Well, I guess it's done now... \nHe leans back against a car. \nSHANNON How big's the take?... \nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE One million I guess... \nSHANNON Jesus... \nHe looks dazed by the thought of so much money. \nSHANNON You better bring it over. \nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE I'm hurt. I need a doctor to patch me up... \nSHANNON I'll take care of it... \n90 OMITTED 90 \n91 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - NIGHT. 91 \nAn underworld doctor, \"DOC\", a shabbily dressed old man who looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch along with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival. Shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he hears a noise in the garage. \n92 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE - NIGHT. 92 \nShannon arrives downstairs to see Driver walking unsteadily towards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his hands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but there's no sign of it. \n93 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT.93 \nScissoring Driver's blood soaked shirt away Doc examines the shards of glass embedded in his arm, then notices the deep scars running down his back. \n(CONTINUED) 93 CONTINUED: 93 \nDOC ...Looks like you got more metal inside you than a ten ton truck... (His hand shakes) You'd be better off with a mechanic not a medic... \nDriver looks up at him warily from Shannon's pull out bed. \nDOC Relax. Just having my fun with you... \nDoc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of Peroxide and Betadine, takes a drink, then offers it to Driver. \nBERNIE ROSE That's what you should worry about... \nShannon smiles back but Bernie senses how distracted he is. \nBERNIE ROSE You want my advice? Let your friend work it out for himself. Don't take pills for other people's headaches... (HE GRINS) You got twenty minutes? I need you to run down to the market and get me some milk... \n95 OMITTED 95 \n96 INT. HALL/ STAIRS/ STRIP JOINT - DAY. 96 \nSunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs, passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he puts them at ease with a friendly smile. \nDRIVER Cook moved office again? \nSTRIPPER That one over there... \nDriver smiles gratefully, then heads towards an office at the end of the corridor. He knocks on the door. A voice calls back. \n(CONTINUED) 96 CONTINUED: 96 \nCOOK O/S It's open... \nDriver takes a hammer out of his jacket, then starts turning the door handle as if he can't get in. \nCOOK O/S It's open, goddamit!... \nHe hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face. \nBefore Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face. Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery. \nDRIVER Should've figured you for a shill. Who were you fronting for? \nCOOK Fuck you - \nDriver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the door but Driver couldn't care less. \nDRIVER Whose money am I holding? \nCOOK Don't worry. They'll come get it. You don't know who you're fucking with - \nDriver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting Cook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig. \nDRIVER Who's money am I holding? \nCOOK (Barely able to get the words out) Fuck you... \nThe strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the call log and finds the same number appearing again and again. \n97 OMITTED 97 \n98 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - DAY. 98 \nThe kitchen is busy, CHEFS taking out hot pizzas from the oven and slicing them up in takeaway boxes. In the background we hear the phone ringing. \n99 INT. BACK ROOM/ PIZZERIA - DAY. 99 \nAn impeccably dressed MAN IN A TAN SUIT answers the phone. \nTAN SUIT Hello?...I'm afraid we're closed. Could you call back after twelve... \n100 EXT. PARKING LOT/ BURGER KING/ SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY. 100 \n(INTERCUT) \nDriver leans against his car, talking on Cook's cell phone. \nDRIVER I could, but your boss won't be happy when he finds out you've kept him waiting... \nTan Suit looks curious now. \nTAN SUIT Can I ask what this is about? \nDRIVER I have something that belongs to him. \nThe glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering Tan Suit's skull. \nDriver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the elevator, framed against the light. \nShe stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out. \nDriver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view. \n108 OMITTED 108 \n108a EXT. LA STREET - NIGHT. 108a \nShannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his own car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at him a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt. \n(CONTINUED) 108a CONTINUED: 108a \nSHANNON What happened? \nDRIVER Nino's guys came after me. How did they know about Irene? \nShannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed. \nSHANNON I called Bernie...I asked if he could help. Him and Nino are like brothers. I told him you weren't interested in the money, that you only did it for the girl... (From the heart) I wanted to make sure once you returned the money that was the end of it... \nDriver doesn't seem to hear him. \nSHANNON Let me talk to Bernie again. They probably didn't listen to him - \nDRIVER It's too late... \nShannon says nothing now, knowing he's right. \nDRIVER They're gonna come after you to find me. You have to leave... \nShannon takes this in slowly. \nSHANNON What are you gonna do?... \nDriver doesn't answer, but from his silence Shannon can guess. \nSHANNON How the fuck did this happen? We're supposed be in Charlotte or Daytona drinking champagne out of trophies and getting laid by pit lizards... \nHe stares at Driver with quiet regret. \nSHANNON Fuck... \n109 OMITTED 109 \n110 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - MORNING. 110 \nBernie Rose looks quietly furious. \nBERNIE ROSE ...I already gave you my advice. You should have taken your money and left this guy alone. \nNino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now. \nNINO It's not that simple, Bernie. \nBERNIE ROSE Not now that it's bounced up in your face. \nCOOK Mr. Paolozzi, I owe you this guy. Just give me the okay and I'll - \nBERNIE ROSE You like taking orders, go shut the blinds. \nHe looks at Cook's broken hands. \nBERNIE ROSE Sun's in my eyes... \nNino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain. \nNINO ...The money belonged to a half assed wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was keeping a million in a pawn shop and was gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a rival operation. I wanted to teach him a lesson... \nThe lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the blinds. \n116 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 116 \nTwo big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask. He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria. \n117 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 117 \nSeveral of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them recognize him. \nNINO'S GUY We're closed... \nDriver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out again. \n118 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - NIGHT. 118 \nNino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the white Lincolns. \nNINO (To one of his men) I'm going to pick up my wife. I'll meet you there... \nAcross the road Driver climbs into his car, still wearing the mask. He starts his car, setting off after Nino's Lincoln. \n119 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - NIGHT. 119 \nDriver drifts in behind a couple of other cars, keeping them between himself and the Lincoln. \n120 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 120 \nThe sunlight is fading fast. The neon cityscape has come to life and the streets are a sea of glittering lights. \n121 INT. NINO'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 121 \nThe CHAUFFEUR checks his mirror as he turns into another street, seeing only the anonymous glare of headlights behind him. \n122 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 122 \nDriver slows down and lets another car turn in front of him, keeping it between himself and Nino's car. \n123 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 123 \nThe streets are less crowded in this residential area. As the car in front of Driver pulls into its front drive, Driver takes the next turning, making sure the Lincoln doesn't spot him. \n124 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PARALLEL STREET - NIGHT. 124 \nDriver cruises along another residential street. At every intersection we glimpse the Lincoln heading in the same direction down a parallel street. \n125 EXT. SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD/ BRENTWOOD - NIGHT. 125 \nThe Lincoln turns back into traffic on San Vincente. \n126 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 126 \nNino's talking on a cell phone in the back seat. \nNINO ...Sure, Carlo, I'll send him your regards... \n127 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 127 \nDriver merges in with the traffic, weaving between the cars in front of him until he has Nino's Lincoln back in his sights. \n128 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 128 \nThe sun has almost set, the red backlights of the cars blinking in the fading light. \n129 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 129 \nNino's car turns into 7th Street. \n130 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 130 \nThis time there are no other vehicles turning into the same street. Driver has no choice, settling in behind the Lincoln. \n131 INT. NINO'S CAR/ 7TH STREET/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 131 \nThe chauffeur glances in his rear-view mirror and spots Driver's car for the first time. For now he doesn't give it much thought. In the back seat Nino finally says goodbye on the phone. \nIn the front seat Nino's chauffeur checks his mirror curiously. \nNINO When this is over I'll make it up to you, I swear... \nThe lights of the car behind have vanished. \n147 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 147 \nEven from above we can't see Driver's car with its lights off - no idea how close it is to Nino's car. \n148 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 148 \nEven though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his childhood friend. \nBERNIE ROSE How many times I heard that before... \n149 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 149 \nNino grins. \nNINO I lost count - \nSuddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him. \n150 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 150 \nDriver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting it just above the left rear wheel. \n151 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151 \nThe impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards. \n152 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 152 \nBernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead. \n153 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 153 \nThe collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car skids to a stop near the overturned wreck. \n154 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154 \nAmong the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck. \n155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155 \nDriver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the other passengers are dead, then heads on. \n156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156 \nNino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves. \nDriver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries to wade out further, the ocean drags him back. \n(CONTINUED) 156 CONTINUED: 156 \nDriver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water, barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back. \nThey stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean. Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino splutters as Driver lets him up again. \nNINO It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your friend not me... \nDriver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there until Nino's body finally stops thrashing. \n157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157 \nA phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it. \nBERNIE ROSE Nino? \nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE He's dead. \nBernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's no trace of emotion in his voice. \nHe smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of sympathy. \nBERNIE ROSE This is what I'll do for you. You give me the money, nobody knows she exists. But it's a different matter with you. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 160 CONTINUED: (2) 160 BERNIE ROSE (cont'd) These people I have the misfortune to be involved with, they don't mind Nino being gone, but they'll wanna know what happened to him... \nDRIVER Sounds like we have a problem... \nBERNIE ROSE And just when we were getting to know each other... \nTheir eyes are fixed on each other, deadly enemies but kindred spirits of a kind. \nBERNIE ROSE ...We shake hands, say goodbye, it's the start of your new life. Sooner or later they'll come after you. No end to it. Someone gets tired, somebody else takes their place. It goes on and on. Whatever dreams you have, whatever plans, you might as well forget `em, because this is what it's gonna be like till the day you die... (A BEAT) I just thought you should know... \nDriver stares back at him quietly. \nDRIVER What do you suggest I do? \nBERNIE ROSE First time I heard about you, Shannon told me you drove. Fast. That's a start... \nHe keeps staring at Driver, then smiles. \nBERNIE ROSE Either that or you choke on the duck... \n161 EXT. PARKING LOT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY. 161 \nDriver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk, taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't even look at it, still admiring the car. \nBERNIE ROSE How much does something like this cost? \nDRIVER Nine, ten thousand. If you can find one that still runs. \n(CONTINUED) 161 CONTINUED: 161 \nBERNIE ROSE Maybe I'll take yours. Part of our deal. \nHe grins, then holds out his hand for the gym bag. \nBERNIE ROSE Guess we won't be seeing each other again.. \nDriver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to his throat. \nTheir eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight. \nBlood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut. \n162 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF A MUCH LARGER PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 162 \nWe're looking down on an enormous parking lot, hundreds of different colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls into the lot, searching for a place to park. \n163 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 163 \nDriver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood- soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on his cell-phone. \n164 EXT. ECHO PARK - DAY. 164 \nIrene and Benicio sit in the park. \nIRENE (Picking up her phone) Hello?... \n(INTERCUT) \nThe blazing sun beats down. Driver walks through a long corridor of glinting cars. \nDRIVER It's me... \n(CONTINUED) 164 CONTINUED: 164 \nIrene stares in surprise. \nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Don't hang up... \nShe says nothing but stays on the line. \n", "test1_input": "He's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile. \nSTANDARD Fucking punks took me by surprise... \nDriver watches him, unconvinced. \nDRIVER Fucking punks didn't look like they needed to... \nStandard looks at him in surprise now. \nSTANDARD You saw them, huh?... \nDriver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue. Standard hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him. \nSTANDARD You ever been inside? \nDRIVER Why? \n(CONTINUED) 73 CONTINUED: 73 \nStandard takes another glance at the items laid out neatly by the sink. \nSTANDARD I owed some protection money in the joint. \nDriver begins to see how worried he is. \nDRIVER How much? \nSTANDARD They want twenty thousand. I told them I couldn't pay so they want me to do a job for them... \nDRIVER Is that why you need a car? \nStandard stares back at him. \nSTANDARD What did you say you were inside for? \nDRIVER I didn't. \nA beat, then he finally opens up. \nSTANDARD It's a pawn shop in the valley. I tried to back out tonight, they said they'd come after Irene and Benicio next time... \nDriver stares at him in surprise now, more concerned than he shows. \nDRIVER Why don't you take them away? \nSTANDARD Where would I go? Irene finds out I fucked up again I'll lose everything... \nHe sounds upset, angry with himself. \nSTANDARD This lousy job's my only way out... \nDriver stares at his battered face and the blood stains on his t- shirt, then walks out of the bathroom to check on Benicio. \n74 INT. LIVING ROOM/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 74 \nBenicio is watching a baseball game on TV, his back to Driver. \nDRIVER You okay? \nThe little boy nods without turning round, still frightened by his ordeal. \nDRIVER You want something to drink? \nBenicio shakes his head, trying to hide his tears. Driver heads over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go. \nDRIVER What have you got there?... \nBenicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet. Driver stares at it, then looks at him. \nDRIVER Who gave you that?... \nBENICIO One of those men. He told me not to lose it... \n", "test1_true": "75 OMITTED 75 \n76 EXT. OUTDOOR TACO SHACK/ EAST LA - DAY. 76 \nAn outdoor food shack in a park. COOK, the leader of the group of men who beat Standard up in the parking lot, sits at a table with his girlfriend, BLANCHE, a stunning blonde with short cropped hair. \nCOOK I've got you to do this fucking job for me, why do I need to pay someone else? \nStandard sits next to Driver, holding his ground even though he's clearly intimidated by the Albanian. \nSTANDARD I'll pay him out of what's left of my share. I can't do something like this on my own. \n(CONTINUED) 76 CONTINUED: 76 \nCOOK You got Blanche... \nHe grins, looking at Driver now. Blanche doesn't even seem to hear them, hung-over from the previous night. \nCOOK You look like you're hard to work with? \nDRIVER Not if we understand each other. \nCOOK What's to understand? It's my score. Either you sign on or you don't. \nDriver stares at him quietly, finding it hard to conceal his contempt. \nDRIVER I drive. That's all I do. \nBlanche gets up from the table before Cook can respond. \nCOOK Where are you going? \nBLANCHE They've forgotten my Coke. \nCOOK They'll bring it. Sit down. (His eyes still fixed on Driver) Standard, why don't you hire a fucking taxi cab? \nSTANDARD He didn't mean it like that, man... \nStandard looks worried, trying to diffuse the tension. \nCOOK So, what does he mean? \nDriver looks him calmly in the eye. \nDRIVER You tell me where we start, where we're headed, where we'll be going afterwards. I don't take part, I don't carry weapons, I drive... \nStandard seems surprised by Driver's professional patter. So does Cook. Even Blanche looks interested for once. \n(CONTINUED) 76 CONTINUED: (2) 76 \nCOOK Standard, get Blanche her coca cola. \nStandard hesitates, but has no choice. As he leaves to fetch Blanche her drink, Cook starts to write something down on the palm of his hand. \nCOOK Okay, here's the deal. This much for Blanche, this much for that asshole minus what he owes me, and this much for you... \nHe holds up the palm of his hand to Driver, the words Fuck Off written in marker pen. \nCOOK You still interested? \nDriver looks at him, all his instincts telling him to walk away, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene and Benicio. \nCOOK Good. Anything else?... \nDriver stares back at him with his clear blue eyes. \nDRIVER We do this job he's paid his debt. You leave him and his family alone... \nCook looks surprised at first, then laughs at his nerve. \nCOOK Whatever you say, boss... \n", "test1_id": 3123, "test2_input": "IRENE Where have you been?... \nHe stares back at her in silence. \nIRENE I tried to reach you. Standard's been - \nDRIVER I know... \nHis eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a small voice interrupts. \nBENICIO O/S Hey... \nDriver looks over at the little boy. \nDRIVER Hey... \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: 104 \nIrene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits her. She stares in disbelief, reeling. \nDRIVER I'm sorry about your father... \nBenicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He looks back at her. \nIRENE I can't talk now. I have to go. \nDRIVER Can I give you a ride? \nShe stares at him in dismay, close to tears. \nIRENE The car's working fine. \nDRIVER Then let me walk you down... \nShe wants to say no but can't. \n105 INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 105 \nDriver and Irene head down the long corridor in silence. \nIRENE (Almost a whisper) Why?... \nDriver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard. \nDRIVER He was into one of the prison gangs for a lot of money. He was trying to protect you. \nIRENE Great job... \nShe walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver follows her. \nDRIVER I still have the money. Whatever you need - \nShe turns around and slaps him hard. \nIRENE What are you, a bank? I work for a living. I don't need your widow's pension! \n(CONTINUED) 105 CONTINUED: 105 \nHer eyes well up with tears, staring at him in anger and frustration. \nIRENE Just tell me one thing. How did he talk you into it? \nDRIVER He didn't talk me into anything. I've been doing this my whole life. It's what I do... \nShe stares at him in deep disappointment. \nIRENE Stupid me... \nShe turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open, revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused. \nTAN SUIT Sorry, I'm supposed to be going down... \nIRENE So are we... \n", "test2_true": "TAN SUIT Which floor? \nDRIVER Parking lot, please... \nTan Suit presses the button and the doors slide shut. \n106 INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 106 \nDriver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of them heading in the opposite direction. \n107 INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 107 \nThe overhead lights flicker, the huge underground car park hidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In the distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade. \n(CONTINUED) 107 CONTINUED: 107 \nDRIVER I'm leaving. I want you to come with me... \nIrene can't believe what she's hearing. \nIRENE What are you talking about? \nDRIVER You and Benicio... \nShe's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now. \nIRENE You're crazy. I don't even know you - \nDRIVER You will. Once I straighten out this thing I'm getting out for good. We'll go some place. Anywhere you want. \nShe shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him. \nIRENE It doesn't work like that. \nDRIVER Why not?... \nShe stops and looks at him. \nIRENE Because people like you never get out. And I don't want my son to grow up like that... \nShe holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his eye. \nA beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of the darkness, opening fire with his automatic. \nBullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst. \nMore sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene. \nDriver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of parked cars. \n(CONTINUED) 107 CONTINUED: (2) 107 \nDriver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if all her worst fears have been confirmed. \nDriver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps approaching. \nHe holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire. \nTan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him, reloading, when suddenly his gun jams. \nCrouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now. \nStill lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing footsteps. \nDriver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a car. \nTan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car. \nIrene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She picks herself up and runs towards the elevator. \nDriver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs him by the throat and rams his head into a car window. \n", "test2_id": 3124, "test3_input": "Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino. \nBERNIE ROSE Your turn to clean up after me... \n110a EXT. TRAILER/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - MORNING. 110a \nThe CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene. Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask he saw previously on the film set. \n111 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - MORNING. 111 \nShannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops. Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him. \nBERNIE ROSE All these priceless cars, you should get better locks... \nSHANNON Door's always open to you... \nBernie Rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat pockets. \nBERNIE ROSE Going somewhere? \nSHANNON Thinking about it. \n(CONTINUED) 111 CONTINUED: 111 \nBERNIE ROSE I'm looking for your driver. \nSHANNON You break in like this I figure it's bad news. \nBERNIE ROSE It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this city a year, he had to pick the wrong one. \nSHANNON He tried to put it right. \nBERNIE ROSE Picked the wrong guy for that too. My partner's a belligerent asshole with his back against the wall... \nHe stops, facing Shannon. \nBERNIE ROSE Right now so am I. I don't take care of this I'm in big trouble... \nHe stares at his old friend. \nBERNIE ROSE Any idea where he is? \nSHANNON Probably across the border by now. Mexico. Belize. That's where I'd go... \nBernie Rose smiles, not believing a word. \nBERNIE ROSE He just walked out on you after everything you've done for him, took all the money? \nSHANNON That's gratitude, I guess. \nBernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite everything. \nBERNIE ROSE I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a neighborhood of wops. Long as I can remember he was getting me into trouble and I was getting him out of scrapes... \nHe looks almost apologetic. \n(CONTINUED) 111 CONTINUED: (2) 111 \nBERNIE ROSE Anyone else I'd take your side... \nSHANNON Anyone else I'd do the same... \nBernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret. \nBERNIE ROSE What's this fucking kid to you anyway? \nShannon shrugs, no idea himself. \nBERNIE ROSE I leave here without finding out where he is, there'll be others coming after me. I guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure out you won't talk and drag this out unnecessarily... \nSHANNON Then I'm glad you got here first... \nBernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny stock car. \n", "test3_true": "SHANNON Nah, I'd have fucked it up too... \nShannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends, when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung. \nWe see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed, paralysed with shock. \nBernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him down against the boot of the stock car. \nBERNIE ROSE You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and you'll fall asleep... \nShannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a handkerchief. \n111a INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 111a \nBernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box full of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly storms towards his front door. \n111b EXT. CORRIDOR/ BERNIE ROSE'S NEIGHBORS' APARTMENT - DAY. 111b \nA loud knocking. Bernie Rose's neighbor opens his door. \nHUSBAND Yeah? \nBERNIE ROSE Bernie Rose, next apartment over - \nHUSBAND Yeah, I know. I'm kind of busy here. \nBERNIE ROSE I heard... \nThere's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife. \nBERNIE ROSE You all right, Shonda? \nThe woman nods without meeting his eyes. \nHUSBAND Get the hell out of my - \nBernie doesn't give him time to finish, clamping a powerful hand on his throat. \nBERNIE ROSE What's your fucking name? \nHUSBAND LENNY - \nBERNIE ROSE I'm a patient man, Lenny, not much for getting in other people's way. What I figure is, we've all got our own lives, right? And the right to be left alone? (SQUEEZING HARDER) So I sit next door for almost a year now listening to what goes down in here and I keep thinking, hey, they'll work it out. You gonna work it out, Lenny? \n(CONTINUED) 111b CONTINUED: 111b \nHe jerks the husband's neck forward, making him nod. \nBERNIE ROSE You're lucky to have her, lucky she's put up with you this long. Lucky I've put up with you. She has good reason: she loves you. I don't have any reason at all. So stop raising your voice or fucking move... \nHe lets go of the terrified man and storms out again. \n112 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 112 \nSunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings, glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through. \n113 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 113 \nDriver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently against the trunk of the car. \nDriver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of money. \n114 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 114 \nDriver's car roars out of the garage. \n115 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 115 \nNino stands in the kitchen, wearing a beautiful suit but no shoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN, also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone. \nNINO Alright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour. \n", "test3_id": 3125}

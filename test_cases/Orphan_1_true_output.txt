Kate opens-the door, angrily signing as she speaks: Stop banging that against the house! I'm trying-to work!. 
MAX 
SORRY. Max gives an abashed look. Kate sighs. She knows she was too harsh with her. 
KATE -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a break for a little while, okay? Max nods. Kate goes. back inside. A CAR pulls into the-drive..

DANIEL Boo -yahl He shoots! He scores! 
JOHN Nice one, champ! - Daniel pumps his arm and runs inside. John walks up the drive, carrying a bouquet of FLOWERS. He hands Max the ball and lifts her up to the basket. Max happily puts the ball-through'the hoop.

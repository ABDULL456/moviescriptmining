SHOOTING DRAFT 
Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day 
Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The Chronicle." He reads the society page. A man enters and leans across his desk. 
MAN Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants to see you. 
He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into Madison's office. 
Interior: Madison's Office, Day 
Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk. 
MADISON Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark? 
JACK No. Who'd he shoot? 
MADISON Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or something like that. 
JACK What's so special about him? 
MADISON They say he's an honest man. What I want you to do is to hop into your car... 
JACK Why, you promised me a vacation. 
MADISON Well, that can wait. 
JACK Yeah... but there's a... a girl I know. 
He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison a photograph of Anne Stanton. 
MADISON Oh... Well, she can wait too. 
Jack takes the paper back and looks at it. 
JACK The question is... can I? 
MADISON The answer is... get up there. 
JACK Right. (starts to go) Oh... uh... what did you say his name was? 
MADISON Who? 
JACK The fellow's name. 
MADISON Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie Stark. 
Madison goes on with his work. 
JACK (as he leaves) Willie Stark... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Kanoma City, Day 
As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town. 
JACK (voice over) I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, hot, dusty, backwoods county seat. 
He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking. 
WILLIE ...to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money. When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell you why... 
A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering. 
Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills. 
WILLIE ...Because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure. But it's their own. Let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures. That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. That same brick factory uses convict labor. 
The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd. 
SHERIFF Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move on. 
WILLIE Why? 
SHERIFF City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace.

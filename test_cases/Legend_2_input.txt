JACK: Is there nothing you can do? 
GUMP: If you want more tricks, I'm your man.... but, for big questions, you must go elsewhere. 
JACK: But don't you care what's happened? 
GUMP: Course we care.... What good's the world locked in a season of death? No folks to scare on a summer's night.... 
BROWN TOM: No babies to tickle.... 
SCREWBALL: No lovers to tease.... 
GUMP: No more spells to cast....Does that sound like an enjoyable prospect? 
JACK: We must find the answer! 
GUMP: That we must. But first, we better see that no harm's come to the unicorns. 
SCREWBALL: I sadly fear the worst.... 
Gumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding luminous flower lanterns. 
46C EXTERIOR DEEP FOREST NIGHT 
Seen from a distance, the lantern-lit faerie procession glows like foxfire between the massive trees. 
46D EXTERIOR SNOW (LILI TRACKS GOBLINS) NIGHT 
Princess Lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees, following the tracks of the goblins. The quilt is torn, her hair dishevelled. She pauses at the top of a small, steep hill. 
The tracks of the goblins' sleigh pass below. 
Lili jumps from the hilltop, leaving the quilt floating behind like a discarded skin. It is an incrediable leap. 
She lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs off, hair streaming behind, following the trail of the sled. 
47 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA NIGHT 
The faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow. 
FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's Nothing to be done? Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun.... 
The silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie lanterns. 
Led by Jack, the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion. 
Wisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins. 
GUMP: This is goblins' work.... Powerful demons are agaisnt us! 
Jack kneels sadly beside the ice-glazed unicorn. 
The SOUND of CRASHING HOOFBEATS alerts the faeries as the mare unicorn thunders out of the trees. 
BROWN TOM: Take cover, laddies! 
The faeries dive for protection. Only Jack stands his ground. 
The mare charges straight at Jack. He is knocked to his knees as she gallops past. 
The unicorn wheels about. Jack scrambles to his feet. 
She charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass. Her alicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat. 
GUMP: Run, Jack! 
JACK: The fault was mine. I owe her my life. 
GUMP: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility is her gift in return. 
The mare makes a soft NOISE deep in her throat. It is a cross between whale song and the cooing of doves. 
Jack responds in kind, imitating the sound exactly. 
SCREWBALL: What's he saying? What's it mean? 
BROWN TOM (shrugging): Search me.... I speak some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn. 
The unicorn continues, a SOUND as close to music as anything in nature. Jck listens intently and answers her. 
GUMP: Come on Jack, don't keep us in the dark. 
JACK: The dark is where we'll stay.... We're cursed. All warmth and light was lost when the stallion died. 
BROWN TOM: Is there naught we can do? 
JACK: We must get the alicorn back. Only then will the world return to normal. 
GUMP: And how do faeries fight a demon? 
JACK: She says we're to find a champion.... a mortal, bold of heart and pure in spirit. 
SCREWBALL: Look....! Look....! 
Screwball points to the mare's hoofprints in the snow. Tiny wild flowers spring to life within each indentation. 
JACK: That is the warmth of her soul. Not even death's icy hand can stop it! 
SCREWBALL: Little good her soul'll do us now. 
BROWN TOM: Screwball's right. Where we gonna find a champion when every mortal can swing a sword is froze stiff as an icicle? 
GUMP: Don't give up so quick, lads. (feeling Jack's arm) You sure you're mortal?

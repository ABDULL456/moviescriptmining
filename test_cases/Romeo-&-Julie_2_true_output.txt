Juliet buckles. 
INT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON. 
We are close enough now to hear Juliet's words. 
JULIET Oh God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? 
NURSE It did, it did! Alas the day, it did! 
JULIET Oh serpent heart, hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile 
MATTER So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace! 
NURSE There's no trust, No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. Shame come to Romeo. 
JULIET Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish! He was not born to shame. Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit. 
NURSE Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin? 
JULIET Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy three-hours wife have mangled it? But whyfore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have killed my husband. All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then? Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death: I would forget it fain - exiled. Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled. To speak that word is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain, All dead. 
Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears. 
JULIET (CONT.) Nurse, I'll to my wedding bed, And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead. 
Nurse looks down at Juliet. She goes and comforts her. 
NURSE Hie to your chamber. I'll find 
ROMEO To comfort you. I know well where he is. Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night. 
Juliet looks up through tears. 
JULIET O find him, give this ring to my true knight, And bid him come to take his last farewell. 
SLAM MACRO ZOOM: Into the ring. The screen fills with the words 'I love thee'. 
INT. PRESBYTERY BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
Romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying. His wound has been bandaged and Balthasar crouches frightened in the corner. 
The priest leads the Nurse into the room. 
Romeo looks up. 
ROMEO Nurse! 
She goes to him. 
NURSE Ah sir! Ah sir! Death's the end of all. 
ROMEO Speakest thou of Juliet? Where is she? And how doth she? And what says My concealed lady to our cancelled love? 
NURSE O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again. 
Romeo is wailing inconsolably. 
ROMEO As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand murdered her kinsman! 
Father Laurence shakes the hysterical boy. 
FATHER LAURENCE I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A pack of blessings light upon thy back. 
Romeo calms. The Nurse gives him the ring. 
NURSE Here sir, a ring my lady bid me give you. 
Romeo enfolds the ring in his hand. 
ROMEO How well my comfort is revived by this. 
The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt and helps Romeo put it on. 
FATHER LAURENCE Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed. Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her. But look thou stay not till the Watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back, With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou wentst forth in lamentation. 
Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room. 
INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT. 
They hurry down the hallway. 
The priest opens the front door. 
FATHER LAURENCE Go hence. Be gone by the break of 
DAY Sojourn in Mantua. Give me thy hand. 
Romeo embraces him. 
ROMEO Farewell.

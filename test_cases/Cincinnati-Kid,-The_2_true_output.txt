INT. POKER SUITE 
CAMERA starts on Yeller, who is stretched out on the loveseat with his eyes closed and PANS UP to INCLUDE Hoban, who sits at the observation post with the binoculars. Yeller speaks without opening his eyes. 
YELLER Anything? 
HOBAN Naaa, Kid paired kings. He wins a hundred. 
CAMERA MOVES on PAST a window, showing it is night outside; past a group of other spectators; past Bill, Shooter and Melba who watch the game grimly; and finally to the table, where The Shooter is dealing again. The Kid is down to his undershirt, and even Lancey has made a few concessions to comfort. The players have just been dealt their third cards. Christian moves up to stand behind The Kid. 
LANCEY Queen bets another C-note. 
THE KID (folding) Take it away. 
He looks up at Christian. 
THE KID Go read a magazine, honey. 
She hesitates. Then moves away. Lancey watches this. 
(TIME LAPSE) 
INT. POKER SUITE - CHRISTIAN 
It is later at night. The magazine lies open on Christian's lap; she is staring absently into space. 
LADY FINGERS' VOICE (O.S.) All right, gents. I'm declaring a break. 
The announcement rouses Christian from her reverie. 
THE POKER TABLE 
Lady Fingers is in the dealer's chair. The two players look pretty weary. 
LADY FINGERS I break. 
THE KID I don't want a break. 
LANCEY Well, I don't either. 
THE KID Deal. 
Lady Fingers puts down the deck. Picks up a new one. 
LANCEY (snapping) Same deck is good enough. 
THE KID I want a new deck. 
LANCEY Alright, alright -- A new deck then, Jesus. 
THE KID Deal. 
Lady Fingers looks at the two men for a long moment. Puts the cards down. 
LADY FINGERS You want to deal? Then deal them yourselves. I'm going to the john. I'm going to get something to eat, and I'm going to take a nap. You barracudas can snap all you want but at each other -- I'm taking a break and if you don't like it you can both go to hell. 
She turns and stalks off. Lancey and The Kid look at each other for a moment, then both grin. 
THE KID I guess we been told. 
LANCEY Looks that way. 
THE KID (rising) See you in about 3/4 of an hour, Lancey, right? 
LANCEY Make it an hour. Old bones need a little more time to loosen up. 
THE KID (meaning it) Listen, I think it is amazing you've been able to keep going this long. 
As he heads for the door, Lancey reacts to this. Then stands and looks around the room. Groups of people stand in the shadows watching silently, not hostile but certainly not friendly. He is The Man but he is getting beat and nobody is sorry. After a moment he turns and leaves from a side door. CAMERA PANS to HOLD on Christian as she stops The Kid by the door. 
INT. POKER SUITE 
CHRISTIAN (taking his hand) Eric -- 
SHOOTER (simultaneously) Your fan on the fifth floor wants you to have a bite with him. Alone. 
KID There's nothing to talk about. 
SHOOTER You better, Kid. You don't, you're only making worse trouble. 
Christian scans both their faces as they talk... concerned.

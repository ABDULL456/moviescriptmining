{"test1_input": "WITNESS \n\"WITNESS\" \nby \nEarl W. Wallace \nWilliam Kelley \nPamela Wallace \nEXT. LANCASTER COUNTY, PA. COUNTRYSIDE \u0096 DAY \nTITLE SEQUENCE \nThe faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish. \nEXT. COUNTRY LANE \u0096 DAY \nThrough the last traces of early morning mist another group of black-clad figures make their way down a lane. \nEXT. COUNTRY LANE \u0096 DAY \nAn Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces. \nFramed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired like his father, peering out. \nThe horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES on the pavement. \nANOTHER LANE \nTwo Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory. \nVALLEY \nA BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse. \nBARNYARD \nWhere literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of the barn. \nEXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \u0096 FRONT PORCH \nAs the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women and children presumably first). \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \nThe coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen partially covering the bearded face. \nEND TITLE SEQUENCE \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \nPartitions have been removed, making the central rooms of the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred- fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy a special Place. \nRACHEL LAPP \nA young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and drawn. \nIn happier circumstances, although there haven't been too many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence. \nEight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events. \nAnd the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered \u0096 yet not unkind \u0096 features grief-stricken. \nTHE MOURNERS \nTheir faces... \nCLOCK \nAs it begins to CHIME nine a.m. \nFAVORING PREACHER \nAs he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation remove their hats also. \nThen the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect: \nSUBTITLES OVER. \nPREACHER ...a brother has been called home. God has spoken through the death of our neighbor, Jacob Lapp... \nTHE FAMILY \nWhere Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as: \nPREACHER ...husband of Rachel, father to Samuel, son of Eli. (and) His chair is empty, his bed is empty, his voice will be heard no more. He was needed in our presence, but God needs such men, too. That one should be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. Still, we would not wish him back. Rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. CEMETERY \nThe mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g. \nAs the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty air. \nRACHEL \nTIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \nWhere the Amish have gathered for the traditional post funeral, midday meals. \nLong tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries. \nRACHEL \nWhere she sits among women, accepting their condolences. \nDANIEL HOCHSTETLER \nA brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom. \nSTOLTZFUS Lapp was a good farmer. None better. \nBEILER But not the man to buy a horse for you. (and) Hochstetler, wasn't it your father sold him that horse with a ruptured testicle? \nTOM (grins) Told him it was a bee sting made him limp that way. \nHOCHSTETLER (amused) That horse had one good ball. That's all it takes. \nThe others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on Rachel. \nRACHEL \nAs Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a tree in front of her. \nAt ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, tune in as Rachel looks up. \nHOCHSTETLER I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let us hope he walks close with God. \nRACHEL I'm sure he does, Daniel. \nFIELDS, LAPP FARM \u0096 DAY \nIt is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three \u0096 Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach \u0096 it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various tasks associated with the work in hand. \nDaniel works close beside Rachel. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 DAY \nA few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a chance to cross a busy interstate highway. \nEXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 DAY \nA huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to overtake it. \nEXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION \u0096 DAY \nDaniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming to her cheek. \nRACHEL Daniel? \nHOCHSTETLER I... I was at the feed store. And I saw your horse, so... \nThere is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival of the train. \nHOCHSTETLER You will come back soon? \nSamuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his mother's hand. \nSAMUEL Quickly, Mother Quickly! \nRachel embraces Eli. \nELI You be careful out among them English. \nShe turns to Hochstetler. \nRACHEL I need time, Daniel. \nEXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION \u0096 DAY \nDaniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his horse off at a fast trot. \n", "test1_id": 462, "test2_input": "ANGLE PAST Book's desk calendar. Carter enters in the b.g., crosses quickly to the desk. He snaps on a light, thumbs a page of the calendar. Frowns. \nINSERT \nRachel's name and address scribbled on a page of the calendar. \nBACK TO SCENE \nANGLE \nA couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on. \nCarter shakes it off, goes. And... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR (MOVING) \nAs light colors the eastern horizon, Book is crossing into Lancaster County. \nBook glances at Rachel; she's asleep. He coughs wrackingly, hurting... cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter. And... \nEXT. LAPP FARM \nHIS POV \u0096 BOOK'S CAR \nComing up the long drive. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it. \nSuddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man. \nANGLE AT CAR \nAs Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains seated. \nHe lets his eyes travel around the farm. \nRACHEL Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast. \nBOOK I can't. \nRACHEL What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial? \nBook starts the engine: \nBOOK (grimly) There isn't going to be one. \nRachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around in the barnyard. \nANGLE \nAs Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel. \nELI Who was that man? \nRACHEL His name is John Book. \nEli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries: \nSAMUEL Momma \u0096 look. \nThey glance in the direction Samuel is looking. \nTHEIR POV \u0096 BOOK'S CAR \nThe car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes to rest against a bank of earth. \nBACK TO RACHEL \nShe stares... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD \u0096 DAY \nAs Samuel races for all he's worth across the field, negotiates the creek via a fallen log \u0096 Rachel, now, also running toward the car. \nEXT. STABLES \u0096 DAY \nEli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot. \nANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR \nWe see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. Momentarily he comes awake: \nRACHEL But John... why didn't you go to a hospital? \n", "test2_true": "RACHEL (bewildered) But why? \nBOOK Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me. \nRACHEL But \u0096 \nBook reaches up to grip her arm fiercely: \nBOOK And when they find me, they'll find your boy! \nHe slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety. \nShe reaches out, touches him gently. \nBut the moment is broken by... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses to glance into the car. \nELI Is the English dead? \nRACHEL No... \nELI Looks dead... \nAnd together they begin to lift Book from the car and place him in the back of the springwagon. And... \nINT. LAMP FARMHOUSE \nWhere Eli is looking out a window. \nHIS POV \u0096 BUGGY \nAn Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car. \nANGLE IN BEDROOM \nWhere Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with warm water from a pan. \nEli appears in the doorway. \nELI Stoltzfus is coming. \nRachel looks at him, nods. \nEli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly folded clothes on a chair near the bed. \nELI That has no place in this house. \nRACHEL I know. \nShe picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places them in a chest. \nRACHEL It will go when he goes. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nAs Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage son, LEVI. \nRACHEL Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus. \nStoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed: \nSTOLTZFUS That's the English is it? \nINT. SICKROOM \u0096 TIGHT \nAs Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of Book's wound: \nSTOLTZFUS (O.S.) I feel... burning. \nWIDER \nAs Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the examination. \nFinally he steps back. \nSTOLTZFUS This man should be treated in town. (indicates) The bullet entered there... and came out there. But there is the danger of infection, and he has lost a great deal of blood. \nRachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her dilemma. \nHer eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room: \nRACHEL Go help Levi with the car, Samuel. \nShe closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and Stoltzfus: \n", "test2_id": 463, "test3_input": "BACK TO SCENE \nAs Book leans forward in his chair. \nBOOK Hey, Sam... \nSAMUEL ...I want to say a thing. \nBOOK (sitting up) What's that, Sam? \nThe boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving the door open behind him. \nANGLE \u0096 BOOK \nLooking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he speaks softly: \nBOOK Same to you, Sam. \nAfter another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door that Samuel has left open behind him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \u0096 BOOK \nFrom the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks softly: \nBOOK Sam? \nNo answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen. \nINT. LAPP WASHHOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nWhere Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub. \nShe replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back of a chair. \nThen she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath. \nRACHEL'S POV \u0096 FRYING PAN \nThe gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRachel hesitates for a moment \u0096 and in that moment she makes a choice. \nSlowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his eyes. \nAnd for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, for an instant, a woman of Book's world. \nBOOK \nAs he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable to make it happen. \nAnd suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting it on, looks away. \nBOOK \nTIGHTENING to him, and... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAPP FARM \u0096 DAWN \nREESTABLISHING... \nANGLE \u0096 HEN YARD \nWhere Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens. \nA beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as she senses his presence. \nBook watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing them in the fold of her apron. \nWhen he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work. \nBOOK Last night. \nShe goes very still, but keeps her back to him. \nBOOK If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't leave. \nShe lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from him. \nBook continues to stare at her. \nEXT. RURAL ROAD \u0096 LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 DAY \nThe Lapp carriage on a winding lane. \nINT. BUGGY (MOVING) \n", "test3_true": "A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all Book can do to keep from flinching. \nRachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her. \nBOOK Maybe I ought to learn to drive this thing. \nRachel says nothing. \nBOOK (beat) Pick myself up another useful skill. \nNow Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And... \nEXT. ANGLE \nWe can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, another buggy approaching at right angles. \nINT. LAPP BUGGY \nAs Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield. \nRACHEL Samuel, who is that? \nSamuel checks out the buggy. \nSAMUEL It looks like Hochstetler's mare. \nEXT. ANGLE \nAs the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy. \nINT. LAPP BUGGY \nAs Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel returns her greeting: \nBOOK (teasing her) Uh oh, they're leaving us behind. \nRachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick \u0096 the race is on. \nRACE MONTAGE \nHochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together with his young sister \u0096 at first they're not aware of the race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly. \nIt's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers of Samuel and Book. \nEXT. SALZBURGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nIt's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're everywhere \u0096 taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves. \nBook and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing smoke pulls up nearby. \nRachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She waggles the camera at him... \nTOURIST LADY Could I... ah, you know? \nBOOK (smiling) Lady, if you take my picture, I'll rip your brassiere off and strangle you with it. \nThe Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back from whence she came. \nINT. STORE \nRachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention as the shopping. \nBook is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN to him, and... \nBOOK Lieutenant Elton Carter, please. \nA beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia Police Department switchboard: \nVOICE Are you a member of the family? \nBOOK What? I'm a friend of his. \nVOICE I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter was killed in the line of duty... \nBook hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a second number. \nINT. HALLWAY, SCHAEFFER'S HOME \u0096 DAY \nSchaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily shocked. \nShe calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation. \nMRS. SCHAEFFER How are you, John? \nPaul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called away from the Saturday afternoon game. \nMRS. SCHAEFFER (covering mouthpiece) John Book! \n", "test3_id": 464}

{"train": "WITNESS \n\"WITNESS\" \nby \nEarl W. Wallace \nWilliam Kelley \nPamela Wallace \nEXT. LANCASTER COUNTY, PA. COUNTRYSIDE \u0096 DAY \nTITLE SEQUENCE \nThe faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish. \nEXT. COUNTRY LANE \u0096 DAY \nThrough the last traces of early morning mist another group of black-clad figures make their way down a lane. \nEXT. COUNTRY LANE \u0096 DAY \nAn Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces. \nFramed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired like his father, peering out. \nThe horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES on the pavement. \nANOTHER LANE \nTwo Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory. \nVALLEY \nA BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse. \nBARNYARD \nWhere literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of the barn. \nEXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \u0096 FRONT PORCH \nAs the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women and children presumably first). \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \nThe coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen partially covering the bearded face. \nEND TITLE SEQUENCE \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \nPartitions have been removed, making the central rooms of the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred- fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy a special Place. \nRACHEL LAPP \nA young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and drawn. \nIn happier circumstances, although there haven't been too many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence. \nEight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events. \nAnd the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered \u0096 yet not unkind \u0096 features grief-stricken. \nTHE MOURNERS \nTheir faces... \nCLOCK \nAs it begins to CHIME nine a.m. \nFAVORING PREACHER \nAs he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation remove their hats also. \nThen the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect: \nSUBTITLES OVER. \nPREACHER ...a brother has been called home. God has spoken through the death of our neighbor, Jacob Lapp... \nTHE FAMILY \nWhere Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as: \nPREACHER ...husband of Rachel, father to Samuel, son of Eli. (and) His chair is empty, his bed is empty, his voice will be heard no more. He was needed in our presence, but God needs such men, too. That one should be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. Still, we would not wish him back. Rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him. \nEXT. TRAIN \u0096 DAY \nThe ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly forward. \nINT. TRAIN (MOVING) \nAs Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him to light up. \nSAMUEL Look, Mama...! \nHIS POV THROUGH WINDOW \nA road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs Rachel smiles. \nRACHEL I see, darling. \nAnd Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he can. \nEXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE \u0096 DAY \nThe train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish farmers working their horse-drawn equipment. \nSERIES OF CUTS \nAs the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots and fast food outlets. \nEXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS \nAs the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets choked with cars and the gutters with filth. \nINT. TRAIN (MOVING) \nNow Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, almost apprehension: \nSAMUEL Is this where we're going? \nRACHEL Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore. \nAnd Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the window. \nINT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA \u0096 DAY \nRachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress of the two Amish \u0096 particularly Samuel's black coat and hat \u0096 are drawing curious stares. \nSAMUEL \nHe's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a little girl about his own age, standing in line with her parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother... \nANGLE \nAs Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, from appearances, be an Amishman. \nSamuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we discover that he is a Hasidic Jew. \nSAMUEL \nAs he reacts. \nBACK TO TICKET COUNTER \nAs Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and she shows him her ticket. \nRACHEL We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where is that train, please? \nTICKET SELLER Delayed three hours. You'll hear an announcement when it's time to board. \nHe starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and puts it on his head. \nANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM \nAs Samuel enters. \nIt's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops before one of the urinals \u0096 a long, trough-like affair with water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel. \nIt's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, stoops to see which are empty. \nHIS POV \u0096 TOILETS \nBeneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel is alone in the restroom. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up. \nTwo other men have entered the men's room; one is a large BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and a short leather jacket. \nCUT TO: \nDOOR \u0096 MEN'S' ROOM \nThe diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black partner \u0096 about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing a suit, Carter is much more casually \u0096 almost disreputably \u0096 dressed. \nCUT TO: \nBENCH \nLittle Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN. \nBOOK You found the body? \nCUSTODIAN Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported it. It was the kid. \nBOOK What kid? \nCUSTODIAN How'n hell do I know what kid? The kid in the funny black threads. \nTIGHT SHOT \u0096 SAMUEL \nWorry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move suddenly to his left. \nBOOK'S LEGS \u0096 SAMUEL'S POV \nComing in at full stride, then stopping. \nSAMUEL \nHe doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then... \nANGLE \u0096 BOOK \nAs his face breaks into a big grin, and... \nBOOK Hi, kid. \nRACHEL \nImmediately alarmed, intervening. \nRACHEL What do you want of my son? \nTHE SCENE \nAs Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield. \nBOOK I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name? \nRACHEL Samuel. Samuel Lapp. (then, quickly) But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon. \nBOOK There'll be another train. (turns to Samuel) The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there. \nSAMUEL (stammers) I saw him. \nBOOK Who'd you see? \nSam looks at his mother. \nBOOK Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor? \nSAMUEL No... I saw the man who killed him. \nBook stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to Carter. \nBOOK Anybody know about this? \nCARTER I didn't even know about it. \nBOOK (back to Sam) Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? \nSAMUEL (groping, touching his clothes and pointing at Carter) He was... like him. \nBOOK (nods) Black... I understand. What else,Sam? \nA beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather slightly built partner: \nSAMUEL Not Zwartich, like him \u0096 \nBook frowns, puzzled: \nBOOK Try that one again, Sam \u0096 \nSamuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter: \nRACHEL May I talk to you? \nANGLE \nBook drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened storefronts. \nCarter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST EVERY FEW MINUTES. \nCARTER I got there late, John. \nBOOK Let's just find Coalmine. (beat) Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens \nCARTER (grimly) It won't happen again. \nRACHEL Where are you taking us? \nBOOK We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area. \nRACHEL You have no right to keep us here. \nBOOK Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide. \nRACHEL You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws! \nBOOK Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that. \nRACHEL It's not a joke. \nBook decides to try contrition: \nBOOK You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, I know a little about the Amish. I know this has to be an ordeal for you; and I'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved. \nSamuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book frowns. \nBOOK What was that? \nRACHEL He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you. \nBook eyes Samuel: \nBOOK Book. John Book \nEXT. 13TH ST. STATION \u0096 NIGHT \nBook's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's side window. \nINT. BOOK'S CAR \u0096 NIGHT \nBook lowers the window. \nBOOK Sammy, where's Coalmine? \nThe little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the back seat. \nSAMMY What you got there, the Salvation Army? \nBOOK Coalmine. \nSAMMY Try \"Happy Valley\". \nEXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nBook's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get out, and move swiftly inside. \nINT. HAPPY VALLEY \u0096 NIGHT \nSixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their move... \nEXT. HAPPY VALLEY \u0096 NIGHT \nAs Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see Coalmine is not the killer. \nAs Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's face down next to the car window. \nBOOK Put some light on him. \nA cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over Coalmine's face. \nBOOK (continuing; to Samuel) Look at him. \nCrazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at Samuel inside the car: \nSamuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative. \nCoalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing his face up against the front window. His face takes on a grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he gets back in the car. \nRACHEL John Book, you listen to me! I will have no further part in this, nor will my son! As God stands between us! \nBook sighs, starts the engine and moves off. \nEXT. HOTEL \u0096 PHILADELPHIA \u0096 NIGHT \nBook pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN moves to open the rear door. \nBOOK \nAlready starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as: \nMCELROY \nComing right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. And McElroy still smiling as: \nBOOK \nHit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send Book down hard and grasping. \nMCELROY \nLowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book toward McElroy. \nHe smiles at them. \nBOOK \nDown, muttering CURSES. \nTHE SCENE \nAs McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, keeps on going... and is gone. \nBOOK \nGROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And we HEAR \u0096 from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream. \nSCHAEFFER (V.O.) Who else knows? \nBOOK (V.O.) Just us. \nAs the lights of an oncoming car \u0096 going very slowly, on its way to a parking space \u0096 sweep over him and we HEAR it come to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the oncomers, \nANGLE \nA fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of Book, looks on edgily: \nMAN Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little too much to drink? \nBook stares at him, then looks down at his belly. \nBOOK'S WOUND \nAs Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage). \nTHE SCENE \nAs the man stares: \nMAN Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a hospital! (and) Here; I'll give you a hand. \nHe starts to approach, but Book shoves him away. \nBOOK No! No hospital! \nBy now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance: \nWIFE Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to die in the street, that's his business! \nBut the man is not content: \nMAN Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at that blood? \nBook has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to intercept him: \nMAN Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed to death! \nBook whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed squarely at the fat man's face: \nMAN Shit! \nWIFE (quavering) I told you, Henry! \nBook doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back toward his car. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 PHILADELPHIA \u0096 NIGHT \nAs Book's car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic. \nINT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) \nBook has a gym bag open on the seat next to him, is stuffing a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood. And... \nINT. CARTER'S APARTMENT \u0096 BEDROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nAs he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps on a lamp... He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him. \nRACHEL No, he must stay here. \nStoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And: \nELI Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws \u0096 \nRACHEL We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows! \nELI Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands. \nRACHEL I know God help me, I know that, Eli. (then) But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel. \nRachel beseeches them helplessly: \nRACHEL What else can we do? \nEXT. LAPP DRIVE \nLevi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel catching a ride on the bumper. \nRACHEL \nWhere she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors. \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM \nAs Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to Rachel: \nSTOLTZFUS Make a poultice... three parts milk, two parts linseed oil... for the infection. \nI'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself. \nRACHEL Thank you. \nStoltzfus turns to Eli: \nSTOLTZFUS Lapp, I'll have to speak with the diener on this matter. \nELI (nods) As you see fit, Stoltzfus. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SICKROOM \u0096 LAPS FARM \u0096 NIGHT \nAs Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered. \nBook's brow is beaded with sweat. \nRachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat- soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on display here just now than she's quite comfortable with. \nShe begins to apply the poultice. \nANGLE \nAs Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he recoils with alarm. \nRACHEL It's all right! You have got to lie still. \nBook stares up at her without recognition, but some of what she says seems to penetrate. He quiets. \nRACHEL (soothingly) Yes, much better... \nANGLE \nAs Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so. \nShe finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at first, then the words take shape \u0096 swear words; curses; fuck this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind her. \nINT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE \u0096 DAY \nHe's on the phone: \nSCHAEFFER Looks like we're going to need some help from you folks down there. \nINT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE \u0096 DAY \nWhere an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone: \nUNDERSHERIFF ...want to help any way we can, Chief, but you got to understand we've got upwards of seven thousand Amish over here. \nAnd that's just Lancaster County. \nINTERCUT SCHAEFFER \nWho is trying to control his impatience: \nSCHAEFFER I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should simplify your work. \nThe Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down to. \nRACHEL See. Anyway, you don't have any clothes on. And besides that, Bishop Tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel better. \nThe elders appear to have concluded their conference, and are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside. \nSTOLTZFUS Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. And drink my of my tea. \nHe goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel puts the teacup to his lips. \nBOOK Tell him his tea stinks. \nRACHEL (smiles) You tell him. When you're able. \nHe looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises. \nRACHEL (from the door) We're all very happy that you're going to live, John Book. We didn't quite know what we were going to do with you if you died. \nThat penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into sleep again. \nINT. LAPP LIVING ROOM \u0096 DAY \nAs the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns: \nHERSHBERGER ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious. \nTSCHANTZ It is not the first time we have done this. In the Englischer war of the revolution, old Elmer Miller's grandfather took in gunshot English soldiers. (a tad of pride) Saved them, too. \nThey all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then: \nERB Still, he should be among his own people. \nRachel enters on this last. \nRACHEL He'll leave as soon as he is able. He already wants to go. \nHershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus: \nHERSHBERGER How long will that be, Stoltzfus? \nSTOLTZFUS (shrugs) A month. Maybe less. With God's healing love. \nEXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE \u0096 PHILADELPHIA \u0096 DAY \nSchaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine opens it cautiously, peers out. \nELAINE (half fearfully) Did you find him? \nSCHAEFFER Not yet. \nSuddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door: \nELAINE Then go away, you bastard. \nSchaeffer quickly \u0096 but gently \u0096 prevents her from shutting it. \nSCHAEFFER Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position. \nELAINE (bitterly) He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know \u0096 anybody who knows John \u0096 knows that's a goddamn lie! \nSCHAEFFER (smoothly) Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name. \nELAINE (cuts in) Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace! \nSCHAEFFER Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him \u0096 \nELAINE (clipped) I don't know where he is. \nSCHAEFFER But... if you had to guess? \nANOTHER ANGLE \u0096 SCHAEFFER'S CAR \nMcElroy watching. \nTHEIR POV \u0096 FRONT DOOR \nWe see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his car. \nINT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR \nAs Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into the seat, beside McElroy. \nMCELROY She say where he is? \nSCHAEFFER I don't think she knows. \nSchaeffer is staring grimly ahead. \nSCHAEFFER What about Carter? \nMCELROY Tight. But I'm working on him. \nELI The gun \u0096 that gun of the hand \u0096 is for the taking of human life. Would you kill another man? Eh? \nSamuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially. \nELI What you take into your hands, you take into your heart. \nA beat, then Samuel musters some defiance. \nSAMUEL I would only kill a bad man. \nELI Only a bad man. I see. And you know these bad men on sight? You are able to look into their hearts and see this badness? \nSAMUEL I can see what they do. \nNow he meets Eli's eyes: \nSAMUEL I have seen it. \nEli expels a deep sigh; then: \nELI And having seen, you would become one of them? (intent... gesturing) Don't you see...? The hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the head... leads the heart. The one goes into the other into the other into the other... And you have changed, and gone amongst them... \nHe breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly into the tabletop with enormous intensity: \nELI \"Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord!\" \nELI (indicating pistol; continuing from Corinthians 6:17) \"And touch not the unclean thing!\" \nHis intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely impressive. \nEXT. WASHHOUSE \u0096 NEAR KITCHEN \u0096 NIGHT \nBook stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come out from the kitchen. \nEXT. BARN \u0096 LAPP FARM \u0096 DAY \nSamuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the traces of the buggy. \nINT. BOOK'S BEDROOM \u0096 DAY \nBook stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table. \nThere's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. She smiles. \nRACHEL Enjoying your reading? \nBOOK Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. (eyes the clothing) What's that? \nRACHEL Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these. \nShe passes the clothes to Book. \nBOOK Your husband's? \nRACHEL Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers. \nShe continues, cheerfully. \nRACHEL I should tell you these do not have buttons. (shows him) See? Hooks and eyes. \nBOOK Something wrong with buttons? \nRACHEL Buttons are Hochmut. \nBOOK Hochmut? \nRACHEL Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain. \nBOOK (nodding) Anything against zippers? \nRACHEL (almost blushing) You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint. \nBOOK Quaint? Can't imagine why. \nShe smiles. \nBOOK Where's the nearest telephone? \nRACHEL Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even. \nBOOK No. I'd want a public phone. \nRachel's face clouds. \nRACHEL Well... the store at Saltzburg... (then briskly) But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while. \nBOOK I'm going this morning. \nRACHEL But Stoltzfus said... \nBOOK Make that 1790. \nHe hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the store. \nINT. BARN \u0096 DAY \nBook works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted under the front seat of the Lapp buggy. \nEli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the disapproving look. \nELI If you are well enough to do that thing, you can do work for me. \nBook is genuinely apologetic. \nBOOK Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do? \nELI Maybe milking. \nBOOK (eyes Eli) Milking? \nELI Cows. You know, cows? \nBOOK I've seen pictures. \nELI Good, you start tomorrow. \nINT. BOOK'S ROOM \u0096 LAPP FARM \u0096 NIGHT \nWhere Book lies asleep. A beat, then Eli comes in carrying a lamp. \nHe pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump: \nELI (briskly) Veck oufl. Time for milking. \nBook comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his watch. \nINSERT WATCHFACE \nIt reads 4:30 a.m. \nBACK TO BOOK \nAs he stares at it in disbelief. \nINT. BARN \nAs the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused. \nSAMUEL \nWhere he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs. \nBOOK, ELI \nWhere the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from scalding milk cans rising behind her). \nELI Good, firm twist and pull, eh? (and) Right. Now you try it. \nBook gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book bends to his task. \nELI Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before? \nBOOK (grimly) Not one this big. \nEli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars him. \nThen he moves off. Book bends to his task, and... \nANGLE \u0096 RACHEL \nGrinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand. \nAs he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel milk can. \nEXT. BARN \nAs the milk herd is released back into the pasture. Book crosses into the f.g., stares OFF SCREEN. \nBOOK'S POV \u0096 HORIZON \nAnd dawnfire etching the hilltops. The BELLHOUSE behind the house, the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its small roof. \nBACK TO BOOK \nSomething in him can't help but respond to the beauty. \nA beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn. \nEXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \u0096 DAY \nBOOK Oh? (and) What happened to Hochstetler? \nRACHEL We had some lemonade and he left. \nBOOK A real fireball. \nRachel smiles. Book crosses to a workbench and selects another tool. \nRACHEL You know carpentry? \nBOOK I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school. \nRACHEL What else can you do? \nBOOK (really annoyed) I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking. \nRACHEL Whacking is not of much use on a farm. \nBOOK Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job. \nRACHEL I'm sorry. I'm sure it is. \nShe turns, starts to go. Then turns back, eyeing his makeshift garb: \nRACHEL Tonight I'll let out those trousers for you. \nStifling a smile, she goes. HOLD on Book a beat, then... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAPP FARMHOUSE \u0096 DINING ROOM \nEli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount of food. \nEli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him: \nELI Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite? \nBOOK Guess I'm not used to so much. \nELI (snorts) Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite. \nBook swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes: \nRACHEL Eli, John is a carpenter. (conciliatory afterthought) As well as being a fine policeman. \nELI Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter. \nBook can't refuse the challenge. \nBOOK Sure. \nRACHEL But... You may not be well enough. \nBOOK I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea. \nEXT. / INT. BARN \u0096 NIGHT \nAs Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp buggy. \nHe glances up as she enters: \nBOOK Hi... \nAs she sets her lamp down near the one he's using. \nRACHEL (beat) When will you be going? \nBOOK Not long... A few days. \nAnother beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the battery power, hits the radio \u0096 and suddenly from the Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major inventions \u0096 rock and roll. \nIt fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in Amish. \nRachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel alternately protesting and laughing. \nBOOK You like it... Don't you? \nRachel, confused, protests: \nRACHEL No... You just stop \u0096 \nBut she doesn't really want to. Book grins: \nBOOK (mock alarm) Next thing you know you'll be off drinking beer and racing motorcycles. \nAnd it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing. \nANGLE \u0096 THE BARN DOOR \nBook approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches. \nBook starts to talk gently to the animal: \nBOOK All right, you nasty son of a bitch, we're going to be friends whether you like it or not. \nThen, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall gate. \nANGLE \nAs Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, brings out some lumps of sugar. \nBOOK See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't you for Christ's sake? \nFinally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends to eat. Book nods with satisfaction. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled expression. \nRACHEL (surprised) Well... \nBook turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment! \nBOOK Won him over just like that. \nRACHEL I see. (and) But I hope you have a lot of sugar. (then, going) Eli is ready to go to Zook's. \nJust then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go: \nBOOK Later. \nAnd we... \nEXT. ZOOK FARM \u0096 LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 DAY \nBIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising. \nIn the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun raising the main supports on the already laid foundation. \nElsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot coffee and cold lemonade for the men, \nLAPP BUGGY \nAs Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the construction site. \nELI Wait here 'til I find a gang you can work with. \nHe goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and more workmen and their families climb out. \nEli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad face breaks into a grin: \nHOCHSTETLER Book! Good to see you! \nHe pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused. \nHochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance. \nAnd Book realizes it as well. \nHOCHSTETLER Eli says you're a carpenter, Book. \nBOOK It's been a while. \nHOCHSTETLER No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter. \nWith that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and ushers him away. Rachel calls after them: \nRACHEL Good luck. \nBOOK / HOCHSTETLER \nAs they move off. \nHOCHSTETLER Your hole is healed, then? \nBOOK (gives him a look) Pretty much. \nHochstetler nods with satisfaction: \nHOCHSTETLER Good. Then you can go home. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCUTS \nAs the morning progresses: \n...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the gang. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs Book leans forward in his chair. \nBOOK Hey, Sam... \nSAMUEL ...I want to say a thing. \nBOOK (sitting up) What's that, Sam? \nThe boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving the door open behind him. \nANGLE \u0096 BOOK \nLooking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he speaks softly: \nBOOK Same to you, Sam. \nAfter another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door that Samuel has left open behind him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \u0096 BOOK \nFrom the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks softly: \nBOOK Sam? \nNo answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen. \nINT. LAPP WASHHOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nWhere Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub. \nShe replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back of a chair. \nThen she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath. \nRACHEL'S POV \u0096 FRYING PAN \nThe gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRachel hesitates for a moment \u0096 and in that moment she makes a choice. \nSlowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his eyes. \nAnd for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, for an instant, a woman of Book's world. \nBOOK \nAs he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable to make it happen. \nAnd suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting it on, looks away. \nBOOK \nTIGHTENING to him, and... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAPP FARM \u0096 DAWN \nREESTABLISHING... \nANGLE \u0096 HEN YARD \nWhere Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens. \nA beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as she senses his presence. \nBook watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing them in the fold of her apron. \nWhen he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work. \nBOOK Last night. \nShe goes very still, but keeps her back to him. \nBOOK If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't leave. \nShe lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from him. \nBook continues to stare at her. \nEXT. RURAL ROAD \u0096 LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 DAY \nThe Lapp carriage on a winding lane. \nINT. BUGGY (MOVING) \nSCHAEFFER I'll take it in the study. \nINT. STUDY / STORE \u0096 DAY \nSchaeffer takes the phone. \nSCHAEFFER You can hang up, dear. \nWe HEAR the click of the other phone, \nBOOK You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out. \nSCHAEFFER (beat) How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad. \nBOOK I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you. \nSCHAEFFER (quickly) Johnny \u0096 \nBOOK You might want to pass it along to Mac. \nSCHAEFFER (urgently) Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in \u0096 \nBOOK I've already got something worked out. (and) Be seeing you. \nBook hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on Schaeffer. \nBook has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the situation. \nHe straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General Store. \nINT. BUGGY \u0096 MAIN STREET \u0096 SALTZBURG \u0096 DAY \nBook, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists and traffic. \nEXT. NARROW SIDE STREET \u0096 SALTZBURG \u0096 DAY \nThe buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road \u0096 several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, facing the buggy. \nINT. LAPP BUGGY \u0096 DAY \nAs Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally stopping. \nRachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks at Book. \nRachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm. \nRACHEL Do nothing. This happens from time to time. \nShe senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly. \nRACHEL It's not our way, John. We'll have nothing to do with violence! John! \nBook shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the... \nEXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY \u0096 DAY \nHochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various jeers and taunts from the English lads \u0096 various jokes about them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John Book. \nYOUTH Here comes another one! \nBook stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth flicks off Book's hat. \nBOOK (quietly) You're making a mistake. \nHochstetler calls from his buggy. \nHOCHSTETLER Everything is all right, John. \nBOOK (to the youth) Pick up the hat. \nThe youth momentarily unsure \u0096 something about Book's tone of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A pause, then Book explodes. \nThe kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction of the Lapp farm. \nThe youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD LOCAL addresses Rachel. \nLOCAL MAN Never seen anything like that in all my years. \nRACHEL (covering) He's from... Ohio... My cousin. \nLOCAL MAN We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different. (addresses a gathering crow) Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them. \nRACHEL John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant. \nLOCAL MAN (to Rachel) You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you? \nRACHEL Yes. Samuel! We're going. \nA second man calls from the pickup. \nCLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book. \nANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach. \nBIG WIDE ANGLE \nThe light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as Rachel reaches Book and they embrace. \nEXT. FIELD BY ROAD \u0096 NIGHT \nBook and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still warm earth and make love. \nEXT. SOUDERSBURG CAFE \u0096 LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 NIGHT \nESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the morning. \nTIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows. \nINT. CARE \nA booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF \u0096 an expansive politician type \u0096 are seated. \nThe Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, pointing directions to Schaeffer: \nSHERIFF There... White Oak Road a couple of miles before it ties into two-twenty- two. Got it? \nSCHAEFFER Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff. \nSHERIFF My man Holmes here put it together. Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the doctor at the hospital. \nSCHAEFFER Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked on the phone. (nods at Holmes) Good work. \nUNDERSHERIFF Sure you don't want us to post some backup units? \nSCHAEFFER If we need any help, we'll give you a shout. I'd like to slip in there quiet, then get out before we attract any attention. \nEXT. CAFE PORCH \u0096 DAY \nAs Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes and the Sheriff watch after them. \nHOLMES Maybe I'll take a drive over that way. \nSHERIFF Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry. \nBut Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out. \nEXT. RURAL LANE \u0096 LANCASTER COUNTY \u0096 DAWN \nWith the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the Lapp driveway and comes to a halt. \nIn the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings. \nHOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn. \nANGLE \nGOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in the chill, eyes the terrain: \nMCELROY Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into? \nSCHAEFFER They don't have any shit. \nINT. KITCHEN \u0096 DAWN \nWhere Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. Rachel is beginning the dishes. \nINT. BARN \u0096 DAWN \nBook and Samuel are starting the morning milking... \nINT. KITCHEN \u0096 DAWN \nEli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified. \nSCHAEFFER (to Fergie) Outside \u0096 (to Mac) Check out the rest of the house. \nHe turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room. \nSchaeffer flashes his badge: \nSCHAEFFER We're police officers. We're looking for a fugitive, John Book. He's living here? \nELI I have nothing to say to you. Get out of my house! \nSCHAEFFER You speak English. Good. Now listen \nRACHEL (recovering) No, you listen. Get out! \nSCHAEFFER Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal. (ingratiating) He's got a gun, hasn't he? \nAs he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh straw. \nBook eases back alongside Luke, waits. \nBACK TO FERGIE \nAs he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch. \nBOOK \u0096 FLASH CUT \nAs the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy explode in an horrendous SCREAM. \nFERGIE \nBowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half like a matchstick. \nBOOK \nAs he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the barn. \nFERGIE \nFallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle and he collapses atop Fergie. \nEXT. BARN \u0096 DAY \nMcElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound of the shots. Then starting slowly forward. \nSCHAEFFER \nOn the porch of the house, looking toward the barn. \nEXT. FIELD \u0096 DAY \nSome distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still REVERBERATING across the quiet fields. \nSAMUEL (stricken) Mr. Book? \nHe hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the barns. \nEXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH \u0096 DAY \nRachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously toward the barns. Starts out.

FIELD \u0096 DAY \nSamuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on. \nINT. BARN \u0096 DAY \nMcElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, stops short, stares off screen. \nHIS POV \u0096 FERGIE \nWhere he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, his head crushed like an eggshell. \nBACK TO MCELROY \nMCELROY \nFIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY POPS UP. \nANGLE \nAs McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES twice. \nMCELROY'S POV \u0096 LAPP BUGGY \nThe buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off. \nEXT. BARNYARD \u0096 DAY \nSamuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of the rockerarm. \nHe hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of his head, his face set against the tears that move down his cheeks. \nSCHAEFFER \nComes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. He still can't see Samuel. \nHIS POV \u0096 THE PORCH \nAs Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps. \nSCHAEFFER \nTurning, SHOUTING: \nSCHAEFFER You stay put! \nRACHEL \nShe stops. She is also unable to see Samuel. \nSCHAEFFER \nMoving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him. \nEXT. FIELDS \u0096 DAY \nBeyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, Stotlzfus and others \u0096 including Hochstetler and his brothers \u0096 are baling the first cutting of June hay. \nBut the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating. \nBut now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward Samuel. \nEXT. BARNYARD \u0096 DAY \nAs Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS: \nSCHAEFFER Cut that out! \nSamuel looks at him, keeps on pulling. \nSchaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs on grimly. \nSchaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several threads, so he FIRES again. \nThe rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness right then and there. \nBut a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He SNARLS at Sam: \nSCHAEFFER Get down to the house and stay there! \nSamuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off. \nRACHEL \nAlready halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in her arms... then to lead him back toward the house. \nSCHAEFFER \nTurning, starting very slowly toward the barn. \nINT. BARN \u0096 DAY \nMcElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing over, placing his feet on the rungs. \nBOOK \nHe stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks at him with its horns. Book waits, watches. \nHIS POV \u0096 MCELROY \nVisible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering the rungs. \nBACK TO BOOK \nINT. BARN \u0096 DAY \nSchaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent shotgun shell near the hayfork... \nINT. SILO \u0096 DAY \nBook listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on his side, starts silently up. \nMCELROY \nClimbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand. \nBOOK \nHe climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the distance to the floor, starts upward again. \nBARN YARD \u0096 DAY \nThe Amish beginning to arrive.

SILO \u0096 DAY \nBook has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one side as best he can... hangs there, listening. \nMCELROY \nRattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard. \nBOOK \nListening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, raps on the board smartly once. \nMCELROY \nStartled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety. \nBOOK \nWe HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it to the floor. \nMcELROY \u0096 FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet to the bottom of the silo. \nBOOK \nHe falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies stunned. \nMCELROY \nHis forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as... \nTIGHT ON BOOK \nBlinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle is placed firmly against Book's temple. \nWIDER \nSchaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a SOUND behind him. He snaps around. \nWHAT HE SEES \nOld Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on as: \nSCHAEFFER \nHe eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly: \nSCHAEFFER Okay, Johnny. On your feet. \nTHE SCENE \nAs Book struggles to his feet \u0096 Schaeffer holding the pistol tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, blinks. \nSchaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward Samuel, he speaks quietly: \nBOOK It's okay, Sam. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in at the inert McElroy) follow and... \nEXT.

I'll pour you some coffee. \nELAINE You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work? \nRACHEL (smiles) I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. (and) Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit. \nRachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to storm. \nELAINE Oh, is that so? (and) No offense, lady, but I'm not so sure I like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down! \nRachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst: \nRACHEL Please, I didn't mean... \nAbruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's hands. \nShe mops furiously as she Continues: \nELAINE I know exactly what you meant! Listen, maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, but maybe I don't have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids! (and) It's none of your business, but I don't happen to have a man around here full time. So I sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes I can even pay the rent on time! So maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe I don't need to have it jammed down my throat like this. \nShe finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER: \nELAINE There is that clean enough for you? \nRachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen. \nFRED Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and leave you a broom? \nNot a politic observation on Fred's part. \n", "test1_true": "And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares after her. \nFRED What's bugging her? \nUnperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure. \nINT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM \nAs Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing. \nRACHEL I brought your coffee. \nShe takes a seat next to the bed. \nRACHEL I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. \nAfter a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together: \nELAINE It's okay. (and) Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. It's like... somehow... I've let everything get away from me. And you sort of made me face it. \nShe takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private thought. \nELAINE What's so funny? \nRACHEL Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him. \nELAINE (disparing) God, Fred... \nRACHEL At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way. \nELAINE No? Why not? \nRACHEL You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. (then) But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night. \nELAINE Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay? \nRachel smiles. \nRACHEL Okay. \nINT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) \u0096 DAY \nBook glances irritably at Rachel: \nBOOK Now what's the problem? \nRACHEL The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people. \nBook gives her a look: \nBOOK Whacking? \nRACHEL (firmly) Yes. And I also want to leave this city. \nBOOK Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify. \nRACHEL We do not go into your courts. \nBOOK People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail. \nRachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly note for a beat. \nBOOK Look, I'm genuinely sorry... \nRACHEL (snaps) No you're not \u0096 (off his look) You're glad, because now you've got a witness. (and) I heard the other police talking last night. (and) They don't seem to like you very much. \nBOOK They kid a lot. \nRACHEL (glances at him) I would not be too sure. \nSamuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look. \nRACHEL He says you look very tired. I thought the same thing. \nBook says nothing. \nRACHEL But not a good tired. \nBOOK What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired. \nShe doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility. \nINT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM \u0096 POLICE H.Q. \u0096 DAY \nSamuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. Samuel shakes his head \u0096 another negative. \nBook winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an inquiring look. It's a peace offering. \n", "test2_input": "Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at Samuel. \nBOOK (to Rachel) Just wanted to see if you were on your toes. \nEXT. CITY PARK \u0096 DAY \nBook, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of hot dogs heaped with kraut. \nBook watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. Rachel eyes him a beat. then: \nRACHEL Your sister said you don't have a family? \nBOOK No. \nRACHEL She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility. \nBook gives her a look: \nBOOK Oh? Anything else? \nRACHEL Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows. \nBook is staring at her. Rachel nods. \nRACHEL I think that's what she said. \nJust then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles proudly. \nRACHEL Good appetite. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION \u0096 DAY \nRachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads \"Narcotics Division.\" \nRachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially open door. \nINT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q. \u0096 DAY \nA group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid conversation by the opening of the main office door. They stare in considerable surprise. \nCUT TO: \nJOHN BOOK \nStanding in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand. \nBOOK Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a little help. \nINT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION \u0096 DAY \nA Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker. \nThe Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously \u0096 internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the working policemen in any department. \nKAMAN There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone for you. \nBook gets up and moves to the door. \nKAMAN And, Captain, don't want to rush you, but I'm gonna need these files back in a half hour. We got a lot of work to do round here. \nThe two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his perch and following the direction taken by Book. \nINT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION \u0096 DAY \nThrough glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in a cubicle of an office. \nSamuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the bustle of the squadroom. \nHe crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of outstanding duty and achievement. \nANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE \nAs Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway. \nUntil suddenly he freezes. \nSAMUEL'S POV \u0096 NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT \nEnlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: \"Division Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project\". Accompanying the item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy \u0096 clearly the black man who murdered the young cop in the train station men's room. \nBACK TO SAMUEL \nHe stares, transfixed. \n", "test2_true": "He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. He smiles gently at the boy. \nINT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) \u0096 PHILADELPHIA \u0096 DUSK \nRachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding Samuel close. Book glances at her: \nRACHEL Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman? \nBOOK (snaps) Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops. (eases up) I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved. \nRachel shakes her head. \nRACHEL But why would they murder... \nBOOK Because \u0096 somehow \u0096 they knew I was getting close. (and) Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. (and) And they can get away with it because they're cops. \nRACHEL (beat, then) I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home. \nBOOK You'll be safe. You don't have to worry. \nShe says nothing. \nAnother beat, then: \nBOOK Look, they're thinking as long as they keep the killer out of Samuel's way, we can't make an I.D. There's no way they can know Samuel saw that photograph, so he's safe. \nHe glances at her, but she continues ahead. \nBOOK I mean it. You will be safe. \nSuddenly Rachel explodes: \nRACHEL Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS \u0096 NIGHT \nThe front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed inside. \nINT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY \u0096 NIGHT \nSchaeffer passes Book a drink. \nBook is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, closing on his quarry: \nBOOK It was McElroy, Paul. \nSchaeffer gives him a sharp look: \nBOOK Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. \nSCHAEFFER I hope you don't have any doubts about that. \nBOOK If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... (and) It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. (excited, explaining the thing eagerly) He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. (and) And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum. \nSCHAEFFER (beat) Who else knows? \nBOOK Just us. \nSCHAEFFER (shakes his head) Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up \nBOOK More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department. \nSCHAEFFER (nods) Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it. (then) I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you. \nSchaeffer pours himself another drink. \nSCHAEFFER What's your first move? \nBOOK (expels a breath) A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \u0096 PHILADELPHIA \u0096 NIGHT \nBook slams the front door of his car, checks it for being locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts to take a step... and looks up. \nWHAT HE SEES \nMcElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the other side of the parking lot crosswalk \nBACK TO BOOK \nFreezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught. \nMCELROY \nStill smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping bag (which he appeared to be carrying) \u0096 letting the shopping bag fall away as he does so \u0096 revealing a five-inch barrel Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES once. \n", "test3_input": "ANGLE PAST Book's desk calendar. Carter enters in the b.g., crosses quickly to the desk. He snaps on a light, thumbs a page of the calendar. Frowns. \nINSERT \nRachel's name and address scribbled on a page of the calendar. \nBACK TO SCENE \nANGLE \nA couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to give him a look.

CAR (MOVING) \nAs light colors the eastern horizon, Book is crossing into Lancaster County. \nBook glances at Rachel; she's asleep.

Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast. \nBOOK I can't. \nRACHEL What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial? \nBook starts the engine: \nBOOK (grimly) There isn't going to be one. \nRachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around in the barnyard. \nANGLE \nAs Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel. \nELI Who was that man? \nRACHEL His name is John Book. \nEli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries: \nSAMUEL Momma \u0096 look. \nThey glance in the direction Samuel is looking. \nTHEIR POV \u0096 BOOK'S CAR \nThe car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field.

STABLES \u0096 DAY \nEli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot. \nANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR \nWe see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. Momentarily he comes awake: \nRACHEL But John... why didn't you go to a hospital? \n", "test3_true": "RACHEL (bewildered) But why? \nBOOK Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me. \nRACHEL But \u0096 \nBook reaches up to grip her arm fiercely: \nBOOK And when they find me, they'll find your boy! \nHe slips under again.

Rachel is bathing his wound with warm water from a pan. \nEli appears in the doorway. \nELI Stoltzfus is coming. \nRachel looks at him, nods. \nEli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly folded clothes on a chair near the bed. \nELI That has no place in this house. \nRACHEL I know. \nShe picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places them in a chest. \nRACHEL It will go when he goes. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nAs Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage son, LEVI. \nRACHEL Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus. \nStoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed: \nSTOLTZFUS That's the English is it? \nINT. SICKROOM \u0096 TIGHT \nAs Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of Book's wound: \nSTOLTZFUS (O.S.) I feel... burning. \nWIDER \nAs Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the examination. \nFinally he steps back. \nSTOLTZFUS This man should be treated in town. (indicates) The bullet entered there... and came out there. But there is the danger of infection, and he has lost a great deal of blood. \nRachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her dilemma. \nHer eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room: \nRACHEL Go help Levi with the car, Samuel. \nShe closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and Stoltzfus: \n"}

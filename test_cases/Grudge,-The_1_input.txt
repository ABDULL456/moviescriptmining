INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Susan quickly draws the chain lock. Then she builds the courage to step forward, and look through the peephole -- 
HER POV: the phone lies broken in the middle of the floor. Otherwise, the hallway is empty. 
Susan backs away from the door, shaking in fright. 
Breathing hard, she backs into --

62    INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                        62 
Susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the bedroom phone from the wall. 
Then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on -- 
THE APARTMENT DOOR, next to the kitchen.    Silence. 
Susan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room, still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds. But she's alone in the room, isn't she? 
As we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter. The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence. 
And Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud, catches in her throat. 
A long moment of silence.   Then -- 
-- DRIP.   DRIP. 
It's coming from the KITCHEN SINK. 
Susan stares at it.   She finally stands, and --

Relieved, Susan turns away -- 
-- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense. 
Scared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink. 
She slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as tightly as she can manage -- 
-- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort.. 
Until the water stops.   Only then does she let go -- 
-- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY SPLASHING the surface.

Susan screams and runs back to her bedroom -- 
62b   INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                    62b 
She lies down, shivering, pulling the quilt to her chin.      A final retreat. 
SUSAN Please... stop it... 
The SPLASHING SOUNDS in the kitchen continue for a while. Then, it suddenly stops. 
Susan is so terrified that she almost faints. 
Then her breathing stops.   Her eyes widen. 
Her hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around -- 
-- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT. 
The one she left behind in the stairwell. 
Susan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body abruptly going stiff. We soon see why: 
A LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one. Moving slowly up Susan's body. Reaching the edge of the quilt, which slowly rises -- 
-- revealing a QUICK FLASH of the PALE FACE OF THE JAPANESE WOMAN WITH LONG DARK HAIR on top of her! 
Susan SCREAMS, and is abruptly pulled under the covers -- 
CUT TO BLACK.

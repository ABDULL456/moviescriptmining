Fade in to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. NIGHT. 72. We hear a cool rap song on soundtrack called \"NO BUDGET.\" (\"When we say action, we mean action, \nnobody's putting us in turnaround\") \n73. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 73. Wild \"Dailies\" party is in progress. LYLE is smoking crack and showing developed footage from that day's shoot on the wall of the warehouse as he dances lewdly with himself in place. LEWIS watches the \"dailies\" as he DJ's from turntables in booth while CHARDONNAY sexily raps the outlaw-film call-to-arms we hear on the soundtrack. PETIE and RODNEY torridly go-go dance on separate tables as PAM and DINAH writhe sexily to the beat on the dance floor. CECIL and CHERISH watch the gritty film rushes atop CECIL's bizarrely decored crane that doubles as their love nest. CECIL is frantically trying to write his script but CHERISH is pawing him, turned on by seeing herself on film. \nCHERISH Come on, Cecil, I want a little \"action\" of my own! \nCECIL (Gently pushing her away) I'm trying to write, Cherish! HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty, grainy, but very striking footage. RAVEN does a \"devil dance\" with herself and ritualistically drinks from a skull head. \nRAVEN \n(TO HONEY) Goat urine, want some? HONEY pales. \nRAVEN \n(HAPPILY) It's a Satan thing! (Glancing at HONEY on film) You're really good in our movie! HONEY beams at compliment, catches herself, and smiles weakly back at RAVEN as FIDGET approaches with a martini on a tray for HONEY. \nFIDGET Miss Whitlock? \nHONEY Oh, craft service. Thank you, Fidget, but I never drink when I'm working but you're very kind. Do your parents know where you are tonight? \nFIDGET They're probably mad... \nHONEY Don't you think you ought to call them...? \nFIDGET \n(FALTERING) Cecil says our parents are the enemies of film... \nHONEY You know that's nonsense! Go ahead, call them up. I bet they miss you... LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily high. \nLYLE Hey Honey, want some crack? \nHONEY I most certainly do NOT, Lyle. I can't believe you'd be a drug addict in the 90's - it's so retro. \nLYLE Before I was a drug addict, I had so many different problems, Honey. Now I just have one - drugs. It gave my life a real focus. Cut to CECIL on crane with CHERISH as they hornily watch CHERISH on film. \nCHERISH (Suddenly riding CECIL's leg) How can you see me on film and not want to fuck me?! \nCECIL (Moaning in sexual frustration) I S-Q want to fuck you, Cherish, but you know I can't... \nCHERISH Why not?! \n(PROUDLY) All my directors fuck me! \nCECIL (Suddenly back in control) I'm not \"all your directors,\" Cherish. \nI'M CECIL B. DEMENTED, THE ULTIMATE \nAUTEUR! LYLE begins projecting the dailies on the writhing bodies of the sexually frustrated SPROCKET HOLES. \nCECIL (Grabbing microphone and addressing his followers) SOLDIERS OF CINEMA, save your sexual energy for the silver screen... SPROCKET HOLES break apart and look up to CECIL. \nCECIL Our footage is stronger than Otto Preminger's... CHERISH licks CECIL's tattoo. \n", "test1_true": "CECIL .more exploitative than Herschel Gordon Lewis. LYLE humps the projector, out of his mind. \nCECIL .and more violent than Sam Fuller..- DINAH writhes in horniness, pulls her pistol and fires at \"The Films of David Lean\" coffee table book she uses as a target. \nCECIL We will rise above our raging hormones to a new level of cinema unrest! Cut to FIDGET sneakily dialing parents on phone as HONEY nods her support. \nCECIL . Do whatever it takes to avoid sexual release! Get as drunk as Sam Peckinpah... PAM guzzles whisky. \nCECIL As high as Rainer Werner Fassbinder!... LYLE sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic paint. \nCECIL But stay celibate for celluloid! Cut back to FIDGET on phone. We see his suburban MOM answer on split screen. \nFIDGET'S MOM \n(WORRIED) Hello. \nFIDGET \n(CHEERFUL) Mom, it's me, Fidget. \nFIDGET'S MOM \n(FRANTIC) Oh God, where are you, Fidget? Are you okay? \nFIDGET I'm fine. The movie's going great, Mom! \nFIDGET'S MOM \n(HORRIFIED) Going great? Fidget... you're wanted for murder! Cut back to CECIL whc is building to a climax of brainwashing. \nCECIL .Feel the black humor of Almodovar... RODNEY dances a wild S&M step and tries to look PETIE in the eyes. \nCECIL .the satanic fury of Kenneth Anger! RAVEN, possessed by the devil, rolls her eyes back in devil horniness. \nCECIL .the racial tension of Spike Lee... CHARDONNAY lets out a soulful wail as she dances in sexual abandon. \nCECIL (Spotting FIDGET on the phone and giving him the \nEVIL EYE) .and the unashamed exhibitionism of William Castle! FIDGET freezes and looks down at William Castle's name tattooed on his arm. \nFIDGET'S MOM (Still on phone) Hello? Fidget, talk to me! Hello? We'll come and get you! Tell us where you are! Hello? Hello? FIDGET hangs up phone and starts playing pocket pool frantically. HONEY sighs and shakes her head in disappointment. \nLEWIS (Sneaking a peak at \"Vibe Magazine\" before blurting out to CECIL) If we can't have sex, can't we at least make money? \nCHARDONNAY (Scared, but giving it her best shot) Yeah, Lewis thinks I could have a hit record! \nCECIL \nNO, NO, NO, SPROCKET HOLES! I'm a prophet against profit! And you should refuse to sully your artistic vision with financial success! (Wide-eyed, to all) \nSPROCKET HOLES, BE STRONG! \nAND JOIN ME IN PRAYER! LEWIS and CHARDONNAY give up quickly and join the other SPROCKET HOLES as they fall to their knees in cult worship. HONEY signals to FIDGET she's changed her mind - she'll have the martini after all. \nCECIL Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... \nALL Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... HONEY guzzles down the martini. CHERISH prays the hardest, still sexually aroused. \nCECIL .help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did for the future of outlaw film! \nSAY IT SPROCKET HOLES! HONEY watches, a little tipsy. \n", "test1_id": 1563, "test2_input": "THAT'S ALL OVER WITH! SAVE YOUR \nRAGE AND USE IT IN THE CINEMA! CHERISH suddenly quiets down in fear. \nCHERISH \n(MEEKLY) Yes, Cecil... \nCECIL \n(PREOCCUPIED) Now Honey...I want you to do a little stunt for this scene... \nHONEY \n(ALARMED) A what? \nCECIL A simple little stunt. \nHONEY It doesn't say anything about a stunt in your rewrite. \nCECIL \n(TO HONEY) See Pam? HONEY looks down to PAM, and sees PAM putting gaffer's tape mark on deck of ship. \n86. \"PRIDE OF BALTIMORE\" DECK. 86. PAM, wearing earphones, looks up at CECIL and HONEY in window and nods gravely. Another CATERER looks quizzically at PAM, not recognizing her. He then sees DINAH shucking oysters and realizes something is wrong. He spots a mobile phone on table. 87. Cut back to INTERIOR SECOND FLOOR ABANDONED PIER. 87. \nCECIL \n(TO HONEY) That's your mark. When you hear \"Action,\" jump through the window, and land facing Pam's camera. \nHONEY \n(LOOKING DOWN) But Cecil, surely you realize I could be injured... \nCHERISH Suffer for celluloid! \nHONEY Maybe with an air bag or some kind of safety precaution... \nLYLE Just call me irresponsible... (Snorts a line of Special K) \nCHERISH Outlaw cinema has no limits! \nCECIL (Smiling, to HONEY) Prove yourself, Honey. HONEY spots a marine police boat quickly darting behind \"Pride of Baltimore,\" filled with MARINE \nPOLICE. \nHONEY (Realizing this could be her only chance) Alright, Cecil. I'm a professional... Roll the camera. \nCECIL (Hissing excitedly to CHERISH and LYLE, and handing \nTHEM SCRIPT) Places, you fools! CHERISH and LYLE rush to scurry back down steps. CECIL hands HONEY a grenade and a gun. \nCECIL Don't worry, they're just props. After your first line, throw the grenade at the Film Commission. Nobody will get hurt. \nHONEY But there are bullets in this gun... \nCECIL Blanks ...trust me Honey. HONEY gulps. \nCECIL \n(INTO WALKIE) Lock it up! \n", "test2_true": "89. \"PRIDE OF BALTIMORE\" DECK. 89. PAM and CHARDONNAY put down serving trays and pull out camera and sound equipment.

PARTY GUESTS fix their hair, smile, thinking they are in a promotional film. \n92. INTERIOR SECOND FLOOR ABANDONED PIER. 92. \nCECIL (Lovingly, to HONEY) I kidnapped the right star, didn't I? HONEY smiles weakly. \nCECIL \n(SEXILY) \nACTION! HONEY runs and jumps through window. \n93. DECK OF \"PRIDE OF BALTIMORE.\" 93. HONEY comes crashing down in a hail of broken glass and lands directly on her mark holding her grenade. PARTY GUESTS scream in panic and try to escape but PETIE, DINAH, FIDGET and LEWIS block every exit with drawn guns. HONEY, bleeding from tiny cuts looks up to CECIL'S directorial glare and realizes she is supposed to act. \nHONEY (In character, to table full of terrified producers headed by Film Commissioner) Which one of you assholes insulted our movie?! (To FILM COMMISSIONER) \nWAS IT YOU?!! \nFILM COMMISSIONER No...please...I was only following studio orders. HONEY throws what she thinks is her \"prop\" grenade. The FILM COMMISSIONER dives out of the way and it explodes. HONEY, horrified that the \"effect\" was real looks up to CECIL but he has vanished. Suddenly CECIL enters the ship \"directing\" through megaphone. \nCECIL ALL EXTRAS - keep eating the oysters or you will be shot and killed! \nDINAH (Shoving party guests \nTOWARDS CAMERA) \nI SAID BACKGROUND ACTION! \nPanicked party guests immediately slurp down oysters in gastronomic detail for PAM'S camera. CHERISH and LYLE, enter ship on cue in character, with guns drawn. \nLYLE (Grabbing PRODUCER B) Didn't you produce that foreign language hit that was remade badly in English? \nPRODUCER B I had to. You know American audiences won't watch subtitles! LYLE overturns bar table, sending bottles crashing. \nCHERISH (Firing gun in air, pointing it at STUDIO EXEC A) Didn't you just greenlight another new movie based on a video game? \nSTUDIO EXEC A It wasn't my idea... I'm just a vice president of creative affairs! We see MARINE POLICE silently pulling up to \"PRIDE \nOF BALTIMORE.\" HONEY aims gun at PRODUCER C, terrified the gun is as real as her grenade was. \nPRODUCER C \n(BEGGING) No, please don't shoot me! I don't even go to the movies... \nCECIL \n(TO HONEY) Do it. MARINE POLICE suddenly open fire on SPROCKET HOLES. RODNEY is instantly killed as he mixes HONEY'S hair dye. PETIE's face turns to stone at seeing his dead \"boyfriend.\" HONEY screams, thinking she is being rescued as RAVEN bravely tries to touch up her makeup. \nHONEY \n(TO COPS) \n", "test2_id": 1564, "test3_input": "HELP!

CHERISH, firing her gun wildly, runs to LYLE and manages to pull him \"off set\" as HONEY freezes in terror deciding between her director or the POLICE. CHARDONNAY fires her gun and accidentally blasts her ears over earphone and lunges to turn down volume control on her Nagra. \nPAM (Struggling to continue filming while firing her gun) \nHOLD STILL FOR FOCUS! FIDGET plays pocket pool while firing away, hitting a few COPS. \nCECIL (To HONEY as he fires his gun) \nFINISH THE FUCKING SCENE! \nHONEY (Suddenly jumping back \nINTO CHARACTER) \nBAD MOVIES MUST BE AVENGED! HONEY fires gun at PRODUCER C. PRODUCER C clutches his stomach and doubles over. HONEY covers her mouth in real horror. Instantly PRODUCER C recovers, realizing the bullet was a blank. \nCECIL smiles benevolently at HONEY. \nCECIL (Dodging bullets, happy) \nTHAT'S A CUT! CECIL is shot in the left shoulder by POLICE. HONEY kisses RAVEN goodbye and makes a break for it and runs towards MARINE POLICE. \nHONEY DON'T SHOOT! I'm Honey Whitlock and I've been kidnapped! HONEY is shocked when the POLICE tackle her and place her under arrest. DINAH grabs FILM COMMISSIONER and uses him as a human shield as she fires away, hitting several cops. \nFILM COMMISSIONER \nNO! NO! WE'LL GO TO SUNDANCE \nTOGETHER, I PROMISE! CECIL, clutching his shoulder wound, looks up in shock to see HONEY being dragged off ship in handcuffs as POLICE read her her Miranda rights. \nHONEY (In a star fit) \nGET OFF ME!

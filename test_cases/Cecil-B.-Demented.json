Cut to SINCLAIR STEVENS, the handsome but intense 20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle class suburban kid. \nROY STILLINGS, the tuxedoed fifty-year-old theater owner, shouts instructions from below as CATERERS, DECORATORS and PUBLICITY PEOPLE rush in an out of theater preparing for tonight's event. He is surrounded by several of his young staff - DINAH, the sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier; CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their usual uniforms for the premiere. \nMR. STILLINGS A little more to the right, Sinclair. \nSINCLAIR (Moving the final \"S\" \nIN \"HAPPINESS\") That better, Mr. Stillings?

HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors open and she is led inside. \n9. INTERIOR ELEVATOR. 9. Several well-dressed hotel guests recognize HONEY and are thrilled. \nHONEY (In a sudden tirade) Did you hear what that little bitch said to me? \nLIBBY She didn't know. \nHONEY In show business we say \"break a leg.\" NEVER fucking \"Good Luck\"! \nHOTEL GUESTS frown in disappointment at HONEY's language. \nLIBBY \n(TO HONEY) That's just an old superstition. \nCHARLES \n(NERVOUSLY) Miss Whitlock, there's photo cps with the mayor in the lobby... \nHONEY That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's language. \n10. INTERIOR HOTEL LOBBY. 10. MAYOR FENWICK, the middle aged African American mayor waits with the PRESS.

SINCLAIR nods gravely to LYLE the projectionist who picks up a 35mm metal film can and sneaks up behind MR. STILLINGS who is looking down from projection booth to the premiere CROWD filling the theater below. \nMR. STILLINGS Christ, there's what's-her-name from E Network. Look at the tits on her!

CHARLES the press agent, LIBBY the assistant, and RODNEY the bodyguard sit in back with HONEY as she gives a phone interview. PETIE the chauffeur winks sexily in rear view mirror to RODNEY the bodyguard, who smiles back uneasily, \nHONEY (On phone, being a star) \"Some Kind Of Happiness\" is a \n(MORE) \nscrewball romantic comedy - life-affirming but realistic and to be honest, with all the misery in the world today, couldn't we use a little optimism in the movies? \n23. EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. 23. SINCLAIR smiles evilly, holding a huge bouquet of flowers as LEWIS greets MAYOR and BODYGUARDS as they exit limo to applause from CROWD. HONEY's white limo pulls up behind them, led by MOTORCYCLE ESCORT. \nSINCLAIR (Into his walkie-talkie) 7:06pm...The Big Snatch.

MALLORY (To AUDIENCE as she tries to hug him) Little William's a little grumpy... \nLITTLE WILLIAM (Snatching away her hands, under his breath) Get off me, ugly. \nMRS.

HE staples her gown to the chair. FIDGET, the grunge dweeb, dressed in complete rags but looking somehow great with his \"William Castle\" tattoo, shyly steps forward, absentmindedly playing \"pocket pool.\" \nFIDGET \n(BASHFUL) I'm Fidget, the costumer...

RAVEN, smiling beatifically, steps forward dressed in a satanic robe, an inverted cross necklace, pentagram jewelry and a \"Kenneth Anger\" tattoo. \nRAVEN Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist. I'll be doing your makeup... HONEY stares back in confusion. \nRAVEN You look so pale... RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY cries out in shock. \nRAVEN Sorry... but Satan says... you need color! RODNEY, the biker \"bodyguard,\" now in S&M leather get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb and a hair dye applicator bottle. His \"Almodovar\" tattoo is a beauty. \nRODNEY Call me Rodney.

(Laughs evilly as he \nCARESSES RODNEY) From behind a curtain, covering a room of lab and editing equipment comes DINAH, now dressed in alarming vintage fashion outfit that shows off her shapely but purposely hairy legs. \"Sam Fuller\" is tattooed on her back. She wheels a TV set and VCR mounted on wheels framed by little velvet curtain. \nDINAH (Snarling to HONEY) I'm Dinah, Cecil's prod\u00c2\u00bbcer and I do everything! I've been knocking down box office money from every big Hollywood hit for years to pay for this \n(MORE) \nequipment. You fuck with me, sister, and you're DEAD! (Smugly to CECIL) We made the news...

Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two year old chairwoman of the Maryland Heart Fund died tonight at Union Memorial Hospital following an on stage heart attack she suffered in the middle of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at tonight's Baltimore movie premiere... SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the enormity of their act barely sinking in. \nNEWSMAN .the teenage gang of cinema terrorists who apparently infiltrated the staff of the Senator Theater are now eligible for the death penalty in the State of Maryland... CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does. SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for guidance. CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's terrified face. \nCECIL Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie... SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm. \nCECIL .but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed. HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of terror. \nFADE OUT. 55. Fade in to EXTERIOR \"SPROCKET HOUSE.\" Next morning. 55. We hear HONEY letting out a fresh cry of agony. \n56. INTERIOR \"SPROCKET HOUSE\" - \"HAIR AND MAKEUP,\" 56. a dilapidated section of the loft filled with broken mirrors, beat up barber chairs, filthy hair driers and mangy beauty supplies. HONEY, tied to a barber chair, still dressed in her raggedy premiere gown, moans in pain as RODNEY, in scary rubber fetish outfit, sadistically applies the final batch of double strength bleach to HONEY's already shockingly blond hair. RAVEN, wearing another \"witchy\" black robe and 666 earrings, finishes up HONEY's overly-theatrical makeup job. \nHONEY \n(TO RODNEY) Owwww! Please! I don't want to be blond! \nRODNEY You're going right off the deep end of the Clairol color chart! RODNEY squirts on more dye. \nHONEY It's burning my scalp! Ow! Ow!

HONEY nervously starts to unzip her gown. SPROCKET HOLES let out an involuntary sexual moan. \nHONEY (Muttering, furious) The Screen Actors Guild will hear about this and I mean it! HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it. She is wearing beautiful lingerie. \nFIDGET \nDAMN! \nRAVEN \nNICE VESSEL! \nFIDGET (Starts reaching into his pocket, subtly) Excuse me, ma'am.

HONEY sees her transformation into terrorist glamour girl for the first time. \nHONEY Oh, God, I look terrible! (Breaks into sobs) CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly. \nDINAH (Suddenly all business) Alright, LET'S LOCK IT UP! \n62 INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. SOUND STAGE. 62 CECIL leads HONEY to set, past equipment and lights as SPROCKET HOLES scurry to position, adjusting lights, setting up camera, readying props. \nCECIL \n(TO HONEY) This is Sprocket House, Miss Whitlock, think of it as your studio. They arrive at the amazingly inventive exterior set of \"RITZ CINEMA,\" a tiny guilded movie palace gone to seed. Marquee reads: PASOLINI FESTIVAL. HONEY stares dumbfounded. \nCECIL Can't you say good morning to Lewis? He worked hard on this set with a budget of zero. \nHONEY Good... morning. \nLEWIS \n(PROUDLY) All these materials were stolen from city-owned construction sites...just for you! We're gonna have a hit, Miss Whitlock! \nCECIL Our picture is called \"Raving Beauty.\" You play the insane owner of a failed art theater who along with her film fanatic boyfriend Lyle. . .Lyle come on over... LYLE enters dressed in hepcat 70's junkie splendor wear. \nCECIL .and her violence prone daughter, Cherish...

DINAH quickly hands CECIL a stun-gun. \nCECIL You dare to tell Cecil B. DeMented you refuse! \nHONEY I'm too young to play her mother! \nCECIL \n(THREATENINGLY) I know how cid you are... \nHONEY (Trying to change the subject) It doesn't feel right... I'm just not motivated... \nCECIL (Advancing on her with \nSTUN GUN) How's this for motivation? Huh? CECIL zaps her painfully with the stun gun.

HONEY, terrified, immediately jumps back into character. \nHONEY (Yelling to BOX OFFICE LADY in ticket booth) How dare you play this rotten movie?! PAM pans the camera to BOX OFFICE LADY whose eyes light up in fear at seeing the \"actors\" in their terrorist outfits. \nBOX OFFICE LADY Oh my God, it's Honey Whitlock! \nCECIL (Yelling to \"actors\" into \nMEGAPHONE) \nI SAID ACTION! LYLE and CHERISH grab HONEY and they run toward BOX \nOFFICE LADY. \nHONEY (To BOX OFFICE LADY) $7.50 for this piece of shit?!

Suddenly, one of CECIL's bloodshot eyes open and he lurches for the microphone. \nCECIL (In a booming voice to all the SPROCKET HOLES \nBELOW HIM) Hey kids! Wake up! Let's make a mother-fucking movie! He hits hideously loud alarm button. SPROCKET HOLES leap to their feet and stagger into film production. \n76. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY'S DRESSING ROOM. 76. Before she can barely open her eyes, HONEY sees RODNEY and RAVEN rushing towards her, their instruments of beauty torture ready. \nRODNEY (Glaring at HONEY's hair) I see that fucking brown color... \nHONEY Please Rodney, those aren't roots - they're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they're raw! RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as HONEY lets out a cry of agony. \nRAVEN \n(SMILING) Just close your eyes and think of the films of George Cukor. RAVEN tweezes HONEY'S eyebrows painfully as RODNEY continues to torture her hair. \nHONEY OWWWW!! Please... please... (Trying a new tactic) Raven, you're a pretty girl, you could escape this madness... \nRAVEN Escape to what, Honey? \n(PROUDLY) My father is a Zo-Zo, the three-headed guard dog at the gate of hell! \nHONEY Well ...I'm sorry to hear that... \nRAVEN And one day I'm gonna commit revolutionary suicide for celluloid... \nHONEY \n(REALLY SCARED) Don't say that, Raven! Tell her, Rodney - no movie is worth dying for! RODNEY blasts HONEY's hair with his fiery malfunctioning drier as she cries out in pain. \nHONEY OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want to hurt me? Gay men are supposed to be gentle... \nRODNEY (Begins teasing HONEY's hair) That's just it, Honey! I'm not gay. I'm straight and I fucking hate it! Petie loves me but I can't love him back! I've tried! I kiss him and all I feel is beard. \nI CAN'T TAKE THAT CERTAIN THICKNESS \nIN HIS PANTS! \n(SOBBING) I'm so ashamed of my heterosexuality! \nRAVEN \n(COMFORTING HIM) Oh, it's alright, Rodney. \nRODNEY (Suddenly snapping back \nI. .HAVE...A...VISION...

INTERIOR VAN. 80. \nCECIL is hastily re-writing his script in long-hand and as soon as he finishes a page, DINAH snatches it and passes it out to HONEY, LYLE and CHERISH who are now dressed in FIDGET'S newest terrorist costumes. The rest of the SPROCKET HOLES, dressed in caterer's outfits, huddle in the back of the van preparing the film equipment. RODNEY and RAVEN, as always, touch up HONEY. \nCECIL (Finishing up last page of script, to HONEY, LYLE \nAND CHERISH) OK, in this scene you guys are the avenging angels of underground cinema... \nLYLE We'll let these fat cat producers know! \nCHERISH Yeah, that Maryland is not safe for their kind of movies! \nHONEY Cherish, this is America. They have the freedom to make bad films if they so desire... \nCECIL Not anymore they don't! \nCHERISH (Suddenly testy, to HONEY) You think just 'cause you made \"real\" movies that you're better than me, don't you? \nHONEY Oh, please... \nCHERISH Do you know w I became a porno star?! SPROCKET HOLES groan, they've heard it before. \nCECIL \n(TO HONEY) Cherish has recovered memory. \nCHERISH \n(TO HONEY) When I was ten years old my entire family fucked me under the Christmas tree... \nHONEY \n(STAMMERING) I'm.. . so sorry. \nCHERISH I guess you are. \"Jingle Balls, Jingle Balls,\" my stupid brother started singing.

He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a \"Herschell Gordon Lewis\" tattoo across his skinny chest. \nLYLE Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your leading man. I've had a boner for you for years. HONEY pales. \nCECIL (Getting off crane and stepping towards HONEY) Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny... CHERISH starts writhing sexily. \nCECIL .but our film comes first. CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES undulate in sexual frustration. \nCECIL .And now for the crew. PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we \nsee her \"Sam Peckinpah\" tattoo on her arm. \nPAM I'm Pam, the director of photography and you'd better hit your mark! CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's head, revealing the \"Spike Lee\" tattoo on her stomach. \nCHARDONNAY .and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH! I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound. LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding staple gun like a weapon. \n", "test1_id": 1563, "test2_input": "CHARDONNAY (Spinning sound boom \nINTO POSITION) Speed. \nPAM Mark it! DINAH marks the take. \nCECIL \nACTION! \nLYLE (Entering in character) Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what? \nCHERISH \n(IN CHARACTER) I didn't sell one ticket, Lyle. Nobody came! \nLYLE Pasolini's playing and we have an empty theater? HONEY enters and does the lines convincingly. \nHONEY \n(IN CHARACTER) It's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall, isn't it? CECIL's eyes light up in happiness at HONEY's performance. \nCHERISH I heard they were sold out last night, Mom. \nLYLE Not for \"THE FLINTSTONES\"?! \nHONEY (Getting even better) Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY. \nHONEY From the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in America, we will rise to take back the screen! \nThe SPROCKET HOLES watch in awe. \nHONEY Death to those who support mainstream cinema! \nCECIL \n(TRIUMPHANTLY) CUT and PRINT! CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES burst into applause. \nCECIL That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look. \nHONEY (Feeling her oats) To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system. \nCECIL (Suddenly the dictator again) Let's move on! \nHONEY \n(SHOCKED) What? No coverage? \nCECIL The first take is the only real truth... \nHONEY But you can't cut the film with only a master! \nCECIL There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges. We believe technique to be nothing more than failed style. You see, I've had a vision... All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to \nHONEY. \nCECIL .and that vision is called \"ultimate reality.\" The rest of our film is shot in real life, with real people ... . and yes, with real terror. 63. Flip wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. Industrial 63. doors swing open and freshly painted phony FEDEX truck comes speeding out. \nHONEY (VOICE OVER) Please, no! Let's go back! I hate location work! 64. INTERIOR FEDEX VAN as it drives through downtown 64. streets and enters Jones Falls Expressway. PETIE is behind the wheel as LYLE and CHERISH study their lines in hand-written \"Raving Beauty\" script. CECIL hurriedly flips through TIME Magazine until he finds the article he wants. RODNEY and RAVEN torture HONEY with their constant touchups as PAM, CHARDONNAY, DINAH and FIDGET crowd in the back of van with equipment and guns as LEWIS reads a copy of \"Psychotronic\" magazine. \nRODNEY I see a fucking root already! He lunges to HONEY's scalp with hair dye applicator bottle. \n", "test2_true": "CECIL That's not what TIME Magazine has to say. \n(READING) \"Miss Whitlock seems a little ill at ease and past her prime to carry a picture by herself, especially one as sappy and overproduced as \"Some Kind Of Happiness.\" \nHONEY \n(SHOCKED) TIME Magazine said that? \nLEWIS Your picture's gonna lose thirty million dollars. \nPETIE \n(TO HONEY) Can I ask you a question? Did you ever fuck Mel Gibson? \nHONEY (Ignoring both PETIE and LEWIS) Cecil, give yourself up! It's not too late... \nLEWIS Our film goes into profit the day we sell the first ticket! \nPETIE (To HONEY, again) How big is his dick, anyway? \nHONEY (Still to CECIL, refusing to acknowledge PETIE or LEWIS) Come to Hollywood with me and I promise I'll get you a job as a production assistant on a real Hollywood movie. \nPETIE \n(LOSING IT) \nTELL ME ABOUT MEL GIBSON'S \nDICK AND BALLS! 65. EXTERIOR TIMONIUM CINEMA. Suburban chain theater 65. in mall. \"FLINTSTONES\" is playing in both theaters. FEDEX van pulls up out front and stops. \n66. INTERIOR FEDEX VAN. 66. SPROCKET HOLES have guns drawn and equipment ready and are ready to begin \"location shooting.\" \nCECIL .and remember there are no bad takes in a Cecil B. DeMented picture - just keep the scene going \nLYLE (To HONEY, getting ready to take a large capsule) I never took this much acid \n(MORE) \nbefore, so if I forget my lines, Honey, cue me! \n(POPS PILL) \nCHERISH (Primping with FIDGET'S help, \nTO HONEY) Do my tits look OK? They're bigger than yours, you know. \nHONEY Cecil, please don't make me do this scene... \nCECIL Your Hollywood system stole our sex and co-opted our violence so there's nothing left for our kind of movies... except this! \nDINAH \nPICTURE'S UP! \n67. EXTERIOR TIMONIUM CINEMA. 67. PAM and CHARDONNAY leap from the van with their equipment followed by DINAH who holds marker up before van door. \nDINAH Roll camera. \nPAM Camera rolling. \nCHARDONNAY Speed. DINAH marks the take. \n", "test2_id": 1564, "test3_input": "CECIL \nCUT! PRINT! (To HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES) \nWRAP IT UP AND RUN! CECIL, his \"cast and crew\" take off, chanting their terrorist yell. \nFADE OUT. 72. Fade in to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. NIGHT. 72. We hear a cool rap song on soundtrack called \"NO BUDGET.\" (\"When we say action, we mean action, \nnobody's putting us in turnaround\") \n73. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 73. Wild \"Dailies\" party is in progress. LYLE is smoking crack and showing developed footage from that day's shoot on the wall of the warehouse as he dances lewdly with himself in place. LEWIS watches the \"dailies\" as he DJ's from turntables in booth while CHARDONNAY sexily raps the outlaw-film call-to-arms we hear on the soundtrack. PETIE and RODNEY torridly go-go dance on separate tables as PAM and DINAH writhe sexily to the beat on the dance floor. CECIL and CHERISH watch the gritty film rushes atop CECIL's bizarrely decored crane that doubles as their love nest. CECIL is frantically trying to write his script but CHERISH is pawing him, turned on by seeing herself on film. \nCHERISH Come on, Cecil, I want a little \"action\" of my own! \nCECIL (Gently pushing her away) I'm trying to write, Cherish! HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty, grainy, but very striking footage. RAVEN does a \"devil dance\" with herself and ritualistically drinks from a skull head. \nRAVEN \n(TO HONEY) Goat urine, want some? HONEY pales. \nRAVEN \n(HAPPILY) It's a Satan thing! (Glancing at HONEY on film) You're really good in our movie! HONEY beams at compliment, catches herself, and smiles weakly back at RAVEN as FIDGET approaches with a martini on a tray for HONEY. \nFIDGET Miss Whitlock? \nHONEY Oh, craft service. Thank you, Fidget, but I never drink when I'm working but you're very kind. Do your parents know where you are tonight? \nFIDGET They're probably mad... \nHONEY Don't you think you ought to call them...? \nFIDGET \n(FALTERING) Cecil says our parents are the enemies of film... \nHONEY You know that's nonsense! Go ahead, call them up. I bet they miss you... LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily high. \nLYLE Hey Honey, want some crack? \nHONEY I most certainly do NOT, Lyle. I can't believe you'd be a drug addict in the 90's - it's so retro. \nLYLE Before I was a drug addict, I had so many different problems, Honey. Now I just have one - drugs. It gave my life a real focus. Cut to CECIL on crane with CHERISH as they hornily watch CHERISH on film. \nCHERISH (Suddenly riding CECIL's leg) How can you see me on film and not want to fuck me?! \nCECIL (Moaning in sexual frustration) I S-Q want to fuck you, Cherish, but you know I can't... \nCHERISH Why not?! \n(PROUDLY) All my directors fuck me! \nCECIL (Suddenly back in control) I'm not \"all your directors,\" Cherish. \nI'M CECIL B. DEMENTED, THE ULTIMATE \nAUTEUR! LYLE begins projecting the dailies on the writhing bodies of the sexually frustrated SPROCKET HOLES. \nCECIL (Grabbing microphone and addressing his followers) SOLDIERS OF CINEMA, save your sexual energy for the silver screen... SPROCKET HOLES break apart and look up to CECIL. \nCECIL Our footage is stronger than Otto Preminger's... CHERISH licks CECIL's tattoo. \n", "test3_true": "CECIL .more exploitative than Herschel Gordon Lewis. LYLE humps the projector, out of his mind. \nCECIL .and more violent than Sam Fuller..- DINAH writhes in horniness, pulls her pistol and fires at \"The Films of David Lean\" coffee table book she uses as a target. \nCECIL We will rise above our raging hormones to a new level of cinema unrest! Cut to FIDGET sneakily dialing parents on phone as HONEY nods her support. \nCECIL . Do whatever it takes to avoid sexual release! Get as drunk as Sam Peckinpah... PAM guzzles whisky. \nCECIL As high as Rainer Werner Fassbinder!... LYLE sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic paint. \nCECIL But stay celibate for celluloid! Cut back to FIDGET on phone. We see his suburban MOM answer on split screen. \nFIDGET'S MOM \n(WORRIED) Hello. \nFIDGET \n(CHEERFUL) Mom, it's me, Fidget. \nFIDGET'S MOM \n(FRANTIC) Oh God, where are you, Fidget? Are you okay? \nFIDGET I'm fine. The movie's going great, Mom! \nFIDGET'S MOM \n(HORRIFIED) Going great? Fidget... you're wanted for murder! Cut back to CECIL whc is building to a climax of brainwashing. \nCECIL .Feel the black humor of Almodovar... RODNEY dances a wild S&M step and tries to look PETIE in the eyes. \nCECIL .the satanic fury of Kenneth Anger! RAVEN, possessed by the devil, rolls her eyes back in devil horniness. \nCECIL .the racial tension of Spike Lee... CHARDONNAY lets out a soulful wail as she dances in sexual abandon. \nCECIL (Spotting FIDGET on the phone and giving him the \nEVIL EYE) .and the unashamed exhibitionism of William Castle! FIDGET freezes and looks down at William Castle's name tattooed on his arm. \nFIDGET'S MOM (Still on phone) Hello? Fidget, talk to me! Hello? We'll come and get you! Tell us where you are! Hello? Hello? FIDGET hangs up phone and starts playing pocket pool frantically. HONEY sighs and shakes her head in disappointment. \nLEWIS (Sneaking a peak at \"Vibe Magazine\" before blurting out to CECIL) If we can't have sex, can't we at least make money? \nCHARDONNAY (Scared, but giving it her best shot) Yeah, Lewis thinks I could have a hit record! \nCECIL \nNO, NO, NO, SPROCKET HOLES! I'm a prophet against profit! And you should refuse to sully your artistic vision with financial success! (Wide-eyed, to all) \nSPROCKET HOLES, BE STRONG! \nAND JOIN ME IN PRAYER! LEWIS and CHARDONNAY give up quickly and join the other SPROCKET HOLES as they fall to their knees in cult worship. HONEY signals to FIDGET she's changed her mind - she'll have the martini after all. \nCECIL Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... \nALL Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... HONEY guzzles down the martini. CHERISH prays the hardest, still sexually aroused. \nCECIL .help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did for the future of outlaw film! \nSAY IT SPROCKET HOLES! HONEY watches, a little tipsy. \n", "test3_id": 1565}

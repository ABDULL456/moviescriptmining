Walter gets a text from Odessa that says I'm leaving. 
WALTER Hey, Todd. I have to go. I have a piano situation I have to take care of. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay, man. 
WALTER Um hey, can I have my four hundred dollars back? 
EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER 
Walter walks up to Battery Park to find (really) a grand piano sitting in the park. He stops and stares at it awhile. 
EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER 
Walter sits at the abandoned piano (in pristine shape). Regular NY foot traffic passes around him. He absentmindedly starts playing the first bars of Cheers. Then he just keeps doing it because he's thinking of other things. 
GUY IN PARK Stop playing Cheers, Dick. 
Then Walter sees Cheryl Mellhoff and her son RICH (9), headed his way from across Bridge Street. They've got two skateboards. Walter smiles when he sees them and waves. 
EXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER 
Cheryl, Walter and Rich push the grand piano toward quiet Bridge Street. It's on its wheels and a couple skateboards. It's rolling down the street pretty well. They're about to push it out onto the street. 
WALTER Rich, are you ready to push a piano down a street and get honked at by everybody in New York? 
RICH (like it's going to be FUN) Yeah. 
They do. The honking begins right away, but they keep rolling the grand piano down Bridge Street. It looks like it might be fun. 
CHERYL I can't believe they left it in the park. How old is this? 
WALTER Her dad bought it for her when she was six. It's seventy-years-old. 
CHERYL Your sister just took off? 
WALTER My sister's not the responsible one in the family. 
CHERYL No kidding, man. 
WALTER She told them no steps. I paid them for a first floor move. But she screwed up and got my mom a apartment on the 15th floor. The movers weren't equipped to get it up there. She didn't have the money for them to take it back. She had to get her braces adjusted, so she just took off. 
CHERYL Braces. How old is she? 
WALTER 
EXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER 
It's pretty late now. Walter has placed a tarp over the piano. They rolled it into a city parking space. 
CHERYL You're sure this is your sister's parking space? 
WALTER Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good on that. 
Rich is skateboarding around a little. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I used to skateboard a little. 
CHERYL (something about the idea makes her smile) When? 
WALTER Maine. When I was a kid. (trying to unburden her of the other skateboard) Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I don't want you to have to carry it all the way home. I got it. 
CHERYL Thanks. 
WALTER You helped me move a piano. I can carry this. See you Rich. Thanks for putting your back into it. 
RICH What does that mean? 
WALTER Just, you know... helping out, man. 
CHERYL See you tomorrow. 
WALTER Yeah. 
Walter's got the piano all tarped. Cheryl and Rich take off. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Are you sure I can't walk you home? 
CHERYL I'm going to drop Rich at his Dad's. Thanks, Walter. 
Walter hangs out a moment. He's watching them go. Then he starts walking off with Rich's skateboard.

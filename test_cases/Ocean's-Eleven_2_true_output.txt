Yen, still on the door, remains frozen.       Trembling. 
A beat. 
Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he can get.

Danny presses it again.      Still nothing. 
LINUS What's wrong? 
DANNY I don't know. 
Linus comes over to look. 
LINUS You check the batteries? 
Danny blanches.    Linus shoots him a look.

224    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                       224 
Livingston, Frank, and Basher watch the monitors in disbelief... 
Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again.      His job is complete. 
SAUL Everything going okay? 
225    INT. VAULT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE VAULT                              225 
As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements. He finds AA's in their flashlights. 
LINUS You know, you lose focus for one second in this game -- 
DANNY -- and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining. 
He takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator, then slaps the door twice more.

Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. He hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the line of fire.

Danny presses the detonator.

Several MUTED but powerful BLASTS. 
Linus inches forward, almost dreading this moment, pauses...

DANNY Do it. 
Linus pulls... and the door opens. 
226    INT. VAULT                                                  226 
Danny and Linus enter. Silence. The cash carts have crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held. 
DANNY Amazing? 
Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it... 
Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone. 
YEN (his only English) Where the fuck you been? 
227    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                  227 
Livingston, Frank, Saul, and Basher watch as the first wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor. Smiles all around. 
SAUL Ever been in love? 
FRANK (considers it for a moment) No, I guess not. Not really. 
SAUL This is better. 
228   INT. CASINO - OUTSIDE FIGHT ARENA                              228 
Rusty steps forward as people stream past him out of the fight arena. He dials his cell phone, listens... 
229   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA                                    229 
MOVING WITH Benedict and Tess, pushing their way out through the crowd. A PHONE is RINGING nearby... again and again... 
BENEDICT You gonna answer it? 
TESS I don't have a cell phone. 
They keep moving, but the RING pursues them. Finally, Benedict stops, pulls Tess's purse from her shoulder and opens it: inside, he finds a CELL PHONE, RINGING. 
TESS It isn't mine. 
BENEDICT See who's on the other end. 
She takes the phone, activates it. 
TESS Hello? 
RUSTY (V.O.) May I have a word with Mr. Benedict, please? 
Tess looks up, confused. 
TESS It's for you. 
Benedict takes the phone. 
BENEDICT Who the hell is this? 
ON RUSTY 
in the distance, at the arena's exit, unseen by Benedict or Tess, on the phone... 
RUSTY The man who's robbing you.

Randy, turning, is surprised to see Cassidy standing there. She looks tired and worried and scared. 
RANDY What are you doing here? 
CASSIDY Don't do this. This is dumb. 
RANDY This ain't the best time to talk. 
RANDY (CONT'D) What about your heart? 
RANDY (CONT'D) I'll be fine. 
CASSIDY I thought the doctor... 
RANDY They always say that. Whatever you got. 
CASSIDY You could really hurt yourself. 
RANDY I know what I'm doing in there. (turns vaguely sad) Out here's where I get hurt. 
CASSIDY Out here's what counts. The real world. 
RANDY Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a shit about me in the real world. 
CASSIDY I quit my job, drove 14 hours through the night to get here. What do you call that? 
Randy looks away, unable to hold her gaze. Through the curtain, we hear the Arabic music DIE DOWN. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (from auditorium) And his opponent... 
A new, familiar song rises on the auditorium speakers. 
MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)" 
The crowd roars. 
RANDY (points to curtain) Listen to them! This is where I'm great. This is where I belong. 
Randy looks at the curtain. He looks at Cassidy. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) From Elizabeth, New Jersey, weighing in at 219 pounds... 
RANDY I gotta go. 
CASSIDY Randy. Please. 
RANDY I'll see you after the show. 
CASSIDY (grabs him) No. 
He pulls her off. 
RANDY Enjoy the show. 
He turns away from her, toward the curtain. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) A true wrestling immortal, one of the greatest of all time... (BEAT) Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn! 
He steps through. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS 
Randy bursts through the curtain to HUGE CHEERS. There's probably 700 people there in the 2,200-seat facility. 
INT. COMMENTATORS' TABLE - CONTINUOUS 
Seated at a ringside table are the match's COMMENTATORS, a pair of wannabe Marv Alberts in their 20s. A sign taped to the table reads CAROLINA WRESTLING NETWORK. Next to the table is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod. 
COMMENTATOR #1 There he is, folks! Randy The Ram! 
Randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. Fans do the same in tribute. 
COMMENTATOR #2 History about to be made here at the Greenville Civic Auditorium. 
Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after chair. His head gets a little bloody. The fans eat it up. 
Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits. 
The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers. Randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love. 
He grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. He looks around. A hush comes over the crowd. 
RANDY I just got one thing to say to you people... 
Randy looks toward Cassidy, standing over by the entrance curtain. He looks out at the larger crowd. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Thank you. 
LOUD CHEERS. Randy takes a contemplative pause. 
RANDY (CONT'D) You take your lumps and bruises in this game. But you know what? It's all worth it. Because of you guys. Your cheers keep me young. They make me feel alive. (BEAT) In 1982, the year I wrestled my first professional match, I was six- foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot- eleven. Three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. I may be down to five- eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. And that's the way it's always gonna be. 
Randy looks toward Cassidy, who's standing over by the entrance curtain. Their eyes meet. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Forever.

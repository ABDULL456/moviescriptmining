STEMLER (CONT'D) Show time. 
VIGMAN Thanks for the update Stemler. 
TERRY We're dead. 
MIKE No. It's gonna be fine. 
INT. NEW PROVIDENCE HIGHSCHOOL, MAIN GYM - LATER. 
The SCORE BOARD reads 33- 31. The 112 pound weight class is wrestling. 
MIKE Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm! 
Carlos does and holds on for the win. The team cheers. Mike turns to Vigman and Terry. 
MIKE (CONT'D) How we doing? 
VIGMAN With that win, we're up by five. If Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win. 
TERRY That's a huge fucking "if". 
STEMLER (O.S.) I can hear you, Coach. 
They all turn. Stemler is standing right there. He looks petrified. 
VIGMAN Good job, Ter. 
TERRY Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ. 
MIKE Come here, Stemler. 
Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 77 CONTINUED: 
MIKE (CONT'D) You've been practicing for a long time. You're ready for this. You hear me? 
Stemler nods. 
MIKE (CONT'D) If you get in trouble out there, you just listen to me. I'm right here, OK? 
Stemler nods again. Too scared to respond. 
MIKE (CONT'D) OK. You are not going to get pinned! You hear me! No way! 
STEMLER (BARELY AUDIBLE) No way. No way. 
MIKE Good. Now I'm going to slap you. Ready? 
STEMLER Yeah but not so hard. 
Mike gives him an odd half-slap and Stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line. The team cheers. 
But then the other WRESTLER runs out. He is wearing a BLACK PROTECTIVE FACE MASK. Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike. 
STEMLER (CONT'D) Holy shit! It's Darth Vader! Are you kidding me? No way! 
He does look like Darth Vader. But in a singlet. 
MIKE/TERRY/VIGMAN Don't worry. It's just a mask. You are ready! Get on that line. Now! 
KYLE Hey, Stemler. Come here. 
Stemler walks over. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 78 CONTINUED: 
KYLE (CONT'D) If he's Darth Vader then you're the Secret Apprentice. You got this. 
Stemler buys it. 
STEMLER Yeah. You're right. 
Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. The Ref blows the whistle and the match starts. Stemler is immediately taken down. Terry looks at his feet. 
TERRY I can't watch. 
LATER - 
It's late in third period. Stemler is losing 13-0. Stemler is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled. The Ref calls him for stalling. One point. 14-0. Thirty seconds to go. 
MIKE Keep moving, Stemler. Keep working! 
VIGMAN (Reading score card) Oh shit. Oh shit! 
TERRY What? 
VIGMAN He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria. 
MIKE Shit. Really? 
TERRY What the hell does that mean? 
VIGMAN If he falls behind by fifteen points it's a technical fall. They get five team points. If that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria.

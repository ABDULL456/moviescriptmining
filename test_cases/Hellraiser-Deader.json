{"test1_input": "CHARLES ...the delightful and world-famous Amy Klein. Have a seat, angel of light. \nAMY Eat me, Charles. \nCHARLES It's exactly that lack of respect for authority that got you fired from the New York Post. \nAMY I wasn't fired. I was re-assigned. \nCHARLES Of course. Where would you be without me? By the way, I don't recall ever being thanked properly for this \"re- assignment\". Charles makes air quotes with his fingers. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Lucky for you I opened my doors to you here as soon as I heard you were \"available\". \nMore air quotes. Amy walks over to a \"trophy table\" where she looks over a cluster of framed photo's. She points to one of her and Charles, smiling together. More innocent times for both. AMY I seem to recall a rather similar \"reassignment\" with you, Charles. \nCHARLES Touche'. Well, thanks to international conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I, along with Mother England, am blessed with your acquaintance, yet again. \nAMY Hey a contract's a contract. \nShe holds up the cassette recorder. \nAMY (CONT'D) Look, if all this about me being late with the crack whore story It's all right here -- and it's gold. I was just about to- \nCHARLES (interrupting) It's not about the crack whores, I'm sure you're working your usual unrestrained insightful magic on what I'm certain will be another eye-opening expose. I expect nothing but brilliance -- in five thousand words or less. (beat) But this is better. \nAmy spots an open container of Chinese food on Charles's desk. She inspects it, then picks something out of it with a pair of chop sticks. \nAMY So what then? Are we being sued again? \nCHARLES Hmm? Oh no. (sees her eating) Please feel free to have some of that. \nAMY Thanks. What is this? General Tso's cat? \nCHARLES Spare me the \"Nothing comes close to New York Chinese\" speech just this once. Go on, sit down. Just something I wanted to show you... \nHe heads back over to the VCR. Amy ditches the Chinese food and picks up her coffee again. She sits, lights another cigarette. \nCHARLES Okay... rewind, rewind? Rewind. \nHe finds the button, presses it and turns back to Amy. \nCHARLES Somebody mailed us this thing around two weeks ago but, in keeping with our usual level of efficiency, Betty didn't get around to opening it `til this morning. Then she brought it to me. \nAMY What is it? \nCharles closes the door. \nAMY What's the matter? This X-rated or something? \nCHARLES Something. Amy, with your encyclopedic world-wide knowledge of skank-ology -- have you ever heard of \"Deaders?\" \nAMY Oh, sure. They're generally in their forties, kind of ex-hippy types. They still think Jerry Garcia is like \"really cool\" even though he's dead. \nCHARLES Not dead-heads... Dead - ers. D-E-A-D-E-R -- S. \nAMY You know, sometimes they wear ponytails. Dream about how great the sixties were. You see `em in the park sometimes... \nCHARLES Love of my life, go screw yourself. I'm asking you a serious question. \nAMY No, Charles. I've never heard of \"Deaders.\" \n", "test1_true": "Charles goes to the VCR and hits the play button. Amy finishes her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the still- glowing butt of her last one. She leans forward. \nON THE TAPE \nThe image flickers into view. It's handheld, low-rez, clearly been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere, decorated in a \"mattresses on the floor/beer spray on the walls\" type decor. There are around half a dozen PEOPLE there, in their twenties and younger. They drift in and out of frame, in and out of focus. \nWe hear a woman's voice -- clearly the person who is operating the camera, as the shot moves about the room. This is MARLA CHEN. \nMARLA (off screen) Okay, okay. Here we go. There's Anna... \nThe camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on ANNA, a girl with bright dye-red hair (on the side of her head that isn't shaved). Anna looks, with no particular expression and goes away. \nThe camera turns toward a smudged mirror on the wall and we get a look at Marla, a twenty-ish Asian girl. \nMARLA Here's Marla Chen, official Deader Archivist. Hello, me. \nhe camera turns toward a door as it opens and KATYA, a young round-faced girl with dark hair, comes out, looking a bit nervous. \nMARLA (off screen) And here's the star of the show. Katya... \nShe gives a little smile. The camera swings over toward a mattress on the floor. Some of the people are tugging a plastic sheet over it. One of them, and the one who clearly appears to be in authority -- a man with albino-like features -- WINTER. \nMARLA And here's our deader bed -- this is the scene of the crime. Crime to be... \nhe camera moves in on Winter. \nMARLA And here is the fearless leader of the Deaders... Winter. \nWinter glances up, then dismisses the camera altogether. He looks off screen, then raises his hand. The room quiets. We hear various voices. \nVOICES Shh. Quiet. We're starting. \nWinter looks up and the camera swings toward Katya. She hesitates. A girl next to her starts to prompt her. \nWINTER Do you become one of us of your own free will? \nKATYA Yes. \nWINTER Are you afraid? \nKATYA Yes. \nWINTER Good. Fear is the place we go to learn. \nShe hesitates. \nATYA (reciting) My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real. My muscles aren't real. My bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... aren't real. What I see, what I hear, what I taste, what I touch, what I remember, what I think, what I feel, aren't real. \nWINTER (off screen) Go on. \nKATYA I'm not real. \nThe camera swings back to Winter, who gestures for her to come forward, then swings back to see her coming. \nThe various people in the room gather around as she comes to the mattress. The camera moves this way and that, trying to get the best angle to cover the action. People spread towels on the mattress, over the plastic, as Katya, naked, sits down on the towels, then lays back, flat on the mattress. \ninter looks to the Black Kid standing next to him. He comes up with a big handgun -- maybe a .45. \n", "test1_id": 726, "test2_input": "AMY It's him.! \nIn an instant, Amy is tearing down the platform, heading for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side. \nCOP Hey... \nAmy is watching, staring through the moving train windows. The figures are still there. Winter is staring at her - \nCOP Hey, stop! Tomislav! Tomislav! \nn the next instant, the Cop is giving chase, and another Cop, clearly, the \"Tomislav\" called by the first Cop, further down the station, is rushing in to head Amy off. \nAMY It's them! Over there, over there! \nn the next instant, Tomislav tackles Amy and she goes down on her face. Even with the rather large Cop on top of her, she's still struggling. \nAMY God damn it, get off of me! Get the hell off of me... Get... \nShe keeps struggling as the first Cop, and the others on the station, converge on her. She looks toward the far platform. \nThe figure is still there, visible through the windows of the departing train. Then, the last car of the train passes, leaving an unencumbered view of the far side. \nThe platform is empty. No sign of Winter. No sign of anybody. \nAmy stop struggling, as the Cops tug her arms back, handcuffing her. She hardly notices, but keep staring at the empty platform across the tracks. She glances up at the Cops. \npanting Tomislav looks down at her. Then circles his finger around his ear to his comrades. They all understand. \nTOMISLAV (IN ROMANIAN) She's Crazy. \nINT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nAmy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale. The door opens behind her. She hears a familiar voice. \nCHARLES (O.S.) Is this where they keep the cheaper whores? \nAmy glances up at him, without expression. \nCHARLES Christ, you're lucky to have a boss like me. Once again, I have saved your small but relatively shapely behind. \nAMY Least you got to travel. What were they going to charge me with, anyway? \nCHARLES Charge you? They were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation -- and believe me if you go in there, you don't come out. But through my mastery of international negotiations I managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible. You got your stuff? \nAMY Yeah. \nCHARLES Come on. \nSlowly, feeling her bruises, Amy gets up. \nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nCharles and Amy walk and talk. It's pissing down rain. Charles hold an umbrella for the two to share. \nAMY Why'd you give me this story? \nCHARLES Who else would have taken it? Either they're going to think it's bull-shit, or they're going to be too afraid of it. But Amy Klein... Tell me it's real Amy. \nAMY It's real -- or I'm crazy. \n", "test2_true": "AMY I've got leads. I'll know in the end. \nCHARLES You know, Amy dearest, for the average person, hunger for knowledge is like hunger... for food. We want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite. Then we're satisfied, and we stop. But you... you're like a glutton. You can't help over-eating. \nAMY I don't see you complaining. \nCHARLES But you see, that's the point. That's why I need you. Because all that stuff I don't eat... I still want. So I send you in to do the eating for me, and so I get to experience it, without actually suffering any mental indigestion. \nAMY That's for me... \nCHARLES Nobody's forcing anything down your throat. Correct? \nAMY No. \nCHARLES You see, Amy, you never grew up with all this Catholic god and guilt stuff. It doesn't mean anything to you. I worry about god and heaven and hell. Not during the day, you understand, but around three in the morning, it keeps me up. I want to know what's coming. What's up in heaven and down in hell, or even if there's nothing. It's useful, when you're making plans. So go find out and we'll tell the world. \nAMY You know, Charles, there's something vaguely demonic about you. \nCHARLES Did you know, the word \"demon\" comes from the Greek word for \"knowledge.\" As in \"demonstrate.\" \nAMY No, I didn't know that. \nCharles shakes his head, disgusted. \nCHARLES American education. \nThey're in front of Amy's Hotel now. Charles flags down a CAB. \nCHARLES Then back to your room, lie down in your coffin until the hours of daylight have passed, as is your wont -- then go get me my story. A \nMY You don't have to worry. \nCHARLES I never do. I'm not here to save people and I'm not here to judge them. I just take `em as they come. And use them as they pass by. I'll be at the Soffitel. \nCharles hops in the cab and drives off as Amy walks up the steps to the Hotel lobby. Amy watches him go, waves, then spins back towards the curb. She flags down a cab and hops in. \nEXT. POTEILARI AND MINVARA - DAY \nA ragged, run-down place, looking bleak and ugly in the bright light of day. We see the street sign, identifying the place -- Poteilari and Minvara. A cab pulls up and Amy gets out. \nShe crosses the street, passes one side door -- and then comes to a building that's been sealed up -- doors and windows cemented shut with cinder-blocks. \nBeyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways against the building, running down to a basement entrance. Amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. The stairs and the bottom are littered with trash. A filthy mattress lies at the very bottom. Amy heads down. \nEXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY \nAt the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. A hole has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been bolted to the door frame. Some official government notice of some kind has been tacked to the door -- long rendered unreadable by the effects of time. \nAmy inspects the padlock. It's heavy and uncompromising. She tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain -- but that's only a few inches. Amy peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. \nShe looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps to the side and shoves it up. \nThen, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp and pulls. The bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose. They slide out with it. She tugs the whole thing free and pulls the door open. \nThere is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. Amy enters. \nINT.   THE CORRIDOR - DAY \n", "test2_id": 727, "test3_input": "Amy and Marla march quickly towards camera. \nAMY Marla what... what happened to you? \nMARLA I put my head through a noose and I jumped ten feet down. They cut me down, and Winter breathed into me, and I was alive. And everybody was happy... and like, congratulating me... \nMarla's eyes are wet with yellowish tears. \nMARLA And for a while, it was great. But it's like being a tightrope walker... you're walking along on this rope, and then all of a sudden, it's like you realize -- I'm walking on a rope a hundred feet up in the air. And that's when you fall. struggles to control herself) I tried to end it. That's when you found me. AMY Why are you doing this? Why am I here? \nMARLA For the reward from it all. \nThe tunnel starts to take some weird twists and turns. \nThey stop and Marla turns amy in her direction. The place starts to tremble, a train is approaching from far off. \nMARLA But it isn't enough for somebody else to stick a knife into you. You have to come to the point where you can do it to yourself -- that's the acceptance. The final preparation before you give your soul to it. Willingly. \nAMY But why? What it is all for? \nMARLA That's the missing link. That part he keeps to himself. But he promises an eternal paradise filled with the ultimate pleasures. We just can't be afraid. And we can't have any doubts. (introspective) Guess I screwed up on that part. \nThe tunnel is narrowing, the train is right around the bend. Amy turns to the sound of the rumbling train. \nMARLA Fear is where you go to learn. \nAmy spins back to her. \"Huh?\" \nMARLA Sorry. I told you there's no turning back Amy. Only he can bring you back. \nAmy's attention is on the train, it roars in at full throttle. \nWINTER AMY! \nAmy turns around just as the train is about to run through them to find WINTER, arms open for her. \nWINTER (screaming over the train) All roads lead home. \nINT. A BED - DAY \nAmy's eyes abruptly pop open. \nShe's lying on a white pillow, with white sheets tucked up over her. She turns her eyes to one side. There's a hospital curtain, the kind on a railing, pulled closed around her. She looks down. \nShe's lying in a hospital bed. She tries to move, but she realizes her hands and legs are tied to the bed by large leather straps. Charles is there, in a chair, watching her. \nCHARLES Good morning. \nHe takes a sip of coffee. She struggles with the straps. \nCHARLES Amy don't fight it, it's only going to make things worse. \nHer eyes dart around the room in a panic. \nAMY What the hell happened? \nCHARLES I didn't hear from you. I went over to your hotel. You were lying on the floor... covered in every kind of stuff that can come out of a human body... \nShe remembers. \n", "test3_true": "Amy looks down at her gown, expecting a large red stain, but there's no blood. \nCHARLES Okay. Every other kind. \nAMY I don't... I mean I didn't... \nCHARLES You were sort of... having a psychotic episode, sweets. Major mental blow-out. And frankly, it's about time. Jesus you were tied down for a day and half. (off her look) Listen, I'm trying to get you out of here, back to London, but with the damage to your hotel room... They're not going to be so quick to let you go. \nAmy takes a look around the psych ward. PATIENTS walking aimlessly, mumbling to themselves, arguing with unseen opponents, rocking back and forth in catatonic states. \nCHARLES Look, Amy, you probably won't have to stay... \nAmy feels a sudden rush of relief. A little nervous laughter. \nAMY Hey, Charles, Charles... this is the best news I've had in a long time. \nCHARLES Well, there you go. A whole new definition of optimism. \nAMY What about Marla Chen? The story? \nCHARLES They found her dead in her room. She hung herself. \nAMY They found her. You mean the police? \nCHARLES Yeah. She'd been there awhile. Probably did it right after she sent us the tape. \nAMY Where is she? \nCHARLES Jesus, I don't know. Does it matter? \nAMY No, I guess not. \nCHARLES But this is a good story too. Call it, \"My Psychotic Episode\" -- or, wait, maybe \"Psychotic - Episode One.\" Or \"Psychotic Pilot Episode.\" You know, some play on words with episode. (looks around) Look, there's a lot of raw material around here. Emphasis on the word \"raw.\" Maybe they'll let you use a felt-tip pen or something to take notes. \nSomebody pulls the curtain aside. It's an ORDERLY. His name tag identifies him as M. KIRCHER. This guy's a little out there, like maybe he's been dipping into the medicine cabinet a little too much. His eyes nervously scan the room, like somebody's watching him. \nKIRCHER Well look who's back. How we feelin? \nShe motions to the straps. \nAMY Trapped. \nKIRCHER Sorry. They're for your own protection. The way you were flailing around when they brought you in -- somebody was bound to get hurt. (he chuckles to himself) Get it. BOUND to get hurt. \nAmy doesn't laugh. Doesn't even crack a smile. \nAMY Don't quit your day job. \nCHARLES (to Kircher) What's say we lose the charm bracelets for now? (turns to Amy) Unless of course you somehow find all of this -- stimulating. \nAMY Don't drag me into your fantasies Charles. (to Kircher) Please. \nKircher obliges and scribbles something on a folder at the end of the bed. Charles leans over, gives her a little peck on the cheek. As he does, he whispers to her. \nCHARLES (whispering) I'll see about getting a camera in here... \nHe stands, winks at her. \n", "test3_id": 728}

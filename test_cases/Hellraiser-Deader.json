{"train": "HELLRAISER: DEADER \nScreenplay By \nNeal Marshall Stevens \nRevisions By \nTim Day \nFADE IN: We roll credits over- \nPeal tight on a pattern of brown and black textures. The image begins to shake. Slow motion. Graceful. \nWE HEAR a low rhythmic THUMP, THUMP, THUMP... \nThe surface slowly peels off like flecks of dried old paint as we pull back a little wider and realize that we're looking at an OLD DOOR. \nTHUMP, THUMP, THUMP... \nThe door continues to rattle. Something or someone is behind it, desperately fighting to get out. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP... \nWider still to include the rusted, worn doorknob twisting back and forth and shaking. Whatever is in there -- it's locked inside. SUPER: HELLRAISER:DEADER \nCROSS DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CRACK DEN - MORNING \nIt's almost pitch black in here as a few beams of light fight W their way through holes in the torn black window shades of this flop-house apartment. TN A HIGH SHOT \nTe take in the scene. A young WOMAN, mid-twenties, lies on an old mattress tossed on the floor in the center of the room. There's a MAN asleep next to her with his arm around her. About a half-dozen others, in various stages of nakedness, are sprawled unconscious around the room. WE BOOM DOWN and as we do we- \nINT. CRACK DEN - NIGHT \nWe're in the middle of a crack/X party the night before. \nLASH CUT TO: \nOur YOUNG WOMAN (AMY KLEIN) moving through the party. She reaches into the pocket of her long black coat and lifts out a TAPE RECORDER. She clicks it on and slips it back into her pocket. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nTHE MAN from our opening shot offers her some X. She lets him place it on her tongue and then she swallows it. He smiles, pleased, and turns to leave. She quickly but slyly removes the X from her mouth and flicks it away.         F LASH CUT TO: \nLater. The party in full gear. Things are really starting to get weird here as the crack pipe starts to make it's way around the room. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nAmy's putting on a full \"X\" performance, taking the crack pipe and quickly passing it on, pretending to be too far gone for another hit, all the while studying the other partiers with a keen reporter's eye. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nLater. After everyone has left. The sun is coming up. Amy alone with the MAN. He's half-naked on the mattress, trying to pull Amy close. Amy's looking for a safe exit, but she's stayed too long and he's starting to get a little rough with her. A wrong move now could push him over the edge. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nAmy's vision starts to blur. Did he slip her something? \nFLASH CUT TO: \nCHARLES ...the delightful and world-famous Amy Klein. Have a seat, angel of light. \nAMY Eat me, Charles. \nCHARLES It's exactly that lack of respect for authority that got you fired from the New York Post. \nAMY I wasn't fired. I was re-assigned. \nCHARLES Of course. Where would you be without me? By the way, I don't recall ever being thanked properly for this \"re- assignment\". Charles makes air quotes with his fingers. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Lucky for you I opened my doors to you here as soon as I heard you were \"available\". \nMore air quotes. Amy walks over to a \"trophy table\" where she looks over a cluster of framed photo's. She points to one of her and Charles, smiling together. More innocent times for both. AMY I seem to recall a rather similar \"reassignment\" with you, Charles. \nCHARLES Touche'. Well, thanks to international conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I, along with Mother England, am blessed with your acquaintance, yet again. \nAMY Hey a contract's a contract. \nShe holds up the cassette recorder. \nAMY (CONT'D) Look, if all this about me being late with the crack whore story It's all right here -- and it's gold. I was just about to- \nCHARLES (interrupting) It's not about the crack whores, I'm sure you're working your usual unrestrained insightful magic on what I'm certain will be another eye-opening expose. I expect nothing but brilliance -- in five thousand words or less. (beat) But this is better. \nAmy spots an open container of Chinese food on Charles's desk. She inspects it, then picks something out of it with a pair of chop sticks. \nAMY So what then? Are we being sued again? \nCHARLES Hmm? Oh no. (sees her eating) Please feel free to have some of that. \nAMY Thanks. What is this? General Tso's cat? \nCHARLES Spare me the \"Nothing comes close to New York Chinese\" speech just this once. Go on, sit down. Just something I wanted to show you... \nHe heads back over to the VCR. Amy ditches the Chinese food and picks up her coffee again. She sits, lights another cigarette. \nCHARLES Okay... rewind, rewind? Rewind. \nHe finds the button, presses it and turns back to Amy. \nCHARLES Somebody mailed us this thing around two weeks ago but, in keeping with our usual level of efficiency, Betty didn't get around to opening it `til this morning. Then she brought it to me. \nAMY What is it? \nCharles closes the door. \nAMY What's the matter? This X-rated or something? \nCHARLES Something. Amy, with your encyclopedic world-wide knowledge of skank-ology -- have you ever heard of \"Deaders?\" \nAMY Oh, sure. They're generally in their forties, kind of ex-hippy types. They still think Jerry Garcia is like \"really cool\" even though he's dead. \nCHARLES Not dead-heads... Dead - ers. D-E-A-D-E-R -- S. \nAMY You know, sometimes they wear ponytails. Dream about how great the sixties were. You see `em in the park sometimes... \nCHARLES Love of my life, go screw yourself. I'm asking you a serious question. \nAMY No, Charles. I've never heard of \"Deaders.\" \nKATYA I'm not real... \nThe camera moves in closer as Winter takes the gun and slips it into Katya's hand. \nKATYA I'm not... I'm not real... \nhe slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her head. \nAMY \n...sits forward in her seat, not quite believing what she's seeing. \nAMY Holy ... Charles... \nCHARLES Just keep watching. \nON THE TAPE \nKatya is breathing fast now, but we can't be sure if it's terror, or passion, or some combination of both. She continues to lie on the mattress, the barrel of the gun pressed against the side of her head. \nKATYA I'm not real. I'm not... \nWinter reaches out, hesitant, and cocks the gun in her hand. Meanwhile, we see other hands, reaching in, pressing a folded up towel against the opposite side of her head. Other hands come in and press a doubled-over pillow against the towel. \nKATYA I'm not real. I'm not... I'm not... \nShe closes her eyes, grits her teeth. Her back arches. \nAMY \ndrops her cigarette as it burns down to her fingers. She stands. \nON THE TAPE \nKatya holds her breath... and pulls the trigger. \nThere's a huge CONCUSSION as the bullet tears straight through her head. We can see it splatter out the other side, tearing through the towel and the folded over pillow, which catch a great blast of bone and brain. \nWe hear some screams in the room. \nAMY jumps back. \nAMY Have you called the police on this? \nCHARLES Just watch... \nAMY I want to know if you've called the pol... \nCHARLES I said, \"Just watch.\" \nAMY Oh, man, don't tell me that was some special effect... \nCHARLES You tell me. \nAMY This is sick... \nCHARLES That's saying a lot, for you. \nThe camera is now pointing at Winter. There is a look of deep tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down, staring toward Katya, who is lying, as dead as dead can be, on the mattress. Blood has run from the ghastly wound down both sides of the plastic, and towels on the side of the bed catch the mess. \nAmy hesitates, shaking her head, not sure what it's all about. \nCHARLES Look, Amy. Maybe this is just some kind of bull-shit shot-on-tape gore movie. And since that's all it can be, that's all you're going find, but it sure smells different to me. If it's bull-shit, you'll know pretty fast. If it's not... \nAmy, though, is only half listening, lost in her own thoughts. \nAMY How could she... \nCHARLES Who said miracles can only happen at Lourdes? \nAMY Who said they happen there? \nShe lifts her fingers to the side of her head, duplicating the action of Katya slipping her fingers inside the wound. \nHARLES Amy... you know what my father said once... \nAMY That all writers were queers? \nCHARLES No, that was a different time. This time, we were driving down the block and there was this fortune-telling place, you know, this gypsy fortune telling place in a store front? And he said, \"You know, if I could tell the future I wouldn't be living in any crappy store front.\" \nHe looks back at the tape. \nCHARLES If I could do that, I wouldn't be hanging out in some rundown basement. I'd own the earth. \nAMY Maybe they're just getting started. \nCHARLES Maybe. \nAMY What else do we have besides the tape? \nCHARLES Just a return address on the envelope. \nHe holds up the envelope which is addressed to \"AMY KLEIN C/O THE UNDERGROUND\". Amy hesitates. Snatches the envelope out of his hand. She reads the return address. \nCHARLES Looks like your online fan-base is growing. It's an address in Bucharest. It's where all the Euro-trash kids looking for a good time are heading these days. Amsterdam is so 90's. \nShe's shocked that he would even know. \nAMY Why Charles... \nCHARLES I still like to keep my finger on the pulse, even though I know you think I don't have one. \nShe thinks about it. He hands her a thick envelope. \nCHARLES Your ticket, hotel and per diem. \nShe smiles. \nAMY You know me too well. \nCHARLES It's what keeps me up at night. (beat) Now here's the part where I'm supposed to say be careful. Be careful. \nAMY Always. \nCHARLES Call me when you get settled. \nShe just smirks and exits. \nEXT. EASTERN EUROPE - DAY \nAmy enters. The place is dark and cold. Eerily quiet. The manager stays in the hallway, he looks at Amy and taps his watch. Amy nods as he pulls the door closed. \nShe descends down the dark hallway. Her face tightens as she takes in the deathly ripe air. The BUZZING of flies getting louder with each step. \nAs she approaches a room, she recoils, clutching her face from the stench. She inhales -- drawing in the smell to acclimate herself -- and almost vomits. She steadies herself, drawing in breaths through her nose, tentative at first, and finally in larger breaths, until she can tolerate it. \nhe looks back toward the entry door, she is alone. \nINT. MARLA'S ROOM - DAY \nAmy steps in and stops, struggling to keep herself from retching. \nNo sign of anything dead. No sound except the sinister buzzing of flies. Amy steps cautiously in. \nShe looks toward one side, sees a closet with a double sliding door. She slides open one side, sees nothing that shouldn't be there -- a ragged winter jacket, a green plastic raincoat, a hangar festooned with scarfs, some other garments still obscured beneath cleaning bag plastic. \nShe hesitates, then calmly slides the other side open. More of the same. \nShe turns in the other direction. There's a little kitchen. Nothing dead there. She starts forward then turns back -- staring at the refrigerator. She goes quickly over and tugs it open. It's empty. Not so much as a ketchup bottle. Curious, she opens the freezer. The same. Empty. \nShe heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor leading to another bedroom. At the end of the hallway is a bathroom. The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet, on the far wall, faces the door. Marla is there. \nDressed only in bra and panties, she is sitting on the closed lid of the john, leaning forward in what seems, at first, to be an impossible angle. Her hands hang forward, almost touching the floor. Her head is cocked back, staring up. Her skin is gray, swollen. \nAmy takes a few steps forward, for a better look. As she approaches, she sees the reason for the odd position of the body. \nA long boot-lace has been tied around Marla's neck and tied to the wall pipe on the toilet. The flesh of her neck has swollen out, almost burying the boot-lace. She has hanged herself in this ghastly way. \nAmy takes another step forward. As she does, there's a sudden loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla abruptly rise up, alarmed (or whatever it is flies are) at her approach. But they soon return to the corpse, crawling about the face, around the edges of the glazed, eyes, around the margins of the open mouth, rimmed with dry foam -- around the out-thrust tongue. \nAmy covers her mouth with her shirt, trying to filter out the stench. She backs away from the body and into another room. \nIN THE BEDROOM \nAmy starts to search -- fast, thorough, -- she's done this sort of thing before. She finds a journal, opens it... no writing. She tosses it aside. Pulls open a drawer. She tugs out what looks like a blade-less knife handle. She presses a stud. A STILETTO BLADE SPRINGS OUT. She tosses it back in the drawer, tugs some other stuff into view. \nSome bills, some shoelaces, loose change. She goes drawer to drawer, looking for anything that might mean something. Socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee shirts and short skirts and jeans. \nAmy stops, surveying the territory. Where to look next? Then, deciding, she goes to the bed. \nShe reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a dust-encrusted skirt. Feels around some more, hesitates, pulls something else out. She brings it out into view. It's a desiccated mouse. She grimaces and tosses it back under the bed in disgust. \nShe stops... then slides her hand between the mattress and the box spring. She feels around, then stops, finding something. She pulls out a little red paper folder -- the kind that photographs come from. She opens it. \nIt appears to be a photographic record of another \"deader\" party. We see some of the same participants -- we also see Marla herself in some of the pictures. She's smiling. Amy flips the next photograph. \nIt shows Marla next to Winter. He's holding something in his hand. Amy looks closer. THE PUZZLE BOX -- Amy turns another photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front of Marla. \nThe picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose on one end. Marla is on the other side-- Almost a kind of \"joke\" photo. \nShe has a kind of sickly smile on her face. Amy's eyes narrow. She holds the picture closer. There seems to be a figure lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more reality merges with the grains of the photo. What is there? A man? \nAmy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room. She stuffs the book in her satchel. \nAmy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the unseen bathroom. She sits, silent, waiting. \nThen the sound of the scratching comes again. The sound of flies rising -- and again, more distinct -- something scratching. She keeps her position, still listening. Nothing. Just the slow steady, untroubled buzzing. \nShe moves toward the bathroom. \nAmy comes flying down the hall at top speed. She reaches the top of the stairs and starts down... ...and as she does, her feet slip. \nShe slides down five or six steps, then over-balances, throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the polished stone steps. She keeps sliding down, finally over- balancing again, flipping over and landing on her back on the landing half-way between the floors. A MY Dammit! \nThe Manager looks down the stairs for her. He doesn't even attempt to chase her. \nMANAGER \nStop her! \nHe curses her in his native tongue. \nEXT.   SIDEWALK - DAY \nAmy breaks through the doors of the building. She hits two of the ten stairs down to the sidewalk. People walking by hardly notice. \nUp ahead, a police car is turning down the street. She stops and walks calmly, diverting her eyes. The police car races by, and Amy walks faster, and faster, then runs. \nINT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nClose on a tray of ice being cracked apart. It's contents poured into a open towel. \nAmy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now dressed in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin. \nShe has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she applies to this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in the other. She doesn't look happy. She takes a drink, then looks toward a TV and VCR in front of her. \nThere's a tape half-inserted into the VCR. We can see the empty envelope with \"AMY\" written on it, lying on the floor. \nhe tape is within reach of Amy's bare foot, and she lifts a toe toward it, hesitant. She puts her toe against the tape...hanging on the edge of decision. Finally, she shoves it forward with her toe. \nIt slides into the machine. She grabs up the remote and turns on the set. The IMAGE appears. \nIt's Marla, looking like she hasn't slept in days, sitting on a chair in her apartment staring into camera. Her eyes are glazed, distant. But she looks a hell of lot better than she did in the bathroom. \nMARLA (a little sad) I knew you'd come. Course if you're watching this tape, it's already too late for me. But maybe you can stop it. \nAmy removes the PUZZLE BOX from her satchel. Stares at it. \nMARLA He promised us pleasures beyond anything we could ever imagine. We just had to fight through the pain first. Easier said than done. (beat) Don't open the box Amy. If you do Winter wins, and if he wins- \nSomeone pounds on a door. Marla panics. \nMARLA (hurried) Go to Pletkow station at midnight. Go to the south end of the platform and step onto the last car. Find a guy named Joey who runs the show and tell him I sent you. He'll guide you to them. \nThe POUNDING GETS LOUDER. \nWINTER (O.S.) Marla! \nMARLA Save them Amy. Please... \nWINTER (O.S.) Marla! \nMarla leaps forward and- \nMARLA Those you trust the most -- trust the least. \n- shuts off the camera. It goes black for a few seconds, and then cuts to snow. \nAmy sits, staring at the snow, her face empty. She sets the PUZZLE BOX on the table and stares at it. Takes a sip of her drink. \nTHE PHONE RINGS. She nearly leaps out of the chair, striking the puzzle box with her hand. The Puzzle Box closes. \nPINHEAD vanishes back into the shadows. \nAMY Charles, I get the message. OK?    Your my editor, not my Mommy! (long beat) Charles? \nAmy waits. But there's no sound. \nAMY Hello? Hello? \nA sound comes over the line -- a hoarse gurgling sound - a ghastly wet sound - the same sound Amy heard coming from the throat of the hanged Marla. \nMARLA (through phone, wet choking voice) Don't open... \nThe line goes dead. She shoves the whole phone away from her. She sits, breathing fast for a second, staring at the box. Quiet. Only the sound of the snow on the TV. \nShe stands and pulls her pants on. \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT \nA thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a station. \nLit with cold fluorescent light, Amy, now dressed, with her sunglasses in place, slides her card through the slot and shoves through the turnstile. She descends the long, non- working escalator -- the only one on it at this time of night. \nShe reaches the subway platform. It is virtually empty. \nAmy has come down stairs that land her just about in the middle. She scans the far end of the platform, past a lone FIGURE in a SHINY GREEN PLASTIC RAINCOAT who lies motionless on a bench. \n- a couple MIDDLE-AGED GUYS in security uniforms, maybe heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not moving, hands thrust in pockets. \nShe turns back to the bench but the FIGURE in the SHINY GREEN RAINCOAT is gone. \nShe takes up a position at the far end of the platform. She waits. \nA moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair. A few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the station. Amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows. The train is virtually empty. One car after the next rolls by as the train slows. \nFinally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car different from the others comes in. This one, for some odd reason, seems to have newspaper covering all the windows -- taped up from the inside. \nOne of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly in front of the spot where Amy is standing -- the spot marked by the stenciled PUZZLE BOX. There's a pause, then the doors slide open -- just one the one set in front of Amy. The others stay closed. The interior of the car is dark -- the lights, apparently, are not working. \nA tall ODD-LOOKING MAN in a CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM is standing there. He gestures toward the adjoining car. \nONDUCTOR Next car. \nAMY Is Joey on this ride? \nCONDUCTOR Come on in... \nShe enters. The doors slide closed. The train pulls out. \nINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT \nThe interior of the car has been transformed into some odd- ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse.. \nAs the train passes out of the station, and the lights dim, we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes -- or at any rate something being smoked in some kind of pipe, glinting in the darkness. Various hands reach up and tug down the newspapers, and the tunnel lights come in, providing a flickering, constantly changing illumination. \nIn the uncertain light, Amy can see the various CELEBRANTS hanging out -- some on the seats, some on the floor, some dressed, some partially undressed, some engaging in desultory drug use, others in desultory sex acts -- mostly teenagers and twenty-nothings. \nAmy looks around, not particularly effected by the oddness of the scene. The Conductor touches her arm. \nAMY It's him.! \nIn an instant, Amy is tearing down the platform, heading for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side. \nCOP Hey... \nAmy is watching, staring through the moving train windows. The figures are still there. Winter is staring at her - \nCOP Hey, stop! Tomislav! Tomislav! \nn the next instant, the Cop is giving chase, and another Cop, clearly, the \"Tomislav\" called by the first Cop, further down the station, is rushing in to head Amy off. \nAMY It's them! Over there, over there! \nn the next instant, Tomislav tackles Amy and she goes down on her face. Even with the rather large Cop on top of her, she's still struggling. \nAMY God damn it, get off of me! Get the hell off of me... Get... \nShe keeps struggling as the first Cop, and the others on the station, converge on her. She looks toward the far platform. \nThe figure is still there, visible through the windows of the departing train. Then, the last car of the train passes, leaving an unencumbered view of the far side. \nThe platform is empty. No sign of Winter. No sign of anybody. \nAmy stop struggling, as the Cops tug her arms back, handcuffing her. She hardly notices, but keep staring at the empty platform across the tracks. She glances up at the Cops. \npanting Tomislav looks down at her. Then circles his finger around his ear to his comrades. They all understand. \nTOMISLAV (IN ROMANIAN) She's Crazy. \nINT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nAmy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale. The door opens behind her. She hears a familiar voice. \nCHARLES (O.S.) Is this where they keep the cheaper whores? \nAmy glances up at him, without expression. \nCHARLES Christ, you're lucky to have a boss like me. Once again, I have saved your small but relatively shapely behind. \nAMY Least you got to travel. What were they going to charge me with, anyway? \nCHARLES Charge you? They were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation -- and believe me if you go in there, you don't come out. But through my mastery of international negotiations I managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible. You got your stuff? \nAMY Yeah. \nCHARLES Come on. \nSlowly, feeling her bruises, Amy gets up. \nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nCharles and Amy walk and talk. It's pissing down rain. Charles hold an umbrella for the two to share. \nAMY Why'd you give me this story? \nCHARLES Who else would have taken it? Either they're going to think it's bull-shit, or they're going to be too afraid of it. But Amy Klein... Tell me it's real Amy. \nAMY It's real -- or I'm crazy. \nAmy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite light that leaks in from the street. \nThere's an archway, presumably leading into the rest of the basement, on one side, but it's blocked by a great heap of rubble. \nAmy ponders the chances of getting through it, and decides to check out the rest of the hallway. She works her way through a series of ominous corridors. \nAmy senses that she is not alone, stops, and turns around. No one. She continues. \nThere is only a single door left -- at the far end of the hallway. It hangs half-open, but we cannot see what's inside. She approaches it, reaches out and pushes the door open. It's a bathroom. \nAs she enters we see a FIGURE beyond her in the hallways, buried in the shadows. \nINT. THE BATHROOM - DAY \nThis is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink so close that there's hardly room to move. A mop and some other supplies, long forgotten, are propped up in a corner. \nAmy steps in, looks down the toilet. Nothing left but some nasty stains -- the water long dried up. Her face brushes against something hanging in the air. She pulls back. It's a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb. \nShe tugs on it. Nothing. No power here. \nShe stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. She looks back down the hall. It seems as if she's come to another dead end. Then she stares at the bathroom door. Open now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -- the only place she hasn't looked. \nAmy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes the door closed. As she does, of course, what little light there is, vanishes completely. If there's something behind the door, she can't see it, or anything else. \nAbruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter, and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and the previously unseen space behind the door. \nThe walls do not meet there. There is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, apparently \"between\" the walls, perhaps ten inches wide. \nHesitating only a moment, Amy turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. She holds the lighter up ahead of her, but its dim flickering light does not reach to the end of the passage. She moves forward cautiously -- the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster, rotting insulation -- seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of the walls. \nAs she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens behind her. Passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing blade appears. \nInside the tunnel, Amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the wall - - only a few inches thick, but it reduces the available room to under eight inches. She hesitates. Meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. She lets it click off. In some dim half-light we can see her slipping a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation. \nShe flicks the flint. The lighter lights. \nAnd, abruptly, around a million roaches , which had returned from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go skittering every which way. \nAmy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant. \nAMY Christ... \nShe looks at the pipe again, and then starts to squeeze past it. It's a tight fit. She has to squirm to get through. \nAMY Welcome to club anorexia... \nShe pops free and comes out the other side. She holds up the lighter. Still the light cannot reach to the end of the passage. Steeling herself, she moves on. But as she does, the space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower. \nFrom ten inches to nine, to eight, until both sides of her body are scraping against the walls. She holds the lighter out. The wall continues to narrow. \nAt the end of her outstretched arm, the walls are only around five inches apart. \nAMY What the... \nClearly, she's reached the end of the line. Annoyed, she starts to back out -- then realizes that the light on the far side of her body renders the area into which she's now moving essentially black as midnight. \nShe brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body, but she can't bring her hands together in front of her -- the space is too narrow. Finally, she reaches her hand up, over her head, passing the lighter from one hand to the other directly over her head. \nAs she does, the lighter almost slips. She grabs for it, but it goes out. Again she is lost in virtual darkness. \nThe sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place. \nThen somebody in the circle moves, to get a better vantage point, and now Amy can see, clearly, what is going on. \nWinter is lying on top of the corpse of a YOUNG MAN, breathing into his mouth as he did with Katya. An almost sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape. \nHe takes a final deep breath. And then, as before, the Young Man gasps. Winter pulls away. As he does, we can see the Young Man's face, smiling, despite the knife that is lodged into his chest. Winters grabs the knife and yanks it out. \nThe others come forward, helping him up. \nWinter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body. He promptly looks straight at Amy, still hidden in the shadows. \nWINTER I have a room of my own. Kindly join me. \nHe throws the knife at the wall, where it embeds itself in way further then it should have, and walks away. Amy moves away from the opening. She circles around, through a doorway, and into the space that she was previously watching. \nShe moves forward hesitantly, trying to avoid the touch of the various occupants, who don't behave aggressively, but clearly press forward, into her personal space. \nShe looks this way and that, trying to find where Winter has gone. \nA hand comes down on her shoulder. She turns suddenly. It's the Black Kid. He gestures. \nBLACK KID Winter's through there. \nHe points toward a doorway, lost in shadow. Amy notices on his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed. She looks down to the other hand, which the kid politely offers for her to examine. \nAmy backs away through the crowd. Following her is the recently revived Young Man, who's still completely naked. He smiles at Amy. She moves away, and through the door to Winter's room. \nINT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY \nThis is a small, dark space, light coming mostly from a rather conventional-looking standing lamp. In the shadows beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half-open doors, walls and shadows, half lit rooms with un-guessable occupants. \nWinter is there, sitting in a padded chair in front of a coffee table, reading a book. Amy steps inside. Winter doesn't react to her presence. Abruptly, the door closes behind her. She hesitates and walks forward. \nWINTER Amy Klein. \nAMY You know me. \nWINTER I chose you. \nAmy pauses, unsure, then moves forward and takes a seat opposite him. \nAMY That was a hell of a way in. Makes me think that you don't want... \nWINTER People come in here the way they want. If it was difficult, then that was the way you wanted it. A little danger. A little mystery. That's what you expected. That's what you found. \nWinters puts the book down.     His attention is now on Amy. \nWINTER (CONT'D) Were you afraid, Amy? Just now? And during your little \"rite of passage\" through the walls? \nAMY Yes. Was it real? \nWinter smiles, he displays amusement to Amy's suspicions. \nWINTER And were you afraid when you saw Marla Chen? Of what you found in the bathroom? \nAMY Yes. \nWINTER You took something from her? \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nCLOSE ON A DOOR being unlocked. We recognize it from the opening montage. Slowly, it is pulled open to reveal: \nA LITTLE GIRL standing there - frightened. \nINT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY \nBACK TO SCENE. \nWINTER (CONT'D) These spaces. That what makes a hand. You get it by taking things away. You, Amy Klein, are the infinitesimal speck that's left when we subtract the infinite possibilities that the space you occupy might have held. \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY(FLASHBACK) \nThe LITTLE GIRL kicking and screaming. She is pulled out of the closet. We never get a clear view of THE MAN, but we know he is pure evil. \nINT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY \nBACK TO SCENE. \nClose on Amy's hand, trembling in Winter's grip. \nWINTER (CONT'D) (referring to her hand) This thing here isn't a presence. It's an absence. It's a place where things are missing. In all essential qualities, it is less than nothing. In all essential qualities, we are less than nothing. Not solid, not here, not real. \nAmy finds herself responding, falling under his spell. \nFlashback: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nThe LITTLE GIRL is picked up under THE MAN'S arm, and pulled away. His groping hands move seductively, and violently. She is carried away out of sight, kicking and screaming. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nINT. DEADER'S DUNGEON - DAY \nAmy awakens from the trance. She is lying down surrounded by the Deaders. Winters stands above her. \nWINTER What did you see? \nAMY Nothing. \nINTER What are you afraid of, Amy? \nAMY I'm not afraid of you. \nWINTER Yes you are, but still you can't run -- you won't run. (studies her) I wonder why that is? (beat) I'm no devil. I'm no monster. Amy, I'll never hurt you and I'll never leave you. \nAmy doesn't answer. Winter extends to her a knife. \nWINTER (cont'd) Accept my gift. No more fear. No more questions. No one can ever hurt you again. \nFor a moment she appears to consider his offering. Then, as if waking up... she shoves herself back away from Winter. \nAMY No, get... get away... \nAmy puts the phone back on the table. \nAMY Who are you? Why did you do this to me? \nPINHEAD I didn't. Believe me, when I want to hurt you, it will be more than a scratch. \nAMY Then why the hell are you here? Why are you in my room? \nPINHEAD This isn't your room. It's mine... \nAMY What... \nPINHEAD This is my room, my building, my street... my world. You still can't believe that you're in the \"real\" world, can you? I mean... you've just had a A knife run through you. Shouldn't it hurt? \nAMY It's a dream. I'm dreaming... \nPINHEAD No. Dreams come to an end. Nightmares are forever. \nHe approaches her. She backs away. \nPINHEAD You've been recruited as a soldier in another man's war. A war he will never win, that I can assure you. \nAMY I don't know what you're talking about. \nPINHEAD You will. Soon enough. But one shouldn't worship false Gods. Especially when that false God is themselves. \nAMY I'm not a believer. \nPINHEAD Oh you will. Tell me, do you believe in Hell? \nLooks down at the blade jutting out from her chest. \nAMY Starting to. \nPINHEAD You opened a door. He pulled you in. But the only way out -- is through me. \nHe steps towards her. \nShe grabs up the phone, flings it. It hits the far wall and falls to the floor. Winter's gone. She reaches a hand behind her, to her back, brings it back, red with blood. \nA MOMENT LATER \nWe see Amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder. Hands trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky side up. \nShe presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up the tape, with towel attached. She slides the towel down the center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel against the wound. \nShe takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the tape and tossing the roll away. She yanks yesterday's clothes up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans. \nShe tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket. \nShe goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile looks with the towel stuffed in her back. \nShe turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood. She hurries to the sink, rinses them off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then grabs her bag and heads out the door. \nEXT. AMY'S HOTEL - NIGHT \nAmy comes unsteadily down out of her Hotel. \nEXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT \nHer chest is stained with blood. She licks her fingers and wipes the blood away from the middle of her chest. Joey's eyes narrow. He leans forward to study it. He leans in closer, hesitates, then leans back, looking Amy in the eye. \nJOEY Wow, are those real? \nAmy doesn't react. \nJOEY Okay, you're not in the mood for my light- hearted banter. What the hell, this isn't my idea of paradise either. \nAMY I don't understand. Why aren't I dead? Or am I? Please... \nJOEY Life, death, they're not all that different, really. You can find your death in your life. You can find your life in your death. Round and round and round you go. \nAMY Please, help me. \nJOEY I am helping you. \nAMY Then explain what the hell is going on. Why did I have a knife buried in my back? Why am I seeing dead people walking around? Why is there a guy with Pins in his head stopping by in the middle of the night for a chat. \nShe gets in his face. \nAMY Why am I not DEAD! \nThere's a jolt as the train starts to pull into the station. The light from the station begins to illuminate the inside of the car more clearly. Joey leans back from her. \nJOEY Whoa. It's time to give in Amy, you're just fighting it too hard. Forget about the truth, forget about reality, just sit back and enjoy the ride. There's nothing you can do anyway. We're all just piece's in Winter's little puzzle. \nAMY The box. \nJOEY You're willing to do anything to find the truth. (MORE) \nJOEY(cont'd) That's what I find most attractive about you. Well, that and the fact that you have a great ass. You and I are the same really, we're both willing to take it as far as it will go, to the edge, to the extreme. \n(beat) \nYou know what our biggest problem is Amy Klein? Neither of us know when to get off the God damn train. \nThe train jerks to a stop, tossing Amy a little. She regains her footage and turns back to Joey but in the flickering fluorescent light, Joey's skin suddenly looks sickly pale. \nAMY Joey? \nHe doesn't answer. He doesn't move. \nAMY Joey come on. Let's get off the train. Right now, you and me. \nHe still doesn't move. Amy reaches out a shaky hand and takes his glasses off. \nAMY (voice trailing off) You and me... \nJoey's eyes are empty, glazed. He's dead. Not only is he dead, it's clear that he's been dead for awhile. \nThen she freezes when she realizes the sound has completely dropped out around her. \nAll she can hear is her heart beating. \nShe slowly turns around to find that all of Joey's Celebrants on the train are also dead and surrounded by the familiar buzz of flies. \nSome of the dead are hung from the hand rails by HOOKS AND CHAINS, their throats slashed, eyes gouged, bullet holes in the head, etc... \nA large female cenobite is sewing the filleted skin from one Deaders throat open to reveal his vocal chords. He makes a sound at Amy and his chords vibrate. But there's this one COKE HEAD GUY who was snorting a line when Amy got on the train. \nAmy and Marla march quickly towards camera. \nAMY Marla what... what happened to you? \nMARLA I put my head through a noose and I jumped ten feet down. They cut me down, and Winter breathed into me, and I was alive. And everybody was happy... and like, congratulating me... \nMarla's eyes are wet with yellowish tears. \nMARLA And for a while, it was great. But it's like being a tightrope walker... you're walking along on this rope, and then all of a sudden, it's like you realize -- I'm walking on a rope a hundred feet up in the air. And that's when you fall. struggles to control herself) I tried to end it. That's when you found me. AMY Why are you doing this? Why am I here? \nMARLA For the reward from it all. \nThe tunnel starts to take some weird twists and turns. \nThey stop and Marla turns amy in her direction. The place starts to tremble, a train is approaching from far off. \nMARLA But it isn't enough for somebody else to stick a knife into you. You have to come to the point where you can do it to yourself -- that's the acceptance. The final preparation before you give your soul to it. Willingly. \nAMY But why? What it is all for? \nMARLA That's the missing link. That part he keeps to himself. But he promises an eternal paradise filled with the ultimate pleasures. We just can't be afraid. And we can't have any doubts. (introspective) Guess I screwed up on that part. \nThe tunnel is narrowing, the train is right around the bend. Amy turns to the sound of the rumbling train. \nMARLA Fear is where you go to learn. \nAmy spins back to her. \"Huh?\" \nMARLA Sorry. I told you there's no turning back Amy. Only he can bring you back. \nAmy's attention is on the train, it roars in at full throttle. \nWINTER AMY! \nAmy turns around just as the train is about to run through them to find WINTER, arms open for her. \nWINTER (screaming over the train) All roads lead home. \nINT. A BED - DAY \nAmy's eyes abruptly pop open. \nShe's lying on a white pillow, with white sheets tucked up over her. She turns her eyes to one side. There's a hospital curtain, the kind on a railing, pulled closed around her. She looks down. \nShe's lying in a hospital bed. She tries to move, but she realizes her hands and legs are tied to the bed by large leather straps. Charles is there, in a chair, watching her. \nCHARLES Good morning. \nHe takes a sip of coffee. She struggles with the straps. \nCHARLES Amy don't fight it, it's only going to make things worse. \nHer eyes dart around the room in a panic. \nAMY What the hell happened? \nCHARLES I didn't hear from you. I went over to your hotel. You were lying on the floor... covered in every kind of stuff that can come out of a human body... \nShe remembers. \nMARLA Looks like you're running out of time. \nAmy leaps up from the table and suddenly Marla is gone. In fact the whole room is empty and dead quiet. A pool of blood lies beneath her seat. She staggers a bit as she moves forward. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe main corridor. It seems to go on forever. \nAmy turns back to the common area. Empty. \nThe she hears the familiar sound of A LITTLE GIRL SCREAMING. It's faint and echoing. \nAmy turns back down the corridor to the Little Girl's voice. \nMARLA (V.O.) It's all about finding the truth... \nAmy starts to slowly make her way down the long cold corridor. \nWith each step she takes, the walls of the corridor become whiter, slowly bleaching out. She looks below her and sees the blood now draining from the wound. \nShe stumbles back slowly and turns as the LITTLE GIRL'S SCREAMS continue. \nThen she hears the BANGING and RATTLING of a door. Like someone's fighting to get out. \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nAMY'S FATHER half walking, half stumbling out of one of the rooms at the far end of the corridor. He's dressed in a stained white tank top shirt, his eyes glazed and distant. \nHe's knows the source of the noise -- and he's pissed. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nBack to scene. \nAmy keeps stumbling down the corridor. \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nNow Amy is within the flashback. She looks good, no blood, almost peaceful. Her father looks down the corridor toward Amy, but doesn't seem to see her. He turns and storms off in the opposite direction. \nAmy can't believe what she's seeing, but she can't help herself. She follows him. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nBack to scene. \nAmy is stumbling more than walking as she grows weaker with every step. Her eyes begin to glaze over and her vision is beginning to blur. \nShe looks down to find the trail of BRIGHT RED BLOOD trailing behind her on the otherwise PURE-WHITE floor. \nWhen she looks back up she finds herself in- \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nAMY'S EYES SNAP OPEN as we quickly BOOM UP to find her lying on a mattress in the middle of the floor surrounded by- \nTHE DEADERS. She's in the middle of the ritual. The Deaders are all chanting. Marla and Joey are there. \nDEADERS (O.C.) My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real. My muscles aren't real. (MORE) \nDEADERS(cont'd) My bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... aren't real. What I see, what I hear, what I taste, what I touch, what I remember, what I think, what I feel, aren't real. \nWith a glance she can see that the PUZZLE BOX, in its solved configuration, sits on a make-shift altar at the head of the mattress. \nWINTER is towering over her at her feet. He holds out a knife -- THE FAMILIAR STILETTO -- for her to take. \nWINTER You've gone through this before Amy. Go through it again -- with me. \nAmy has a sudden look of resignation, mixed with a little relief. She reaches out and slowly takes the knife from Winter. \nWINTER That's it. I knew you were the one. The second I saw you, I knew you were the one. \nThe chanting continues. \nDEADERS My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real. My muscles aren't real. My bones, my heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and meat... aren't real. What I see, what I hear, what I taste, what I touch, what I remember, what I think, what I feel, isn't real. \nAmy looks at Marla. She looks deader then ever. She chants with the others. Winter holds the knife closer for Amy. \nAmy looks at the PUZZLE BOX. RAYS OF LIGHT start to stretch out like hands and swirl from the PUZZLE BOX. \nTHE ROOM STARTS TO RUMBLE. \nA BLACK VOID starts to take shape and swirl behind them. Winter is pleased. \nWINTER It's working. I knew it. \nHe kneels down next to Amy. \nWINTER Say it with us Amy. You have to say it with us. \nAmy's hands start to tremble. \nAMY I can't. \nWINTER Yes you can Amy. You're one of us now, all you have to do is take this final step and let the pain go. And welcome a world of ultimate pleasures. AN ARM, bluish white, stretches out from the VOID trying to grab Joey who ducks it's grasp. \nThe Deaders break the circle around Amy as more ARMS reach out from the void. The VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS, twisted and warped, scream out for help in the wind that BURSTS out of the void. \nHOOKS AND CHAINS reach out and grab the outstretched arms, dragging them back into the VOID. Back into Hell. \nThe Deaders turn to Winter -- they're all a little freaked out. From the look on their faces it's clear that this isn't at all what they expected. \nJOEY Where are the naked chicks? The oil? The orgies? \nIt's not what Winter expected either. \nWINTER (calm) Finish it Amy. \nAMY I can't. \nWINTER (screams) Finish it! \nAmy steels herself with sudden resolve. \nNow we can see the terror in Winter's eyes. \nPINHEAD It just might come true. \nWinter screams as he is finally torn apart by the chains. Pinhead turns his attention to the DEADERS. \nPINHEAD This world, it obviously disappoints you all. Perhaps that's why you choose to begin this journey. And as long as you so willingly accepted, allow me to finish off what he started. \nAnd out of the darkness an oversized MENACING CHAIN comes FLYING OUT, HARPOONING straight through the midsections of all the deaders lined on the right side of Amy. Piercing \nthem at all different levels. \nThen another chain HARPOONS the Deaders on the left side. The Deaders look like fish on a stringer. They dangle there, suspended by the chains. \nPINHEAD (to Amy) And as for you. You opened the box, you brought us all together. You chose wisely. I'm pleased. \nAMY I didn't want any of this. They used me to open the box. I didn't choose to do anything. Amy looks to Marla, she's got the fear of god in her. Pinhead sees Amy looking for help. \nPINHEAD She's one of us now Amy. Now a guide to the far reaches of pleasure. To a world where suffering is taken to higher level. \nAMY Please. \nPINHEAD You opened the box. \nAMY I didn't mean to. I only wanted the truth. \nPINHEAD And now you have it. But knowledge comes with a price -- and it's time to pay. \nAMY What about them? \nWe see the CENOBITES now with snake-like tongues working their way up the line of Deaders towards Amy. They're preparing each one as they pass. Poking them with large pins, piercing them, stitching them, filleting them, etc... \nPINHEAD They belong to me now. They offered themselves willingly through him to me -- And now it's time for you to do the same. \nAmy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at Pinhead. \nPINHEAD It won't be that easy this time. But yes, your Father is with us too. And he's waiting for you. \nThese words pierce through Amy. She looks at Marla, now barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness. Her head lifts up to Amy. \nARLA You're here to stop this Amy. He needs your soul willingly. Don't let him take you. Don't go willingly. \nMarla looks at the knife. Amy gets it, she only has one way out. Marla can see the uncertainty in her eyes. \nMARLA Its over. Winter is gone. You can't come back. You won't become a Deader...or one of them. \nMarla looks to Pinhead, then back to Amy. They both know what she has to do. \nMARLA (her final words) Only he can bring you back. \nAmy sees the meat hanging off the chains. It used to be Winter. She glares at Pinhead with a sudden look of confidence, like a light bulb has gone off and she can finally see her way out. She raises the knife high in front of her. \nThe two SNAKE-TONGUED CENOBITES move in closer to Amy. They can't wait to have a little taste. \nFor a moment, Pinhead is pleased, then Amy begins the DEADER CHANT, but reverses its meaning. \nAMY                               PINHEAD My skin IS real. My eyes ARE       It's too late to save real. My muscles are real. My      yourself. Your soul is mine bones, my heart, my veins and      and mine alone.

They haven't seen that before. \n", "test1_input": "AMY I'm already into it. \nJOEY Angel, devil, angel, devil \nAmy produces the Puzzle Box from her pack. Joey looks at it like he's just seen a ghost. \nJOEY This is making me very unhappy... \nHe pushes the woman from his lap. He's more serious now. \nJOEY (CONT'D) Poteilari and Minvara. On the northeast corner, two doors down, there's a stairway going down into a closed up building. It's always locked, and they're not always there. I don't know where they are when they're not. And once you get mixed up with them -- it's like that story with the tar baby -- chances are you never get loose, and if you do, you never get clean. \nThe \"Conductor\" shouts from somewhere. \nCONDUCTOR Coming in! \nHands promptly reach up, covering the windows with newspaper. The Conductor goes to the door. The band finishes its set as the light from the station shines through the newspapers. Joey, looking drab in the steady uneven light, stares at Amy. \nJOEY I can't take responsibility for you. \nAMY I'm not asking you to. \nAmy begins to walk off. Joey leans forward, for the first time he seems sincere, almost foreboding. He shouts over the breaking train. \nJOEY Amy Klein, I'm doing a change of heart thing here, which doesn't usually happen with strangers, but I'm trying to give a little back, it's this whole Karma kick I'm on -- don't do it. Don't go any deeper. Forget about it. Move away. Change your name. Become somebody different. \nThe other members of the car watch the two of them. \nAMY Can't do that. I've got that fucked up self- destructive thing going on. \nJOEY Yes you do. \nThe one door hisses open. Amy stares at Joey for a second, turns and departs, back into the fluorescent lit station. \nJoey calls after her. \nJOEY Only he can bring you back! \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT \nAmy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut. The train pulls away. She checks her watch, then moves to the other side of the platform. She looks down the tunnel. The light from an approaching train is beginning to reflect off the curved wall of the tunnel. \nShe turns back in the direction she just looked. Far down the platform, there's a bench with a lone occupant - - a slumped over figure dressed in a SHINY GREEN RAINCOAT. She turns toward it, staring. In the distance, no details of face or form are visible -- just the lumpy figure in the shiny green raincoat. She takes a step toward it, but still cannot make out any detail in the slumped over figure. She approaches... as does the train. There is no sign of movement. \nShe comes around, closer to the edge of the platform, to get a more direct view of the green-coated form. As she does, she sees that one hand is draped off the front edge of the bench, hanging limp. The hand is gray. \nAmy takes a step forward. \nHis eyes pop open! He looks at her with large black eyes, dead eyes. Dripping from beneath his raincoat is a small pool of fresh blood. \nAmy gasps, takes a step back -- and her heel lands on the edge of the subway platform. She struggles for balance. \nAbruptly, a man's voice comes from somewhere. \nVOICE Amy Klein! \nAmy stumbles forward, goes down to her knees and turns. Around twenty feet behind her, standing on the edge of the platform, with his back toward the drop, is- \n- WINTER, wearing a black trench-coat, cinched at the waist. \n", "test1_true": "And as the train comes flying in, he calmly falls backward, directly into its path. \nAmy screams. \nIn an instant she's up, running alongside the braking train. The doors open, but virtually nobody comes out. The front of the train is still far ahead. \nAMY Hey! You hit someone! Someone fell in front of the train! Hey! Hey! \nThe doors hiss and start to close. Finally, Amy reaches the front window of the train. She hammers on it. It opens and a middle-aged WOMAN'S face leans out -- the DRIVER. \nAMY Somebody fell... somebody fell in front of the train. \nDRIVER Where? Where is he? Where'd he fall? \nAMY Back there, way back... \nShe looks back in the direction from which she's come. The bench is now empty. \nT \nDRIVER Aw, damn... Dammit! \nAmy, though, is now looking, this way and that -- at the confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of the train. There is no sign of Winter \nIME CUT: \nINT. TRAIN STATION - LATER \nThe train is still there, doors open. There are TRANSIT COPS on the station, disgruntled passengers hanging out on the platform... TRACK WORKERS are poking around underneath it. \nAmy is leaning against one of the metal pillars, staring at the empty bench -- at the place where the mysterious figure was sitting. She's looking grim. \nBehind her, a Track Worker approaches the DRIVER, who's standing with a pair of Transit Cops. He's shaking his head, shrugging. The Driver curses, heads back toward the first car. One of the COPS approaches Amy. \nCOP Well, the men have looked. \nAMY And there's nothing there? \nCOP You don't seem terribly surprised. \nAMY Hmm? \nThere's a sudden hiss. Amy turns as the train doors close. \nCOP I mean, you don't seem terribly surprised that there isn't somebody under the train.    A MY I don't know what to say. I saw him... \nCOP Yeah. That's the thing. Can you tell me again, just what it is that you saw? \nAMY Um, I was standing on the platform... \nThe train starts to move out of the station. Amy looks toward it. The train is moving on one of the center tracks, so that you can look through the windows of the cars and see through them to the platform on the far side. \nAMY ...and, um... I saw this man standing on the edge of the platform, facing away from it. \nBut now Amy is seeing something -- through the windows of the moving train. On the platform on the far side, there is a lone figure, the man in the black trench-coat. Amy jumps, looks more closely. \nCOP Did he say anyth... \n", "test2_input": "CHARLES I think it's too dangerous, for a lot of reasons. \nAMY This isn't like you. \nCHARLES I know. I'm going to hate myself in the morning. \nAMY I'm just a little... fucked in the head. That's all. It's just a funk, but I'm fine. All I need is some sleep. \nCHARLES OK. I just thought I'd put it out there to see if you'd bite. I should've known better. It goes against my instincts. A MY That's what I love about you. I'll call you tomorrow. (beat) \nHey, Charles, did you know that the word \"demon\" comes from the Greek word for knowledge. \nCHARLES Yes I believe I've heard that somewhere before. \nAMY Well, I wish somebody had told me about it. \nShe hangs up, and shuts off a light on her way to bed. \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nCLOSE ON the LITTLE GIRL slung under THE MAN'S arm, as he carried her down the hall. She's scraping at the walls, the door jams, anything to try to free herself from him. \nHer hand sweeps across a small table at the end of the hall, smashing over a GLASS VASE. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT.   AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER \nThe room is dark, drained of all color the way things appear when we see in them in almost total darkness. \nAmy's lying in bed on her stomach. The sheet has crumpled off of her. She's dressed only in her panties. \nAbruptly, there's the sound of a wettish \"thud\" and Amy seems to bounce a little. Her eyes open, but she isn't alarmed. Still lying on her back, she flicks her eyes this way and that, but, seeing nothing, she closes them again. \nA few seconds later, we see some black liquid trickle across her shoulder, coming from the unseen center of her back . It follows a course down her backbone, then swerves and finds a path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades, finally trickling down her neck. It continues to flow, staining the pillow by her face. \nShe stirs slightly, clearly feeling the trickle. She puts her hand to her shoulder, smearing the black liquid. Still half- asleep, she tries to \"brush\" it off... but it continues to flow. Finally, her eyes open. She sits up painfully and looks at her hands -- stained with this sticky black stuff. She stares at it, not quite awake enough to figure it out. \nShe reaches over her shoulder, pulls her hand back, stained with the black stuff. She looks down at her pillow, also stained. Confused, she rises, painfully awkward, and heads toward the bathroom. We can see that her feet leave blackish wet footprints across the floor as she moves toward the bathroom. \nINT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT \nShe moves in, stares in the mirror -- sees the side of her face and her shoulder, smeared with black. She fumbles for the light, flips it on. \nIn the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, COLOR abruptly re-enters the world... And the black of the liquid that's stained Amy's face and hands, that track the floor of the white-tiled bathroom, that smear the wall where she flipped on the light switch turns instantly to its true color The color of blood. \nAmy gasps at the sight -- she looks like she's just crawled out of a slaughterhouse. She reaches behind her, feeling her back, trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be pouring out of her, dripping to the floor, pouring down the small of her back, staining the back of her panties a vivid, ghastly red. \nIn a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink full blast, washes away the blood from her hands, scooping handfuls onto her face and the front of her body. The water drips to the floor, commingling with the blood, turning it a nasty pink. \nShe reaches behind her back, feeling again -- her hand comes back as vividly red as before. Again she washes them. She stops dead, seeing something in the mirror. \nSomething is glinting between her breasts. She touches her finger to it. It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal, poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel splinter. It appears to have just barely broken through the skin from \"inside\" -- barely a drop of blood. \nShe stands staring down at it, breathing fast. What the hell is it? \nThen, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back to the mirror and looks over her shoulder. She sees -- and we see for the first time -- the center of her back where her questing hands couldn't reach. \n", "test2_true": "She strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. She turns back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes. \nAMY It's not real... it's not real. \nShe clenches her eyes... opens them. Her fingers feel desperately for the metal tip between her breasts. It's still there. \nAMY Wake up... wake up... wake up... \nShe starts slapping her hands against the side of her face -- not gently, hard slaps. But she isn't \"waking up.\" She grabs her hair, pulls hard. Nothing. She's still there. The knife is still stuck, impossibly in her back. \nShe sits on the closed seat of the toilet... not knowing what to do. She reaches again for the knife, but she can't touch it. She buries her face in her bloody hands. \nAMY I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming... (screams) I'M DREAMING! \nShe stands, turns this way and that, not knowing what to do. She looks around her bathroom, searching for something. She tugs open the medicine cabinet, searches beneath the sink, tugging the various stuff out. Whatever it is that she's looking for, she can't find it. \nShe spins back to the mirror. Opens it. Slips back against it wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine cabinet. \nHolding one hand against the mirror, she starts to push away, wincing in pain. \nWe can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish from view, drawn back inside her body . Slowly, making a wet, sticky sound, the long thin knife begins to slide out. \nWith a gasp she heaves out... and the knife goes flying. It bounces on the floor, splattering blood. With shaking hands, Amy bends over and picks it up. She stands, staring at it. It's some kind of nasty stiletto. Amy stands, staring at it. \nA FLASHBACK \nAmy searching Marla's drawers, tugging one open -- pressing the stud on a stiletto. ON THIS STILETTO. \nINT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT \nShe looks down toward the floor. She is literally standing in a pool of her own blood. She gasps, turns back toward the mirror. \nBlood is pouring from the wound. Gasping, almost crying, Amy stumbles back into the main room. With shaky hands, she picks up the phone, then realizes that she's still holding the stiletto in her hand. She drops it on the table. Her bloody fingers press in the numbers -- 9-9-9 (emergency). \nShe waits, standing in the middle of her dark hotel room, shaking, bloody. She can hear the phone ring and ring. \nFinally, there's a click as the line picks up. But there's no voice on the other end. \nAMY Hello, hello? Hello? Is there anyb... \nThen she stops dead. There is somebody there, and making a sound we've heard before. The nasty gurgling that Amy heard when she tried calling Marla's room. \nMARLA (through phone) Only he can bring you back. \nShe slams the phone down, tears the cord from the wall. As she turns to fling it she hears the sound of a man speaking. \nShe turns at the sound. \nPINHEAD is standing across the room from her, reading from one of the books on a tiny bookshelf in the corner. \nPINHEAD (reading) \"--to all of us - there comes the closing of the doors - the entrances - the exits - so that one may pass no more out or in...\" \nHe closes the book, turns toward her. \nPINHEAD Walt Whitman. I like your taste in books. \nAMY Came with the room. Along with the uncomfortable couch. \n", "test3_input": "CHARLES Feel better. (beat) When you get a chance, check out the public area. It's a swinging place. I mean, like, they're literally... swinging. \nHe heads out. Amy watches him go. She waits a beat, and then hops out of bed. She looks around for Nurses and Orderlies but there's no one around. She exits frame. \nINT. PSYCH WARD/COMMON AREA - DAY \nBlank walls lit with flickering fluorescent lighting. There's a TV hanging from ceiling in the corner showing TIME-LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY of a blooming rose (a little homage to the original Hellraiser.) \nWe move to find a various assortment of PATIENTS, but none of them are watching the TV, they're too busy entertaining themselves and their invisible friends. \nAmy enters cautiously, feeling a little threatened by the other patients. She looks around, not sure where she should plant herself and then she sees her- \nA LITTLE GIRL (age 6) sitting off by herself in the corner of the room drawing pictures. A few of them (a half human/half monster clawing at a closet door, a child screaming, a child running from the monster, a child holding a butcher knife, etc.) are taped on the wall behind her. \nAmy walks over to her. There's just something about her. \nAMY Mind if I join you? \nLITTLE GIRL Please. I'm drawing pictures. \nAMY I can see that, they're lovely. \nLITTLE GIRL Want me to draw your picture? \nAMY I'd like that very much. \nThe Little Girl stares at Amy and focuses in on her features. We can't see what she's drawing as her little hand starts to move across the sketch pad. \nBut there's something a little off. Her hand doesn't move like a six-year-old would draw, it moves with the confidence and control of an adult's. \nAmy tries to get a glance at the portrait. The Little Girl pulls it close to her. \nLITTLE GIRL No peaking. \nAMY I'm sorry, you're right. \nWith a few more strokes the drawing is complete. The Little girl studies it, pleased with herself. \nShe spins it so Amy -- but not the audience -- can see it. \nCLOSE ON AMY -- her eyes wide with terror. \nLITTLE GIRL What do you think? \nAMY'S POV as we get our first good look at it. \nIt's Amy's face as a CENOBITE, twisted and stretched in a way that begins to reveal the skull around her DARK EMPTY EYES. \nThere's also that nasty knife wound in the center of her chest with hooks stretching the skin back and to the side. \nLITTLE GIRL (O.C.) I only draw what I see... Amy. \nAmy backs away from her, trembling. \nAMY How do you know my name? \nThe Little Girl giggles. Amy turns to the other drawings that the Little Girl has taped to the walls. T hey too now all look like Cenobites, some look like Deaders, one looks just like WINTER... \nAMY No... this isn't happening. \n", "test3_true": "MARLA sitting on the opposite side of the room. But here's the thing. She looks fine. \nAmy walks over, hesitant, confused. \nAMY Marla? \nMarla doesn't seem to recognize her. \nAMY (CONT'D) \nMarla! You're alive. \nMARLA You say that like it's a good thing. \nMarla takes a long quiet look around the room and then leans in close, unable to keep up her charade. \nMARLA (whispers) You know he's watching us. \nAMY Who? \nS \nMARLA Winter. This is where he sends all the trouble makers. Tries to show us who's boss. Tries to make us believe. \nAMY So it is real? \nMARLA As real as you want it to be. We all have our own version of the truth, some are just more screwed up than others. But you wouldn't know that, because you still don't know the truth. \nAMY I don't understand. \nMARLA You will. You see that's the point. All this, \"Deaders\", \"Cenobites\", whatever you want to call it, it's all about solving the puzzle. Part of that puzzle is you. Finding the secrets that are hidden within you. \nMarla pokes a finger at Amy's heart. Right on her wound. \nMARLA - in there. And as soon as you find that, as soon as you face it, you'll be free. Once and for all. \nhe pulls back into her chair. \nMARLA (CONT'D) Me -- I'm still looking. A MY But what is it all for? \nMARLA Ultimate pleasure -- more than anyone, even those who have solved the puzzle before us, have ever known. Conditions of the nerve endings the likes of which your imagination could not hope to evoke. Marla stares at Amy deeply. The breaks into a smile. \nMARLA ...at Least that's what they say. \nMarla looks around the room to see if anyone is watching her and then she takes Amy's hand and leans in close. \nMARLA Problem is Winter can't solve the puzzle. Only a few chosen ones -- with just the right amount of depravity and loneliness in their soul -- can. beat) So he's been on this quest for years, searching for that mythical person who is both willing to join us and can also solve the puzzle. And it would seem, Amy Klein, that that person is- \nAMY Me. \nMARLA Bingo baby. Sorry. \nShe's trying to give Amy a clue without tipping off anyone who might be watching her. \nMARLA He has to be there for you Amy. And he will be. Like he was for all of us. That's the key. Without him, you can't come back. It's you he wants. Its you he needs. Remember that above all. \nMarla looks down at Amy's chest. Amy follows her stare to find blood starting to soak through her hospital gown. Amy's eyes begin to glaze over. \n"}

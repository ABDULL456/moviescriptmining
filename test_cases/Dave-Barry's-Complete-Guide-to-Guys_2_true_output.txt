STEVE I can fix that. Roger puts the tool kit down. Joins Steve. 
STEVE There's your problem right there. 
(POINTS) You got calcification in your pullet- beam header grommets. 
ROGER I was afraid of that. Steve looks at him. One of those sideways looks. 
STEVE What you gotta do is jack up your laminate bolts and remove the calcification on the stress points. 
ROGER (while Steve takes 
SOME MEASUREMENTS) Of course when he says "you," he doesn't mean "me." I don't have jacks. I don't have winches. And Steve has got like fifty kinds of each, right on his truck. If society collapsed, the Steves of the world will be living in nice sturdy shelters that they built with their own hands, eating food that they grew or caught. And I'll be getting shredded to death by wolverines. 
STEVE Here we go. He reaches down. Pulls out a fuse assembly, holds it up. 
STEVE Here we go. Back in business in no time.

Steve is packing up his truck. Roger is about to go back 
INSIDE WHEN: 
KID Dad, look! Look what Steve made me! A working battleship made entirely out of Coke cans! Roger looks. It is a working battleship made from Coke cans. 
KID This is so neat! Thanks, Steve! The kid runs off. Roger looks at Elaine. 
ROGER Do we have a kid? 
ELAINE Steve got him from the truck. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STEVE'S TRUCK - TRAVELING - DAY 
Dave rides up front with Steve. Talks to CAMERA. 
DAVE Just because Steve can fix things, doesn't mean he's shallow and doesn't have any concerns. All guys have concerns. Deep concerns. 
STEVE 
(LOOKS OVER) You like SportsTalk? Mike the Moose? 
DAVE Hell yeah. Steve gives him a look. Turns on the radio. 
CALLER I'm just sayin' those owners better never run into me. Because God help 'em, man. 
MIKE THE MOOSE -- and we'll pick up on that and more, right after the news. 
CALLER I mean it, man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RADIO STATION - WGRG-AM SPORTSTALK - DAY

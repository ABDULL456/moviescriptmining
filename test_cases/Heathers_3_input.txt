HEATHER DUKE Yeah, so what's the question? 
HEATHER CHANDLER God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase. 
HEATHER DUKE (hurt) I forgot. 
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye. 
VERONICA Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last...... 
HEATHER CHANDLER Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks. 
VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact. 
Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones. 
BETTY Sorry Veronica. 
VERONICA Betty Finn. Gosh..... 
VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful. 
VERONICA I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month. 
BETTY That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date. 
VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe. 
VERONICA Don't say that. 
BETTY Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day. 
BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch. 
VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor. 
VERONICA I was talking with someone! 
HEATHER CHANDLER Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn. 
THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE 
A coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out. 
COURTNEY Oh great. Here comes Heather. 
COURTNEY'S FRIEND Shit. 
MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE 
Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again and brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it. 
THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE 
HEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh, let me snare a tater. 
COURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around. 
COURTNEY Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance. 
HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile. 
HEATHER CHANDLER That's pretty very. Now check this out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. What would you do? 
A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks. 
KEITH That's easy. I'd just slide that wad over to my father. He's like one of the top brokers in the state. 
VERONICA Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City. 
KEITH Man, in two days, my dad could double my money. Triple it. 
COURTNEY If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent. 
VERONICA You're beautiful. 
THE FAMINE FUND STAND 
PETER reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills. 
PETER Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.

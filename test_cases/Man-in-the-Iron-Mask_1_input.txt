FIRST DRAFT 
September 18, 1995 
FADE IN: 
From the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in 
A ROYAL BEDCHAMBER 
The royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal mother grips her hands... 
On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain of childbirth. 
Her fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head, stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers. 
DOCTOR The head is born!  One arm... the other arm... it is a boy! 
The advisors, disregarding the Queen's privacy, scurry around the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet with birth.  The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony, yet she struggles to lift her head. 
ADVISOR 1 I shall tell the king! 
ADVISOR 2 I shall tell him! 
They hurry for the door.  But their race to be first to bring this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits another cry; it surprises the doctor. 
DOCTOR M'lady...? 
He kneels again to examine the Queen. 
DOCTOR Another...?  It is another! 
The joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors.  They look gravely at each other, as they hear a second BABY'S CRY. 
SMASH TO: 
A DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT 
A door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER. 
He carries an OBLONG BASKET. 
A carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a sharp word to the driver -- 
MUSKETEER Away. 
The whip CRACKS and the carriage plunges into the night. 
TIME DISSOLVE: 
EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY 
On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison, like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding.  As we SUPERIMPOSE: 
TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER 
INT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON 
With the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell. 
And we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his eyes... They are blue, childlike. 
A greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty. 
KEEPER You dead yet? 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK No, Keeper. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY

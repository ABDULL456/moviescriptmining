GRIERSON 
Various things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very serious crap right now. 
He can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up. 
They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges smiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes. 
GRIERSON So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel. 
BERNIE Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period. 
GRIERSON David? 
DAVID Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ... 
GRIERSON I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ... 
DAVID on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due? 
GRIERSON hands DAVID a piece of paper. 
GRIERSON Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that? 
PAUSE 
DAVID No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it. CUT TO: 
INT.    LONDON . PHOTO BOOTH.    DAY. 
The camera faces Mr BEAN sitting in a Photo booth. His face is totally impassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes. And then, just before the 4th flash, he pulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen. Flash! He gives a little 
Satisfied giggle. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.    THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY 
7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a bum-fluff moustache. 
DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them. 
DAVID Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some more. 
The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON, has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are laughing in the car as DAVID walks up. 
He is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID. 
CHARLES Hello, David. 
DAVID Hi, Charles. (To Alison) Wow - late! 
ALISON (brightly) I had to do some last minute stuff. 
CHARLES My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you, gallery going well? 
DAVID Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it .... 
ALISON Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short. 
Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better - she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out. 
ALISON Kevin!   You stop that right now! 
CHARLES Great kids.     Good looking too. 
DAVID You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay, looks-wise. 
CHARLES 
Take after their mother, huh? 
DAVID Ah ... absolutely. 
DAVID is not very happy here. 
CUT TO: INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - DAY 
It is open plan and leads through into the lounge. DAVID and ALISON enter. ALISON puts her port folio on the table and leads DAVID onto a sofa. She puts her arms round him. 
ALISON Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.

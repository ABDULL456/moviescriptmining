MALBIN (CONT'D) Might I make an observation? Tuvia gestures, go ahead. 
MALBIN (CONT'D) We need to be strong, but-- 
TUVIA ...But--? 
MALBIN Other things are important, too. 
TUVIA Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to put it.

ZUS And what exactly does that mean, 'do what we can.' 
TUVIA We must send for whoever is left alive. 
ZUS And if it is a hundred? Six hundred? 
TUVIA Then we will provide. 
ZUS And when the Germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us. 
TUVIA I won't let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He has sensed Malbin's growing influence. 
ZUS You won't let that happen.

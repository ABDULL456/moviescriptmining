DOUG (CONT'D) 
Cars are his religion. He can drive a Valiant in the States but I can't drive a Vantage because they won't tolerate the emissions. Well, it's too late now, that's Concorde. 
SHOT OF CONCORDE'S WHEELS TOUCHING DOWN 
30   EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY 
Hands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car. 
DOUG 
How about a hug for your old cousin Doug? He stops looking for his car and focuses on Doug. 
· HANDS 
Fuck off you fat bald bastard - and where's my car? 
31   EXT. BOOKIES 
The black guys are sitting in the car still.         The occasional squeak comes from the dog. 
VINNY 
How am I going to get it out? 
SOL 
He'll probably cough it up. 
VINNY 
Do you think he'll be alright? Sol shrugs. 
SOL 
Hope not. 
TYRONE 
What are we waiting for? 
SOL 
We are waiting for a man carrying a case. 
TYRONE 
Why? 
(CONTINUED) 
31   CONTINUED: 
SOL 
Because the deal is that we give the Russian the case and we keep the money. He rubs his fingers symbolically together 
TYRONE 
What's in the case? Sol turns round to talk to Tyrone. 
SOL 
Fuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of questions. You concentrate on the driving okay? He turns back just as a MAN is stepping into the bookies: he is carrying a case. 
SOL (CONT'D) 
Shit, was that him? 
.'               VINNY 
Don't ask me, you're the one supposed to keep an eye on it. How many fingers did he have? 
SOL 
Are you serious? I am sorry but I couldn't get the binoculars out in time. 
VINNY 
Well let's not stand on ceremony, let's start the show. They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors. Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol hangs back with the shotgun. 
32   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY 
Inside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter. Vinny doesn't mince around and goes straight to the counter, where the HEAD CLERK PAULINE, comes up to help. 
PAULINE 
Yes sir, how can I help? 
(CONTINUED) 
32   CONTINUED: 
VINNY 
You can start by giving me all your money. 
PAULINE 
Does Sir know who this bookies belongs to? 
VINNY 
It. belongs to me now. Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing.              Pauline looks more than a little concerned 
VINNY (CONT'D) 
If you know what's good for... He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun. 
SOL 
Vi nce ? Vince?? He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise tells him to look up.     , 
SOL (CONT'D)                           . 
What are you doing Vince? And what the fuck are you doing up there? A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter. Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is called for.                               . 
SOL (CONT'D) 
I have got your man out here. If you don't put down the screen I'll blow his fucking head off! You hear me?

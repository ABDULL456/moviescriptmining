ALISON Help me stay relaxed. 
BEN So, what should I do? 
ALISON You need to call Dr. Howard. Ben goes into the hall and calls Dr. Howard's house. 
INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE 
Dr. Howard's housekeeper, MARIA, answers the phone. 
MARIA Hello? 
INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM 
BEN Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr. Howard. It's an emergency. 
INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE 
MARIA He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah. 
INTERCUT: 
BEN He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco? Do you know when he gets back? 
MARIA In three days. 
BEN Do you have his cell number, by any chance? Ben pops his head around the corner to talk to Alison. 
BEN (CONT'D) 
(TO ALISON) Hey! Good news. I got his number right here. I'm going to call him right now. 
ALISON Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you. 
KNOCKED UP - 122. 
BEN I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said that. I feel terrible about it. 
ALISON No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong. 
BEN It's okay. I didn't 
ALISON Let's just drop it now. We're over it. 
BEN I'm going to call him right now. You're doing so great. Ben slips into the hallway and calls Dr. Howard. 
DR. HOWARD (O.S.) Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here right now. Please leave a message. 
BEN (into the phone) Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling. Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's going into labor and you are not fucking here. Now, where are you? You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit! And you know I'm going to have to do now? I'm going to have to kill you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac! You are fucking Biggie, you piece of shit! I hope you fucking die or drop the fucking chair and kill that fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes. Peace, fucker! Ben goes back to Alison. 
ALISON Hey. 
BEN Hey. 
ALISON Did you talk to him? 
BEN I didn't talk to him directly, I left him a very nice message, though. What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad. You should know that going in. We can get through this and it's just a little hiccup, but everything will be fine. Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine? 
KNOCKED UP - 123. 
ALISON I can deal with it. 
BEN Okay. So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar Mitzvah. 
ALISON A Bar Mitzvah? 
BEN It's a Jewish rite of passage. And he's going to be there for the next three days, so he will not be able to be here tonight. 
ALISON It's okay. What do you think we should do? 
BEN I know exactly what to do. All we do is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to the hospital, and on the way, we will call every gynecologist we've met. Someone will be available. You know? 
ALISON I can do that. 
BEN Good. We still have time. I mean, how far apart are your contractions? 
ALISON I think, like, seven minutes. 
BEN Seven minutes! See? Not until four minutes is it really coming. And has your water broken, even? 
ALISON I don't know. I'm in the tub. 
BEN That's a good point. Have you had, have you had your bloody show? 
ALISON What's that? 
BEN It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it only comes out right before the baby's going to come, so if that hasn't happened, we have time. We can make it to the hospital. It's no problem. 
ALISON You read the baby books. 
BEN Yeah. I did. I read three of them, actually. 
KNOCKED UP - 124. 
ALISON Thank you. 
BEN You're welcome. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Ben drives Alison's car. They park in a handicapped spot. 
ALISON Wait. Are we allowed to park here? 
BEN It's okay. Ben takes a handicapped placard out of his jacket pocket and hangs it on the mirror. 
BEN (CONT'D) I stole this from Martin's grandma. 
ALISON Oh. That was really sweet of you. 
BEN Thanks. 
INT. HOSPITAL - FRONT DESK 
Alison and Ben approach the desk. A male nurse, SAMUEL, and a FEMALE NURSE tend to them. 
BEN 
(TO ALISON) We're close. Home stretch. (to Female Nurse) Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni said he would let you know we were coming? 
FEMALE NURSE He did. We'll take good care of you. Samuel? 
SAMUEL Yeah?

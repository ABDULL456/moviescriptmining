CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATER 
BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust. 
BOWER None of the activators are working. 
PAYTON Figures. We can ride two hundred thousand tons of space freighter across the galaxy without a dent in the hood, but can't get one good cup of coffee. PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power. 
BOWER Without the mainframe, we can't connect. I don't know how we'll ever be able to- PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of electricity to the light panels. 
BOWER (CONT'D) Oh, I- didn't even think of that. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch. 
PAYTON Payton on the con. Respond? This is Lt. Payton of flight Team...? Shit- 
BOWER Five. 
PAYTON Five? How do you know that? BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON nods, "good thinking." 
PAYTON (CONT-D) Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone awake up there? Dead static. 
BOWER Team Four suppose to be here for the shift rotation. Where could they be? 
PAYTON Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't get to us. BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber. 
BOWER Where could he have gone? PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass and the computer screens slowly fade, going black. 
PAYTON The power systems must be free-floating off blown circuits or something. The over-ride grid won't even lock in. 
BOWER Whatta ya think? 
PAYTON I think we need to find a deck of cards and call the union. Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching the ceiling with uncertainty. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BOWER Somebody... is up there. 
PAYTON Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep re-booting after each surge. That could be anything. THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) I say we get out of here. I'd rather be up and out then stuck in the trunk. The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way towards one end, gesturing towards the doors. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) We're not far from the bridge but without the circuits locked in... I don't know how we could ever get this thing open. As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open. 
BOWER Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out. 
PAYTON Ironic. I think it was built to protect us. 
BOWER (gesturing to the third pod) Well, he got out... some how. A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head as it fades. 
BOWER (CONT'D) Cycle is broken. 
I 
PAYTON What? 
BOWER It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but it's not. Each revolution decreasing before starting over from the beginning. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BOWER (CONT'D) It's trying to reconnect, but it won't until it's reset. 
PAYTON How the hell do you know that? 
BOWER I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I know everything there is to know about that damn reactor. 
PAYTON The training stuck. 
BOWER And I know that... Another SHUDDER approaches. 
BOWER (CONT'D) That's twelve revolutions, before recycling. And this one will only last- As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They exchange a look and...

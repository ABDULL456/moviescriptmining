PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY \nBOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key now. \nTurning it. And the door opens... \nNothing... \nNo bombs. No wife and kids. No one. \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY \nA huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history. \nWE'RE MOVING NOW \nTHE LIVING ROOM \nBOURNE and MARIE exploring. \nMARIE It's big. \nBOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place. \nMARIE This is like a real apartment. (she likes it) This is really yours? \nBOURNE I guess so. \nMARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become familiar. He's deep into this as we go to -- \nTHE BEDROOM \nMARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in... \nMARIE opening an armoire... \nNothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling better by the moment as we go to -- \nTHE KITCHEN \nLike a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE picking up a frying pan. \nBOURNE This is my frying pan. (and then --) This is my spoon. (trying harder) I'm Jason Bourne and this is my kitchen. \nTHE MASTER BATHROOM \nMARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One toothbrush. \nAN OFFICE STUDY \nThere's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats. \nMARIE This is your office? (from the doorway) God, you live like a monk... \nBOURNE All this stuff -- it's all about boats. (looking up) I think I'm in the shipping business. \nMARIE See. It's starting to come back, yeah? (he sort of nods) You mind if I take a bath? \nBOURNE Go ahead. \nMARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a moment. Dealing with it. \nAnd then he sits down in a chair. \nBOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches his eye and -- \nINSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit. \nBOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No keyboard.

Allo... \nBOURNE Yes, I'm here... \nMANAGER/PHONE You call about Monsieur Kane? John Michael Kane? \nBOURNE Yes. Is he there? \nMANAGER/PHONE You are a friend of his? \nBOURNE Yes. \nMANAGER/PHONE I have some very bad news for you, sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago... \nSilence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he interprets the silence as grief... \nMANAGER/PHONE There was an accident. On the motorway. Apparently, he was killed instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this... \nBOURNE ...I understand... \nMANAGER/PHONE ...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened.

Cutthroat. \nA long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go. \nRAWLINS (finally) Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. (pitching now) I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel? \nBOURNE Yes. \nRAWLINS We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive. \n", "test2_true": "Another beat.

{"train": "\"THE BOURNE IDENTITY\" \nby \nTony Gilroy \nBased on the novel \nby \nRobert Ludlum \nPARIS DRAFT 9/20/00 \nDARKNESS. THE SOUND OF WIND AND SPRAY. \nMUSIC. TITLES. \nEXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT \nThe darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING TRAWLER. \nFISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water -- \nA HUMAN CORPSE. \nEXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT \nTHE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence of death -- \nSAILOR #1 -- Jesus, look at him -- \nSAILOR #2 -- what? -- you never saw a dead man before? -- \nSAILOR #3 -- look, look he was shot -- (nudging the body --) \nSAILOR #1 -- don't, don't do that -- \nSAILOR #2 -- he's dead, you think he cares? -- \nSAILOR #1 -- so have some respect -- it's a -- (stopping as --) \nTHE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as -- \nTHE MAN begins to breathe. \nINT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT \nA wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN down -- \nTHE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the door as -- \nGIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot soul. \nGIANCARLO -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here somewhere -- give me a minute -- get some blankets -- get some blankets on him -- (finding the kit --) -- here we go -- here it is -- \nGIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as -- \nTHE CAPTAIN Giancarlo. (Giancarlo turns back --) We pick him up? Okay, we have to pick him up. But that's as far as it goes. \nGIANCARLO He needs a doctor. \nCAPTAIN Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't care. We've wasted two hours on this shit already. You do what you can, but we're not going back. (pure steel now) You understand me? \nGIANCARLO Yes, sir. \nCAPTAIN (to the rest of them) Let's get back to work! \nGIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a pint of rum he's got stashed and -- \nINT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS \nTransformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages. \nTHE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done a million times before... \nThis is something he definitely knows how to do. \nAnd then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off into the darkness -- \nINT. TREADSTONE -- DAY \nA deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like a suite. \nSmall staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for communications. A couple for research. People are at their posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. This is a place under siege. \nZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading toward the boss's little office at the back -- \nTED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air. Work on the desk. Cot in the corner. \nCONKLIN (looking up) What? \nZORN Abbott wants to talk. \nCONKLIN Tell him we're busy. \nZORN I tried. \nINT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT \nABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering. \nABBOTT Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear. \nCONKLIN I don't know what we're talking about. \nABBOTT We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. (silence) Was this Treadstone? \nCONKLIN You're asking me a direct question? \nABBOTT Yes. \nCONKLIN I thought you were never going to do that. \nSilence. Pressure drop. \nABBOTT They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. (beat) What am I going to do about that? \nCONKLIN You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that. \nABBOTT And what if I couldn't do that? \nCONKLIN Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. (silence) Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? (Abbott staring) We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets. \nEXT. ZURICH -- DAY \nMorning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight. \nGEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO GUARDS unlocking the front door and -- \nTHE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and -- \nINT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY \nOrnate, formidable and tech at the same time. \nRECEPTIONIST Can I help you? \nTHE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place. \nTHE MAN I'm here about a numbered account. \nTHE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card. \nRECEPTIONIST (instant English) If you'll just enter your account number here I'll direct you to the appropriate officer. \nTHE MAN takes the pen, as we -- \nDEPOSIT GUARD I'm not sure. Must be three weeks. \nEXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS \nBOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight. \nBOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- turn -- change pace -- make it look natural -- \nBOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street -- \nBOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from behind him -- \nIt's just an ambulance. \nBOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- she's staring at him and -- \nBOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but -- \nTHE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling her radio and -- \nBOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing himself not to run -- glancing back and -- \nTHERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- he's got his radio out and -- \nFINALLY TO -- \nBOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into -- \nEXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY \nBig gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as he heads for the entrance. \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY \nThe passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem. \nBOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, and the incident in the park, then the bank... \nMARIE (O.S.) -- no, this is not my current address. It was my current address two days ago when I started standing in line outside -- \nA NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy. Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode. \nMARIE -- and so now I lost my apartment, I have no address, and I have no visa, and you keep telling me how much help you cannot give me! \nA CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights. \nCLERK Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down. \nMARIE All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers -- \nCLERK Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States -- \nMARIE You only know that because I told you! (she's incredulous) Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- (tearing through the papers now --) \nCLERK -- it's not the source of the information that's important here -- \nMARIE -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week... (she's found it --) ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this! \nCLERK -- Miss Kreutz, please -- \nMARIE -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off! \nCLERK So now you're asking for a student visa? \nThat shuts her up. Yes. Today she's a student. \nINT. CIA OFFICE COMPLEX -- NIGHT (BUT SAME TIME) \nMotion -- CONKLIN racing down a staircase -- ZORN chasing after -- \nCONKLIN -- and they're sure it's him? -- \nZORN -- he accessed the account -- \nTHE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM -- they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby and -- \nSECURITY CHIEF -- no -- no -- hold your fire! -- \nBOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the backpack and -- \nSOMEONE SCREAMING -- he's got a gun! -- he's got a gun! -- \nAnd he does -- BOURNE with the M-16! -- coming up with it -- coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches for an escape route and THE GUN -- it's like a magic wand of hysteria -- \nPEOPLE IN THE LOBBY -- SCREAMING -- diving away -- everyone dropping for cover and -- \nBOURNE -- bailing -- on the run -- sprinting down a hallway -- tossing away the M-16 as he sprints into the building -- \nTHE SECURITY CHIEF (frantic on his radio now --) -- red! -- red! -- red! -- code red! -- South side entrance! -- male -- five- ten, brown hair -- black jacket -- red bag -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE OFFICE HALLWAY -- DAY \nQuiet for a second -- offices on either side of a carpeted hallway -- BUREAUCRAT-TYPES doing their thing, when suddenly -- \nBUREAUCRAT #1 Excuse me?  Can I help you? (but backing up as he says it, because --) \nHere comes BOURNE -- coming fast -- and he definitely does not belong back here -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY/SECURITY GATE -- DAY \nPanic -- people fleeing the lobby -- MORE MARINES hustling in from outside and -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE FIRE STAIRWELL -- DAY \nDoor flies open -- BOURNE bombing in -- shit! -- it's a dead end -- no way out but up the stairs -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR -- DAY \nSECURITY CHIEF -- THREE MARINES -- sidearms drawn -- jogging past the INNER OFFICES -- running beside them, a frantic guy in a suit -- \nDEPUTY DCM -- what're you talking about? -- \nSECURITY CHIEF -- we're evacuating the building -- \nDEPUTY DCM -- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! -- \nSECURITY CHIEF -- call the code! -- I want everyone out! -- \nDEPUTY DCM -- you gotta give me more to go on -- \nSECURITY CHIEF -- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWAY -- DAY \nBOURNE climbing fast -- two -- three -- stairs at a time -- racing up as a SECURITY ALARM STARTS SCREAMING -- bleet -- bleet -- bleet -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH-FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY \nTHE ALARM ringing everywhere -- TRADE CONFERENCEES -- sixty confused and frightened people -- spilling out into the corridor -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR KITCHENETTE -- DAY \nA NEW DOOR flying open -- it's BOURNE -- ready for anything, but there's nothing -- he's in a butler's prep area off the main conference room -- momentum stalled for a moment -- nothing in here but tablecloths and silverware and coffee cups and -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWAY -- DAY \nTHREE MARINES -- armed and stoked -- staring up the stairs -- leapfrogging -- point-to-point assault procedure -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN STAIRS -- DAY \nCarpeted and grand -- SECURITY CHIEF with FIVE MARINES NOW -- charging up -- pushing past THE PEOPLE trying to come down and -- \nINT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY \nCompletely clogged now -- PANICKED TRADE PEOPLE all over -- EMBASSY TYPES -- trying to herd them toward the main stairs -- everyone talking at once -- THAT ALARM STILL BLARING and -- \nVOICE (O.S.) -- no! -- the other way! -- take the backstairs! -- the backstairs! -- he's on the other side -- there's a bomb! -- \nTHE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the open window. Now he's got to go all the way. \nTiming his next move and -- \nHe's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and -- \nBOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough to slow his fall and -- \nLetting go for the last fifteen feet and -- \nEXT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY \nA DOZEN MARINES -- pumped-up and listening to -- \nSECURITY -- we're gonna go room by room until we find him -- so let's get teamed up -- \nEXT. AN ALLEYWAY NEAR THE U.S. CONSULATE -- DAY \nMARIE storming away. Pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined and -- \nMARIE (German) Motherfucking sonsofbitches! (a new problem --) \nA LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich parking ticket on the windshield. \nMARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces on the ground and stomping on them and then -- \nMARIE (looking up --) What are you looking at? \nBOURNE standing across the car -- on the passenger side -- \nBOURNE I need a ride. \nMARIE What? \nBOURNE I need a ride out of here. \nMARIE Oh, Jesus... (backing away and --) \nBOURNE Please. I don't want to scare you. \nMARIE It's a little late for that. \nBOURNE I've got a situation here and -- \nMARIE Get the fuck away from my car. \nBOURNE I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris. \nMARIE Great. You know what? I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off. \nBOURNE You don't want the police any more than I do. \nBOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it. \nMARIE Jesus... \nBOURNE Get me out of here. Please. \nMARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and -- \nINT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT \nVIDEO PLAYBACK -- FULL FRAME -- fast forward -- a speeding blur of images from a surveillance camera outside the Zurich bank -- it's two days worth of footage -- they're scanning for Bourne's arrival and -- \nCONKLIN go -- keep going -- go...wait -- stop -- you went past it -- \nCOM TECH #1 working the console. Freezing the image. Punching it up. There it is -- BOURNE leaving the bank with the red bag. \nCONKLIN (staring at the monitor) It's him. My God, it's really him... \nZORN the phones across the room. COM TECH #2 at his console -- \nCOM TECH #2 -- we got a cross-ref ready to go here, sir, we're running hotel, airline, train, and medical variables, anything else you'd like? \nEXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT \nA MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars. A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch. \nINT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT \nWOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted. \nINT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT \nIt's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two at the bar and -- \nBOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk -- the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's been showing it to her -- \nAnd he's got her attention now. \nMARIE And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that? \nBOURNE No. \nMARIE When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see? \nBOURNE Nothing. It's just not there. \nMARIE Well, this is great. (she sits back) I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are. \nBOURNE I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could -- \nMARIE -- you could put it together -- \nBOURNE -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... (hesitating now) But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... (suddenly flat out --) I think something bad happened. \nMARIE What are you talking about? \nBOURNE I don't know. \nMARIE Sounds like you were in an accident or something. \nBOURNE I was shot twice in the back. \nMARIE Okay, so you're a victim. \nBOURNE There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports? \nMARIE Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns. \nBOURNE I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it. I knew how to do it. \nMARIE People do amazing things when they're scared. \nBOURNE Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door -- \nMARIE You're paranoid. You were shot. It's natural. \nShe's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now. \nBOURNE I can tell you the license plate numbers of all three cars out front. I can tell you that the waitress is left-handed and the guy at the counter weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself. I know that the best, first place to look for a gun is the cab of that grey truck outside. I know that at this altitude I can run flat out for half a mile before I lose my edge. I knew that you were my first, best option out of Zurich? How do I know all that? How can I know all that and not know who I am? How is that possible? \nLong dead pause. \nMARIE God, you're not kidding, are you? \nINT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- DAY \nBOURNE'S FACE -- a video image frozen on A COMPUTER SCREEN -- it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at the camera in the consulate passport office and -- \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nHALF A DOZEN COMPUTER MONITORS -- and lots of shots of Bourne -- twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid perspectives of Bourne and his mad scramble through the consulate -- \nCONKLIN and RESEARCH TECH #1 poring over these surveillance tapes downloaded from Zurich -- \nCONKLIN And that's the best angle of the courtyard? \nMARIE I needed a break. \nBOURNE Where are we? \nMARIE We're about an hour away. \nBOURNE I can't believe I slept. \nMARIE You were tired. Here... (bread and soda --) For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. (he takes it) So what do you dream about? \nBOURNE I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. (he takes a hit from her smoke and coughs --) I don't think I smoke. \nAnother silence. She's watching him. \nMARIE You ever think maybe you have a family? \nBOURNE I thought about it. I don't know. \nShe looks away. Was she hoping for another answer? \nMARIE I guess it's like Christmas every day for you, huh? \nINT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's smiling -- really alive and fresh and -- \nCONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture -- \nABBOTT Who is she? \nZORN Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- six. Born outside Munich. Father was a welder. He died in '91. We don't have the mother. There might be a step-sister, we're trying to track that down. (apologetic) It's tough. She's a wanderer. She pops up on the grid here and there but... I mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in Europe was '94. No taxes. No steady employer. She's got three arrests. Two shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one in Germany. And she actually did three months in an Italian detention center for credit card fraud. \nABBOTT No political affiliations? \nCONKLIN She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one. \nABBOTT I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility. \nCONKLIN We're exploring every possibility. (tighter by the moment) We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you? \nABBOTT Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is. \nCONKLIN No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is. \nABBOTT Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs. \nCONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming. \nCONKLIN We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here? (real steam) I'd rethink that. \nABBOTT I want a second opinion. \nCONKLIN This is an operations desk. \nABBOTT I'm not asking. \nEXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nTHE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town. \nINT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY \nMARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass -- \nBOURNE Slow down. No, don't stop. Just... \nMARIE (looking over) That's it? Is that it? \nAN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold. \nBOURNE Four-fifty. That's the address... \nMARIE Looks familiar? \nBOURNE Great. We could use a shower. (they look like shit --) It was a long drive. \nTHE CONCIERGE steps aside and -- \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY \nBOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key now. \nTurning it. And the door opens... \nNothing... \nNo bombs. No wife and kids. No one. \nINT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY \nA huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history. \nWE'RE MOVING NOW \nTHE LIVING ROOM \nBOURNE and MARIE exploring. \nMARIE It's big. \nBOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place. \nMARIE This is like a real apartment. (she likes it) This is really yours? \nBOURNE I guess so. \nMARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become familiar. He's deep into this as we go to -- \nTHE BEDROOM \nMARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in... \nMARIE opening an armoire... \nNothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling better by the moment as we go to -- \nTHE KITCHEN \nLike a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE picking up a frying pan. \nBOURNE This is my frying pan. (and then --) This is my spoon. (trying harder) I'm Jason Bourne and this is my kitchen. \nTHE MASTER BATHROOM \nMARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One toothbrush. \nAN OFFICE STUDY \nThere's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats. \nMARIE This is your office? (from the doorway) God, you live like a monk... \nBOURNE All this stuff -- it's all about boats. (looking up) I think I'm in the shipping business. \nMARIE See. It's starting to come back, yeah? (he sort of nods) You mind if I take a bath? \nBOURNE Go ahead. \nMARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a moment. Dealing with it. \nAnd then he sits down in a chair. \nBOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches his eye and -- \nINSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit. \nBOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No keyboard. Now he's really confused and -- \nBOURNE Right. Yes. Of course. \nMANAGER/PHONE It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man. \nBOURNE Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number? \nMANAGER/PHONE I think not... (quick French to someone in the office there --) No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. He was here very briefly. \nBOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane is dead. And he had the passport. \nSuddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This is bad. Danger. \nTHE MASTER BATHROOM \nMARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water -- \nMARIE (calling out to him --) She wasn't kidding about the water. It's freezing. \nTHE OFFICE \nBOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood. \nBOURNE Hang on. I'll check the kitchen... (moving out of the office --) Maybe it takes a while to get all the way upstairs. \nTHE KITCHEN \nBOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On the move again, now -- \nBOURNE Yeah, it's cold in here, too... (calling to her as he goes --) Let's give it another minute. \nBOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- every breeze -- everything carries information. \nStanding still. Taking it all in. \nReal quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple furniture. \nMARIE (suddenly --) -- omigod! -- (she's behind him --) -- what're you? -- no -- no -- \nMARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing there with the knife in his hand and -- \nBOURNE -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not like that -- \nMARIE -- please -- Jason -- omigod -- \nBOURNE -- quiet -- quiet -- \nMARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment -- \nBOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down! \nMARIE hesitating and -- \nBOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb from a lamp beside him and -- \nMARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off -- \nBOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- putting his foot on a chair in front of him and -- \nMARIE ...what are you doing?... \nBOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- get under the window -- go! -- \nMARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? -- \nBOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- over her head -- into that frosted window and -- \nAs she ducks down -- \nAs it SHATTERS -- \nEVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE \nPHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and -- \nBOURNE -- let me do this, okay? -- \nMARIE -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture -- (just apoplectic --) -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod -- \nNow there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and -- \nTHE CONCIERGE (muffled but urgent) Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's going on? Is everything all right in there? (-- and she keeps banging and --) \nMARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just impossible and -- \nSuddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and -- \nBOURNE bracing himself but -- \nCASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely nowhere -- except -- \nTHE WINDOW \nCASTEL hurling himself into the glass and -- \nEXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY \nWINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- sixty feet above the street -- \nFalling and falling and... \nIMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and -- \nINT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY \nTHE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and -- \nTHE CONCIERGE (still outside the door--) --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- you give me no choice -- I'm calling them right away! -- \nBOURNE -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- where are your shoes? -- Marie -- \nMARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just happened -- \nMARIE He's dead isn't he? \nBOURNE Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this -- \nMARIE He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that? \nBOURNE -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here -- \nMARIE He came to kill us. \nBOURNE -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- \nMARIE You knew he was coming. \nBOURNE No. \nMARIE I trusted you. \nBOURNE You're wrong. I didn't know. \nMARIE I don't trust anybody and I trusted you! \nBOURNE I didn't know this would happen. \nMARIE He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us! \nBOURNE And where is he now? (that gets her quiet) You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous. \nMARIE (totally overwhelmed) Oh, Jesus... \nBOURNE You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- (starting to back away --) But I can't stay here. I can't. \nMARIE But the police -- \nBOURNE -- there's no time -- \nA secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from -- \nMRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence. \nBOURNE/TAPE \"Kane. John Michael Kane.\" \nOPERATOR/TAPE \"One moment, sir.\" \nMRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough. \nMRS. DOYLE He's not lying. He's very highly stressed, but he's not lying. He's confused. He's aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos. This conversation, the video from the consulate -- the body language, vocal pattern -- it's my sense he's really lost here. (beat) I think he snapped. \nCONKLIN Is that a medical term? \nShe turns. Battle lines drawn. \nMRS. DOYLE You want clinical terminology? It's called, \"conversation hysteria.\" (to Abbott now --) I don't know exactly how you train these people. I'm not sure I want to know. I'll take a guess there's some extremely rigorous behavior modification going on here. \nSilence. The idea dangling for a moment. \nABBOTT Let's assume that's true. \nMRS. DOYLE You can only wind people so tight. Even machines break down. \nCONKLIN This unit has an unblemished record of success. \nMRS. DOYLE Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting. \nEXT. BELLVILLE CAR PARK -- DUSK \nBOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car. \nINT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY \nABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but they can't. Too many people passing by -- \nCONKLIN That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. (point blank) I have work to do. \nABBOTT What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned? \nCONKLIN Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn? \nEXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT \nFunky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG. \nINT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nHAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking wet. \nA new hair color. \nA MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and wonder. \nAnd then she smells something. Smoke... \nINT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nIt's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And the smoke is coming from... \nHIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just before it burns his fingers and -- \nBOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's holding out her passport -- \nHe looks at her. Big moment. \nBOURNE No. (he won't do it) You know who you are. You know what that's worth? That's everything. (pause) I can't live like this. I can't do anything until I know who I am. Believe me, you don't want what I have. \nHe looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His shoulder. \nBOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. Doesn't know how to react. \nMARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you know the rest... \nOPERATOR RECORDING (OVER) The number you have dialed has been disconnected. If you think you've reached this message in error-- \nTIME CUT -- one minute later -- last call -- \nRECORDED VOICE (OVER) \"You've reached the office of Simon Rawlins at Alliance Security Maritime Division. Paris office hours are from nine a.m. to six p.m. If this is an emergency, please call our twenty-four hour help line at...\" \nBOURNE hangs up. Scribbles down the number. Backing away and -- \nINT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- NIGHT \nCONKLIN and the RESEARCH TECHS jamming on the console -- \nCONKLIN -- let's check that Interpol window again -- \nRESEARCH TECH #1 -- I'm on it -- \nCONKLIN -- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here -- \nRESEARCH TECH #2 Sir. (Conklin turns --) I've got a code here from NSA -- they're not gonna give us Keyhole satellite clearance unless we have sign-off from upstairs. \nCONKLIN turns and -- \nABBOTT No. (sitting there tensely) We can't risk it. \nCONKLIN Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. (please) This is it. He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him. \nABBOTT This doesn't go upstairs. \nCONKLIN left hanging. ABBOTT clear on this one. \nEXT. EST. SHOT -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY \nMonolithic tech. Reflection city. \nINT. ELEVATOR -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY \nBOURNE dressed for success. Suit. Cleaned up good. Catching his reflection in the elevator's mirrored ceiling. Nerves on edge. \nINT. OFFICE LOBBY -- DAY \nALLIANCE SECURITY MARITIME DIVISION. Glossy posters of yachts, tankers and luxury sailboats.

PETER RAWLINS' OFFICE -- DAY \nMeet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfed -- and quite shocked to see... \nRAWLINS Mr. Kane... (hastily tidying up) Come right in... please... have a seat. \nBOURNE Thanks. \nBOURNE just trying to feel his way through this... \nRAWLINS Well... (really thrown) I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised. \nBOURNE Really. \nRAWLINS We thought you were gone for good. \nBOURNE Did you? \nRAWLINS Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat. \nA long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go. \nRAWLINS (finally) Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. (pitching now) I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel? \nBOURNE Yes. \nRAWLINS We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive. \nEverybody following -- all of them confused -- and into -- \nFRONT DESK AREA \nBOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out -- \nBOURNE Is this it? -- (the book) -- this is it, right? -- \nMORGUE BOSS -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that -- \nBOURNE -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page -- (then quick to Marie) -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? -- \nMARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's doing -- \nMORGUE BOSS -- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? -- \nBOURNE -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? -- \nMORGUE BOSS -- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going -- \nBOURNE -- here we go -- I found it -- \nBut he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out of the book -- \nMORGUE BOSS -- what are you? -- what are you doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped the book! -- you stupid fucki-- (no chance to finish this, because --) \nBOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor hit him. And fast. \nAnd that shuts up the room. \nTHE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss -- \nBOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door -- \nEXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT \nMoments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning in -- he's close -- he's hardening -- \nMARIE What are you doing? -- (he's scaring her) -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me... \nBOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security brochures -- scanning them as he walks -- \nMARIE -- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? -- \nBOURNE Nykwana Wombosi. (he stops, holding up the brochure --) \nMARIE What is that? \nBOURNE It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht. He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package. (handing her the brochure --) He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. (the ripped-out page --) \nMARIE What does that mean? (but he's walking again --) Jason, what does that mean? (she's trying to catch up, but he's walking really fast --) Jason, please... who is he? \nBOURNE I don't know. (he's not turning back again --) \nMARIE So what are we doing? \nBOURNE Go back to the hotel. \nMARIE just stops. Reeling. \nBOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and -- \nINT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT? \nABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see -- \nZORN They found him. They found Bourne. \nABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN. \nABBOTT Where? \nZORN You better come in. \nCONKLIN You don't have the stones for this. You people come down here and wink and whisper and we send these guys out and get it done. And you're clear. And the guys upstairs get what they want. And the whole bunch of you are so stuffed on deniability it's coming out of your ears. (gauntlet) Well, you know what? You're here now. What do you want to do? \nABBOTT just shaking his head no. \nAnd CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's the button -- and he's pressing it and -- \nEXT. NEUILLY ROOFTOPS -- NIGHT \nTHE PROFESSOR in position -- roof of the house next door -- hum -- hum -- hum -- \nIt's the E-PHONE PAGER -- he's just been activated and -- \nINT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nBOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to the gallows -- \nTHE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and -- \nWOMBOSI on the throne. \nWOMBOSI Come in. (an imperial gesture) Please... \nBOURNE steps up to the plate. \nWOMBOSI Did you bring investment advice for me tonight? It was tax shelters, wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps. \nBOURNE MPG Capital. \nWOMBOSI I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. (beat) How does it feel to be dead? \nBOURNE It's a lot more stressful than I thought. \nKIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying to scoot them out but -- \nWOMBOSI -- no -- no, let them in! -- let them in. (to the kids) Come in -- on y va -- come in... (to Bourne) I think everyone wants to see the dead man. \nBOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring -- \nWOMBOSI What do you do? (on his feet now --) You get an appointment with me? You make sure it's on the boat? You come visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit investment package. You drink my water -- eat my bread -- play with my children -- and what? -- two nights later you come back and you put this death -- (slamming something down onto the throne --) -- you put this in my engine room! \nThere is A BOMB on the throne now. \nWOMBOSI So this is a different kind of meeting. (steam building) Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? One dead man to another. \nBOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the shirt -- \nBOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw -- \nWOMBOSI You see this? (calling to Deauvage --) I told you my shot was better! \nDEAUVAGE He went in the water -- how did he live? \nWOMBOSI No, no no... (and he means this --) This is a strong killer. This is a crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah... (circling) To make a killer that looks like you? This young? This face? (he means this) It's bloody fucking amazing. \nBOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him -- \nBOURNE Who do you think sent me? \nWOMBOSI I know who sent you. I don't know why. (this could get physical at any moment now --) I learned many, many things from the CIA. Many things. I learned the way they think. (beat) Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not? \nBOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's... \nWOMBOSI You didn't set the bomb. Why? \nBOURNE not sure -- about any of it -- \nWOMBOSI Was this a game or a fuck up? \nBOURNE I don't know. \nWOMBOSI Get the kids out! \nHe doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- they're gone. \nMARIE Yes. That's who I want to be. \nBOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they lay in bed. Just laying there. \nINT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT \nTHE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere.

CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT -- DAY \nDarkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in -- \nCASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs. \nQUICK TIME CUTS \nCASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of books. Taking the top book off. Opening it. \nINSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his password and -- \nCASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner. Pulling away the top pile and -- \nA METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening it. An empty tray on top and -- \nCASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets. All of this goes into the empty tray and -- \nCASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and -- \nTHE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the Zurich safe-deposit box. \nFirst of all... \nMONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo. And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his photo.

Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in the flesh. \nMeet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children -- two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy. \nTHE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE. Into it. Too into it. \nTWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the freezer lockers... \nMORGUE BOSS (French) Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121... \nAnd he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible.

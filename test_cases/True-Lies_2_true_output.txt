262   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A REFUELING TRUCK - NIGHT 
HARRY cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the nozzle of the hose.  He opens the flow and-- A stream of JET- FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach. 
Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area, setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists. 
263   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik a LAW rocket.  Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to fire. 
264   EXT. DOCK - NIGHT 
Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as-- MALIK fires.  The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry leaps toward the dark water as-- KABOOOM!  Behind him the gas truck EXPLODES IN A HUGE FIREBALL. 
265   EXT. UNDERWATER - OFF THE DOCK - NIGHT 
ANGLE LOOKING UP, UNDERWATER, AS HARRY HITS THE WATER AND dives down.  An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the surface above him.  Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the inferno above him so he can surface. 
266   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON HELEN, watching the burning wreckage of the gas truck. 
HELEN Oh my God.  Harry. 
A PISTOL ENTERS FRAME.  Its muzzle taps the back of her head. She gasps and turns to see-- JUNO, holding the weapon expertly. 
JUNO My condolences to the window.                          * 
Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet.  Helen SLAPS JUNO      * HARD.  Juno has a slash across her cheek.  Blood trickles down.  * She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the        * wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side.  Her   * face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face,   * preparing to kill her .  .  .                                    * 
And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her.                  * 
MALIK                                        * Not now.  We may need a hostage.                       * 
Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the     * limo nearby.                                                     * 
JUNO Let's go, Suzy Homemaker. 
267   EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
Harry is still swimming.  He reaches the edge of the fire and surfaces, gasping for breath.  Treading water he scans the dock. 
268   EXT. WATER OF THE DOCK - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT 
Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun point toward a LIMO. 
269   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
TRACKING WITH JUNO, approaching the car.  Malik passes, jumping  * into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men.  The fourth    * bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed.  The      * copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as   * it arcs away. 
AKBAR, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and      * Juno gets into the limo with Helen.  Akbar scrunches into the front seat and starts the car. 
270   EXT. RAMP TO HIGHWAY - PREDAWN 
There is just enough light to see some geography.  The island is very tiny.  Running right over it and to the horizon in both directions is the OVERSEAS HIGHWAY.  The terrorists' trucks rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says MIAMI - 110.  The limo is the last member of the convoy.  The Aerospatiale passes overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots. 
271   EXT. DOCK/ WAREHOUSE - DAWN 
It looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage, black smoke, bodies.  Not a living soul around.  The smoke swirls as two big BELL 206 HELICOPTERS settle on the middle of the dock.  GIB jumps out of the nearest with an AR-15, scanning the wreckage.  Several of his men, and a couple of DEA agents, spread out.  Gib breaks into a grin as he sees-- 
HARRY, materializing out of the swirling smoke.  Dripping wet, clothes ripped and bloody.  But okay. 
GIB I thought this look like your work. 
HARRY Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air. 
GIB You're welcome. 
272   INT. BELL 206 - DAY 
Gib and Harry are working out of brief-case mobile com-units. Several Omega agents with headsets are reading maps, giving commands, coordinating the evacuation, mobilizing their own forces.  The energy is controlled but very high, everybody talking at once.  This is the day they all have trained for. It is impressive to watch. 
GIB --you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right-- 
HARRY (overlapping) ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately-- 
Gib whips around to Harry, lowering his headset mike. 
GIB I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica. 
HARRY (checking his watch) Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in. 
273   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY 
TRAFFIC on the two causeways is almost non-existent this early in the morning.  The three rental trucks, followed by the limo about a mile back, are almost the only vehicles. 
274   INT. LIMO - DAY 
Juno has a 9mm pistol aimed at Helen.  She opens the sunroof, letting in the morning air and light.  Then pours herself a Scotch from the bar. 
JUNO Like one? 
HELEN (eyes like steel) Fuck you.

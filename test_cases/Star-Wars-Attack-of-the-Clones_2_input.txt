ANAKIN (continuing; to pilot) Put the ship down! Down! 
OBI-WAN No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku. 
ANAKIN No we're not!! Land this ship! 
OBI-WAN Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do. 
Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU. 
ANAKIN I don't care!.. Go back. 
OBI-WAN Anakin! She's all right! Look. 
ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS. 
OBI-WAN (continuing) Follow that speeder! 
On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows. 
Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower. 
INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open. 
DROID CAPTAIN Your Excellency! 
COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons. 
COUNT DOOKU That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me. 
The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement. 
OBI-WAN (to Anakin) We move in together - you slowly on the... 
ANAKIN I'm taking him now! 
OBI-WAN Anakin, no! 
ANAKIN You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku. 
ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN 
COUNT DOOKU Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down. 
OBI-WAN I don't think so. 
OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles. 
COUNT DOOKU Ah, but if I must. 
COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other. 
COUNT DOOKU (continuing) I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power. 
OBI-WAN You will have to prove it. 
OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style. 
COUNT DOOKU Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. 
COUNT DOOKU parried another cut. 
COUNT DOOKU (continuing) Surely you can do better...? (parries) No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? (cuts) Which is it? 
COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath. 
COUNT DOOKU (continuing) come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. 
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat. 
COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

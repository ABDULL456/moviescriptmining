TYLER It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but... 
Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial... 
JACK No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us... 
TYLER You never talked to me in front of anyone else. 
JACK Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat? 
TYLER What about them?  They're lunatics. 
JACK You took me to the house. 
TYLER The house is rented in your name. 
JACK You have jobs. 
TYLER Night jobs -- while you were sleeping. 
JACK What about Marla? 
TYLER What about Marla? 
JACK She's... you... you're fucking her. 
TYLER Um, well... technically, no. 
Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD. 
JACK (V.O.) It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN 
Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at the clock -- 4:35am. 
INT. HALLWAY 
The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room, carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL... 
INT. STAIRWELL 
Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him... 
INT. LOBBY 
Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him. 
DESK CLERK Sir... sir?  Are you checking out? 
JACK Yes. 
The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER. 
DESK CLERK Please initial this list of phone calls. 
JACK Bill me! 
Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS. 
JACK Wait...when were these made? 
DESK CLERK It says right there, sir... between two and three-thirty this morning. 
Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk. 
JACK I need a copy of this. 
INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY 
Jack stares out the window, his face set hard. 
JACK (V.O.) Had I been going to bed earlier every night?  Have I been sleeping later? Has Tyler been in charge longer and longer? 
EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY 
A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE. 
JACK Wait here. 
INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES, GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS. 
He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID." 
INT. TYLER'S ROOM 
Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS... 
JACK (V.O.) Deja vu, all over again... 
Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear. 
VOICE (from phone) Eighteen-eighty-eight. 
Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST." 
JACK Who is this? 
VOICE Maintenance. 
JACK Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible... 
VOICE Very good, Sir. 
JACK Excuse me? 
VOICE Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid. 
JACK Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed... 
VOICE You told me you'd say that. 
JACK Abort the plan.

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
A tribe of HOMELESS TEENAGERS sits on the sidewalk in front of SOUVENIR SHOPS.  They beg money off pedestrians. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... I've never been anywhere else. I don't think mom wants to let me go.  Every time I try to talk about it she says it'll cost too much or she changes the subject." 
EXT.  CHURCH, SOUP KITCHEN -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
A long line of HOMELESS PERSONS trails out the door.  Welles stands out front, showing the PICTURE to a VOLUNTEER with a broom, and a PRIEST... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "Dear diary.  Something terrible happened today when dad and I were alone.  I can't tell anyone.  I feel sick.  What did I ever do to make this happen to me?" 
The volunteer and priest can't help.  Welles is weary, futility beginning to wear on him, walks to his car... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "Dear diary.  My stomach hurts all the time.  I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.  I want to get out of my head and stop hearing myself think." 
INT.  WELLES' RENTAL CAR -- IN MOTION -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles smokes, driving, blankly watching the road ahead... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "Dear diary.  Grandma fell and broke her leg last week.  We drove down to visit her in the hospital. Hospitals smell like dead people." 
EXT.  FREEWAY -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS 
FOLLOW Welles' car speeding along... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "Dear diary.  It's happening all the time now.  There s nothing I can do. I'm all alone.  Everything is bad. I used to have lots of dreams and I'd remember them when I woke up, but that doesn't happen anymore." 
PULL BACK: still FOLLOWING WELLES' CAR, over the FREEWAY... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "Dear diary.  If I can get to California, I'll be okay.  I've got money saved.  I can work as a waitress till I get something better.  Billy says he and his family went to California once on vacation.  He says it never rains. They stayed near the beach and he went swimming in the ocean..." 
CONTINUE TO PULL BACK -- till Welles' car is very, very far below -- REVEALING the staggering size of the City of Los Angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the DIARY... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... I hope I can be an actress.  I hope I can be happy.  I'll probably have to go to acting school.  I wish I knew someone who lived there. I'll miss my friends, but at least I'll be far away where no one can ever find me." 
Welles has come to the end of the writing in the DIARY.  The next PHOTOCOPIED PAGE shows an image of the TORN RAGGED EDGE of the diary's missing page. 
EXT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY 
Welles enters this "ADULT VIDEO" storefront. 
INT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY 
The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door.  He watches Welles pass. 
Welles looks around, uncomfortable.  A few of the other CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles.  Display shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink- wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES.  Welles pretends to browse. 
Handmade signs above each section identify content: "ANAL," "BIG TITS," "CUMSHOTS," "BONDAGE and FETISH," etc... 
Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles. Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he's considering it.  He glances at other customers. 
Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography.  One guy has his arms full of about ten videos. 
Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter.  The clerk watches him the whole time. 
WELLES Is this pretty much it? 
The clerk just stares at Welles. 
WELLES Just... just videos? 
PIERCED CLERK What are you looking for? 
Welles considers, decides to leave, exiting... 
WELLES Nothing. 
PIERCED CLERK Fuck-head. 
INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY 
Welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  This place is larger than the last.  TWO CLERKS are behind the counter. One clerk's pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno- novel.  Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth. 
Welles browses.  There's a huge video bargain bin.  Walls are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. 
CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper. 
There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back.  A MAN looks around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely, slipping behind one curtain. 
Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of dildos, looks towards the front... 
Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and highlights a section in the book he's reading. 
Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five. 
Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet.  Max starts ringing everything up. 
MAX Big date tonight? 
WELLES (embarrassed) Yeah... guess so. 
MAX Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina? 
WELLES Pardon me? 
MAX My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling. 
WELLES Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

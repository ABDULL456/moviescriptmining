LOU She's not a hooker. She's a girl who did what she had to do to make a few bucks. (tries new tactic) Listen, she's probably awesome in bed. 
JACOB She probably has a hairy vagina. 
LOU Exactly! Jacob looks confused. 
JACOB I'm not having this conversation. It's pointless. I don't have a condom. 
LOU Perfect! Me neither! No one here uses condoms. It's like heaven. Only with a lot more coke. Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch. 
LOU (CONT'D) How do I look? 
JACOB Like a fucking madman? He slaps Jacob's arms. 
LOU Rock and roll. Lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls. 
LOU (CONT'D) Who's ready to get laid by an awesome penis?! 
INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - LATE NIGHT 
Adam and Jennie are sitting on the floor by the fireplace, playing MONOPOLY. 
ADAM Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That's gonna cost you. 
JENNIE How much? 
ADAM I'll tell ya what... Adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of looking over his shoulder, as if someone might see. 
ADAM (CONT'D) I'm not supposed to do this. But I'm gonna upgrade you to Marvin Gardens. It's a suite. Plus, there's an excellent buffet and a view of the pool. Jennie laughs, despite herself. She looks around, as if someone might see her. Adam notices. 
ADAM (CONT'D) No one's gonna see you hanging out with the creepy spaz. Don't worry. 
JENNIE I'm sorry I called you those names. 
ADAM Hey, it's cool. I was being creepy and spazzy. 
JENNIE You're still not gonna tell me how you know me? 
ADAM I'm from the future. 
JENNIE Fine, let's just drop it. I'm glad you're feeling better. Blaine had no right to hit you. 
(SMILES) I bet he's going out of his mind right now. 
ADAM What are you doing with a douche like him anyway? You're so much better than that. 
JENNIE Yeah, well guys like you come to visit. Guys like him live here. 
ADAM So if I lived here, I'd have a shot? For a moment, Jennie is thrown off. She's about to say something, but checks herself. Instead she nervously stands. 
JENNIE I'm gonna get going. Adam stands up with her. 
JENNIE (CONT'D) Thanks for being a good guy. I don't remember the last time I had this much fun playing such a stupid game. She gives Adam a sweet KISS ON THE CHEEK. 
JENNIE (CONT'D) If you run into Blaine, you can tell him I blew you. But that's all. We didn't do anything else. 
ADAM 
(SURPRISED) We didn't do anything! 
JENNIE 
(SMILES) Shh. It's our little secret. Jennie exits, leaving Adam confused.

{"train": "A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS recoils with a startled, muffled cry. \nEXT.  CHURCH \nThe cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow! \nEXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH \nLOUIS Church! God, you scared the life out of me! \nCHURCH Waow! \nLOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND comes again and he looks toward: \nEXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV \nAnother Orinco tanker drones by, fast. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH \nLOUIS (to the cat) I know one thing that will keep you home, good buddy. \nHe starts toward the house. \nBLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD SPEAK. \nINT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY \nWritten on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!! \nTHE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape. \nWe look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL, climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a Gerrypak. \nEXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD \nThey are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them catch up. \nJUD Take a look behind you. \nThey turn around, and their faces express their wonder. \nLOUIS My God! \nRACHEL It's beautiful! \nEXT.  THE VIEW \nIt is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9 just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue. \nEXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS \nJUD You folks ready to go on? \nLOUIS Sure. \nELLIE But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? \nJUD You'll see soon enough, hon. \nThey go into the woods, still following the path. \nEXT.  FOREST  DAY \nThese are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his mark here. \nTHE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked. \nJUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps are. \nLOUIS Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies? \nJUD Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. \nELLIE (giggling) Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. \nJUD (smiles) Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc? \nLOUIS Not yet...how much further is it? \nJUD Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. \nHe starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him. LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then they press on. \nEXT.  THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY \nEXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH \nJUD (stopping) This is the place, honey. \nELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch but can't. She whips around to look at her mother. \nELLIE What's it say, mommy? \nA strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like this. Not a bit. \nRACHEL It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's misspelled, but...that's what it says. \nShe runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever. \nRACHEL Ellen--! \nEXT.  ELLIE \nShe's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning. \nEXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD \nRACHEL (a bit lame) Be careful. \nEXT.  ELLIE \nShe goes racing into the Pet Sematary. \nEXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD \nJUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail. \nJUD I told you it was a bad road, Louis--it's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something good come of it. This place. \nELLIE (excited voice) Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it! \nEXT.  ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY \nJUD That's where I buried my dog Spot when he died of old age in 19 and 14. Dug it good and deep. By the time I finished, I had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. Soil's stony up here. \nELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too. \nJUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is still looking at ELLEN. \nJUD Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is? \nELLIE Well...I guess not. \nJUD It's a place where the dead speak, Missy. \nHe sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her hair reassuringly. \nJUD No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis? \nLOUIS I think it is so, Ellie. \nELLIE What if you can't read what's written on there anymore? \nJUD Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it? \nELLIE Yes-- \nLOUIS And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot. \nELLIE To remember. \nJUD (smiles) Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary place, Ellie. It's a place of rest and speaking. Can you remember that? \nELLIE (a little awed) Yes, sir. \nThey start to walk slowly back toward the arch. \nEXT.  RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH \nIt's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing. \nRACHEL (calls) Louis, can we go? I'm tired! \nEXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD \nELLIE Mommy! This is a place where dead animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so! \nEXT.  RACHEL AND ELLIE \nBut RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this. \nRACHEL (soft) Did he. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD \nLOUIS My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed. \nJUD Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy. \nLOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly. \nEXT.  THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE \nThe men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE. \nLOUIS (voice) Did we take too long? \nRACHEL (curt) Well, if supper's burned, I'm not the one going out for pizza. \nThey move away. \nEXT.  THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH \nThe face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN  NIGHT \nThere are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on them. Guess dinner was burned. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and tweezers. He's wearing glasses. \nELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile. \nLOUIS (not looking around) Hi, babe. \nELLIE Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of the road, isn't it? \nLOUIS looks around at her, surprised. \nELLIE That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much. \nLOUIS Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey... \nINT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR \nRACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid. \nELLIE (voice) No he won't! Not in the end! He won't be all right in the end no matter how you fix 'im! \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE \nEllis has started to cry. \nELLIE In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he? \nLOUIS Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time. \nELLIE It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! \nPoor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort. \nLOUIS If it was up to me I'd let Church live to be a hundred...but I don't make up the rules. \nELLIE (muffled) Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not mine! Not-- \nShe breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and forth. \nINT.  THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL \nShe is crying silently. \nINT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nShe is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her mouth. \nINT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL \nLOUIS (reluctantly) Church will be fine. I promise. \nELLIE Yayyyy! \nShe runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too. \nRACHEL Thank you, Louis. \nLOUIS Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her. \nHe gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and a little frightened. \nINT.  GAGE \nGAGE (conversationally) Here, Durch! \nHe picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier. \nINT.  THE CAT-CARRIER \nCHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the mesh, driving him back, surprised. \nEXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING \nThe school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it across the lawn, with her lunch-box. \nEXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY \nRACHEL Have a great day! \nLOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it. \nGAGE Bye-bye! \nEXT.  THE BUS \nELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls away. \nEXT.  THE CREED DRIVEWAY  MORNING \nThe station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens the wagon's doorgate. \nA small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS. A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She looks at the cat-carrier. \nMISSY Gonna get his-- \nLOUIS --nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary. \nMISSY Don't mention it. \nShe opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an attack of indigestion. \nLOUIS (sees this) How's that belly-ache of yours? \nMISSY (gets the sheets) No better and no worse. \nLOUIS You ought to see a doctor about it. \nMISSY It'll pass. They always do. \nShe starts toward the house with the sheets. \nEXT.  THE SIDE YARD  MORNING \nRACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him. \nRACHEL (anxious) Still friends, doc? \nLOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then he smiles and hugs her. They kiss. \nRACHEL Thank God. I was a little worried there. Have a great first day at school, doc. No broken bones. \nLOUIS (smiles) Not so much as a sprain. \nEXT.  VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS  MORNING \nPASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the bearers. \nPASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red jogging shorts. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on break to either side. The infirmary doors open. \nEXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS \nShe's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty. \nCHARLTON Holy Jesus. (turns) Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed, we've got a mess here! Stat! \nThe bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform. \nINT.  THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA \nTHE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after Sirhan shot Bobby. \nAs the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified. \nLOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and pulsing brain tissue beneath. \nThere's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the blanket is having hysterics. \nGIRL Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic! \nLOUIS (to CHARLTON) Get her out. Get them all out. \nCHARLTON puts her arms around the girl. \nGIRL (struggling) No! No! He can't die! He can't die! \nTHE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes. \nCHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out the door. \nLOUIS Steve, get the ambulance over here right now. He's got to go to EMMC. \nSTEVE The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco downtown, getting-- \nLOUIS --a new muffler, oh shit-- \nPASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of his mouth. He begins to seizure. \nOne of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall. \nCHARLTON rushes over. \nPASCOW Come on, doc--don't make me tell you twice. \nINT.  LOUIS \nHe glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed. He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms. \nINT.  PASCOW \nHe turns and leaves the doorway. \nINT.  LOUIS \nHe reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at: \nINT.  THE BED, LOUIS'S POV \nRACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad dream. \nINT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS \nLOUIS (relieved) Oh. Thank God. \nPASCOW (Voice) Hurry up, doc. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN \nLOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it. \nPASCOW (low) Come on, doc... \nLOUIS goes into: \nINT.  THE SHED/GARAGE \nThe station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands, perplexed. \nPASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S mutilated face. \nPASCOW Let's go, doc. \nLOUIS (moans) I don't like this dream. \nPASCOW Who said you were dreaming? \nHe begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS follows him. \nEXT.  THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG  NIGHT \nWe can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW and, behind him, LOUIS. \nEXT.  THE PET SEMATARY ARCH \nCAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch. \nEXT.  LOUIS, CLOSE \nHe looks around, obviously afraid. \nEXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV \nWe can see why. By starlight this is one scary place. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to terror. \nEXT.  THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV \nThe face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified. \nEXT.  PASCOW, CLOSE \nHe really is a dreadful mangled mess. \nPASCOW This is the place where the dead speak. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe closes his eyes. \nLOUIS I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- \nEXT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW \nPASCOW The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know. \nHe points at: \nEXT.  THE DEADFALL \nThat grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know. \nAfter a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before. There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree like a toothpick. \nEXT.  PASCOW AND LOUIS \nLOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly shut. \nLOUIS Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in-- \nPASCOW The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. \nCAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS. \nLOUIS Leave me alone! \nPASCOW Remember. \nCAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS. \nRADIO (voice) --another beautiful day in Maine! This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that the git-go ain't gonna be that bad. Temps are going all the way up to 70... We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's \"Sheena.\" \nAs the Ramones start blasting \"Sheena Is A Punk Rocker\": \nINT.  LOUIS, IN BED \nHis eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back. \nAfter the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved; he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all. \nLOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of his own in the other. \nEvening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark. \nJUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD \nJUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones slung around his neck. \nLOUIS Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. \nJUD It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to. \nLOUIS But-- \nJUD Does she love the cat? \nLOUIS Yes, but-- \nJUD Then come on. \nHe puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear Marshall Crenshaw singing \"Crystal Girl.\" JUD starts away. After a moment, LOUIS follows. \nEXT.  THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH  LATE EVENING \nThe SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree... \nThe SOUND of footfalls. \nFaintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing \"Working For A Living.\" \nIt's now almost twilight. \nJUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around curiously. \nLOUIS Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland. \nJUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck again. \nJUD What say, Louis? \nLOUIS Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one? \nJUD We're still not where we're going. \nHe walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows. \nLOUIS What do you mean? \nJUD The place we're going is on the other side of that. \nHe points at the deadfall. \nLOUIS We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks! \nJUD No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure. \nLOUIS I'm not climbing that. \nJUD Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself. \nHe holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as he says. After a moment he says: \nLOUIS Let's go. \nJUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows. \nLOUIS (low) Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up. \nEXT.  THEIR FEET \nFirst JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe's grinning, exhilarated. \nLOUIS God, this is amazing! \nEXT.  JUD \nThere are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both stern and a little scared. \nJUD Just don't stop and-- \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe looks down. \nEXT.  LOUIS'S FEET \nA dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot plunges down maybe six inches. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it. \nLOUIS And don't look down. Right. \nHe continues. \nEXT.  THE DEADFALL, REVERSE  TWILIGHT \nJUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches the top. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nLOUIS (amazed) Holy...! \nEXT.  BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV \nIn the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe- inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias. The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle- carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path goes on. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with frank amazement. \nEXT.  JUD \nJUD (turns to look) Come on, Louis--don't stop! \nEXT.  LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL \nJUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse shape. \nJUD Almost there, Louis. \nLOUIS You keep saying that. \nJUD This time I mean it. \nHe tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder. \nEXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV \nThe top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see, there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the Pet Sematary: concentric circles. \nSOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND \nLOUIS (awed) What is this place? \nJUD This was their burying ground, Louis. \nLOUIS Whose burying ground? \nJUD The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. \nLOUIS Why? For God's sake, why? \nJUD I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right? \nLOUIS I guess so...but... \nJUD You want to rest a bit before you start? \nLOUIS No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. \nJUD Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. \nHe hands him the pick and shovel. \nJUD I'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. Each buries his own. That's how it was done then. \nJUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out into the burying ground. \nEXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT \nSOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here. \nThe hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, and flashes fire. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside him we see a low pile of rocks and earth. \nJUD (voice) Should be deep enough. \nHe joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms. \nLOUIS You think so? \nHe notices the rocks. \nLOUIS What are those for? \nJUD Your cairn. \nEXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV \nThose tumbled piles of rock are very obvious. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE \nLOUIS Doesn't look like they last long. \nJUD Don't worry about that. \nLOUIS Jud, why am I doing all this? \nJUD Because it's right. \nHe walks off again. \nLOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down. \nEXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG \nHe opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse. \nLOUIS Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat. \nHe tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade. \nEXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT \nLOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three stones. \nEXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN \nHe looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there. \nJUD That's fine. You did real good. \nLOUIS looks at him. \nEXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT \nThere's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING. \nEXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT \nLOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their lights. They are both clearly fagged out. \nSOUND, FAINT: The telephone. \nLOUIS Oh, shit! Rachel! \nHe drops the tools and sprints. \nEXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING \nLOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder. \nEXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS \nEXT.  THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV \nGrass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH. \nEXT.  LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU \nINT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS \nHe's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now. \nEXT.  THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS \nHe puts the dish of food down and sits beside it. \nLOUIS Food, Church...food! \nSOUND: Miaow. \nEXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV \nCHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nLOUIS Come on, Church! Chow down! \nEXT.  CHURCH \nHe crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food. \nLOUIS (to himself) Christ. I don't believe this. \nHe picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food. \nLOUIS (wincing) God, you stink, Church. \nCHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms. \nLOUIS In a second. \nHe tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S neck. \nEXT.  CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV) \nThere's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant\tof the crash. A line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all grows. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP \nLOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes something out of CHURCH'S whiskers. \nEXT.  LOUIS'S HAND, ECU \nIt's a shred of green plastic. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH \nLOUIS Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch-- \nCHURCH suddenly claws at his face. \nLOUIS Ow! \nHe claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek, welling blood. He looks at the cat. \nEXT.  JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD \nThe garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear the Romantics doing \"What I Like About You.\" JUD is singing along and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you can dig it. \nHe sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it. \nHe takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking totally stunned. \nJUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the phones off JUD'S ears. \nLOUIS What did we do? \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN \nLOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens them. \nJUD I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception. \nLOUIS What did we do, Jud? \nJUD Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis! \nLOUIS drinks about half the beer. \nLOUIS I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But... \nJUD Wouldn't wash? \nLOUIS No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it? \nJUD Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself. \nLOUIS drains his beer. \nLOUIS Can I have another one? \nJUD I guess it wouldn't hurt. \nHe gets up and goes to the fridge. \nINT.  JUD, AT THE FRIDGE \nJUD The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came. \nHe returns to the table with the beer. \nJUD They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground. \nLOUIS Wendigo? \nJUD Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you... \nJUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts. \nJUD Maybe it really was a Wendigo-- I ain't the one to say it wasn't-- or maybe it was just some disease. Whatever the reason, those that were left moved on. But they left that place...the way it is now. \nJUD shrugs, and drinks. \nEXT.  JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE  DAY \nINT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK \nRACHEL (with great force) Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me. Promise me. Promise me. \nINT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS \nThe washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are closed--he's dozing. \nLOUIS Promise... \nINT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE \nTo LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD, his eyes shocked and staring. \nJUD (to LOUIS) You do it for all the best reasons, but that ain't why. You do it because it gets hold of you...you do it because you have to. \nINT.  LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU \nThe washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze is deepening; he's started to snore a little. \nSOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath. \nLOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in shock. \nINT.  THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV \nA very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath, actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain the water. \nINT.  LOUIS \nTurns his head, preparatory to leaping out. \nINT.  THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH \nIts mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth. \nINT.  THE BATHROOM \nLOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing. \nLOUIS looks at the closed door. \nLOUIS How the hell did you get in? \nHe may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once, LOUIS helps it with his foot. \nThen he looks down at: \nINT.  THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV \nINT.  LOUIS \nStaring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES. \nEXT.  A DELTA 727 \nIts landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor International Airport. \nINT.  A DEPLANING AREA  DAY \nLots of people making their way up the jetway. \nINT.  LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT \nHe's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a dozen roses. His face lights up. \nINT.  THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV \nHere comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up. \nELLIE Daddy! \nShe runs for him. \nINT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT \nELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her cheerfully. \nLOUIS Hi, sugar! \nShe smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily. \nELLIE Daddy, is Church all right? \nLOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful. \nLOUIS Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left. \nELLIE Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. \nLOUIS (trying to smile) That was a silly dream, wasn't it? \nELLIE Is he really all right? \nLOUIS Yes. \nELLIE Because you promised. \nLOUIS I know. \nRACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face, good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit stale. \nRACHEL Want to take your son, doc? \nLOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic. \nLOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply. \nINT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT \nCHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors. CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again. \nINT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT \nRACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket suit, is sacking on the couch. \nELLIE (entering) Can cats have shampoos? \nRACHEL Yes--you have to take them to someone who grooms animals, though. I think it's pretty expensive. \nELLIE (still upset) I don't care. I'll save up my allowance and pay for it. Church smells bad. \nLOUIS I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. \nELLIE No more chocolate chip cookies. \nLOUIS Huh? \nELLIE Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! \nShe cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair. \nEXT.  THE STATION WAGON, DAY \nMoving up the country road toward home through blazing fall foliage. \nINT.  TV SCREEN, CU  NIGHT \nOn it is a scene from \"Night of the Living Dead.\" \nNEWSCASTER Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living. \nELLIE (voice) Daddy? \nINT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  NIGHT \nThere's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching \"Night.\" Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV. \nShe's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly. \nLOUIS What's up, sugar? \nELLIE Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? \nLOUIS \nWhat? \nINT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL \nShe's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE \nShe's gotten up into his lap. \nELLIE At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. \nLOUIS Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear. \nINT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR \nShe smiles a little at this. \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM \nLOUIS But don't you dare say that. \nELLIE I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? \nLOUIS I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children-- \nELLIE Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. \nLOUIS Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard. \nELLIE Do you believe that? \nLOUIS looks toward: \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV \nCHURCH is sleeping. \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE \nLOUIS I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that. \nELLIE You believe in it. \nLOUIS Oh, faith's a little more than just believing. \nINT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR \nListening intently. \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE \nLOUIS (continues) I'll tell you what faith is--it's the evidence of the heart; the assurance of things not seen. \nELLIE I don't get it. \nLOUIS Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow? \nELLIE Yeah, sure. \nLOUIS Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right? \nELLIE'S giggling. \nINT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR \nShe's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks. \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE \nLOUIS But we plan on that chair. We believe in that chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I believe I will. \nELLIE (awed) You have faith in that. \nLOUIS Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz. \nHe gets her off his lap. \nELLIE I'm not tired! \nLOUIS I'm sure you're not. \nELLIE Then why do I have to go to bed? \nLOUIS Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz. \nShe heads toward the stairs. \nINT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM \nLOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her nightgown, comes in. \nBelting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE. \nEXT.  THE SKY, WITH THE KITE \nLOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay. \nEXT.  LOUIS, IN THE FIELD \nHe's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back at the picnic table. \nLOUIS Hey, Gage! \nEXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE \nGAGE gets down and runs toward his father. \nEXT.  ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER \nBelting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones. \nEXT.  THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE \nGAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands. \nGAGE Dat? \nLOUIS String! You're flying it, Gage--you got the hammer, my man! \nGAGE Gage fline it? \nLOUIS Bet your boots. Look-- \nLOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down. \nEXT.  THE KITE \nIt dips in the sky. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE \nLOUIS See? \nGAGE Gage fline it!! \nLOUIS (tenderly) Bet your ass, little hero. \nHe kisses his son. They look up at: \nEXT.  THE KITE \nDipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky. \nIRWIN GOLDMAN (voice) Where were you while he was playing in the road? Thinking about your stupid medical articles? You stinking shit! You killer of children! \nINT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN \nIRWIN You-- \nBut there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the floor. \nINT.  THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY \nRACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back. \nRACHEL Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT! \nINT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN \nLOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood. \nIRWIN How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I should have done it sooner! \nIRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS \"oofs\" and doubles over. \nINT.  ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS \nAmong them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON. \nSTEVE (getting up) Hey! \nINT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN \nLOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of glee. \nIRWIN How do you like that? How do-- \nLOUIS pushes the old man with both hands. \nINT.  IRWIN GOLDMAN \nHe goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin... knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners. \nINT.  RACHEL AND DORY \nRACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily breaks free and goes running down the aisle. \nINT.  ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE \nMARCY Stop them. Right now. \nSTEVE gets up and goes toward: \nINT.  THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN \nHe's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water. He's weeping. \nLOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic pose. \nIRWIN Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll take y'apart! \nAs LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last possible moment. \nSTEVE Stop it! \nLOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body. \nSTEVE Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis? It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match! \nThat gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly have happened. \nINT.  LOUIS \nPASCOW (voice) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, doc-- \nHorrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and sees: \nEXT.  GAGE, LOUIS'S POV \nThe kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it. \nRISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK. \nEXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK \nEXT.  GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD \nGAGE (cheerful) Geddit-geddit-geddit! \nEXT.  EVERYONE, KITE'S POV \nGAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table. JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him. \nEXT.  GAGE, IN THE ROAD \nAs he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string. \nSOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK. \nGAGE turns his head. \nGAGE (not afraid) Druck! \nEXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV \nSuddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror. He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN. \nEXT.  LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD \nLOUIS (shrieks) NO!! \nEXT.  GAGE \nBLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen- dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face. \nEXT.  PHOTO MONTAGE \na.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE. \nb.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm. \nc.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm. \nd.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood. \ne.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap. GAGE looks c. but c. \nf.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair. He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing. \ng.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9. \nh.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the other. \ni.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn, blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky and screaming. \nj.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while: \nJUD (voice) Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS \nHe's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are actually hundreds. \nLOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye. \nJUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table. \nJUD Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago? \nLOUIS No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie. \nJUD Louis-- \nThe swing door opens. They look toward: \nINT.  ELLIE \nShe looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE on the sled. \nINT.  JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE \nELLIE (coming to the table) I want to go back to my own room. I can't sleep with mommy. She keeps stealing the covers. \nJUD What you got there, Ellie? \nAt first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind. \nJUD (studying it) Why that's real nice...you pullin' him on a sled. Bet he liked that, didn't he? \nELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the eyes. \nELLIE (crying) I used to pull 'im a lot. \nLOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods. \nELLIE I'm going to carry this picture, Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage come back. \nJUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I think it has. \nJUD Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but-- \nELLIE He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair-- \nLOUIS Ellie-- \nELLIE And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and... \nShe bursts into tears. \nJUD Louis, take care of your little girl...she needs you. \nINT.  LOUIS, CU \nHis face is stricken. \nINT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nLOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep. \nEXT.  THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA \nThe doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his brow. \nJUD (v-o continues) He wasn't able to get to the bottom of the truth, Louis. \nINT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD  NIGHT \nLOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD. \nLOUIS I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? \nJUD Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. \nLOUIS (bitter) Tell that to my wife and little girl. \nJUD It ain't your wife and little girl that's got me worried, Louis. \nEXT.  THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA  DUSK \nWe're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck, showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at the grave and then goes to the back of his truck. \nJUD (voice-over) Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as I remember. \nEXT.  BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA  DUSK \nHe reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA  DAY \nShe's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the sun. She's staring at something, horrified. \nJUD (v-o continues) It was four or five days later when... \nEXT.  A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA  DAY \nA young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident. \nJUD (v-o continues) ...Margie Washburn seen him walking up the road toward Yorkie's Livery. \nEXT.  MARGIE/SEPIA \nShe's screaming--we hear her faintly. \nEXT.  TIMMY/SEPIA \nHe turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins at MARGIE. \nEXT.  IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA \nShe hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the door. \nJUD (v.o.) Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman walking back and forth between the home place and the town line. But it was Margie... \nINT.  THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA \nShe's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes in. \nJUD (v.o. continues) ...who finally got up enough guts to talk to the town fathers about it. She knew it had to be stopped, Louis. \nINT.  THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA \nMARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking; they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN. \nJUD (v.o. continues) She knew it was an abomination. George Anderson, the town postmaster, was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal Benson...and me. I was there. \nEXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA  SUNSET \nIt's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill. \nAn old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out. \nSOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS. \nThey go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer. \nSOUND: Crazy laughter. \nBILL BATERMAN (voice) Stop that, Timmy! \nThe four men look at each other. \nJUD Come on. \nThey start around to the back. \nEXT.  THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA \nTIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane. BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the sun. \nEXT.  THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA \nThe four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when they see BILL and TIMMY. \nALAN Oh holy Jesus lookit that. \nBILL whirls around and sees them. \nBILL You men get out of here! \nJUD I heard your boy was killed down Georgia. \nBILL (agitated) That was a mistake! \nHANNIBAL Was it? \nBILL You see him standing there, don't you? Now get out! Get the Christ off my land! \nNow TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward. \nTIMMY (laughing) Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an! \nGEORGE (revolted) Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can smell him! \nBILL He ain't dead! Give him a day or two and he'll be fine! Don't you say that! \nJUD Bill, this ain't right--you can see that yourself-- \nBILL (screaming) GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!! \nEXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA \nRACHEL Oh Louis, I just don't know about this-- \nLOUIS I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy. \nRACHEL Louis, are you sure? \nLOUIS I'm sure. \nINT.  THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE \nELLIE I don't want to go to Chicago, Gramma Dory. \nDORY Why not, darling? \nELLIE I had a bad dream last night. A nightmare. \nIRWIN (kindly) About what? \nELLIE About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage. \nDORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's head. \nELLIE And someone named Paxcow. \nINT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS \nLOUIS guides her to the jetway. \nLOUIS Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat. \nHe kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him. \nIRWIN Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I lost my mind? It's the truth, but no good excuse. \nLOUIS (hugs him back) We all lost our minds, Irwin. \nLOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE. \nLOUIS Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you. \nELLIE Come with us, daddy. Please come with us! \nLOUIS I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- \nINT.  ELLIE, CU \nELLIE (crying) Please, daddy! I'm scared! \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE \nLOUIS Of what? \nELLIE (crying harder) I don't know. \nLOUIS (great emphasis) Everything's going to be all right, Ellie. Now go on--get aboard. \nELLIE Do you swear? \nLOUIS I swear. \nThe Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face that while things are still not all right, they are a little better. She joins her mother. \nThe four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and then they're gone. \nINT.  LOUIS, CU \nLOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face. Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face. \nHe turns and strides away. \nINT.  THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS \nThe family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches: \nEXT.  THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV \nFrom behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks away. \nEXT.  LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT \nFace set, he gets into the wagon and drives away. \nEXT.  ROUTE 15 IN BREWER \nThe CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware and LOUIS crosses to it. \nINT.  THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU \nOn it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the CLERK'S hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work- gloves into the pile. \nINT.  LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE) \nCLERK Anything else for you today? \nLOUIS (after a look) I think we got it all. \nThe CLERK starts to ring things up. \nCLERK Looks like heavy work. \nLOUIS It could be. \nThe quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing things up again. \nINT.  A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL \nELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space. \nCAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset. She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she screams. \nINT.  JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER \nWe can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are startled. So are other passengers. A stewardess comes running. \nELLIE Paxcow says it's almost too late! \nRACHEL Ellie...Ellie...what... \nELLIE Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late! \nEXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY \nThe CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops and LOUIS gets out. \nEXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT \nSOUND: Phone starts to ring. \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD \nHe shuffles to the telephone. His Walkman 'phones are around his neck. He's got a bottle of beer in one hand. \nJUD (picks up) Hello--you got Judson. \nINT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL \nRACHEL It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm calling from Chicago. \nJUD (surprised voice) Chicago! Is Louis with you? \nRACHEL No...we're going to be here awhile, and he wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there. I just wondered if he was with you. \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD \nHis face says this is very serious. \nJUD No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you. \nINT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM \nRACHEL Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? \nJUD (voice) I don't-- \nRACHEL Was it Pascow? \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD \nJUD Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to-- \nINT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL \nRACHEL Don't bother. I'm coming home. \nJUD (alarmed voice) Rachel! \nRACHEL Thank you, Jud. Goodbye. \nShe hangs up. \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD \nJUD No! Rachel! Don't do that! Rachel--! \nThe buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces the receiver. The man looks very grim. \nINT.  THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE \nRACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot of the stairs. \nDORY Rachel...darling...you're upset... a night's sleep... \nRACHEL I have to go. The connections are tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in forty minutes. Will you drive me, daddy? \nIRWIN You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too. \nRACHEL Yes. \nIRWIN I'll drive you. \nELLIE (voice) Mommy? \nThey all turn to: \nINT.  ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS \nELLIE Please hurry. \nINT.  RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS \nRACHEL I will. Come and kiss me. \nELLIE races into her arms. \nEXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY  NIGHT \nSOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off. \nCAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon. \nLOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside. \nLOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the scene. \nEXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV \nA quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree- ree... \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe heads for GAGE'S grave. \nINT.  THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN \nIRWIN I'll come with you if you want, honey. \nRACHEL (shakes her head) I've got three planes to catch and I got the last seats on two of them. It's like God saved them for me. \nEXT.  O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR \nIRWIN'S car heads for it. \nEXT.  THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED \nLOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave for a long second. \nLOUIS (low) Gonna bust you out, son. \nHe starts to shovel. \nEXT.  THE SHOVEL, CU \nDigging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is new and fresh. \nEXT.  JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS \nINT.  JETLINER, WITH RACHEL \nHe's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up. \nEXT.  THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV \nIt is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow eyes the size of lighthouse lamps. \nIt makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nThe SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing. \nLOUIS It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me. \nSlowly he begins to walk again. \nEXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE \nIn the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no small tree, either, but a great big old fir. \nLOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at: \nEXT.  THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV \nHere is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen before. Three big claws at the end of it. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nLooks up again. His face is set and hard. \nLOUIS It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage. \nHe starts to walk again. \nEXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND \nSOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart. \nSOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting. \nLOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks at: \nEXT.  A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV \nWe can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is clearly a man approaching total exhaustion. \nEXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K \nIt tracks past THE CAMERA. \nINT.  THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW \nBoth of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel. Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow. \nEXT.  THE ARIES K \nIt goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree. \nINT.  RACHEL \nShe lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl! She unbuckles it and gets out. \nEXT.  RACHEL \nShe looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it than just a scratch up the side. \nRACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been through a lot tonight. \nRACHEL Now what? \nPASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road, looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset. \nPASCOW It's trying to stop you. Do you hear me? It's trying to stop you. \nRACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW. \nRACHEL Is anyone there? \nAfter a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for the first time in her life. \nThe car sweeps by her without slowing. \nEXT.  GAGE'S CAIRN, CU \nLOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is the canvas tarp, now open and empty. \nAbsently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn. \nLOUIS Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us. \nHe turns away toward the stairs. \nEXT.  RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9 \nShe's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand. Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts by. \nRACHEL (shouts) MAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP IN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE! \nShe starts walking again. \nEXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE \nLOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he pushes it, setting it in motion. \nINT.  THE GARAGE \nLOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him. \nINT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL \nSOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view, dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down the hall toward the master bedroom. \nINT.  THE BEDROOM \nThe clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first on the immaculate bedspread and lies still. \nIn this shot we should note the closet door is standing open. \nINT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD \nHe turns slowly and walks toward the bed. \nJUD Gage? Come on out. \nHe reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds the blade. \nJUD I want to show you something. \nSOUND: Miaow! \nINT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV \nINT.  JUD, BY THE BED \nJUD (to the cat) How did you--?! \nINT.  JUD'S FEET \nA small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt of the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf, \nINT.  JUD \nHe screams with pain and staggers backward. \nINT.  JUD'S FEET \nThe other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and pulls. \nINT.  JUD \nWith a startled yell, he falls. \nINT.  JUD AND GAGE \nThis one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE. \nThere is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel. Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife. \nGAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds. \nJUD expires. \nGAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat. \nEXT.  ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES \nHeadlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up. \nRACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side. \nEXT.  ANGLE ON THE CAB \nWe can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just was. \nRACHEL Thank you so much. \nTRUCKER I didn't get a ticket, so you're welcome, lady. (And, more seriously) Whatever your problems are, I hope they work out. \nPASCOW It's the end of the line for me, too--I'm not allowed any further. \nRACHEL (to the trucker) I'm sure things will be fine. \nPASCOW I'm not. \nShe closes the door and steps down. \nThe truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when: \nGAGE (soft voice) Mummy! \nShe stops, startled. Her face wears a \"did I hear that?\" expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house. \nGAGE (soft voice) Mummy! \nRACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at: \nEXT.  JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV \nThe one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go. \nEXT.  RACHEL \nShe goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and opens the porch door. \nShe looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning, and someone else's house. But...that voice... \nGAGE (voice) Mummy, I need you! \nRACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch. \nRACHEL Who-- \nThe door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes into the doorway and sits down. \nCHURCH Miaow! \nRACHEL Church! \nGAGE (voice) Mummy, I need you! \nShe crosses to the open door. \nRACHEL Gage? Gage? \nNo answer. RACHEL steps in. \nEXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING \nINT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS \nHe's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls back and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a wild yell, he goes over onto the floor. \nINT.  LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR \nHe comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and side to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it. \nLOUIS Jesus! \nHe starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on: \nINT.  GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV \nLOUIS Hi, Church. Want some grub? \nHe tosses the pork chop onto the grass. \nEXT.  CHURCH \nHe hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts to chow up. He looks up at: \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe is pulling on the rubber gloves. \nLOUIS Don't mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all you want. \nEXT.  CHURCH \nHe starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack. \nEXT.  ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH \nLOUIS Eat all you can...all you want... that's right...today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead... \nHe finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip, then moves toward CHURCH. \nCHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again, and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs him. \nCHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away. \nLOUIS No, you don't! \nEXT.  CHURCH, CU \nThe syringe plunges into his haunch. \nEXT.  CHURCH AND LOUIS \nThe needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to get up...and then falls over again. \nLOUIS Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead. \nHe walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag. \nEXT.  THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV \nAny doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nTwang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted. He looks back at: \nINT.  CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV \nDead. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe climbs the steps and goes onto the porch. \nEXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH \nHe strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside. \nINT.  THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS \nIt's dark in here, and spooky. \nLOUIS Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause) Gage? \nNo answer. He looks down and sees: \nINT.  A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV \nOne of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs. \nINT.  LOUIS \nHe goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard travelling to get here. \nThere's a spot of blood on it. \nSOUND: A low giggle. \nLOUIS looks up: \nINT.  THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV \nMighty dark. Mighty shadowy. \nSOUND: Another giggle. \nINT.  LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS \nLOUIS Gage? \nINT.  THE STAIRS \nGAGE (voice) Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide and go seek! \nINT.  LOUIS \nHe takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket. \nLOUIS All right, Gage...let's. \nHe begins to climb the stairs. \nINT.  UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS \nLOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing. \nHe checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a guest room. Shadowy and empty. \nDown the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back. \nDown the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in. \nINT.  JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS \nHe checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees: \nINT.  THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV \nA bloodstain. \n", "test1_input": "\"PET SEMATARY\" by Stephen King \n\"PET SEMATARY\" \nby \nStephen King \nFADE IN ON \nthat most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass-- ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly \nDISSOLVES TO: \nEXT.  A GRAVE MARKER  SUMMER DAY \nIt's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in black paint which has faded: SMUCKY  HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a child. \nMAIN TITLES BEGIN. \nEXT.  ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER \nA child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating: BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER \nMAIN TITLES CONTINUE \nEXT.  TWO MARKERS \nI think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut butter jars, etc. \nThese two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1, 1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL 1958 (another board). \nMAIN TITLES CONTINUE \nEXT.  FIVE OR SIX MARKERS \nWe can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the \"gravestones\" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated -- animal graveyard. \nWe can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood, painstakingly hammered flat. \nMAIN TITLES CONTINUE. \nEXT.  ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY \nFrom here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the words on the arch face those arriving along the path. \nMAIN TITLES CONTINUE \nEXT.  THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU \nMAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY. \nTHE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible. \nAS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence? Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON IT and then we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nBLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY. \nEXT.  A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY  EVENING \nSOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree... \nTo the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road. \nThe house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally. \nGROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the driveway of the house we've been looking at. \nEXT.  REAR OF THE WAGON \nAs LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR M.D. TODAY?) \nThe ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree- ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then: \nELLIE CREED (voice) Is this our new house, daddy? \nLOUIS CREED (voice) This is it. \nEXT.  THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE \nThe two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32, gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house. \nThey come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon, still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous. \nLOUIS So...what do you think? \nRACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him. \nRACHEL It's gorgeous! \nELLIE Am I really gonna have my own room? \nLOUIS Yes. \nELLIE Yaay! \nShe looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging down from the bough of a tree. \nELLIE (to RACHEL) Is that a swing? \nRACHEL Yes, but the rope might be-- \nELLIE Yaay! \nShe goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile. \nLOUIS Let her go. It's cool. \nRACHEL Louis, the house is beautiful. \nThey kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch. \nRACHEL The Master of Disaster awakes. \nThis SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat. \nLOUIS And Buckaroo Banzai. \nRACHEL Come on--let's parole 'em. \nThey walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors, LOUIS to the rear of the wagon. \n", "test1_true": "GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in this station wagon, and the wagon looks it. \nRACHEL Decided to wake up and see what home looks like, huh? \nShe begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old. \nEXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS \nHe opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes. \nELLIE (voice) Daddy! Mommy! I see a path! \nLOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward: \nEXT.  ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING \nShe's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs. \nEXT.  THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV \nWe see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up its flank and into the dark woods. \nTHE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings. \nEXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR) \nRACHEL (irritated) Not so high, Ellie! You don't know how strong that rope is. \nShe puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then stands there, looking at his sister. \nEXT.  THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU \nThe bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is going to have a great fall. \nEXT.  LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR) \nHe's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up. \nELLIE (raptuous voice) Wheee! \nLOUIS Ellie, you heard your m--- \nHis eyes widen. \nEXT.  ELLIE \nELLIE Wh-- \nSOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised. \nLOUIS and RACHEL run to her. \nLOUIS\t\t\t\tRACHEL Ellie! Are you all right?\tHoney? Are you okay? \nEXT.  ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT \nELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old girl. \nELLIE Hurrts! It hurrrrts! \nLOUIS Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee. \nNevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from the tire. RACHEL helps. \nEXT.  GAGE \nHe's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a bit; the boy needs a change. \nHe stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the mesh. \nGAGE Hi-Durch! \nCHURCH Waow! \nGAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap. Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment. \nSOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one. \nEXT.  THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV) \nA big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in blue letters--blasts by. \nEXT.  GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER \nThe windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy. \nGAGE Druck! \nHe starts down the driveway toward the road. \nEXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING) \nELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious. \nLOUIS (to RACHEL) Would you get the first aid kit? \nELLIE (screaming) Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the stingy stuff, daddy! \nRACHEL suddenly looks around toward: \nEXT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV) \nNo one there. \nEXT.  RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING \nRACHEL Gage's gone! \nLOUIS Jesus, the road! \nThey get up together. \nEXT.  GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD \nA truck is coming. A great big one. \nEXT.  ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU \nThe grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl. \nEXT.  GAGE \n", "test1_id": 630, "test2_input": "He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab him. \nGAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks. \nEXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL \nThe fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply wrinkled and kindly. \nJUD CRANDALL (to GAGE) No you don't, my friend--not in that road. \nBut he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him. \nGAGE Drucks! \nJUD (low) No shit, Sherlock. \nJUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE brings up the rear. She's still sniffling. \nRACHEL Gage! \nJUD (hands him to her) He was headed for the road, looked like. I corralled him for you, missus. \nRACHEL Thank you. Thank you so much. \nLOUIS Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed. \nHe sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as if he might have arthritis. \nJUD Jud Crandall. I live just across the road. \nRACHEL I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. \nJUD No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night. \nHe leans over toward ELLIE. \nJUD Who might you be, little Miss? \nELLIE I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause) At least, I used to. \nJUD And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. \nELLIE (to LOUIS) Are clams really happy? \nThey all laugh--even GAGE. \nRACHEL Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. \nJUD Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. \nAs RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away: \nELLIE (worries) Daddy, do I really have to have the stingy stuff? \nLOUIS No-I guess not. \nELLIE Yayyy! \nShe goes belting off. \nJUD (amused) I guess your daughter there ain't going to die after all. \nLOUIS (also amused) I guess not. \nJUD House has stood empty for too long. It's damn good to see people in it again. \nSOUND: A truck engine, gearing down. \nEXT.  A MOVING VAN \nIt blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD \nLOUIS Hey--they actually found the place! \nJUD Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want. \nLOUIS Well, maybe I---- \nRACHEL (voice) Louis, what's this? \nEXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE \nGAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path ELLIE has already glimpsed. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD \nThey cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just climbing out of the van. \nFIRST MOVER You Mr. Creed? \nLOUIS Yes. Just a second. \nEXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH \nShe's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them. \nLOUIS The movers-- \nRACHEL Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? \nLOUIS I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. \nRACHEL (smiling) I bet Mr. Crandall knows! \nJUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that he is serious. \nJUD Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and a good walk, too. I'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too-- after you get settled in. \nHe smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference between the CREEDS and JUD. \nEXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT \nSOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree... \nThere's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe. \nINT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT \nThere's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' cartons stacked all over the place. \nLOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first night in the new place will understand. \n", "test2_true": "SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown. \nRACHEL (crossing to LOUIS) Kids are asleep, doc. \nLOUIS Great. \nHe hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just two good people in all the big darkness of their new house. \nRACHEL You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you? \nLOUIS Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and--- \nRACHEL ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- \nLOUIS Did you see his shirt? \nRACHEL (giggles) Sure. Bruce Springsteen. \nLOUIS I really do have a million questions about the area...but the thing I'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the Boss. \nShe laughs. \nEXT.  THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT \nPervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge. \nJUD (voice) That you, doc? \nEXT.  THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE \nWe hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman earphones. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nLOUIS It's me. \nINT.  THE PORCH, WITH JUD \nThe Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the headphones casually around his neck, like a kid. \nJUD Well, come on up and have a beer. \nINT.  THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT \nLOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS. \nJUD You need a glass? \nLOUIS Not at all. \nJUD Good for you. \nLOUIS drinks half the can at a draught. \nLOUIS God, that's fine. \nJUD Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself. \nLOUIS What were you listening to? \nJUD Allman Brothers. \nLOUIS What? \nJUD The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. \nHe passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the Walkman's PLAY button. \nSOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats. \nLOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head. \nJUD I'm sorry. Wait. \nHe turns it down. \nJUD Try that. \nLOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments. It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off. \nLOUIS Nice. \nJUD I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause) One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. \nLOUIS (great sincerity) Thank you, Mr. Crandall. \nHe drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look toward: \nEXT/INT.  THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN) \nOne of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too-- sweeps by in a blast of air. \nINT.  THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD \nLOUIS (wincing) Jesus! \nJUD (lights a cigarette) That's one mean road, all right--you remember that path your wife commented on? \nLOUIS The one that goes into the woods--sure. \nJUD That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there. \nLOUIS What's at the end of it? \nJUD (smiles) Another day--after you get settled in a bit. Meantime, doc--- \nHere JUD raises his glass in a toast. \nJUD (continues) Here's to your bones. \nLOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S. \nLOUIS And yours. \nThey drink. \nEXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT \nLOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his attention the other way...toward the path. \nHe walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark. \n", "test2_id": 631, "test3_input": "Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely. \nEXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS \nHe's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall. \nEXT.  THE ROAD \nHere comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the wall. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nCrouching against his side of the wall and sweating. \nEXT.  THE POLICE CAR \nIt stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nCrouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back. LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat. \nSilence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz. \nEXT.  THE COP \nAh! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the cemetery for a moment. \nCOP I ain't afraid of no ghost. \nHe walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass. \nEXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL \nHe collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down on the other side of the road. \nHe tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults over. \nEXT.  THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS \nHe takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon. \nEXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS \nHe puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope. \nSOUND: An approaching car. \nEXT.  PASSING CAR \nA civilian--not the ubiquitous cop. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing. Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the driver's side of the car and looks in at: \nINT.  IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV \nThe keys are in the switch. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes. \nLOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes back to the front, gets in, and drives away. \nINT.  A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL \nPeople are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her. \nPASCOW There's just time. If you run. \nWithout looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs. \nINT.  THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL \nShe's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit! \nINT.  GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW \nThe FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door. \nPASCOW Don't do that, babe. \nThe GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into the area. She sees: \nINT./EXT.  THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS \nIt is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway. \nINT.  RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE) \nRACHEL Make it come back! \nFEMALE GATE AGENT I can't-- \nRACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on the slide-cards. She picks up her mike. \nEXT.  THE JETWAY  NIGHT \nRACHEL stands all alone at the end of it. \nAMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES. \nRACHEL (screams) COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!! \nEXT.  THE JET, RACHEL'S POV \nIt starts to swing back to pick her up. \nEXT.  RACHEL \nPASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder. \nPASCOW You're doing just fine. \nEXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH \nHe's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out of his Walkman 'phones. \nSOUND: An approaching car. \nEXT.  THE CREED HOUSE \n", "test3_true": "EXT.  THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV \nOff it goes, glimmering in the dark. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe holds the corpse of his little boy to him. \nLOUIS Please God--let this work. \nHe sets off. \nEXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH \nZonked out. He missed the whole thing. Nice going, Jud. \nEXT.  OUTSIDE THE ARCH TO THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS \nLouis passes under like a ghost. \nEXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS \nLOUIS is crying. He crosses to the deadfall. \nLOUIS Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna look down. \nHe begins to mount the deadfall. \nEXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE \nHe reaches the top. And woven into the deadfall, behind him, facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face. \nLOUIS descends the other side. \nEXT.  THE FOOT OF THE DEDFALL, WOODS SIDE \nLOUIS reaches the bottom and looks at: \nEXT.  THE WOODS, LOUIS'S POV \nThe path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows slightly. \nEXT.  LOUIS, MOVING UP THE PATH \nEXT.  LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP \nThat phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of CRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts through the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart man. I wouldn't either. \nBut he does. \nINT.  THE HERTZ DESK, AT BIA WITH RACHEL AND CLERK--AND PASCOW \nPASCOW is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting some of them bloody. \nHERTZ CLERK I'm sorry...it's been very busy tonight. I really don't have anything. \nPASCOW What about the Aries K with the scratch on the side? \nThe CLERK starts looking through her papers. \nCLERK I do have an Aries K, but it came in sort of beat up--there's a long scrape up one side-- \nRACHEL I'll take it. \nEXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP \nHe comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the duffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The landscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact there are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds almost prehistoric. \nSOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER \nLOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at: \nEXT.  MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV \nA demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD THE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long. \nIts eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the sockets. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them. \nEXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV \nNothing there. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nLOUIS See? Just imagination. Just-- \nEXT.  LOUIS'S FEET \nWe can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks. Suddenly a thick tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers around his ankle. \nEXT.  LOUIS, LOOKING DOWN \nLOUIS Nothing...there. \nHe turns around and begins to walk again. \nEXT.  LOUIS'S FEET \nThe tentacle falls away. \nEXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP \nMYRIAD SOUNDS, none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls, screams. Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of escaped lunatics. LOUIS continues on regardless. \nEXT.  WOODS \nLOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he keeps moving along. \nSOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS looks plenty scared. \nSOUND: A falling tree. \nEXT.  WOODS, LOUIS'S POV \nThose SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls-- we see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE. \nEXT.  LOUIS \n", "test3_id": 632}

By the time I finished, I had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. Soil's stony up here. \nELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too. \nJUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is still looking at ELLEN. \nJUD Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is? \nELLIE Well...I guess not. \nJUD It's a place where the dead speak, Missy. \nHe sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her hair reassuringly. \nJUD No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis? \nLOUIS I think it is so, Ellie. \nELLIE What if you can't read what's written on there anymore? \nJUD Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it? \nELLIE Yes-- \nLOUIS And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot. \nELLIE To remember. \nJUD (smiles) Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary place, Ellie. It's a place of rest and speaking. Can you remember that? \nELLIE (a little awed) Yes, sir. \nThey start to walk slowly back toward the arch. \nEXT.  RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH \nIt's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing. \nRACHEL (calls) Louis, can we go? I'm tired! \nEXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD \nELLIE Mommy! This is a place where dead animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so! \nEXT.  RACHEL AND ELLIE \nBut RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this. \nRACHEL (soft) Did he. \nEXT.  LOUIS AND JUD \nLOUIS My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed. \nJUD Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy. \nLOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly. \nEXT.  THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE \nThe men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE. \nLOUIS (voice) Did we take too long? \nRACHEL (curt) Well, if supper's burned, I'm not the one going out for pizza. \nThey move away. \nEXT.  THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH \nThe face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN  NIGHT \nThere are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on them. Guess dinner was burned. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and tweezers. He's wearing glasses. \nELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile. \nLOUIS (not looking around) Hi, babe. \nELLIE Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of the road, isn't it? \nLOUIS looks around at her, surprised. \nELLIE That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much. \nLOUIS Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey... \nINT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR \nRACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid. \nELLIE (voice) No he won't! Not in the end! He won't be all right in the end no matter how you fix 'im! \nINT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE \nEllis has started to cry. \nELLIE In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he? \nLOUIS Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time. \nELLIE It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! \nPoor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort. \nLOUIS If it was up to me I'd let Church live to be a hundred...but I don't make up the rules. \nELLIE (muffled) Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not mine! Not-- \nShe breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and forth. \nINT.  THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL \nShe is crying silently. \nINT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nShe is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her mouth. \nINT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL \n", "test1_true": "INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nLOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's making notes from one as RACHEL comes in. \nRACHEL She's finally asleep. \nLOUIS She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid. \nRACHEL It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it. \nLOUIS Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you? \nRACHEL Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die. \nIt should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook aside and caps his pen. \nLOUIS Rachel...someday Church is going to die. \nRACHEL (whirls on him) That is hardly the point! Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow-- Never mind. I can see you don't have the slightest idea what I'm talking about. \nShe stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes in and slams the door. He goes for the knob. \nLOUIS Rachel--! \nSOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK. \nLOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset. \nEXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT \nHere comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring. \nINT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM \nThe headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she can get, with a big empty space in the middle. \nLights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade. \nINT.  GAGE  MORNING \nCheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon. Now he scoops up a handful and throws them. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE \nSplat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast. \nELLIE Yee-uck! Gross! \nINT.  THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT \nRACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with its message near her). \nLOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of school dress. \nLOUIS He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years. \nINT.  BY THE KITCHEN DOOR \nHere is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE \nELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier. \nELLIE I don't want him to get his nuts cut, daddy! What if he dies? \nINT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK \nLOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of words. \nLOUIS Good God! Where'd you hear that? \nINT.  ELLIE \nELLIE Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation! \nINT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK \nLOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement dies. \nRACHEL Honey, Church will be fine. \nINT.  ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER \nELLIE But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary? \nINT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK \nShe gives him a look as if to say: \"There! Now do you understand what you did?\" \nRACHEL Don't be silly. Church is not going to die. \nLOUIS According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks. \nAt this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is. \nRACHEL That's enough of that kind of talk! \nLOUIS I just said-- \nRACHEL I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place. \nELLIE goes slowly back to the table. \nELLIE (sets the plate down) I'm scared. What if school here isn't like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want to go h-h-home! \nELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face. \nINT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL) \nTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE. \nRACHEL You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face. \nLOUIS And Church will be fine. \nELLIE (anxious) Do you promise, Daddy? \nLOUIS Well, honey...you know that... \nRACHEL Don't shilly-shally, Louis.

THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL \nRACHEL It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm calling from Chicago. \nJUD (surprised voice) Chicago! Is Louis with you? \nRACHEL No...we're going to be here awhile, and he wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there. I just wondered if he was with you. \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD \nHis face says this is very serious. \nJUD No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you. \nINT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM \nRACHEL Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? \nJUD (voice) I don't-- \nRACHEL Was it Pascow? \nINT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD \nJUD Ayuh, I think 'twas.

Rachel--! \nThe buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces the receiver. The man looks very grim. \nINT.  THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE \nRACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot of the stairs. \nDORY Rachel...darling...you're upset... a night's sleep... \nRACHEL I have to go. The connections are tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in forty minutes. Will you drive me, daddy? \nIRWIN You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too. \nRACHEL Yes. \nIRWIN I'll drive you. \nELLIE (voice) Mommy? \nThey all turn to: \nINT.  ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS \nELLIE Please hurry. \nINT.  RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS \nRACHEL I will. Come and kiss me. \nELLIE races into her arms. \nEXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY  NIGHT \nSOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off. \nCAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon. \nLOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside. \nLOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the scene. \nEXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV \nA quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree- ree... \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe heads for GAGE'S grave. \nINT.  THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN \nIRWIN I'll come with you if you want, honey. \nRACHEL (shakes her head) I've got three planes to catch and I got the last seats on two of them. It's like God saved them for me. \nEXT.  O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR \nIRWIN'S car heads for it. \nEXT.  THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED \nLOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave for a long second. \nLOUIS (low) Gonna bust you out, son. \nHe starts to shovel. \nEXT.  THE SHOVEL, CU \nDigging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is new and fresh. \nEXT.  JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS \nINT.  JETLINER, WITH RACHEL \n", "test2_true": "PILOT (voice) This is the Captain speaking.

Looks like it's going to be about half an hour before we get on a roll, so I'm turning off the NO SMOKING sign. \nSOUND: Bing! \nThere's a general groan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed her eyes. I think she's praying. \nEXT.  GAGE'S GRAVE  NIGHT \nNow it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it. We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down. \nEXT.  LOUIS  NIGHT \nHe's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile. Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND. He tosses the shovel aside and squats. \nEXT.  IN THE GRAVE, WITH LOUIS \nThere's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of GAGE'S coffin. LOUIS swipes his hand through the loose dirt, uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the coffin with his hands. \nEXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH \nJUD comes out. He's wearing a light jacket. His Walkman 'phones are around his neck. He's got a six-pack. He looks at: \nEXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, JUD'S POV \nIt's dark. \nEXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH, WITH JUD \nHe sits down. \nJUD You done it, you stupid old man... now you got to undo it. \nHe puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette. Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash buzz-sawing \"Rock The Casbah.\" \nJUD begins to watch. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to pull out the pick. \nSOUND of an approaching car. \nLOUIS freezes. \nEXT.  THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE CEMETERY \nA police car comes cruising slowly along. The spotlight on the driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nWatching. Waiting. Hardly breathing. \nEXT.  THE POLICE CAR \nIt reaches the end of the wall. Everything looks jake. The spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe relaxes perceptibly. He gets the pick and drops back into the grave. \nEXT.  THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU \nLOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and levers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the lock breaks. The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in the hinges. \nEXT.  LOUIS, CU \nHere's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness. \nEXT.  JETLINER LIFTING OFF FROM O'HARE \nINT.  RACHEL AND HER SEATMATE \nSEATMATE Think you'll make your connection in Boston? \nRACHEL I have to. \nEXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE \nHe's lying on his stomach, reaching in. We hear the SOUND of dirt grating in hinges again. \nEXT.  LOUIS, CU \nWe're looking up into his face. If GAGE had a POV, this would be it. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief. \nLOUIS Oh, Gage--oh, honey. \nEXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH \nHis chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his 'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a long round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty beer cans on the table beside him. \nA truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his head up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now. \nEXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS \nHe is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in his arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small limp figure in a dark suit. Hair flops limply. \nLOUIS It's going to be all right...I swear it's going to be all right... \nThe canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to lay his son down on it. \nEXT.  THE GROUND BESIDE THE TARP, CU \nIt's littered with flower petals. One limp hand appears among them. \nEXT.  LOUIS \nHe closes the tarp over GAGE, making a roll.

JETLINER IN THE NIGHT SKY \nPILOT (voice) Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen... \nINT.  THE JETLINER, WITH RACHEL \nHer seatmate is knitting something. Across the aisle sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking straight ahead. RACHEL looks around tensely. \nPILOT (continues) I'm delighted to tell you that we've got a strong tail-wind tonight and we expect to arrive at Boston's Logan Airport almost on time. \nPASCOW clenches his fist in a \"That's one for our side!\" gesture. \nRACHEL (softly) Thank God. \n", "test2_id": 631, "test3_input": "INT.

JUD'S FEET \nThe other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and pulls. \nINT.  JUD \nWith a startled yell, he falls. \nINT.  JUD AND GAGE \nThis one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE. \nThere is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel. Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife. \nGAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds. \nJUD expires. \nGAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat. \nEXT.

All through this she's been travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and opens the porch door. \nShe looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning, and someone else's house. But...that voice... \nGAGE (voice) Mummy, I need you! \nRACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch. \nRACHEL Who-- \nThe door to the house swings open.

THE HALL, WITH LOUIS \nLOUIS Gage! \nLOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the door to GAGE'S room. \nINT.

After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS, looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up. \nLOUIS Irwin, you'll just have to-- \nGAGE (voice) I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come over and play with me? \nLOUIS is dumbfounded...slack-mouthed with terror. \nLOUIS (a bare whisper) Gage? \nGAGE (voice) Mommy already came. We played, daddy. First I played with Jud and then mommy came and I played with mommy. We had an awful good time. Now I want to play with you. \nGAGE begins to giggle...a really awful sound. \nLOUIS What did you do? What did you-- \nCLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling. \nINT.  THE CREED BED, CU \nHe puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts them aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with several ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read the word MORPHINE on it very clearly. \nINT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS \nHe carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the window. His hair has gone partially white. \nHe fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for each syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in the left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in the right breast pocket of his shirt. \nLOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is like a rapidly fraying rope. \nLOUIS What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own comes home to you. Wasn't that what you said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it? \nHe leaves the room. \nEXT.  THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE \nLOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop.

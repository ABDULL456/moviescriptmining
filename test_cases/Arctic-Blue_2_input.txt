Viking Bob watches, wide-eyed with fury.  Mitchell spits. LeMalle punches the wall.  Then he turns and repeatedly BLASTS the Scout, parked nearby, with his carbine. 
89   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT) 
Eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five-gallon cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats. ERIC How the hell were they smart enough to find us? CORBETT Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses. 
Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the southwest.  Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure of the controls. CORBETT (continuing) Been driving long? ERIC I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks. CORBETT That makes the flight more interesting. 
Eric ignores the jibe.  He stays at 2,000 feet, making the landscape all the more immediate. 
Corbett stares out the window and broods.  He spots an open, snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the whiteness. CORBETT (continuing) See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf. (CONTINUED) 89   CONTINUED: ERIC Sounds like professional jealousy. CORBETT Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life. (beat) Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT) 
While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the instrument panel and scans the landscape below. CORBETT The idea was to get to the supplies before the bears did. Along the route we'd set our traps.  Made our year's living in three months. 
Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above the tree line. CORBETT (continuing) Lot of times we didn't even have a landing strip.  We'd set down on a plateau, like that one there.  Yeah, that one's easy; you could glide right in... 
Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the door with his left foot. 
The plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbett kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel, jamming it on. 
90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT) 
The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of emergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is instantly discharged. 
91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT) 
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat. 
Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was too fast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS to a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out. CORBETT Hope you got your money's worth on those lessons. 
92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT) 
There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the plateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau comes up fast. 
The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the wind. 
It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits the jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly, flipping tail over nose. 
93   INT.  CESSNA 
It rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed. 
Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside down, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE. 
Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg gets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the seat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking, Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully wrenching his ankle. 
94   EXT.  CESSNA 
Corbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the plane.

KING Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no choice. (looks at his guards) Death. His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords. 
PRINCE 
(GRIM) I agree. Death it is- And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards. 
PRINCE Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you that have already seen the light- (he nears the guards) Seen the future... The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) As for you- You may join us in our quest or die now- His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together, they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises 
IT- 
PRINCE (CONT'D) All of those in favor, make it known. 
HELLBOY 2 23 All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then kneel. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) Good- I see the council is as brave as it's always been... 
(BEAT) And now, my sister- The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone. He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) Find her- Find her- His minions surge into the tunnels. 
40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40 Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel. With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down a chute. She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves. 
41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41 
The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an ancient, leather-bound tome. She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty sword. It opens a gash in the princess' left arm- 
42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42 
The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a wound in his left arm. 
PRINCE No- no- you fools- 
HELLBOY 2 24 
43 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 43 
As another troll lifts his sword high- 
PRINCESS (calling out) Yrdrig!! YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In seconds, he's upon the TROLLS. Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls. The Princess slips through a secret door. 
44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44 
The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll screams echo off the walls. When they finally- 
45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45 
-reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late. Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor. The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his bleeding arm. 
CUT TO: 
46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46 
Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of Heliboy's "outing" the night before. HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph! 
HELLBOY ON TV Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've fought many creatures over the years but none as strong as me- He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes. 
HELLBOY 2 25 Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of beer. 
HELLBOY I think I did good. And I looked good, don't you think, Liz? Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls. 
ABE Look- there's Manning... He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by microphones. 
MANNING ON TV Evidently we have a- gas pocket- somewhere in-

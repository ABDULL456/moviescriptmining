RAY'S POV  TRACKING 
Toward the car. Still no sign of movement. 
BACK TO RAY 
He slows as he draws up to the back of the car. He looks in the back window. 
RAY'S POV  BACK SEAT OF THE CAR 
It is empty. 
The door on the highway side is ajar. 
BACK TO RAY 
No reaction. 
He walks around the back of the car onto the highway. He looks up the road. 
RAY'S POV 
Marty is crawling up the road on his hands and knees, leaving a trail of blood. The headlights of Ray's car give a fantastically long shadow. 
BACK TO RAY 
Still no reaction. He gets into the driver's seat and stares through the windshield as he gropes for the ignition key. 
RAY'S POV 
Marty, crawling. 
BACK TO RAY 
He throws the car into drive, looks at his target, thinks-- decides. He pulls the key out of the ignition and goes around to the trunk of the car. He opens it and pulls out a shovel. 
MARTY  LOW ANGLE 
From in front. The headlights glare behind him. His breath vaporizes. In the background Ray is walking toward him, dragging the shovel, which scrapes along the asphalt. As Ray moves into the foreground and turns to face Marty only his lower legs and the shovel are in frame. 
The shovel rises out of frame. 
CLOSE SHOT  RAY 
Both hands hold the shovel tensed over his shoulder. He stares down at Marty. A long pause. We hear a distant rumble. 
CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S FEET 
Inches away from Marty. Marty's hand slides forward and wraps around one of Ray's ankles. 
BACK TO RAY 
He shudders. He adjusts his grip on the shovel. 
The rumble grows louder. 
RAY'S FEET 
He jerks his foot away, breaking Marty's grasp. 
BACK TO RAY 
Looks up from Marty. The rumble grows louder. 
RAY'S POV 
Headlight beams, although not yet the headlights themselves, are visible a long way down the road. 
BACK TO RAY 
Staring down the road. Finally he lowers the shovel, walks back to the car and throws it viciously into the trunk, walks back up into the foreground and stoops down. 
CLOSE SHOT  MARTY 
As Ray grabs him under the armpits and starts dragging him back to the car. Just before Ray heaves him into the back seat, Marty coughs weakly. A fine spray of blood comes out with the cough. 
The engine rumble is quite loud now. 
MED SHOT  RAY  FROM ACROSS THE ROOF OF THE CAR 
As he slams the back door shut. He presses himself against the side of the car. Headlights glare over him; the truck roars by just behind him. 
EXT. OPEN FIELD

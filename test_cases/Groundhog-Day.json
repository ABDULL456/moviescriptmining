{"train": "GROUNDHOG DAY \nWritten by \nDanny Rubin \nSecond Revision by Harold Ramis January 7, 1992 \nFADE IN \nHIBERNATING GROUNDHOGS A family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow sleeping off the end of a long winter. \nROLL CREDITS AND THEME MUSIC \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING \nThe crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground, and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the early morning light. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME \nPHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall, talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME \nCREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape, flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME \nPhil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's pointing to -- a national weather map. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME \nThe country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio. \nWe zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING \nWe don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface. As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline blanket. GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his head in the door. \nHAWLEY Christ, what a pit. Phil\" The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley. It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman. \nPHIL \n(SLEEPY) What? \nHAWLEY It's February first, Phil. You know what tomorrow is? Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart, rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but clearly a guy with a lot of personality. \nPHIL (catching on) Oh, no! Not again. He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him. \nPHIL Forget it! I'm not going. \nINT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nHawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9 Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as WPGH - Pittsburgh. Phil ducks into the studio. \nINT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS \nHawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather stats up on a chart. \nPHIL Get away from me. I'm working. \nHAWLEY So what's the outlook? We gonna get that blizzard? Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed \"Phil's Phorecast\" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title. \nPHIL No way. All that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg. \nHe takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for privacy. \nPHIL \n(KINDLY) You didn't do anything wrong, Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of you. It's just that I don't have time for a real relationship right now. I told you that the first time we went out. \nSTEPHANIE (getting close) Everybody says that at the beginning of a relationship. \nPHIL (gently pushing her \nAWAY) I'm different. I really meant it! Things are really starting to move for me now. I ' m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of my life. I was just talking to the CBS guy about a network job. I want that. This is just the beginning for me. I can't waste any more time. \nSTEPHANIE Are you saying our relationship was a waste of time? \nPHIL Our relationship? We went out a total of four times! And only twice did anything happen. It was fun but I don't see that as a big commitment. \nSTEPHANIE (closing in again) I had our charts done. My astrologer says we're extremely compatible. There may even be some past lives involvement here. \nPHIL See? So we've already done this. Let's move on. Next case. \nSTEPHANIE You know what's wrong with you, Phil? You're selfish. You don't have time for anyone but yourself. \nPHIL That's what I ' m trying to tell you. You don't want to be with me. You can do better. Look, Stephanie, if I ever said or did anything to mislead you I'm sorry for that, but right now I have to do this groundhog thing and I don't have a handle on it yet. He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and puts on his jacket. \nPHIL (CONT.) I'll tell you what. I ' m going to do some serious thinking while I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay? He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her standing there with a malevolent look on her face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON \nA VAN marked \".Channel 9 Action News\" speeds along a two-lane highway through the winter landscape of West Central Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter. Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads \"Weathermen Like it Wet.\" \nPHIL (V.O.) (on his earphone) I'm on my way to Punxsutawney... (forced to repeat it, a little embarrassed) Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun? I think that all depends on you. \nINT. THE LEXUS - CONTINUOUS \nPhil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both hands. \nPHIL . . . . I thought maybe you could meet me up there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours....So I ' m supposed to spend the night in Punxsutawney all alo ne? Thanks. \nPhil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in. \nCUT TO: \nA SIGN \"Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the World Since 1887.\" Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his arm. The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts of town. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - LATER \nThe van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has been gaily festooned with banners and bunting. \nEXT . MOTEL - LATER The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: \"Groundhog Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99.\" The parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and everybody gets out. Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head. \nPHIL (calls out) Rita! I can't stay here. Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van. \nLARRY \n(MUTTERING) Prima donnas. \nRITA It's okay. I'll handle it. She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another call on his earphone. \nRITA What's the problem, Phil? \nPHIL I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago and I was miserable. It's like a minimum security prison. I'm not staying here. \nRITA You're not staying here. \nPHIL \n(BRIGHTENING) I ' m not? \nRITA No, Larry and I don't care but I thought you might, so I booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on Cherry Street. Here's the address. She hands him a card. \nPHIL \n(PLEASED) Great. That's great. That's the mark of a really good producer. Making the talent happy. \nRITA Whatever I can do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPhil enters the old library of the house now set up with a breakfast buffet. An old spinet piano stands in the corner. One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful of guests are seated around the room, eating. The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee. \nMRS. LANCASTER Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL (with mock civility) Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs. Lancaster. \nMRS. LANCASTER Would you like some coffee? \nPHIL I don't suppose it1 d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here. \nMRS. LANCASTER \n(BLANKLY) I don't really know -- \nPHIL Forget it. This '11 be fine. \nMRS. LANCASTER ( as she pours) I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities. \nPHIL My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast, high today in the low 30's, dropping to the low 20's tonight, but I'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as .Philadelphia. (off her surprised \nLOOK) You want to talk weather, you asked the right guy. He heads for the door. \n;MRS. LANCASTER \u00b7 \nOh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL Unfortunately yes. Phil exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nSipping at the steaming coffee, Phil manages to put on his coat and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street. \nEXT. MAIN STREET -KPUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS \nThere are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making the annual trek to see the groundhog. An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without taking any notice. \nMAN (O.C.) Hey, Phil! \nA big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing right up to him. There is something about this guy that makes us dislike him on sight. \nNED Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil looks at him vaguely. \nPHIL (at a loss) I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh-- \nNED My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heckrfire remember you. Well? Phil stares, trying to remember. \nNED Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned? Ned the Head. Come on, buddy. Case Western High? \nPHIL Ned? \nNED I see you clicking through that brain of yours. Click-click, c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing! Ned Ryerson, did the whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior ^year^ almost didn't graduate. Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went out with your sister Mary Pat a couple of times-- 'til you told me not to anymore. Well? \nPHIL \n(RESIGNED) Ned Ryerson. \nNED Bing! \nPHIL So what're you doing with yourself, Ned? \nNED Phil, I sell insurance. \nPHIL (sorry he asked) No kidding. \nNED Do you have life insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you do, I bet you could u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I got a feeling you don't have any. Am I right? \nPHIL You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk to you but I really have to-- Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint. \nNED That's okay. I'll walk with you. When I see an opportunity, I charge it, like a bull. Ned the Bull, that's me now. Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but I think it's all just a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single .premium life? That could be the ticket for you, buddy. God, it's good to see you! Hey, what're you doing for dinner? \nPHIL Dinner? Umm, I don't think that's going to work for me. As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs like a donkey. \nPHIL You don't have to rush off, you know. That storm is 'going to miss us completely. \nRITA Nice working with you, Phil. See you around. Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nPhil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just starting to fall. \nPHIL(V.O) (on the earphone) I'll call you after I see the network guy. I should be back there in a couple of hours...What?...1 can't hear you-- you're breaking up...Hello? Sabrina? \nINT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS \nPhil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates. The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield wipers. \nPHIL Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit! He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing moves. He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a parking lot. \nPHIL No. No! \nEXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS \nPhil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY \n\"J PATROLMEN. \nPHIL What's going on, Officer? \nPATROLMAN Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1 the road. Big accident up ahead. Blizzard movin1 in. \nPHIL What blizzard? A couple of flakes! An isolated phenomenon of nature. \nPATROLMAN Are you nuts? We got a major storm movin' in. \nPHIL No, no. All that moisture is going to miss us and hit Harrisburg. \nPATROLMAN Pal, you got that moisture on your head. \nPHIL But I have to get to Pittsburgh today! \nPATROLMAN Mister, the only place anybody's goin' on this road is back to Punxsutawney. Phil glowers at him and shivers. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GAS STATION - LATER \nPhil is on a pay phone. Snow is falling heavily outside. GAS STATION ATTENDANT is shovelling around the pumps. \nPHIL So all the long distance lines a re down? What about the sa tellite? Is it snowing in space?...But I have to call Pittsburgh...Isn't there some special line you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities?...Well, I'm both really. I'm a celebrity in an emergency. Can you patch me through on that line? \nThe door opens and Phil is blasted with frigid Arctic wind and blowing snow. The GAS STATION ATTENDANT enters the tiny office and in trying to squeeze past Phil accidentally bangs him on the head with his snow shovel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING \nPhil is at the bar in Punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the Pennsylvanian. He looks very bored, drinking a beer, unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named NANCY. \nPHIL You never saw me on TV-- on the news? \nNANCY I don't think so. What part of the news do you do? \nPHIL I ' m the White House correspondent for NBC news. \nNANCY Oh , I ' m so sure . \nPHIL Ask me anything? \nNANCY Okay, how big is the White House? \nPHIL Three bedrooms, two and a half baths. Looks much bigger than it , is. Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor. Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux, comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away. Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to Nancy . \nPHIL Good start. I ' m sure they'll be very happy. So what do you say? You want to play doggie obedience school with me? \nNANCY Thanks. I'll pass. She gets up to leave. \nPHIL Sit! Stay! He watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits somewhat unsteadily. \nRita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and gives up. \nRITA Larry! She charges off toward the cameras. In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to their cameras, dribbling on about how \"He could appear any second now.\" Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to Phil. Larry hurriedly sets up the camera. \nLARRY You want me to roll tape? \nRITA (to Phil) Are you going to get on your mark? \nPHIL No hurry. Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to their cameras and pointing towards the mound. \nLARRY \n(DESPERATELY) Everyone else is rolling! Rita looks helplessly at Phil. \nRITA I'm begging you, all right? Gould we please just do this? Phil glances down at his watch. \nPHIL Okay, let's do it. He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder. \nPHIL Roll tape. \nLARRY \n(MUMBLING) Prima donnas. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence. \nLARRY Rolling. \nPhil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this time it's a bit tentative. \nPHIL (to camera) We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again-- and you know what that means. Everybody's here on Gobbler's Knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to tell us just how much more of this we can expect. The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door, then opens it and retreats. Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental prediction, recalling the previous day. \nPHIL My forecast is we're going to see the groundhog peek its head out of its hole, look around a little bit, then he's going to come out, scamper over to this general area, look at the crowd for a second, make a little burping noise and run back into the ground. \nRITA (whispers to Larry) That's it. I'm going to kill him. Phil looks at his watch. \nPHIL O k ay ? And here we go-- Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right, steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool, directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole. Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil. Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog burrow. \nRITA \n(HISSES) Phil! Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before. \nBUSTER He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter. Again the crowd lets out a good-natured \"Awwwwww\" in disappointment. Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita. \nRITA (at a loss) For Channel 9 News, this is Rita Hanson in Punxsutawney. She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her finger across her throat. \nCUT TO: \n- LATER \nINT; PHIL'S ROOM Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call. \nPHIL (on the phone) I know there's a blizzard, but I have to get a call through to my doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a medical emergency. . . .No, don't give me the Punxsutawney Fire Department. When do you think the long distance lines will be working again?. . . But what if we don't have a tomorrow? We didn't have one today, my friend... Hello...Hello? He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and retreats back under the covers. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP - CLOCK The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, \"I Got You, Babe,\" just as it did the day before. \nINT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN \nPhil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap. \nDEEJAY Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there today! \nSIDEKICK It's cold out there everyday. What is this-- Miami Beach? Phil rushes out of the room. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHERRY STREET - LATER \nPhil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon buckets of paint, and a couple of big bags from a hardware store. \nINT. BED AND BREAKFAST - CONTINUOUS \nPhil enters and passes Mrs. Lancaster in the breakfast room. \nMRS. LANCASTER Painting something, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL I ' m conducting an experiment. \nPHIL (starting the ear) Seatbelts. Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts. Suddenly, Phil floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a parked car as he screeches around the corner. \nINT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS \nPhil is having a great time. Gus and Ralph are whooping it up like kids on a roller coaster. \nPHIL This is great, Ralph! \nRALPH Oh, hey, take a left! Phil passes the intersection. \nRALPH You missed it! \nPHIL No problem -- \nEXT . MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and a STOP sign and bounces back onto the street. A POLICE CAR parked in front of the hardware store pulls out and takes off after him. \nINT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS \nPhil swerves in and out of oncoming traffic. Gus is starting to look a little green. \nPHIL So many rules -- \nRALPH You can say that again. \nPHIL \"Don't do this--\" \nEXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS \nThe Buick demolishes a parked car. \nPHIL (V.O.) \"Don't do that -- \" He mows down a row of parking meters. \nPOLICE CAR It comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the Buick \nINT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS \nRalph hears the siren and looks back at the police car. \nAll right! Try and stop us, you mothers ! \nPHIL No more rules! \nRALPH No more rules! \nEXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS \nA second police car joins the chase. \nRALPH (looking back) That's two! \nPHIL Having a good time? \nRALPH I'm having a great time! Phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour. Gus is looking even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car. \nGUS Hey, uh -- \nPHIL Phil. \nGUS Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog. \nPHIL Right. \nGUS Hey, Phil? How're we going to get out of this? \nTHEIR POV - THE INTERSECTION AHEAD Two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways, completely blocking the road. Officers stand in the roadway, motioning for Phil to stop. \nPHIL \n(CALMLY) Gus, you're just going to have to trust me on this one. He tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus's eyes go wide with terror. The police dive out of the way. \nPHIL AND RALPH Yahooooo! \nTHEIR POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD The Buick crashes head on into one of the police cars. \nBLACK OUT: \nC LOSE UP - CLOCK The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing \"I Got You, Babe.\" Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. He is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the same as before. He hops out of bed and quickly examines himself for signs of physical injury. Nothing. The music ends and the two deej ays come on. \nNANCY Is this some kind of come-on? \nPHIL I'm not really sure. We'll have to see. Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINER - LATER THAT MORNING \nPhil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc. Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs himself with pastry. \nRITA Is this some new fad diet? Don't you worry about cholesterol? Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate eclair. \nPHIL I don't worry about anything anymore. \nRITA What makes you so special? Everybody worries about something. \nPHIL That's exactly what makes me so special. He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head. \nPHIL (with his mouth full) What? \nRITA \"The wretch, concentered all in self, Living, shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.\" Sir Walter Scott. \nPHIL (stares at her for a long moment) \"There was a young man from Na n t uc k e t-- \" \nRITA That's really funny. When are you going to grow up, Phil? \nPHIL At this rate-- never. (he pulls out a pack of \nCIGARETTES) Okay if I smoke? Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette. \nRITA You really do have a death wish, don't you? \nPHIL Just the opposite, Rita. I have a life wish. I'm just trying to enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the little things. Don't you ever just want to cut loose and go wild? \nRITA I wouldn't even know what it means to go wild. \nPHIL Yeah, well, that's where I come in. Going wild is one of my specialties. Last night I got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car. \nRITA \n(DISBELIEVING) Oh, really? You look pretty good this morning. \nPHIL That's my point. I know you won't believe me, but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn't matter one bit. Absolutely no consequences. Complete and total freedom. \nRITA And how. . , do we manage that? \nPHIL You leave that to me. Why don't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day? You never make it through that blizzard anyway. Larry enters the diner and spots them. \nRITA I'll take my chances with the -weather. But you have a good time. \nPHIL Don't worry. I plan to. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - NEXT MORNING \nPhil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot she was in the day before. \nPHIL Nancy? Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically. \nPHIL Nancy, right? \nNANCY I'm sorry, I-- \nPHIL Nancy Taylor? Lincoln High? I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's English class. \nNANCY T h at -- \nPHIL Phil Connors. \nNANCY --is amazing! \nPHIL You don't remember me, do you? \nNANCY I don't-- sure, I think-- \nPHIL We used to shoot spit balls-- \nPhil kisses her on the lips and walks off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PENN BANK AND TRUST - DAY \nTwo harmless-looking old GUARDS are calmly loading bags of cash into an armored car parked in front of a local bank. Suddenly Phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a Batman style cape, his face completely hidden by a ski mask. \nPHIL \n(SHOUTS) All right, freeze!! Drop your guns J! The guards stand there frozen with terror. \nPHIL You guys ever been held up before? (they shake their \nHEADS) It's kind of exciting, isn't it? \nFIRST GUARD \n(FRIGHTENED) I guess so. Something to tell the kids about. \nPHIL Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil. He raises the mask and shows his face. \nFIRST GUARD Herman. \nS E C O N D GUARD Felix. \nPHIL (shaking their hands) Herman and Felix. Okay. Take it easy, boys. And thanks. The frightened guards watch as Phil makes off with two large satchels of cash. \nCUT TO: \nINT. USED CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY \nPhil pats the hood of a used BMW 850 sports car as a SALESMAN stands by beaming. Phil is wearing a full Steelers football uniform complete with shoulder pads. \nSALESMAN A real beauty, huh. We picked it u p at a-- \nPHIL I'll take it. How much? \nSALESMAN Well, the sticker says $62,999 bu t if you want-- \nPHIL I'll tell you what. I'll give you $70,000 if you just knock off the car salesman stuff and let me get out of here with my car. The Salesman gawks as Phil opens his briefcase and starts counting out stacks of bills. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PUNXSUTAWNEY - DAY \nFrom a high angle, we see the BMW tearing around the streets of the town as if running a Grand Prix road race. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nThe BMW comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie theater and the door opens. A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver spurs hits the pavement first; then we PAN UP to see Phil emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit with real six-guns on his hips. A very trashy-looking girl, LARAINE, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French maid. \nLARAINE (very self-conscious) I thought we were going to a costume party. \nPHIL Yeah, we are, we are. But first I have this movie theater fantasy I want to talk to you about. He escorts her into the theater. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TATTOO PARLOR - ANOTHER DAY \nPhil is lying on the table, getting elaborately tattooed. Rita walks by, looks in the window and is shocked to see Phil there. Phil waves at her and points to the colorful new heart pierced by a bloody dagger being tattooed on his arm. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BIKER BAR - NIGHT \nWe pan down the line of ROUGH TRADE PATRONS to. Phil, dressed all in black leathers, both arms heavily tattooed, looking like Sid Viscious on crack. He takes off his hat to reveal red, white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull. A slut named ANGIE and another overweight, not very pretty MADONNA WANNA-BE, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on to him, practically licking his ears. Angie pops a couple of mystery pills into his mouth. Phil washes them down with a shot and a beer. \nI \nCUT TO: \nINT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nIt looks like ;outtakes from Fellini's \"Satyricon.\" Heavy metal is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off whatever hit them. Someone is knocking loudly on the door, shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes against the door. Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand. \nPHIL You'd what? \nRITA I don't know what. \nPHIL Then maybe you'd like me? She stares hard at him. \nRITA I don't know. It's sort of like the way I feel about UFO's. I'd have to see it to believe it. Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table. \nLARRY (to Rita) You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather. \nRITA Yeah, I'll be right out, Larry. Larry scowls at Phil and exits. \nPHIL (to Rita) Why don't you stay for a while? The road's going to be closed anyway. Do you really want to be stuck in the van with Larry for three hours? \nRITA I've got to get back. I'll see you later. Phil watches Rita exit. \nPHIL'S POV Rita gets in the news van and drives off with Larry. Phil stares out the window, more\" determined than ever to win her over. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER\u00b7S KNOB - ANOTHER DAY \nPhil is wrapping up his groundhog report. \nPHIL Well, you heard it right from the groundhog's mouth. Bundle up good, 'cause it's going to be a long winter-- at least in Punxsutawney. Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors. Larry stops tape. \nRITA That was great. How did you know \nTHE-- \nPHIL \n(PREOCCUPIED) I have to go now. There's something I have to do. \nPhil runs off without another word of explanation. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE NEWS VAN - LATER \nPhil has the hood open and is doing something to the engine. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BERGHOF RESTAURANT - LATER \nRita is sitting at the bar in the town's best restaurant, a good chophouse with Black Forest decor and waitresses dressed in dirndl skirts and aprons. Phil enters and sits down next to her. \nPHIL (acting surprised) Oh, hi, Rita. You still here? \nRITA \n(GLUM) The van won't start. Larry's working on it. \nPHIL \n(INNOCENT) Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a drink? \nRITA Okay. \nPHIL (to the bartender) Jack Daniels. \nBARTENDER For you, miss? \nRITA Tequila,with lime. Gold, if you've got it.

Larry's working on it. \nPHIL Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a drink? \nPHIL (making mental note) No white chocolate. \nRITA There's something so familiar about this. Do you ever have deja vu? Phil smiles. Then Larry enters. \nLARRY (irate, to Rita) I don't believe it. Someone bought every distributor cap in this town. We're going to be stuck here all night1 Over Phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, \"I Can't Get Started With You\". \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BERGHOF RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe music continues over Rita and Phil on the small dance floor. They dance, close, dreamy, romantic. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThere is a light snow falling. Phil and Rita are making a little snowman. Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old fashioned, wholesome. A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little gang of friends. A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT . CHERRY STREET INN - NIGHT Phil and Rita are walking slowly, very close. \nPHIL What? \nRITA I ' m just amazed. And I'm not easily amazed. \nPHIL About what? \nRITA How you can start a day with one kind of expectation and end up so completely different. \nPHIL Do you like how this day is turning out? \nRITA Yes. I like it very much. They stop dn front of Phil's hotel. She turns to him. \nRITA You could never have planned a day like this, but it couldn't have been more perfect. \nPHIL You're wrong. I've been planning this day for weeks. Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him. \\ They enter the bed and breakfast inn. \nINT. VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS \nRita hugs him again and starts to exit. \nRITA Thanks. See you tomorrow. \nPHIL Tomorrow? Wait, aren't you going to come up to my room for a while? \nRITA (very reluctant) I don't know, Phil-- \nPHIL No\u00b7reason to end a perfect day. \nRITA \n(DECIDING) Well-- we better not. \nPHIL No, you should. The, uh, the poetry! I've got some books, Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could l ig ht a fire-- \nRITA Thanks, but -- \nPHIL (seeing it all slip \nAWAY) Please come, Rita. It'll be -- \nRITA \n(DEFINITE) Phil, I'm tired. We can be together tomorrow. \nPHIL (getting desperate) But there is no tomorrow for me! \nRITA \n(ADAMANT) Let's not ruin it, Phil. There's no way I ' m sleeping with you tonight. \nPHIL Why not? Rita, I love you! \nRITA You don't even know me! \nPHIL (grabs her hand) Please! You have to! Rita shakes loose from his grasp. \nBUSTER (securing the cage) There, little fella. The other official looks up and sees Phil walking toward them like a zombie. \nOTHER OFFICIAL Hi, there, mister. Something I can do you for? Without a word, Phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup and starts it up . \nFIRST OFFICIAL Hey! What 're you -- ! Phil drives off in Buster's truck. Rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs back toward the knob. \nRITA \n(SHOUTS) Larry! Buster and his aides race for another car parked nearby. \nBUSTER Jake! Call the police, and get the word out. Somebody kidnapped Phil. We're going after him. Come on, Tommy! They jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off after the pickup. Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly. \nRITA Let's go! Phil just snatched the groundhog! Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the gear. \nLARRY \n(MUTTERS) Probably some kind of gerbil deal. Pervert. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOCAL ROAD - MINUTES LATER \nPhil comes tearing around a slippery curve, followed by Buster in his car, and close behind him, a contingent of police cars and the Channel 9 news van. \nINT. PICKUP - CONTINUOUS \nPhil looks at the groundhog on the seat next to him, then punches the gas as he turns up a mountain drive. \nPHIL Coming to the end of the trail, Phil. Then we're going out in a blaze of glory. \nINT. BUSTER'S CAR - SAME TIME \nBuster pursues Phil with relentless determination. \nBUSTER Nobody takes my groundhog and gets away with it. \nINT. THE NEWS VAN - SAME TIME \nRita is driving. Larry is hooking up the camera. \nRITA (very upset) What is he doing? What can he be thinking? He must1 ve just -- snapped. Larry squeezes into the passenger seat with the camera mounted on his shoulder . \nLARRY This oughta be good. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nThe cars chase the pickup to the top of the mountain. \nINT. BUSTER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nBUSTER Okay! I know this road. There's no way off ' cept the way we come up. \nFIRST OFFICIAL All right! We got him now. \nEXT. LOGGER'S LEAP - CONTINUOUS \nThe pickup is losing its lead over the pursuers as it nears the sharp mountain cliff. \nINT. THE PICKUP - SAME TIME \nPhil looks in his rearview mirror at the cars chasing him. He glances down at the groundhog. He takes a breath. \nPHIL Okay, pal. It's showtime. Phil hits the gas. \nINT. THE NEWS VAN - SAME TIME \nLarry is taping as Rita comes around the curve just in time to see the pickup truck speeding toward the cliff. Rita hits the brakes and watches in horror. \nRITA \nPHIL! NO! \nEXT. LOGGER'S LEAP - CONTINUOUS \nThe pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over the edge of the cliff. The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it begins its SLOW MOTION descent, falling ever so gracefully until it impacts on the granite rock face far below. BIG EXPLOSION. BIG FIREBALL. FLAMING WRECKAGE. Then a small click, followed by \"I Got You, Babe.\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nRITA Why are you telling me this? \nWAITER \n(SHRUGS) Because some people like blueberry waffles. \nRITA (to the waiter) No t you-- him. \nPHIL Because I want you to believe in me. \nRITA You're not a god, Phil. Take my word for it. This is twelve years of Catholic school talking. \nWAITER I could come back if you're not ready. \nPHIL How do you know I'm not a god? \nRITA Please. \nPHIL How do you know? \nRITA Because it's not possible. \nWAITER I'll come back. The /waiter turns to leave. \nPHIL Hey, Billy! The waiter turns back. \nPHIL This is Bill. He's been a waiter for three years because he left Penn State and had to find work. He likes the town, he paints toy soldiers, and he's gay. \nWAITER I am notl Phil grabs an astonished Rita and pulls her over to the next table. \nRITA What are you doing? \nPHIL This is Doris Kleiser and her fiance Fred. \nDORIS Do I know you? \nPHIL They're supposed to get married tonight but Doris is having second thoughts. \nFRED What! Doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded. Rita is a little embarrassed. \nRITA Lovely ring. \nDORIS Thanks. \nPhil drags Rita to the counter. \nPHIL This is Ralph. Say \"Hi,\" Rita. Rita flashes a quick smile. \nRALPH Don't believe I've had the-- \nPHIL Ralph hates his life here and wants to drive around town smashing into policemen. \nRALPH Well, who don't? \nRITA This is some kind of trick. \nPHIL Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the real God cheats, too. Maybe God isn't omnipotent-- he's just had a lot of practice. \nRITA How about that guy? \nPHIL Tom. Worked in the coal mine \u00b7til they shut it down. \nRITA Her? \nPHIL ' Nancy. Went to Lincoln High School in Pittsburgh. Takes herself out to lunch once a week. Rita is getting very bewildered. From their reactions she can see that Phil is right about each and every one of them. \nRITA How do you know these people! \nPHIL I told you the truth. In five seconds there's going to be a grease fire in the kitchen. Five, four-- \nRITA This is nuts. \nPHIL --three, two, one. Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the service window. Everyone in the diner is now staring at them \nRITA (trying to puzzle it \nOUT) Okay, enough. Let's just sit down and think for a second. (they sit) What do you know about me, Phil? Do you know me, too? Phil takes a long pause. \n(BLUSHING) Phil! It's not funny. She catches up to him. Phil turns to her. \nPHIL You weren't interested. \nRITA \n(RELIEVED) Okay. She begins walking again. \nRITA Not that it would've been so awful. \nPHIL I understand. \nRITA I just had to know whether to smack you or not. \nPHIL You did. \nRITA Good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nPhil and Rita are sitting on a park bench. \nPHIL So do you believe any of this? \nRITA I don't know. I don't know how else you could know so much. Maybe it is really happening. \nPHIL I used to try to stay up all night sometimes. I thought if I could stay conscious I could figure out what was going on, or at least hang onto something from the day before. But I gave up on that a long time ago. Rita looks at him with compassion. \nRITA It sounds so-- lonely. \nPHIL (trying to shrug it \nOFF) It's not that bad. You get used to it. Rita comes to a decision. \nRITA Maybe I should spend the rest of the day with you-- as an objective witness. Just to see what happens. Okay? \nPHIL Yeah, sure. That'd be okay. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nA hat is lying on Phil's bed. A playing card flies past. A second playing card sails right into the hat. Another playing card sails past, missing. Another playing card sails right in Phil and Rita are tossing cards. Rita is missing. Phil is hitting. \nPHIL It's not in the wrist so much as the fingers. Be the hat. \nRITA It would take me a year to get good at this. \nPHIL Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five hours a day. \nRITA Is this what you do with eternity? \nPHIL Now you know. It's like waiting for a bus that never comes . You should see me play pool -- and bowling, juggling, hacky sack. I can ride a unicycle. There ' s a knock on the door . \nPHIL I'll get it! Phil jumps for the door and opens it. The PIZZA GUY is there. \nPHIL Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the delivery charge, right? \nPIZZA GUY U h hh h -- Phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door. \nRITA (opening the pizza box) MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My favorite . \nPHIL Of course. I told you, I know everything . \nRITA (taking a bite of \nPIZZA) I don ' t think I ' d want to know everything that ' s going to happen. I like to be surprised. \nPHIL That's not the worst part. \nRITA What's the worst part? \nPHIL The worst part is starting over everyday. Tomorrow you won't remember any of this. You'll go back to treating me like a complete jerk -- \nRITA No -- \nPHIL I was saying that the cow was eventually returned to it's rightful owner. \nRITA (drifting off) Really? \nPHIL That's right. He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. Then he carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to her. \nPHIL What I was going to say was, I think you're the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most wonderful girl I ever met in my life. She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep. \nPHIL Shhhh. That's good. (satisfied she's still \nASLEEP) I could never tell you this, but from the first minute I looked at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever. iEverytime I -saw you around the station, I thought my heart was going to explode. I used to dream about us being together. In my dream you loved me as much as I loved you and we didn't have to say anything but I knew you understood everything. She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep sleep. \nPHIL I know a guy like me could never deserve to have someone like you, but if I did, I swear I would love you for the rest of my life. Rita opens her eyes. \nRITA \n(HALF-ASLEEP) Did you say something? \nPHIL Good-night, Rita. He kisses her gently on the forehead. \nRITA Good-night, Phil. \nC LOSE UP - THE CLOCK The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing. Phil wakes up alone in bed. He lies there for a moment then leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the shower. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN \nRita and Larry are in the packed press area, beginning to set up the equipment. Phil arrives, carrying two cups of coffee. \nPHIL Rita? She looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the night before. \nRITA Oh, hi, Phil. \nPHIL Thought you might like some-- He hands her the coffee. \nRITA Thanks! \nPHIL Careful, it's hot. Larry? He hands Larry a cup. \nLARRY (surprised, mutters) Yeah, great. \nRITA We're just setting up. \nPHIL You know, I bumped into Buster Greene, he kind of runs this thing, and he tipped me off that we might get a better shot over there. \nRITA Really? \nPHIL I mean, maybe we should go for it. What do you think? \nRITA Sounds good to me. Larry? \nLARRY Sure, why not? \nRITA All right. Thanks, Phil. Good work. She reaches for an equipment case. \nPHIL I'll get that. Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear. \nPHIL (to Larry) You and I never talk, Larry. You got kids? Larry looks suspicious. Rita looks on, reevaluating Phil. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

From my freshman Philosophy course, I guess. They both laugh. Then she looks at him for a long moment and grins. \nPHIL What? \nRITA Nothing. I just can't believe you're such a fine sculptor. Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up. \nPHIL I gotta go. \nRITA Where do you have to go in Punxsutawney? \nPHIL I got piano and then drums. \nRITA Here? \nPHIL Come on, I'll drop you off. They exit. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET '\u00b7\u00b7-.. LATER \nPhil drops Rita off and watches as she crosses the street to Larry who is waiting on the other side. Across the street, Rita takes a wistful glance toward Phil, then gets in the news van and drives off. Phil gets out of the car and starts walking, but finds himself face to face with Ned Ryerson. \nNED Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! \nPHIL Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don't believe it. I've missed you so much. \nPhil gives Ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an uncomfortably long time, actually giving Ned a hickey on the neck. Ned goes into homophobic shock. \nNED Uh, I gotta get going. Nice to see you, Phil. He hurries off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARY'S HOUSE - DAY \nPhil is sitting on the piano bench with Mary, playing pretty well. Mary is astonished. \nMARY How long have you been studying, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL One day. I'm gifted. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nPhil is walking down the street. He glances down the alley as he passes, stops, walks back and enters the alley. The OLD BUM that Phil never noticed before is lying there, huddled against a wall. Phil goes to help him. \nPHIL Hey, mister. Hey. Come on, let's get you somewhere warm. The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his eyes. \nPHIL (helps the old man to his feet) There you go. Phil practically carries him out of the alley. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nA nurse approaches Phil. \nNURSE You the one brought in the old man? \nPHIL How is he? \nNURSE He passed away just now. Phil pauses for a long moment. \nPHIL What'd he die of? \nNURSE \n(SHRUGS) He was just old. It was his time. \nPHIL I want to see his chart. Excuse me. Phil brushes past her and makes for the big double doors leading to triage. \nNURSE Sir, you can't -- (hurrying after him) Look! Some people just die! \nPHIL Not on my watch. \nCUT TO: \nPHIL If you're going to eat steak, get better teeth, will you? Enjoy the rest of your lunch, gents. He exits. \nJERRY Wow. Who was that guy? Phil gets to the door and finds Rita standing there, looking at him in awe. \nPHIL Rita! \n.RITA \n(CONFRONTING) -Okay, hold it right there. I want to know what' s going on and I want to know right now. \nPHIL I'm sorry, I'm really pressed right now. Meet me outside the hospital about 5:00 and we'll talk about it. \nRITA The hospital?

Right! A dog with a big head. \nKIDS Noooo! The kids attack Phil. Lots of rolling around on the bed. Rita watches, completely enthralled. Finally, Phil extricates himself and exits to find Rita waiting. \nRITA All right, now what's going on? \nPHIL (taking her arm) Come on. We have to hurry. \nCUT TO: \nEXT . RESIDENTIAL STREET - A LITTLE LATER Phil rushes down the sidewalk with Rita close behind him. He stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a YOUNG BOY falls out of the tree and into his arms, knocking him to the ground. The kid runs off unhurt as Phil gets back to his feet and brushes himself off. \nPHIL (to Rita) That little bastard has never thanked me once . I ought to j ust let him fall. Teach him a lesson. \nRITA Phil, this is too -- I must be dreaming. \nPHIL Yeah, you and me both. Come on, We're almost done. \nCUT TO: \nPHIL Congratulations.

Fred grabs the tickets. \nFRED Wrestlemania! No way! No way! Doris throws herself on Phil. \nDORIS How did you know? \nFRED We're like going to be in Pittsburgh anyway. \nPHIL I don't know.

You rush from one person to the next in a town you only visit once a year, you know everything before it happens , and you -- - I don ' t know , you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s leading citizen. The band finishes a set. The guests stop dancing and head for the refreshments. Phil and Rita are left alone for the moment \nPHIL What do you want to know? \nRITA Who are you? \nPHIL I really don't know. \nRITA No, there's something going on with you. \nPHIL Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney on February second -- every day. It's supernatural. I don't even try to explain it anymore. So, I live each day as if it's the only day I've got. Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only good, true things. \nRITA That's pretty amazing. \" \nPHIL You want to know what's really amazing? I've been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. I dream of you every night of my life. You've been my constant weapon against total despair, and just knowing you exist has kept me alive. How's that? Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing anybody has ever said to anybody. Mary the piano teacher notices Phil. \nMARY Phil! (to her friend) This is the guy. \nPHIL Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one of Punxsey's finest musicians. \n\u00b7MARY Give me a break. You should talk. Why don't you play something? \nPHIL N o , I-- \nMARY Please. \nFRED Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it. Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs. Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears. Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp. Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in, everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance. An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up a storm. \nLEO That's a great guy you've got there. Doctor Connors fixed my back, you know. \nRITA Do ctor Connors? \nRit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano. \nCUT TO: \nEXT . STREET - NIGHT \nIt is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita. She looks like an angel. \nPHIL Wait! Don't move! \nPhil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously, joyously, then rolling it into a large ball. \nRITA Making a snow man? I'll help. \nPHIL No, stay there. Stand right th ere. \nPh il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nPhil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work. \nRITA Can I look? \nPHIL O kay, look. \nIt is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage. \n", "test1_input": "CHUBBY MAN Morning. \nPHIL Morning. \nCHUBBY MAN Think it'll be an early Spring? \nPHIL (stops, irritated) Didn't we do this yesterday? \nCHUBBY MAN \n(INTIMIDATED) I don't know what you mean. Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into his eyes. \nPHIL Don't mess with me, pork chop. What day is this? \nCHUBBY MAN \n(TERRIFIED) Febr uary second--Groundhog Day! Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the poor man. \nPHIL Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad day. Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted. \nCHUBBY MAN (to himself) I'll say. \nINT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPhil enters the old library of the house and finds everything exactly as it was the day before. Mrs. Lancaster spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee. \nMRS. LANCASTER Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL (completely confused) D i d I? I don't know-- \nMRS. LANCASTER Would you like some coffee? \nPHIL Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a little strange. \nMRS. LANCASTER ( as she pours) I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities. \nPHIL Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs. Lancaster? \nMRS. LANCASTER Is that the Italian dessert with the brandy and the chocolate mousse? \nPHIL No, that's spaghetti. Never mind. He heads for the door, still in a daze. \nMRS. LANCASTER Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL \n(VAGUELY) I don't know. I don't think so. I'll tell you after I wake up. Phil exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nPhil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY. \nPHIL Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's everybody going? \nPASSERBY To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day! The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open- mouthed.

MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS \nPhil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront. \nNED RYERSON (O.C.) Hey, Phil! Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude. \nNED Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil just stares at him and keeps walking. \nNED My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heck-fire remember you. Well? \nPHIL Ned Ryerson? \nNED Bing! First shot right out of the box. So how's it going, ol' buddy? \nPHIL To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m not feeling real well. Could you excuse me? \nNED Now it's funny you should mention your health 'cause you'll never guess what I do. \nPHIL (very distressed and desperate to get away from this guy) Do you sell insurance, Ned? \n", "test1_true": "PHIL (really annoyed now) Did I say \"fuck off, \" Ned? I can't talk to you right now. He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep, slushy puddle he stepped in the day before. \nNED \n(BRAYING) Hey, look .out for that first v step. It's a doozyi Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off toward Gobbler's Knob. \nCUT TO: \nEXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - DAWN The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment. In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry, when she spots Phil heading into the crowd. \nRITA Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil! Over here! Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of the Knob, gesturing for her to follow. Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair mussed. \nRITA Where ' ve you been? \nPHIL (nervous, sweat ing) I've got to talk to you. I think I'm losing my mind. \n. RITA I know you're losing it. What are you doing over here? The camera's over there. \nPHIL Slap me, Rita. \nRITA What is this? \nPHIL \n(INSISTENT) Just slap me-- hard. She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek. \nPHIL I said hardl \n. . .. ... .RITA . I can't! \nPHIL Do it! Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard. \nPHIL (his cheek smarting) Better. Almost too hard, Rita. \nRITA Are you drunk? \nPHIL No, drunk is more fun. Can I be serious with you for a minute? \nRITA I don't know. Can you? \nPHIL Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m having a problem-- no, I may be having a problem. \nRITA What are you trying to say? \nPHIL I'm trying to say that if I was having a problem, just hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know that you're someone I could count on in a crisis. \nRITA \n(WORRIED) What did you do last night? The crowd begins to hush. \nLARRY We better get started. We're going to miss it. \nPHIL Were not going to miss it. (indicating the other \nREPORTERS) They're going to miss it. \nRITA \n(EMPHATIC) Phil. We've been out here for an hour. We're cold and tired. Let's just get this and get out of here. \nPHIL Okay, put it here. \nRITA What? \nPHIL Put the camera here . Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all of the other cameras are set up . \nRITA Phil , there is no tomorrow on this one. It's Groundhog Day. \nPHIL We were in the wrong spot yesterday . \nRITA \n(IRKED) W ha t? Yesterday? What are you talking about? \nPHIL Just trust me. Put the camera here . \n", "test2_input": "PHIL No, really. It's like today never happened. I shaved my head last night, today its all grown back. I could probably cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop! They'd grow back. Just like a starfish. I probably don't even have to floss? \nRITA I'm wracking my brain, but I can't even begin to imagine why you'd make up something like this. \nPHIL 'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm asking for your help. Rita looks at him for a long moment. \nRITA Okay, I'll bite. What do you want me to do? \nPHIL The truth? I'd 1ike you to spend the next 24 hours with me and don't leave my side for a second. \nRITA I see. You know, Phil, you can charm all the little P.A.'s at the station, all the secretaries, and even some of the weekend a nchors, but not me-- not in a thousand years. \nPHIL Wa it a second-- \nRITA Not if I was dying and your breath was the only cure; not if having your child was the only way to preserve the human race. Just get it out of your head because it is NOT GOING TO \nHAPPEN! \nPHIL So much for the truth. Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table. \nLARRY (to Rita) You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather. \nRITA Yeah, , I ' m . ready, Larry. \n(EXITING) Good luck, Phil. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT X-rays of Phil's skull are slapped up onto a light box. \nINT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY \nPhil is having his head examined by a NEUROLOGIST. \nNEUROLOGIST No spots, no tumors, no lesions, no clots, no aneurisms. Everything looks fine and dandy to me, Mr. Connors. Have you considered psychiatric help? \nCUT TO: \nINT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nPunxsutawney's only PSYCHOLOGIST is a marriage and family counselor at the local Lutheran church. His appearance and manner indicate he may have some serious problems of his own. \nPSYCHOLOGIST (not too confident) That's kind of an unusual problem, Mr. Connors. Most of my work is with couples and families. Phil is lying on a couch. His head is completely shaved. \nPHIL Yeah, but you're still a psychologist. You must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Sort of, I guess. Abnormal Psychology. \nPHIL So based on that what would you say? \nPSYCHOLOGIST \n(HESITANT) I ' d say that maybe you're -- I don't know -- a little delusional. \nPHIL You're saying this thing is not really happening to me? \nPSYCHOLOGIST Uh-huh. \nPHIL Then how do I know this conversation is really happening? \nPSYCHOLOGIST I guess you don't. \nPHIL Then forget about me paying you. A discreet little alarm sounds. \nPSYCHOLOGIST \n(RELIEVED) I'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr. Connors. \nPHIL Wait! Are you saying I'm crazy? \nPSYCHOLOGIST (humoring him) Not necessarily. If it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible. How's tomorrow for you? Phil glowers at him. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - A MODEL OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM A SCIENTIST in a white lab coat is holding up the model. Phil looks on with interest. \nSCIENTIST \n", "test2_true": "PHIL You think that's a realistic possibility? A paper airplane sails past his head, accompanied by a noisy outburst of juvenile laughter. We pull back to REVEAL: \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nTwenty-five eighth-graders running amok. \nSCIENTIST \n(STERNLY) All right! I think someone may just need a little visit to the Assistant Principal's office! Get back in your seats. The bell has not rung yet. The kids sit back down, but keep up their noisy chatter. \nSCIENTIST (to Phil) Well, I ' m speaking purely hypothetically. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - LATER \nPhil is walking toward the exit when he passes a first grade classroom. The door is open and the TEACHER is discussing a story with the class. \nTEACH ER So the princess picked up the frog and kissed him. Phil stops outside the door to listen. \nINT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTEACHER Now who can tell me what happened when the princess kissed the frog. \nLITTLE BOY Her lips got slimed! The whole class erupts in giggles and shrieks. \nT EACHER Okay, come on now. What happened when she kissed the frog? \nLITTLE GIRL The princess kissed the frog and the spell got broke and he turned into a handsome prince and they got married and lived happily ever after. \nTEACHER That's right. \nINT. THE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nPhil is leaning against the wall listening. There is something very arresting about the fairy tale, but finally he just shakes his head and exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEW DROP INN - LATER THAT NIGHT \nPhil is at a bar getting drunk with two local blue-collar workers, GUS and PHIL. \nPHIL Gus, what would you do if there was no tomorrow? \nGUS You mean like if the world was gonna end? \nPHIL No, I mean like if it was never going to end. If everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you couldn't get out and nothing you did mattered? \nGUS You're right. Everyday is the same, I can't get out of here and nothin' I do matters. \nV RALPH No, he's askin1 you a question, ya idiot. \nGUS What was the question? \nRALPH What if nothing mattered?! Jeez, I know what I'd do. I ' d j ust spend all my time drivin' fast, gettin1 loaded and gettin' laid. That's it. \nPHIL That's it. It just doesn't get any better than this, does it? Good friends, good conversation and quality brew. Drink up, boys. They salute each other and drink. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE STREET - LATER \nPhil, Gus and Ralph approach Ralph's big, black, old Buick convertible parked outside the bar. They are even drunker than they were before. \nRALPH (fumbling with his \nCARKEYS) Where you stayin', Phil? We'll drop you off. \nPHIL Hey, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Give me your keys. \nHe's as wasted as they are, but Ralph hands over his keys without a fight. \nRALPH Thanks , man . \nPHIL It's nothing. Get in. They all pile into the front seat with Phil at the wheel. \n", "test3_input": "SECOND HUSTLER So what's your name? \nPHIL They call me-- Punxsutawney Phil. \nSECOND HUSTLER Punxsutawney Phil? Like the groundhog. \nPHIL Yeah, like the groundhog. Phil sinks another one. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN \nThe crowd is waiting expectantly for the groundhog to appear Phil is a wreck, squatting unprofessionally in front of the camera. \nPHIL \n(CYNICALLY) This is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to civilization. With one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest control agencies, a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania, Mecca to thousands of people who, if they hated the winter so damned much, why don't they move to Florida, anyway? \nLarry and Rita look on, incredulous. \n. CUT TO: \nCLOSE UP - TV SET The program JEOPARDY! is playing. \nALEX TREBECK (on TV) Nobel prize-winning co- discoverers of the DNA molecule. \nPHIL (O.C.) Who are Watson and Crick. \nCONTESTANT (on TV) Who are Watson and Crick? \nALEX (on TV) Correct. There is a cheering from a small group of people off-screen. \nINT. PARLOR - CONTINUOUS \nPhil is sitting in his bathrobe in a big lounge chair in the parlor of his hotel. Mrs. Lancaster, and other guests watch his performance, awed by his \"intellect.\" \nALEX (on TV) Twin brother and sister Sebastian and Olivia create confusion in this Shakespearean comedy. \nPHIL What is \"Twelfth Night.\" \nCONTESTANT (on TV) What is \"Twelfth Night?\" \nALEX (on TV) Correct. More cheering from the small group. \nCONTESTANT (on TV) I'll take New Jersey for eight hundred, Alex. \nALEX (on TV) And the answer is-- an audio daily double. \nPHIL Count Basie. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nPhil is walking through town, still dressed only in his pajamas and overcoat, counting the sidewalk cracks, taking giants steps from one to the next. He looks crazy. \nPHIL Two thousand six hundred and s e ve n ty -o n e-- (takes another step) two thousand six hundred and se v en t y -t w o -- (another step) two thousand six hundred and seventy-thr-ee-^- A woman passes walking her dog. \nPHIL Hey, pick up after your dog! \nDOG WALKER He hasn't done anything. \nPHIL He's going to! \n(POINTING) There and there. And there! Phil continues walking, counting the sidewalk cracks. THREE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS notice Phil and walk along, matching him step for step. \nIPHIL Two thousand six hundred and seventy-four, two thousand six hundred and seventy-five, two \nTHOUSAND'-- \nJOEY Five million eight hundred-- \nPHIL S i x hundred-- \nMIKE AND SUE Ninety, twenty, four, six, fifty-- \nPHIL Two thousand, four hundred-- \n", "test3_true": "COP You got a problem, buddy? \nPHIL (out of control) Yeah, I got a problem, buddy! I can't stand this place anymore! I can't stand this street and I can't stand the fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad weather and the \"quaint\" little shops and most of all, I can't stand anything-- ANYTHING-- with a groundhog on it. He rips a groundhog patch off the cop's jacket sleeve. \nCOP \n(CALMLY) Okay. Then let's see what we can do about getting you out of here. You got a name? \nPHIL (eyes downcast) Phil. \nCOP Phil. Like the groundhog! Phil turns to the cop like a rabid dog, ready to strike. \nPHIL Yeah, like the-- (he stops as if struck) --groundhog. Some big new idea has formed in his mind. \nCUT TO: \nEXT . GOBBLER'S KNOB - EARLY MORNING Rita is looking at Phil as Larry videotapes his report. \nLARRY (turning to Rita) The guy's nuts. He's out of his gourd. \nRITA Let him finish, then I'll call the station. They turn back to watch Phil's wrap-up. Phil is completely unkempt, still wearing only pajama bottoms and his overcoat, looking even more demented. \nPHIL (to camera) There is no way this winter is ever going to end as long as that groundhog keeps seeing his shadow everyday. I don't see any other way out. He's got to be stopped and I've got to stop him. For Channel 9 news, this is Phil Connors. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - NIGHT \nPhil is walking around the mound, casing it out. He takes a rifle out from under his coat and sneaks up to the burrow. He pulls a smoke bomb from his pocket, lights it, and throws it into the hole, then scurries for the edge of the knob and hits the deck. He lifts his rifle and aims it. Smoke is now pouring from the mound. Lots of it. Phil waits, his trigger finger twitching. A WOMAN casually walks by, stops. She surveys the situation. \nWOMAN He ain't there. Phil doesn't move. He-doesn't care that she sees him. \nWOMAN You can wait all night, but he ain't coming out. He don't live there. They keep him in the library. Phil's gun droops. The woman begins to walk off, then stops. \nWOMAN Plug him once for me. \nShe leaves. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIVIC CENTER - DAY \nPhil passes a pedestal bearing a life-size bronze statue of the groundhog and enters the public library. \nINT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nPhil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and dangerous, and enters the children's section. No one is present except the CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN, a young woman, reshelving books in the stacks. He looks around quickly and sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads: \"Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates\" Phil heads right for it. The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger. As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip. The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes. Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the case. \nPHIL'S POV The groundhog looks right into his sights. Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT. The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The groundhog looks up playfully. Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and wrestle him to floor. The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog. \nBYSTANDER Is he all right? \nLIBRARIAN He's just fine. That's two inches of bullet-proof glass there. You can't be too careful in this day and age. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN \nThe groundhog is just poking his head out of the hole. He stands full height and looks around. Phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming madness. Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his icoat and dives at the groundhog. Town officials and police throw themselves on Phil as the groundhog scampers safely back into his hole. Rita and Larry videotape the incident, aghast at Phil's insane attack. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - ANOTHER DAY \nLarry and Rita are loading their equipment back into the van. Rita spots Phil standing on the other side of the crowd, staring at her. She marches straight over to him, furious. \nRITA Where were you this morning? How could you possibly miss the shoot? \nPHIL (at the end of his \nROPE) I've come to the end of me, Rita. There's only one way out now. Just remember/we had a wonderful day together once. Phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the back of the knob. Rita watches him, then follows at a discreet distance, very worried. In a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow, Buster Greene and TWO other GROUNDHOG CLUB OFFICIALS are lifting a cage into the front seat of Buster's pickup. \nB USTER (to the groundhog) There you go, ol' buddy. Good job. Hey! He smiled at me. See that? \nFIRST OFFICIAL Right. \n"}

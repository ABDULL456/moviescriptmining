{"test1_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPhil enters the old library of the house now set up with a breakfast buffet. An old spinet piano stands in the corner. One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful of guests are seated around the room, eating. The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee. \nMRS. LANCASTER Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL (with mock civility) Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs. Lancaster. \nMRS. LANCASTER Would you like some coffee? \nPHIL I don't suppose it1 d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here. \nMRS. LANCASTER \n(BLANKLY) I don't really know -- \nPHIL Forget it. This '11 be fine. \nMRS. LANCASTER ( as she pours) I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities. \nPHIL My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast, high today in the low 30's, dropping to the low 20's tonight, but I'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as .Philadelphia. (off her surprised \nLOOK) You want to talk weather, you asked the right guy. He heads for the door. \n;MRS. LANCASTER \u00b7 \nOh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL Unfortunately yes. Phil exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nSipping at the steaming coffee, Phil manages to put on his coat and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street. \nEXT. MAIN STREET -KPUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS \nThere are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making the annual trek to see the groundhog. An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without taking any notice. \nMAN (O.C.) Hey, Phil! \nA big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing right up to him. There is something about this guy that makes us dislike him on sight. \nNED Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil looks at him vaguely. \nPHIL (at a loss) I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh-- \nNED My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heckrfire remember you. Well? Phil stares, trying to remember. \nNED Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned? Ned the Head. Come on, buddy. Case Western High? \nPHIL Ned? \nNED I see you clicking through that brain of yours. Click-click, c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing! Ned Ryerson, did the whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior ^year^ almost didn't graduate. Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went out with your sister Mary Pat a couple of times-- 'til you told me not to anymore. Well? \nPHIL \n(RESIGNED) Ned Ryerson. \nNED Bing! \nPHIL So what're you doing with yourself, Ned? \nNED Phil, I sell insurance. \nPHIL (sorry he asked) No kidding. \nNED Do you have life insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you do, I bet you could u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I got a feeling you don't have any. Am I right? \nPHIL You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk to you but I really have to-- Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint. \nNED That's okay. I'll walk with you. When I see an opportunity, I charge it, like a bull. Ned the Bull, that's me now. Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but I think it's all just a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single .premium life? That could be the ticket for you, buddy. God, it's good to see you! Hey, what're you doing for dinner? \nPHIL Dinner? Umm, I don't think that's going to work for me. As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs like a donkey. \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nEXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN \nA big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a residential street. They are gathered around a large mound of dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here. An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters. \nStomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and glances around. Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored. \nRITA How could he be late? \nLARRY Prima donnas. \nRITA It's just so-- inconsiderate. \nLARRY What happens to some people? They're born nice. They grow up nice. You put 'em on TV and - bam! Prima donnas. Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd. \nRITA Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil. Over here! Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark near the rail fence. \nRITA Where've you been? \nPHIL I got hung up with some jerk I went to high school with. So, did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned, didn't you? Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape. \nRITA You're incredible. \nPHIL Who told you? \nRITA Ready when you are. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence. The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney Phil. \nRITA Looks like they're starting. Roll tape. \nLARRY Rolling. Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly snaps into announce mode. \nPHIL (to camera) Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn here, to this tiny hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil, the world's most famous weatherman, the groundhog, who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring. Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good. A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it and retreats. \nPHIL And here's the big moment we've all been waiting for. Let's just see what Mr. Groundhog has to say. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about as far away from the cameras as he can get. \nPHIL Hey! Over here, you little weasel! Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole. \nPHIL Great shot, huh, folks? Well, that was certainly worth the trip. Now we'll be hearing from Mr. Buster Greene, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the so-called Seer of Seers who will interpret for us. BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd. \nB U ST E R He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter. The crowd lets out a good-natured \"Awwwwww\" in disappointment. \nPHIL (sarcastic, to camera) Well, that's it. Sorry you couldn't be here in person to share the electric moment. This is one event where televison really fails to capture the excitement of thousands of people gathered to watch a large squirrel predict the weather, and I for one am deeply grateful to have been a part of it. Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors. Larry cuts the camera. \nRITA (to Phil) You want to try one that's a little sweeter? \nPHIL (to Rita) That's as sweet as I get. I'm outa here. As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground. \nLARRY \n(MUTTERS) Prima donnas. \nCUT TO: \nINT . DINER - LATER Phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy, loud and lively cafe. Rita enters, sees him sitting there, crosses to his table and sits down across from him. \nRITA That was really lousy. \nPHIL Is it my fault the little rat went south on us? \nRITA A real professional would have handled it. You acted like it was a personal insult. Who do you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer? \nPHIL God, you really take this stuff seriously, don't you. \nRITA Yes, I do. As far as I ' m concerned there are no little stories, Phil. Only little reporters with big egos who think they're too good for the job they have to do. \nPHIL (trying to look hurt) You really don't know me very well, do you. 'Cause if you did you could never say something like that about me. I care! Call me a cockeyed optimist but I happen to think there's more to this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night. \nRITA Is that so. \nPHIL Yes, that is so. Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond. Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment. \nPHIL So as far as us getting together, would you say the glass is half empty or half full? Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table. \nLARRY (to Rita) You ready? We better get going if we ' re going to stay ahead of the weather. \n", "test1_id": 2208, "test2_input": "CHUBBY MAN Morning. \nPHIL Morning. \nCHUBBY MAN Think it'll be an early Spring? \nPHIL (stops, irritated) Didn't we do this yesterday? \nCHUBBY MAN \n(INTIMIDATED) I don't know what you mean. Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into his eyes. \nPHIL Don't mess with me, pork chop. What day is this? \nCHUBBY MAN \n(TERRIFIED) Febr uary second--Groundhog Day! Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the poor man. \nPHIL Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad day. Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted. \nCHUBBY MAN (to himself) I'll say. \nINT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPhil enters the old library of the house and finds everything exactly as it was the day before. Mrs. Lancaster spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee. \nMRS. LANCASTER Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL (completely confused) D i d I? I don't know-- \nMRS. LANCASTER Would you like some coffee? \nPHIL Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a little strange. \nMRS. LANCASTER ( as she pours) I wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities. \nPHIL Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs. Lancaster? \nMRS. LANCASTER Is that the Italian dessert with the brandy and the chocolate mousse? \nPHIL No, that's spaghetti. Never mind. He heads for the door, still in a daze. \nMRS. LANCASTER Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr. Connors? \nPHIL \n(VAGUELY) I don't know. I don't think so. I'll tell you after I wake up. Phil exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nPhil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY. \nPHIL Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's everybody going? \nPASSERBY To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day! The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open- mouthed. Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if trying to clear it and starts off down the street. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS \nPhil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront. \nNED RYERSON (O.C.) Hey, Phil! Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude. \nNED Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! Phil just stares at him and keeps walking. \nNED My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause I sure as heck-fire remember you. Well? \nPHIL Ned Ryerson? \nNED Bing! First shot right out of the box. So how's it going, ol' buddy? \nPHIL To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m not feeling real well. Could you excuse me? \nNED Now it's funny you should mention your health 'cause you'll never guess what I do. \nPHIL (very distressed and desperate to get away from this guy) Do you sell insurance, Ned? \n", "test2_true": "PHIL (really annoyed now) Did I say \"fuck off, \" Ned? I can't talk to you right now. He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep, slushy puddle he stepped in the day before. \nNED \n(BRAYING) Hey, look .out for that first v step. It's a doozyi Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off toward Gobbler's Knob. \nCUT TO: \nEXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - DAWN The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment. In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry, when she spots Phil heading into the crowd. \nRITA Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil! Over here! Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of the Knob, gesturing for her to follow. Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair mussed. \nRITA Where ' ve you been? \nPHIL (nervous, sweat ing) I've got to talk to you. I think I'm losing my mind. \n. RITA I know you're losing it. What are you doing over here? The camera's over there. \nPHIL Slap me, Rita. \nRITA What is this? \nPHIL \n(INSISTENT) Just slap me-- hard. She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek. \nPHIL I said hardl \n. . .. ... .RITA . I can't! \nPHIL Do it! Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard. \nPHIL (his cheek smarting) Better. Almost too hard, Rita. \nRITA Are you drunk? \nPHIL No, drunk is more fun. Can I be serious with you for a minute? \nRITA I don't know. Can you? \nPHIL Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m having a problem-- no, I may be having a problem. \nRITA What are you trying to say? \nPHIL I'm trying to say that if I was having a problem, just hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know that you're someone I could count on in a crisis. \nRITA \n(WORRIED) What did you do last night? The crowd begins to hush. \nLARRY We better get started. We're going to miss it. \nPHIL Were not going to miss it. (indicating the other \nREPORTERS) They're going to miss it. \nRITA \n(EMPHATIC) Phil. We've been out here for an hour. We're cold and tired. Let's just get this and get out of here. \nPHIL Okay, put it here. \nRITA What? \nPHIL Put the camera here . Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all of the other cameras are set up . \nRITA Phil , there is no tomorrow on this one.

I want to know what' s going on and I want to know right now. \nPHIL I'm sorry, I'm really pressed right now. Meet me outside the hospital about 5:00 and we'll talk about it. \nRITA The hospital?

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER \nA gurney bursts through the double doors, paramedics and nurses in attendance. The patient is a teenage girl, JANEY, totally unconscious. \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe gurney is wheeled into the surgery. \nNURSE Looks like insulin shock. She's probably diabetic. Phil enters wearing a doctor's scrub suit and begins barking orders. \nPHIL She's not diabetic. It's an overdose. Let's get her up here and pump her stomach, then I want a complete blood work-up, STAT. \nNURSE R i g h t , Doctor--uh-- She realizes she's never seen him before. \nPHIL Call me Phil. \nNURSE Phil.

Okay, a big tail. \nKIDS Neck! A big neck! Phil makes an animal really quickly. Rita watches from the doorway, unseen by Phil. \nPHIL There. A dog with long legs. \nKIDS Nooo ! Long neck ! \nPHIL Oh! Right! A dog with a big head. \nKIDS Noooo! The kids attack Phil. Lots of rolling around on the bed. Rita watches, completely enthralled.

RESIDENTIAL STREET - A LITTLE LATER Phil rushes down the sidewalk with Rita close behind him. He stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a YOUNG BOY falls out of the tree and into his arms, knocking him to the ground. The kid runs off unhurt as Phil gets back to his feet and brushes himself off. \nPHIL (to Rita) That little bastard has never thanked me once . I ought to j ust let him fall.

Let's go. \nRITA In a minute. She waits and watches. The paramedics, BUD and ANDY, get out of the ambulance and inspect the scene. \nBUD It's ol1 Really. \nANDY That's a shame. \nBUD Look here .

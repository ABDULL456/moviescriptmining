RED BARBER'S VOICE Robinson and Reese conferring at first. Maybe discussing an infield shift on Baumholtz. 
UMPIRE Hey! Number one! You playing ball or socializing? 
REESE Playing ball, ump! Playing ball! 
(TO JACK) Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear 42. That way they won't be able to tell us apart. Reese heads for short. Jack pounds his fist in his glove.

171 INT. TRAIN - ENROUTE TO NEW YORK - DAY 171 
Jack playing Gin Rummy with Branca, Reese and Wendell Smith. 
BRANCA (to Smith; teasing) You ever write about white guys in your paper? I mean, if I threw a no hitter and Jackie got a base hit, what would the headline be? 
SMITH Jackie leads Dodgers to victory. Again. Under that: white Italian guy does ok. They all laugh. 
REESE I'd call your folks for ya, Ralph. Tell âem how you did. 
BRANCA No problem. It'll still make the Post. They play their hands as they talk. 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 105. 
REESE We are on some kind of winning streak, huh boys? And I don't mean cards. 
BRANCA Hey, maybe forty of our last fifty. 
SMITH Thirty-two and fifteen actually. Since the 4th of July. 
BRANCA Math is why I throw a baseball for a living. 
REESE This next series against the Cardinals, it's a big one. They look over at Jack who hasn't said a word. It's his play. He lays his cards down. Deadpan as he wins the hand. 
JACK Gin. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE The top of the 11th inning, all tied at 2. For those of you just tuning in, how did we get here? 
CUT TO: 
A172 JACK AT BAT A172 Jack strokes a DOUBLE over Stanky's head as Stanky breaks off second for third. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE It's been double trouble as Robinson knocked in Stanky with a double in the third... 
B172 DIXIE WALKER AT BAT B172 Walker strokes a DOUBLE over Stanky's head as Stanky breaks off second for third. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE ...And Dixie Walker did the same with a double in the eighth. 
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 105A. 
172 EXT. EBBETS FIELD - DAY 172 
ENOS SLAUGHTER steps in for St. Louis. Hugh Casey on the mound for Brooklyn. Slaughter looks fiercely determined. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE It wasn't enough as the Cardinals tied it with two of their own in the top of the ninth. This game is crucial to the Red Birds. They're five games out, the Dodgers having not relinquished first place sine June 30th. Casey throws a pitch. Inside, a ball. INSERT: August 20, 1947. Brooklyn. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE Slaughter takes ball one low. Casey in his second inning of relief. This game is tighter than a new pair of shoes on a rainy day. Slaughter hitless in four trips as Casey goes into his wind-up. Slaughter swings, hits a hard ground ball right at Reese who fires over to Jack at first. Slaughter is out by fifteen feet, but he never slows down. And his foot comes down -- -- High on Jack's right calf. Slaughter's spiked him something wicked. Jack goes down in a heap clutching his leg, blood already seeping through his high socks. Slaughter, head down, on his way to the visitor's dugout as Dodger players pour out of their own to protest. As the UMP raises his hands, motions them all back... Jack pulls up his sock, a bloody mess. Stanky looks to Casey. 
WHITE 3-14-12 106. 
STANKY Next batter, throw right at his head. Clean his clock -- 
JACK 
(FIERCE) Just get him out. Understand? Game's too important. As Casey nods, Jack reaches up to Stanky and Reese. They pull him to his feet. Jack looks, finds Rachel in the stands. As he gives her a little wave: âI'm okay.' 
CUT TO: 
173 WHITEY KUROWSKI 173 A big Cardinal slugger at bat. Casey pitching. 
BARBER'S VOICE The top of the 12th and Kurowski at the plate. He hit his 20th home run on Monday so Casey's going to want to be careful with him. The pitch grooves in and Kurowski nails it. 
BARBER'S VOICE (CONT'D) Oh dear. There goes number 21. 
CUT TO: 
174 SCOREBOARD - EBBETS FIELD 174 The Cardinals leading 3-2 going into the bottom of the 12th. 
175 JACK 175 The stadium electric as Jack steps in, his left leg bloody. He takes an inside pitch at the knees. Bastards! Here comes the next one. WHACK - He singles hard up the middle, nearly takes the pitcher's head off. 
FIRST BASE He rounds hard, returns to the bag. Reiser stepping up to the plate as Musial holds Jack on at first. Jack in a fury. 
JACK I don't care what happens, I don't care what kind of play it is, when I get to second I'm gonna knock someone into centerfield.

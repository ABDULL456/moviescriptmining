Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs. He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains a hand gun. He tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds his shirts over it. 
Street Sidewalk - Evening 
Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down the sidewalk with about 20 other people around them. Rachel is clutching Ray's hand and Robbie is carrying the box of food. 
ROBBIE 
What's happening? 
RAY 
Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We... We've only got about another minute. 
Ray sees the car that Manny was working on just as Manny's Apprentice closes the hood. Ray mutters... 
RAY 
Please, Please, Please. 
People are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction. Ray, Robbie and Rachel approach the car. 
RAY 
Just keep it down. 
ROBBIE 
Ray, I'm standing right beside you. Can you please answer me? 
Ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys. 
RAY 
Just get in the front seat Robbie. 
Ray loads Rachel in the middle row of seats as Robbie gets in the passenger seat. 
RACHEL 
Who's car is this? 
RAY 
Just get in. 
RACHEL 
Who's car is this? 
Ray throws Rachel's bag in the row of seats behind her, slams the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car. He is caught by Manny walking. 
MANNY 
Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right. I had to change the sole... Ray? 
Manny sees Ray has loaded his whole family into the car. 
MANNY 
Hey Ray? Ray? What? 
Manny walks over to the passenger side as Ray and Robbie watch him. 
MANNY 
Ray. Open up. 
Ray, who did no such thing sits there. Robbie looks at ray wondering what he's going to do. 
MANNY 
Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR RAY! 
Ray reaches over Robbie and opens the door. 
MANNY 
What are you... 
RAY 
(interrupts him) Get in. 
MANNY 
That's funny, you gotta get out of the car. You can't take it. 
Ray tries to get Manny to calm down from the panic he is in...

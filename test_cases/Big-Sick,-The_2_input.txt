CUT TO: 
DR. SPELLMAN Our theory is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 
TERRY (taking NOTES) Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an "f" or a "ph"? 
DR. SPELLMAN Ph. 
MONTAGE of doctors babbling unintelligibly as Beth and Terry visibly panic. 
INT. WAITING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER 
Terry, Beth, and Kumail sit, surrounded by: KIDS WITH COLORING BOOKS, ADULTS WITH MAGAZINES, various CHARGERS plugged into the wall. These are the PEOPLE WHO WAIT. 
KUMAIL That was very reassuring, wasn't it? Apparently, there are good and bad comas. And the kind that they put her in, the medically induced ones, are definitely the good kind of coma. (MORE) 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Like you know how there are good and bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good or bad. 
TERRY Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle things from here. You've been very helpful. Thank you. For signing the thing- 
KUMAIL My pleasure 
TERRY But you can go now. 
KUMAIL Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the Mideast. 
He picks up his backpack and exits. 
INT. TRIPLE DOOR - BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT 
Kumail, Mary, Chris, CJ, & Sam sit with notebooks open. 
CHRIS What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at the airport get a boner. Does that mean drugs or bombs? 
CJ That's good. What if instead of it being at the airport, you quit comedy and never did comedy ever again? 
CHRIS Fuck you. It's a good bit. 
CJ Just for the sake of the public. So they wouldn't have to look at your face or hear your words. 
Kumail interjects. 
KUMAIL It's okay that I'm not there, right? Like, I don't need to be there, right? 
SAM What happened? 
CHRIS He put his girlfriend in a coma. You know, the way you do. 
MARY He signed a paper that allowed doctors to put her-- 
CJ He suggested it. 
KUMAIL She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors know medical stuff. That's what doctors do. They're good at medical stuff. This is a medically induced coma. This is their specialty. 
MARY Maybe. 
CHRIS It might be a good thing. She might wake up with a new skill. Like my cousin blacked out once and when he came to, he thought he knew a different language. 
CJ Did he? 
CHRIS No, it was just gibberish that he made up. It was brain damage. 
CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out. 
SAM I got another Taco Bell one... 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING 
Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's. Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them. 
BETH Did you forget something? 
KUMAIL Is she up yet? 
TERRY No, she's not. They won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning. 
KUMAIL I know you guys said you don't need me to stay, but I think I'm just going to wait anyway. 
BETH You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious.

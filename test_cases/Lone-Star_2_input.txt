DEL Chaos. 
Athena is sure she's overstepped her rank-- 
DEL Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"? 
ATHENA They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us. 
DEL Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post? 
ATHENA No, sir. Not at all. 
DEL Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers? 
ATHENA No, sir. They all been real straight with me. 
Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her-- 
DEL It works like this, Private--every soldier in a war doesn't have to believe in what he's fighting for. Most of them fight just to back up the soldiers in their squad--you try not to get them killed, try not to get them extra duty, try not to embarrass yourself in front of them. 
He is right in her face now-- 
DEL Why don't you start with that? 
ATHENA Yes, sir. 
DEL You're dismissed, Private. 
ATHENA Thank you, sir. 
Athena salutes, steps out. Del looks out the window, troubled by the encounter. 
EXT. BORDER CONTROL 
A battered car full of Mexican DAY WORKERS rolls toward the Mexican side checkpoint-- 
INT. CAR 
Enrique sits squeezed between workers in the back. The driver never stops talking as the officer waves them through. 
DRIVER (O.S.) --Julia es demasiado flaca para mime gusto mas mujeres con algo en frente-- o muy altas como Cindy Crofor. Quisiera montar esa caballa--[Julia's too skinny for me--I like women with something up front--or really tall like Cindy Crawford. I'd like to ride that horse--] 
EXT. KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY 
Sam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive- looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood-- 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Sam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games-- 
BUNNY The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio-- 
SAM (O.S.) That's in Maverick County. 
She brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full- sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler-- 
BUNNY Oh. Right. And you're in--? 
SAM Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore-- 
SAM You still going to all the home games? 
BUNNY Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press? 
SAM Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication? 
BUNNY Do I seem jumpy? 
SAM No, you look good. I was just wondering. 
BUNNY Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop-- 
SAM You look good-- 
BUNNY --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal-- 
SAM Yeah, well-- 
BUNNY --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her. 
SAM You were in a fight-- 
BUNNY Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny. 
SAM Same weight I always was. 
BUNNY You look awful good in that uniform, though. 
SAM Best part of the job. 
BUNNY Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now". 
SAM Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?

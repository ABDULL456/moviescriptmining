Daphne breaks for the back way and Easy tries to bar Shariff from going after her. 
EASY Hey! 
Manny swings the baseball bat into Easy's side. and Easy yells and plows into him, wrestling him against the wall. 
Albright grabs Easy from behind and pries him free enough for Manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of the bat. 
Easy sinks to his knees seeing double. 
Shariff leads Daphne back into the room, her face contorted into tears, her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock. 
107   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               107 
ALBRIGHT (to Daphne) Where are the pictures? 
DAPHNE (terrified) I don't know. 
SMACK!   He backhands her. 
Easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and Manny swings the bat down into his kidney. 
ALBRIGHT Where are they? 
DAPHNE (indicating Easy) I wouldn't tell him! And I won't tell you! 
ALBRIGHT Sure you will. (to Shariff) Let's go. 
Shariff leads Daphne outside and Manny draws his forty-five automatic and trains it on Easy, cocking the hammer. 
ALBRIGHT What're you doin'? Who are we gonna give 'em to cover this shit, hunh?... Use your head. 
He shoves Manny through the door and pushes Easy onto his side with his foot and he's out the door. 
Easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and the sound of a car engine growls to life. 
He thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the count. He gets it open in time to see... 
108   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      108 
The blurred white form of Albright's Caddy screaming away, shattering the dark, shrieking in flight. 
Dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the block. 
Easy stumbles back inside and into 
109   THE BEDROOM                                                       109 
Where he manages to dial the phone.      It RINGS several times on the other end, and finally: 
MOUSE'S VOICE (groggy) Yeah. 
EASY Mouse... 
MOUSE'S VOICE Hey, Easy? 
EASY (slurring) Get Dupree's car. Drive it to 78th and Central... The butcher shop. 
MOUSE'S VOICE You alright? 
EASY Hurry up. 
He puts down the receiver, missing the cradle, and staggers out of the room. 
110   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                           110 
Easy is ripping through the night, the streetlights flashing by in blurs of light. The windows down, he's coming to. 
EASY (V.O.) It had come to me in less time than it takes to think that Albright was taking Daphne someplace more isolated than that office building downtown... Someplace where there would be no witnesses... And I was being left alive to take the fall. 
111   EXT. BUTCHER SHOP/JOPPY'S BAR - NIGHT                             111 
The street is still alive. A couple of late night juke joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party onto the sidewalk to straggle home. Easy's car screams around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy-hipped young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for cover. 
He jumps out just as Mouse scorches the tires on Dupree's '38 Packard in behind him. 
111   CONTINUED:                                                     111 
EASY (to the woman) Sorry, baby... Lemme give you twenty bucks for them stockings you got on. 
It takes a moment to register, but when she sees him pull a twenty from his pocket, she gets busy. 
He runs back to Mouse. 
EASY Gimme one of them guns you got. 
Mouse smiles, loving this side of Easy, and trades him a set of car keys for a .32 automatic. 
EASY (continuing) Start up my car. I'm comin' out fast. 
He runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the twenty, grabbing one of the nylons, leaving her still stripping as he runs into

TAMARA Yuri bear, what are we doing? 
YURI We're taking the Bentley! 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN 
Sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering snow field comes flying towards them. 
(CONTINUED) 
SASHA CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast! 
Sasha pulls the Antonov back up. 
SASHA (CONT'D) Now! Open it! 
Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE. 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN 
The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface. 
Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens. Everyone screams in panic. 
YURI SHUT UP EVERY ONE! 
They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly. 
YURI (CONT'D) Engine... start... 
The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson. 
YURI (CONT'D) Voice control... Sold me on it. 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN 
Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon. 
SASHA Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down! 
GORDON What about you?! 
SASHA I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! 
Gordon hesitates. 
SASHA (CONT'D) What are you waiting for! (CONTINUED) 
Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out. 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN 
The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice everywhere. The Bentley roars. 
YURI (O.S.) Push it Curtis! 
JACKSON We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. 
Noah turns and sees Gordon. 
NOAH Tamara! Open the door! 
Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation. 
TAMARA Where's Sasha? 
GORDON He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down. 
Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing. 
LILLY Daaadddy! 
The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. 
The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. 
The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. 
Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep. 
The plane crashes and explodes. 
EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN 
As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow. 
The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking. 
JACKSON (O.S.) Everybody okay back there? 
KATE (O.S.) We're all fine. 
The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES. 
One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- 
Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass. 
GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from these flying machines. 
One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley. 
Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone. 
CHINESE COMMANDER Welcome to the People's Republic of China. 
Jackson nods to them. 
JACKSON Thank you... (to Lilly and Noah) Say thank you, kids. 
The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello... 
CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your passes?

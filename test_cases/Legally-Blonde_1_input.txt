DONOVAN 
Covered. She was in Aspen at the time. Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club. 
ELLE 
Al l I know is-- it's not Brooke. 
DONOVAN 
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi. Elle thinks about this.

A--nervous Elle stands in front of the burly CHECK-IN GUARD.. She holds a basket of goodies. 
ELLE

Elle sits at a conference table with her basket. A door opens and a female guard brings Brooke into the room. Wearing a horribly tacky orange jumpsuit. 
ELLE

He means well.      He's really brilliant and all. Brooke sits, not looking convinced. 
BROOKE

ELLE 
I brought you some necessities. Pink sheets. Aromatherapy candles. Loofah. And The Bible. She holds up a "Cosmopolitan". 
BROOKE 
You're an angel. Elle squirms in her seat.

ELLE

Brooke tears up. 
BROOKE 
Elle, I can't. You don't understand. 
ELLE

BROOKE

ELLE 
I know!   You helped me go from a six to a four! Brooke starts to cry again. 
BROOKE 
On the day of Heyworth's murder, I was -- She snorts back a sob. 
BROOKE (CONT'D)

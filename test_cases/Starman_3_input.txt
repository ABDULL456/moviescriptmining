JENNY I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you. 
The STAR MAN is unyielding. 
JENNY Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. (she hands him some money) That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go. 
STAR MAN (taps the red dot on the satel compass) When we get here. 
Jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat. 
JENNY You bastard. 
Her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, she is out and running. 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn! 
He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the other car waiting at the light. 
EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY 
Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and zigzags through the people in that direction. 
INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY 
As he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand. 
YOUNG MAN Hey!! 
In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people to look in the shops that border the atrium. 
MEZZANINE 
Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away and gets on the escalator to the second floor. 
ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it hits the cement turns faces in his direction. 
Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram. 
It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER comes charging out of a plant store. 
MOTHER My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! Burt!! 
The STAR MAN holds the baby out to her. 
She grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave. 
MOTHER Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was stealing my baby!! 
Two tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR MAN's way to the escalator. 
MAN Where you think you're going? 
Not understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They push him back. 
STAR MAN Please. 
A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to the Mother. 
MOTHER He was trying to steal Gloria. 
Two steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around. 
BURT Is that right? Huh? 
He throws him back against the crowd that has gathered. 
STAR MAN (stutters) Please. 
Burt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes him. 
BURT Is that right? Come on. Answer me. 
Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even madder. 
BURT Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer me! 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn! 
SECOND FLOOR 
Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the mob. 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn! 
One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.

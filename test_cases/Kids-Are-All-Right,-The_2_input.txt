NIC But why didn't you tell us? 
JONI Because we knew you'd be upset. 
NIC WE'RE NOT UPSET!! 
Jules calms her riled-up partner. JULES Honey... (to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly) We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on-- 
JONI (sheepish) Actually... (beat) I want to see him again. JULES                             LASER You do?!                         You do?! 
JONI (CONT'D) (to Laser) Yeah. I was gonna tell you. 
NIC Whoa! Whoa! No. No way. (regaining dominance) Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him! 
Joni looks at Laser.   They knew this would happen. 
INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss. 
NIC Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know? 
JULES Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way. 
When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red hair out of the sink. NIC Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just here! 
Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash. 
INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
NIC (getting tactical) Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse. JULES I know... 
NIC Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed. 
JULES I'm with you, honey. (then) We're gonna get through this, okay? 
Nic smiles.   She loves when Jules shows confidence. NIC I love you, chicken. 
The women bump fists.   They have a plan. JULES I love you too, pony. 
EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON 
Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house. 
OMITTED 
INT/EXT. ALLGOOD FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON 
Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces. 
NIC Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules.

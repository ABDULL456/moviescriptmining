GABRI and TASHA buzz. 
LETOUR St. Luke's. 
TIS No problem, but -- can you believe this? -- she's out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to "get together." Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back? 
LETOUR Not now. 
TIS Huh? 
LETOUR Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking tonic? (TIS nods) He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever -- he's on you. 
TIS You know him? 
LETOUR (shakes head "no") Just a feeling. You holding? 
TIS No. Need help? 
LETOUR ("no") Leave a message. Robert or I will come by later. 
TIS Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway. (to MODELS) Who am I trying to impress? (they smile uncomprehendingly) Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three- quarters. 
LETOUR Nineteen is the top. I'll make two trips. 
TIS Nineteen is fine. 
LETOUR (leaving) A domani. Take care, girls. 
CUT TO: 
THERE IS A DIRECTION 
The blue sedan drives west past Times Square, turns north on Eighth Ave. A plastic wall of trash stretches toward the river. Port Authority hustlers -- male, female -- cruise as TRANSIT COPS whack an emaciated CRACKHEAD. JOHN, lit by neon, lowers his power window. 
John's apartment. Night. He writes in his diary, drinks. 
LETOUR (voice over) I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a direction. What a strange thing to happen halfway through your life. 
He goes to the phone, dials. A voice answers: 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Paramount Hotel. 
LETOUR Marianne Jost, please. 
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Just a moment. 
A pre-recorded message comes on: 
HOTEL MESSAGE "Welcome to the Paramount. Your party is out. If you would like to leave a message for -- (Marianne's voice) 
'MARIANNE JOST' (back to message) -- please do so after the beep." 
LETOUR hangs up, carries the phone to the boombox. He dials again, presses 'Record,' holds the receiver to the mike, records the hotel message, hangs up. 
First light slants from the window. LETOUR lies clothed on the futon, boombox by his ear. He presses "Play" and "Rewind," running the tape over and over, listening, re-listening to Marianne's voice: "Marianne Jost." "Marianne Jost." "Marianne Jost.")

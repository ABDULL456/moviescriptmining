ON SNATCHER: He has lost his balance and crashed to the floor. Trout and Pickles twist their hands, unsure of what to do, as Snatcher lays atop the broken table. 
SNATCHER (GROGGY) I'm alright. Just give me a hand. 
Snatcher holds up his cheese-covered hand and the hand suddenly SWELLS UP into a grotesque meat glove! 
MR. PICKLES (DISGUSTED) Ugh. Mother of sausages! 
MR. TROUT (O.S.) Holy meat glove! 
Eggs looks horrified at the sight of Snatcher's giant hand. 
Fish won't come out of the box so Eggs is forced to lug him like a sack of concrete to the wall beneath the heating duct. 
Trout and Pickles help Snatcher up. 
MR. TROUT (CONT'D) Upsy daisy now, boss. Let's get you a nice cuppa tea-- 
Snatcher SMACKS Trout away with his swollen hand - (YELP!)- 
MR. PICKLES AAAH! Mister Snatcher! 
-- and stares at Pickles. His eyes are swollen nearly shut and blink spastically. 
SNATCHER'S POV: Blurry and distorted at first, then, at each blink, Pickles morphs into Lord Portley-Rind, white hat and all. 
MR. PICKLES/PORTLEY-RIND Huh? (UNEASY) ... What is it, Mr. Snatcher? 
SNATCHER You. 
MR. PICKLES/LPR Me? 
SNATCHER GIVE ME THAT HAT! 
He LUNGES AT PICKLES (AHHHH!) and chokes him with his giant cheese hand! 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I'll make those brie stuffed pigs bow down to me! I'm going to be somebody! 
Pickles wrestles Snatcher's swollen face into a headlock. 
MR. PICKLES AHH! I got him! Do it! 
MR. TROUT MR. GRISTLE NOW! 
MR. PICKLES NOW! NOW! NOW!! 
Gristle runs up and hurls the jar of leeches onto Snatcher's face. 
MR. GRISTLE LEECHES! 
SNATCHER AHHHHH! UGH. OOF. GAHHH! 
Snatcher grunts and yells then everything goes silent, except for the sucking sound of the leeches. Mr. Trout shrinks away and Mr. Gristle grins, enjoying the spectacle. 
ON EGGS: Eggs is horrified by the sight of the leeches sucking on Snatcher's swollen face. 
EGGS Eww! (TO FISH) You have got to help me, Fish! 
FISH (gurgles) Okay. 
Fish sticks his right arm out of the box. 
EGGS (groan) Uggggh. 
Eggs grabs Fish's arm and swings the whole box over his shoulder so he is wearing Fish like a back pack. Then Eggs grabs a pipe on the wall and climbs toward the duct. 
They swell up larger and larger as Snatcher's face shrinks back down to normal. They drop off one at a time and squish at Snatcher's feet. 
Snatcher flicks off the last few leeches and flips his hair. His face is marred with red spots from the suckers but has returned to its normal size. 
SNATCHER (GROGGY) Oh, hello. Where were we? 
MR. TROUT We was about to... uhh... 
MR. GRISTLE (quietly, gestures with the empty jar) Leeches. 
MR. TROUT ... Put that new boxtroll to work. Ain't that right, Mr. Pickles? 
Mr. Pickles stumbles over, rubbing his sore neck. 
MR. PICKLES That is correct. 
SNATCHER Ah yes... right. Open the workshop Mr. Trout! 
Trout runs to a lever and pulls it. 
(1250 EMS) EGGS MEETS SNATCHER 
INT SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY 
The factory is filled with load-grinding sounds as a steam wheel turns. Huge timbers in the wooden floor PULL OPEN, REVEALING A DARK PIT BELOW in the FACTORY SUB-LEVEL. 
Eggs and Fish are still a few feet short of the air duct. Eggs heaves Fish halfway into the duct and has to stretch out over empty space to push him in. 
Snatcher and the Redhats reach Fish's empty cage. 
SNATCHER Huh? Where is the beast? 
Eggs pushes Fish half into the duct while hanging from the swinging cage. Fish is looking straight down, suddenly his eyes go wide!

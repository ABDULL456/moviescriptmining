straightens up and goes out. 
EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT) 
Arbogast comes out and looks off. He sees: 
THE LAST LIT CABIN 
The door ajar. 
C.U. - ARBOGAST - (NIGHT) 
would go along but he stops with a new thought. He turns around and looks off. 
L.S. - THE OLD HOUSE FROM HIS VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT) 
C.U. - ARBOGAST 
comes to a decision. He goes off. 
L.S. ARBOGAST 
dashes up the stone steps to the House. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, sees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for along moment, hears nothing. 
Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins to open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip through and into the foyer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT) 
Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it, waiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no one. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the sounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait, he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly, placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks or groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA FOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the stairway as Arbogast makes his way up. 
CUT TO: 
EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE 
INT. STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING 
We see Arbogast coming up the stairs. And now we see, too, the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly. 
As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous knife flashing. 
C.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST 
The knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts. The sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back and staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the stairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground. As he collapses at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates plunges into the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain the raising and descending murder weapon. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
INT. BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT) 
Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't moved from it in the last hour. Sam is pacing, occasionally stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. The ash tray close to Lila is filled. 
There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness in the small, otherwise cozy room. 
SAM (at window, quietly) Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila? 
LILA (unable to keep up small talk) Sam. He said an hour. Or less. 
SAM It's been three. 
LILA Are we just going to go on sitting here? 
SAM (suddenly cheerful) He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay? 
LILA You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

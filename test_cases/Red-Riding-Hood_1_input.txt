Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of Attewater and Father Auguste. 
SOLOMON Silver. This is our most potent weapon. One blow will kill it. 
(BEAT) That sword has tasted the blood of many such creatures. But never one as powerful as this. 
ATTEWATER If it's that powerful, how can we possibly hope to stop it? 
SOLOMON We must find it in its human form. Who among you do you suspect? Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks. Neither of them wants to speak up first. 
SOLOMON It has not survived this long by being obvious. The signs will be subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness. Strange behavior. Strange smells. (off their looks) Well, none of them smell good, but we must start somewhere. 
FATHER AUGUSTE What about the hair Madame Ordeville found on Lucie's body? It was dark. The person we are looking for must have dark hair. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SOLOMON Perhaps. Unless it planted the hair to make us think that. 
ATTEWATER Yes, it's trying to trick us again. This has been happening for forty years. It must be an old man by now. The hair should have been gray. 
SOLOMON Not necessarily. It may be the child or grandchild of the werewolf that first struck here. 
FATHER AUGUSTE The curse is hereditary? 
SOLOMON It is. But it effects men and women differently. A man can inherit the curse. Or he can be turned simply by being bitten. Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it. 
SOLOMON But women are immune to the werewolf's bite. In order for a woman to be turned, she must inherit the curse. But even then it will lie dormant unless she eats human flesh. Only then will the bite of a male werewolf change her. Only then can she become a werewolf and capable of passing the curse on to her own children. 
ATTEWATER But it could be a woman. 
SOLOMON Of course. It could be any one of you. Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look. 
EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN 
The mood of the village is grim. Isabelle meets Roxanne at the crossroads. Roxanne eyes her warily. A beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ISABELLE Has Claude come home? 
ROXANNE No. Nobody has seen him. 
ISABELLE He's run away before. He'll be all right. Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They all exchange a sad look. 
PRUDENCE Well. I suppose this is all of us. The three of them turn and start toward the woods... 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT 
Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire. 
GRANDMOTHER It talked to you. And you understood it? 
ISABELLE As clearly as I do you now. Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat. 
GRANDMOTHER Word of this cannot be allowed to spread. Do you understand me? 
ISABELLE Roxanne will never speak of it. She won't even talk to me about it. A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then: 
ISABELLE I have to do what it wants. (off her look) I have communed with an unholy beast. What does that make me if not cursed? 
GRANDMOTHER I don't know. But I won't allow you to go with this devil and live as its concubine.

{"train": "MONKEYBONE \nWritten by \nSam Hamm \nbased on the comic book \"Dark Town\" by \nKaja Blackley and Vanessa Chong \nSEVENTH DRAFT 3 FEBRUARY 1999 \nFADE IN: \nMAIN CREDITS ROLL \nover BLACK SCREEN, with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath. Just as the music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH. \nA BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine. TITLE WIPES IN with him: \nMONKEYBONE(tm) in \"FREUD CHICKEN!\" \nTIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED) \nA POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in F.G. Gaping at it is a goofy, bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back and forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right eye keeps going back and forth with the watch. \nSHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.) Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on, get back, ve haven't got all day. \nNow BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized. \nINT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED) \nA squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the Gettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the blackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G. \nSTANLEY (V.O.) It was third grade. The teacher was Miss Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she smelled funny - but she was kind. \nMISS HUDLAPP CLASS! (turning around suddenly) How many times have I told you? In this class we do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head! \nREVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY \nHapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his front-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling. \nA dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP. \nSTANLEY (V.O.) You know how some teachers have those, kind of, flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp flab that like, dangle? \nAs MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR. \nMISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust. Young STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth, with a loud SLAP each time they collide. \nSTANLEY (V.O.) It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to feel...well...oddly... \nNow we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath: Donna Summer, \"I FEEL LOVE.\" \nSTANLEY (V.O.) ...aroused. (beat) And then the horror began. \nDOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls around him are pointing and tittering. \nGrimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK goes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back! \nThe kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of textbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and BOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring directly at him... \nMISS HUDLAPP Young man. What's that in your lap? \nShe marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap. \nSTANLEY (V.O.) It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on the Washington Monument. And then...all at once ...there he was. \nThe BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET OUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES! \nSTANLEY (V.O.) Monkeybone!! \nThe libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS HUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone: \nMONKEYBONE Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way. \nBEAUTIFUL FAN Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my belly? As a guide? \nSTU Guide...? \nBEAUTIFUL FAN For my tattoo artist? \nShe exposes her taut midriff. STU thinks for a moment, then goes to work. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the girl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD. \nBEAUTIFUL FAN Wait! You have to draw the rest of him - \nShe begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw Monkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs... \nSTU I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO- OCCCC!! \nHe wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a bunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside. \nSTU Hey, Doc. Come here. There's something really cool I want to show you. \nHe grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to - \nINT. ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nThere's nothing \"cool\" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside. \nSTU See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out ...they close...you can't get back in! \nHe opens one door and holds it for JULIE. \nJULIE You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! \nSTU They don't love me. They love Monkeybone. \nJULIE It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there... \nSTU That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone! (conspiratorially) I have something I have to give you. \nJULIE Can't you give it to me later? \nSTU Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better. \nHe gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. For a moment they completely forget about the party in the next room. \nThen HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for the clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart: \nHERB Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys - \nSTU Julie and I - we were just gonna go... \nBut before STU knows what's hit him, HERB is leading him back to - \nINT. LOBBY - THAT MOMENT - CONTINUOUS \nHERB Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here... \nSTU Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries? \nHERB Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God - \nThe MERCHANDISERS shoot STU an expectant wave. STU waves back and turns in the opposite direction. HERB grabs him by the sleeve. \nSTU Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand. \nHERB Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth! \nSTU I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap! \nHERB Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. \nSTU Herb. I have to go. \nHERB Why? \nSTU I got the ring. (beat) Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night. \nHe nods toward JULIE, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of punch. HERB realizes a proposal is in the works. \nShe thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then opens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the opposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again... \nEXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT \nHis eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games, lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this SWERVED... \n...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for the prom - seem to be okay. \nSTU Hey! Are you guys all right in there? \nTEENAGE GIRL We're fine. \nSTU That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my windshield - it practically killed us all! (to JULIE) God, Julie, if anything had happened to you - \nJULIE I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky. \nSTU I'd better go report this... \nHe spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with both hands. \nJULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description. \nJULIE Dad's car? \nThe BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy. \nThen: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise, like nails on a blackboard... \nTEENAGE GIRL What was that? Did you hear that? \nThe horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it TOPPLES. Directly toward... \nJULIE STU!! \nON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH \nHe sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger. \nSTU Operator? I want to report an accident. \nFinally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp... \nCLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE \nA HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an insane, almost macabre grin. \nThe screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus... \nSTU'S POV: ON JULIE \nHe's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him, working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand. \nJULIE Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise - \nAll at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant: \nJULIE (V.O.) I'm here, baby. I won't leave you... \nAnd then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him... \nAn AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in: \nEXT. TROLLEY - MOVING \nA tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a vast black VOID... \n...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not unlike a disembodied FIST. \nAnd, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like - turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle... \nEXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT \nThe car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow - stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's stranded - alone. \nSTU Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead? (beat) PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD. \nINT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nSTU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter past outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around. \nThe bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV bottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny Mercer's \"DREAM.\" And over at the BAR... \nBULL (o.s.) New in town, huh? What're you drinking? \nOut of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns away to grab a fresh glass. \nSTU Chasing me - animals - horrible - \nBULL Animals? What kind of animals? \nSTU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a BULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side. \nBULL Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking? \nSTU Uhh - martini? \nBULL Olive or eyeball? \nSTU Olive. - Where exactly am I? \nBULL Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. \nSTU Stu Miley. \nBULL Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here. \nSTU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES. \nBULL I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on every channel...all the stuff people dream, after they have the extra anchovies. \nHe changes channels with a remote. Now we see a guy falling through midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling... \nSTU Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. \nBULL Sad commentary, huh? \nNow a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STU'S BACKPACK: \nDISEMBODIED VOICE (o.s.) \"Bull,\" huh? That's cute. What's your last name - \"Shit\"?? \nBULL (turning angrily to STU) I beg your pardon? \nSTU I didn't say anything. \nVOICE (o.s.) Nice face. Lemme guess. You were in a bullfight ...with a Mack Truck!! \nSTU claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking. BULL glowers at him, snorting STEAM out of both nostrils. \nSTU I was, uh, just getting ready to leave... \nBULL Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist here. \nThe ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over. \nVOICE (o.s.) Well, hello, sailor. Get a lot of dates with that ding-dong on your face?? \nBULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STU'S LIGHTS OUT. He's saying his prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL FURRY BEAST pops out, CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF!! \nMONKEYBONE Just kiddin', folks! Drinks for everybody - (pointing at STU) \nOn him!! HIYA, BOSS!! \nBULL and JUMBO back off, STUNNED. The monkey grabs STU'S FACE and plants a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE. STU SCREAMS. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON an EEG monitor. There's a sudden BLIP on the readout. \nNURSE Just a spike, ma'am. It happens. It's perfectly natural with coma patients. \nMONKEYBONE I'd like something with an umbrella in it and a really smutty name. Like a...Sex Behind the Sofa with Your Parents in the Same Room Watching \"The Brady Bunch.\" \nSTU Nothing for him! He's being repressed. \nKITTY Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense. \nMONKEYBONE Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me. \nSTU I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name? \nKITTY Hypnos? \nSTU Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. \nA softie at heart, KITTY sits across from STU and takes his hand. \nSTU I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least she'd know how I feel. That way she'd...wait for me. \nShe leans forward sympathetically. From this particular vantage, MONKEYBONE has an unobstructed view of KITTY's cleavage. And so does STU - although he's not quite as obvious about staring. \nKITTY She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. Guys like you don't come along that often. Believe me, I know. \nMONKEYBONE slinks over behind STU - up onto his shoulder - and whispers into his ear: \nMONKEYBONE My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before. \nSTU (trying to ignore him) \nI'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying? \nKITTY I mean it, Stu. You're one in a million. \nKITTY is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time. Her furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air. It's hypnotic - like a windshield wiper. \nSTU stares at it. MONKEYBONE stares at it. And MONKEYBONE'S TAIL responds by straightening...stiffening...bending upward slightly. \nSTU I'm not so special. I'm just - kind of - \nSTU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his shoulder. It's a TONGUE...dangling out of MONKEYBONE'S OPEN MOUTH. STU lets out a YOWL OF SHOCK. \nBlushing bright red, he GRABS THE TONGUE and shoves it manually back into the monkey mouth whence it came. \nMONKEYBONE Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment! \nSTU THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK! \nMONKEYBONE FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING - \nSTU LUNGES at MONKEYBONE - who JUMPS OVER HIM, BOUNDS off the edge of the table, and grabs hold of a CHANDELIER. \nMONKEYBONE I'm reportin' this to my union!! \nSTU What union? \nMONKEYBONE The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass! \nSTU grabs a CHAIR and swings it at the chandelier. MONKEYBONE makes a series of SUBMARINE NOISES - \nMONKEYBONE DIVE! DIVE!! \n- and DIVES - directly between KITTY's breasts into her skimpy black dress!! STU circles around KITTY, following the undulating monkey-sized BLOB that's tunnelling around under her dress. Finally MONKEYBONE pops out of the BACK of the dress and NUZZLES KITTY'S EAR: \nMONKEYBONE I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic. \nSTU Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey. \nMONKEYBONE runs under the pool table. STU is giving chase when - suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind. \nEVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place. \nFor there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most dreaded figure in all of Dark Town - \n- a GRIM REAPER, nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some hapless coma victim to the land of Death! \nEERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the REAPER looks from face to face. For a moment he focuses on STU. STU backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread...and MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully. \nMONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them. But STU isn't intimidated. He grabs another ball and winds up. \nMONKEYBONE Stu? Stu? I think weve got this backwards. Your behavior...is disturbing me. \nThe REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as the ball whizzes past. STU starts chasing after him! \nThe REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of the \"fingers\" of the hand that holds Dark Town. When the bike hits the end of the finger, it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING. \nSTU That's right. Run! And don't come back unless you've got my e-ticket!! \nThe REAPER vanishes. STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb. \nSTU Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of here. I'll never see her again. \nJust then, a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on a CHILD'S SCOOTER. He stops... \nMESSENGER BOY Miley? Stu Miley? \nSTU looks up. Six arms reach into six pockets. Finally the MESSENGER finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over. Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION: \nYOU Are Invited to a PAJAMA PARTY at HYPNOS' HIDEAWAY Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp \"If You Snooze, You Lose\" \nSTU'S EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off. \nSTU Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to hear my case. I'm going home! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - MORNING \nAs she's done every morning for the last three months, JULIE brushes STU'S TEETH. Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around STU - on the off chance that he might be aware of her presence. \nShe packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek. \nJULIE I think we can go another day without shaving. Long as you don't look like you're growing one of those stupid little goatees. \nShe opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper. \nJULIE Hey, there's an article about the Monkeybone show. They've run that one episode about eight times now. Herb says it gets higher ratings every time...they're hoping you'll give 'em some new material soon... (long, bored pause) Wanna hear another joke? \nShe refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback entitled The Book of Raunch. She pages through it for a moment. \nJULIE Okay...let me see...here we go. A plane full of explorers crashlands in New Guinea; they are captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the chief's hut, where...wait a minute. I know this one... (reading ahead) \nYou stinker! You swiped this joke for a Monkeybone strip! \nShe whacks him on the arm with the book. No response at all. \nJULIE Okay. Let's try again. Why did the pervert cross the road? \nThe sound of SOBBING interrupts her joke. She looks up and sees KIMMY standing in the doorway, red-eyed and crying. \nJULIE Kimmy! What's the matter? \nKIMMY This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... (long pause) I gave the order. \nJULIE just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand. Then it sinks in. Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nEXT. HYPNOSPIRE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nCAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up, up, THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds, to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of the building... \n...which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES. \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT \nELEVATOR DOORS open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space-age bachelor pad of HYPNOS, God of Sleep. A giant flying CUPID welcomes us, tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft. \nHYP'S HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a party in full effect. A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS. \nMONKEYBONE Now this...is livin'. \nOf course, a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. DJ SLEEPY ZZZ'S has three turntables spinning at once. \nThe DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come. STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread. \nSTU What is this? Who's dreaming this?? (beat) Julie?? \nYETI Hey, keep it down! \nEXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY \nJULIE rolls onto her back on the grass, FACE AGLOW. Only to realize... that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER. \nShe looks around. Gets to her feet. Turns. And the BACKGROUND behind her MORPHS suddenly into... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB) \nThe room is decorated for a FAREWELL PARTY, complete with streamers and confetti. KIMMY, DR. EDELSTEIN, various MEDICAL PERSONNEL and FRIENDS are wearing party hats, lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the guest of honor...the comatose Stu! \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT \nThe DARKTOWNERS clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal excitement. It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror. \nSTU JULIE!! \nHe tries to push his way forward to the orb. An angry CYCLOPS elbows him aside. A YETI grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way. \nHAND WOMAN Stu!! What are you doing? Chill out!! \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB) \nCOMATOSE STU stands in the center of the room, UPRIGHT and IMMOBILE in a party hat. A weird UMBILICAL CORD extends from his navel to a huge groaning BELLOWS DEVICE - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps him breathing. \nEDELSTEIN hands a pair of OVERSIZED CEREMONIAL SCISSORS to KIMMY, and she CUTS THE CORD, as if opening a new mall. Applause all around. JULIE races toward STU in slo-mo, SHRIEKING - \n- as he DEFLATES into a LIMP PUDDLE OF FLESH before her eyes!! \nJULIE No. No. STU! \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - ON STU \nJULIE's distress is killing him. Yet all around him, DARKTOWNERS are cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the air like rowdy drunks at a football game. He LOSES IT ALTOGETHER. \nSTU JULIE! I'M HERE, DOC! DON'T LET THEM PULL THE PLUG! I'M HERE!!! \nHe won't be stopped this time. He makes for the orb - climbing over sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks - \nCYCLOPS HEY! Watch it, you stinkin' gringo - \nSTU JULIE! I'M HERE! I LOVE YOU! \nSomehow, JULIE has heard him!! Down in the nightmare orb, her dream self is looking UP, trying to locate the source of STU's disembodied voice! He struggles to reach the orb, but the CYCLOPS is holding him back. \nJULIE Stu? STU...? \nSTU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare. JULIE's image vanishes - and STU gropes at the air, DESPAIRING. \nINT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT \nThe real JULIE awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own. \nJULIE STU!!!! \nOnly now does she realize where she is. She's fallen asleep in the visitor's chair next to STU's bed. The clock on the wall reads 1:15 AM. \nSTU'S READOUTS are spiking like crazy. \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nSTU is being dragged across the dance floor by the YETI and JUMBO THE ELEPHANT GOD. HAND WOMAN brings up the rear. \nJUMBO Who invited this schmuck, anyway? \nHAND WOMAN Oh, it's my fault. I thought he was cooler than that. \nSTU Listen. Please. It's my girlfriend. I've gotta get a message to her... \nBut just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams... \nIn checking his watch, STU removes his hand from MONKEYBONE's mouth. The singsong resumes... \nMONKEYBONE I'm so dumb! I deserve to die - \nSTU Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do. \nHYPNOS Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick. \nSTU Maybe you could talk to Death! \nHYPNOS Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of - \nHYP shuts up. Looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being overheard. Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed. \nThey climb aboard eagerly. HYPNOS hits his remote... \nINT. HYPNOS'S BEDROOM - ON BED \n...and they rotate AWAY from the party. Privacy at last. \nHYPNOS Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I'm his little brother. \nSTU You're Death's brother? \nHYPNOS Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick. (spreading his hands) \nSo I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be grateful? \nMONKEYBONE The penthouse is pretty swank, though. \nHYPNOS Thank you. I decorated it myself. \nSTU Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to... \nHYPNOS Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it. \nSTU Hyp, I'll do anything. \nMONKEYBONE Me too. And I mean anything. Ask the chicks in the back room. \nHYPNOS You've seen those E-tickets, right? Well, what you gotta do...is go into the Land of Death... and steal an E-ticket right out from under Death's nose. \nSTU Land of Death. How do I get there? \nHYPNOS Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you didn't hear it from me. \nHYP hits the remote. The bed begins to ROTATE OUTWARD again. \nHYPNOS You've heard of a fate worse than Death? That's what's waiting for you if you screw up. \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nHYP gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up, then wanders off to shmooze his other guests. MONKEYBONE shakes STU's hand. \nMONKEYBONE Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum\u00e9. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT? \nSTU Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone. \nMONKEYBONE Stu, you have my absolute confidence. \u00ad- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!! \nSTU (grabbing him by the throat) I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. \nHe turns and stalks off. MONKEYBONE stands there blinking. \nMONKEYBONE Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it? \nSTU No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing. \nStunned, MONKEYBONE scurries along behind him, PLEADING. \nMONKEYBONE You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - (wrapping himself around STU's leg) It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!! \nSTU All right. You can come. \nMONKEYBONE OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- (suddenly realizing) Something went very, very wrong here. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SLEEP LAB - PRE-DAWN \nThe wall clock says it's not quite 3 AM, yet JULIE has managed to round up all her co-workers: ALICE, HUTCH, CLARISSA, et al. They're groggy, disheveled, un-made-up, unshaven. But they're there. \nJULIE Six hours. That's when they pull the plug. That's how long we've got to wake him up. (beat) \nNow these are Stu's old charts from five years ago, when he first came to the sleep lab... \nShe points to a series of EASELS where HUTCH and ALICE have been tacking up EEG printouts, engram maps, etc. \nJULIE ...they show incredibly intense nightmare activity. The chart below is his new chart... \nThe lower chart shows a JAGGED SPIKE virtually identical to the one on the upper chart. JULIE pauses for effect - then pulls on the edge of the lower chart, OPENING IT UP like a gatefold - \nThe onlookers GASP. Opened accordion-style, the lower chart shows the SAME SPIKE recurring again and again, TEN TIMES OVER! \nHUTCH Holy shit. \nJULIE He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. (beat) Anybody here know what Oneirix is? \nCLARISSA Sure - it's an enzyme. The brain secretes it during violent dream activity... \nHUTCH It's nightmare juice. Julie and I were on the team that learned to synthesize it. If those charts are right, Stu's swimming in the stuff. (puzzled) Are you thinking we can decrease the levels? \nJULIE No. I want to give him more. I want to give him a massive dose. \nHUTCH That's not going to stop his nightmare - \nJULIE I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake. \nThe group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky. JULIE claps her hands: \nJULIE All right! We have a plan. Let's move! \nAs the group swings into action, HUTCH pulls JULIE aside. \nHUTCH You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain. \nJULIE What'll it do if they pull the plug? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LAND OF DEATH - NIGHT \nA PANORAMIC VIEW of an impossibly grand, Gilded-Age TRAIN STATION. A central turntable is the hub for dozens of TUNNELS, which converge like the spokes of a wheel, disgorging long trains full of DEAD PASSENGERS from all over the world. \nFar above, in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted DOME that crowns the station, REAPERS on FLYING BICYCLES spiral about like mosquitos, bringing dead souls to their final reward. \nThis is Thanatopolis - land of Death - truly the end of the line. \nA WET SQUEEGEE scrapes across the frame - wielded by a GRIM REAPER in a jumpsuit bearing the logo of \"LAND OF DEATH WINDOW WASHERS, INC.\" The noise is irritating, so a REAPER on the inside snaps the venetian blinds shut, cutting off our view. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, and we realize we've been seeing all this through the wall-to-wall windows of... \nINT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nIt looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the Nautilus; the decor is ornate, and the office equipment - vacuum tubes, pipe intercoms, etc. - is on loan from the Jules Verne Museum of Defunct Technology. \nREAPERS are bustling about everywhere. One of them pushing a HAND TRUCK laden with oversized crates bearing the label \"DEAD SOULS.\" \nREAPER Batch of souls - just back from Processing. \nDEATH'S ASSISTANT Put them over there with the others. \nHe unloads the crates in a corner of the room, where SCORES of crated souls are already piled up. \nDEATH'S ASSISTANT Your Grimness? We have a new shipment - \nDEATH (o.s.) Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'll get to it... \nWe can't see DEATH himself - just the back of a tall swivel chair. With much creaking, it rotates around - bringing us face-to-face with... \nCLOSEUP - DEATH \nSince they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the sheer, monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH. \nIt's no ordinary wall. It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period - \n- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING STU against the ground underneath! \nSTU'S DREAMSCAPE \nNo bike. No monkey. Just STU - who finds himself on an operating table, with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him. The WOLF- FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS... \nSuddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip in a canvas. A FURRY PAW reaches through - GRABS STU by the hand... \nMONKEYBONE This ain't my nightmare! \nEXT. TRAINYARD - JUST OUTSIDE TUNNEL \nMONKEYBONE PULLS STU through the rip in the back of the giant toppled canvas. The bike's there waiting. They hop aboard and pedal off INTO THE DARK TOWN TUNNEL a split-second before the REAPERS arrive to slice them to ribbons. \nINT. DARK TOWN TUNNEL - ON BICYCLE \nSTU pedals so hard his heart is about to burst. He feels down at his side - the yellow pouch containing the E-ticket is still there. The REAPERS are clustered at the mouth of the tunnel, but they aren't following. \nThe boys WEEP WITH GLEE. It's a miracle - they've cheated Death! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT \nAn exhausted STU huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. He climbs off the bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have all been uphill. He slings the YELLOW POUCH over his shoulder... \nSTU You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. \nMONKEYBONE Move it. We got exactly five minutes left. \nSTU It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? \nMONKEYBONE Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine. \nSTU You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me. \nThe gates slide open. STU passes through. But MONKEYBONE lingers behind a moment - just long enough for one of the SINGING SPHINXES to slip him a big, nasty BASEBALL BAT. \nMONKEYBONE Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist. \nSTU Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y-- \nHe turns - and MONKEYBONE MARK McGWIRES HIM upside the head! STU crumples in a heap... \nMONKEYBONE Love you too. Boss. \nLaughing maniacally, MONKEYBONE STEALS the E-TICKET and goes RACING OFF DOWN THE MIDWAY!! \nSTU'S HEAD is swimming. It takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his feet. By now, MONKEYBONE is halfway to the E-ticket ride. Worse yet, STU'S WATCH reads 8:59 AM!!! \nSTU Stop! Monkeybone! Please!! \nEXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - NIGHT \nThe STREETS ARE LINED with Darktowners ROOTING MONKEYBONE ON as if he's the hometown favorite in a big footrace. Which he is. \nMONKEYBONE reaches the E-TICKET RIDE - drops his E-TICKET into the receptacle at the gate. The drawbridge lowers... \nAs STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and TRIPS HIM! Before he can get up, cackling DARKTOWNERS converge on him - forcing him back to the ground and HOLDING HIM THERE. \nSTU NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY - \nHYPNOS Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got big plans for that body of yours! \nEXT. E-TICKET RIDE - ON MONKEYBONE \nThe familiar miasma of COLORS is beginning to swirl in the night sky overhead. MONKEYBONE straps on a NEEDLE-TIPPED HELMET which makes him look like a simian DART. Then he climbs into the seat of the TEST-YOUR- STRENGTH machine and braces himself for the big ride! \nEXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - THAT MOMENT - RIGHT \nONLOOKERS APPLAUD as the robot lifts its mallet and LETS FLY. DING!! The tiny figure of MONKEYBONE soars toward the swirling colors. His DART- HELMET strikes the black hole dead center. \nHe offers STU a box of popcorn soaked in Dr. Pepper. \nSTU What is this stuff? \nSTEPHEN KING They feed us the slops from the Morpheum Theatre. You hope for Jujubes, settle for goobers. - I'm Steve. Steve King. \nSTU Stephen King? What are you doing in here? \nVarious OTHERS emerge from the shadows to shake STU's hand. \nJACK THE RIPPER I'm Jack the Ripper. \nTYPHOID MARY Typhoid Mary. \nATILLA THE HUN Atilla the Hun. Trade you a Twizzler for a box of Raisinets! \nSTU Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place? \nAs if in reply, a FANFARE sounds in the distance... \nINT. DUNGEON - ENTRANCE \nA RAT GUARD stands at attention by the door, TOOTING HIS KAZOO to announce the arrival of an honored guest. \nRAT GUARD All hail the most glorious! Most eminent! Most esteemed all-powerful God of Sleep...his Royal Lassitude - \nHYPNOS Enough, enough, I'm hung over. \nAs HYPNOS passes, the DUNGEON DWELLERS race up to the WALL OF BARS that separates the entry area from the dungeon proper. \nTYPHOID MARY Hyp! Did you bring me the cough medicine? \nSTEPHEN KING Did you remember the night light I asked for? \nEDGAR ALLAN POE King, you pussy. \nSTEPHEN KING Bite me, Poe! I hate waking up in the dark. \nHYPNOS Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ? \nSTU YOU SET ME UP!! \nSTU LUNGES at HYPNOS - who backs up just out of reach. \nHYPNOS Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? \nSTU Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? \nHYPNOS It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan! \nSTU But why me? Why'd you pick on me?? \nHYPNOS The monkey, of course. It was his idea. \nSTU Monkeybone...!? \nHYPNOS Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want. \nSTU You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons?? \nHYPNOS Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice! \nSTU's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan. \nHYPNOS Oh, we're predicting a record box-office. It's like I always say...nightmares are your best entertainment! \nHYPNOS marches off, chuckling. STU's head sinks into his hands. \nEXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nSTU's back from the hospital. JULIE is removing his bags from the trunk of KIMMY's car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat. \nKIMMY I just couldn't stand the thought of you suffering. I love you so, I would never have... forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me. \nSTU-BONE Kimmy. Chill. We've still got a pact. If anything ever happens to you, I'll be right there to return the favor. (baring his teeth) So drive carefully! From now on. \nSTU-BONE Ohhh, nothing. \nShe tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her around. He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls it closed around the two of them. They kiss... \nJULIE You sure this is...medically advisable? \nSTU-BONE Got a doctor on duty. \nJULIE Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone - \nSTU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock. What does she mean??? \nJULIE (glancing downward) \n- which it seems to be. \nSTU-BONE does a take. The good news is, she doesn't suspect. The bad news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis. \nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nAll at once the air is full of Barry White's lush baritone on the bedroom CD player. Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single robe. \nThe only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his mistress about the imposter in STU's body. The dog is almost drowning out Barry White - \n- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT. \nINT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nJULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJ's, going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE. He circles back and forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting, FEINTING at her occasionally. \nJULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but in fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up on the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way. \nNow he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal howl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE! \nTerrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the headboard. \nJULIE Oh, God!! Baby! Are you - \nDazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand. \nEXT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nJULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway. \nSTU How was it? I don't recall. \nJULIE It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER. \nAs they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his balance and topples down the stairs O.S. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DUNGEON - NIGHT \nRASPUTIN, ATILLA, JACK THE RIPPER and STEPHEN KING are engrossed in their weekly Parcheesi game. STU is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his fate. \nSTU I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular guy! I'm not a \"nightmare maker.\" \nRASPUTIN Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked just like you. The guys who replaced us are the nightmare makers! \nATTILA Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia. I just wanted a new recipe for yak! \nJACK THE RIPPER I was Jack the Haberdasher. \nSTU But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments? ...Monkeys?? \nSTEPHEN KING Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog. Go through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds up in my body? That darn Cujo. \nTYPHOID MARY runs past, GIGGLING, pursued by a huffing HITCHCOCK. \nRASPUTIN He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes. \nKAZOOS SOUND. The RAT GUARD appears to announce: \nRAT GUARD Miley. You got a visitor. \nJULIE What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising! \nSTU-BONE Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a potload of money here. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nSUPERCHARGED POP MUSIC underneath as STU-BONE comes running around a corner - followed, a moment later, by a SCREAMING HORDE of BEAUTIFUL GROUPIES in black miniskirts and high heels. It's like something out of \nA Hard Day's Night, only more so. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTIGHT on STU-BONE, head still bandaged, eyes closed, SNORING slightly. He wears a big monkey grin as he DREAMS the above. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS. They kill their engine in the middle of a busy intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE. \nHe cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and FLATTENS HIMSELF behind a dumpster. As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief and MOPS SWEAT from his brow. \nThen, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES. A CATFIGHT ensues as they scramble after this precious memento. The chase resumes. \nSuddenly he realizes he's SLOWING DOWN...running in SLO-MO. Same deal with the girls on his trail. After a moment, he FREEZES. He can't move anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down... \n...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of him! HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving. He strolls right up to the frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY, Moe Howard-style. \nHYPNOS You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? We didn't send you up here to shake your booty and chase broads. We sent you up to make nightmares!! \nSTU-BONE tries to speak. All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL. \nHYPNOS Now find that nightmare juice and get to work. 'Cause you may be a free man during the day... but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine! \nHe winds up - throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at STU-BONE'S FACE. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSTU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed. For a moment he's relieved - it was all a dream. Then he realizes his FACE is swelling like a prizefighter's. His front tooth is loose. BLOOD is streaming from his nose! \nSTU-BONE Eep! \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nHe's awake, fully dressed, and fishing around in the pocket of JULIE's topcoat. He finds her KEY RING and tiptoes furtively to the front door. \nSTU-BONE Friggin' Hypnos. I'll show him... \nINT. SLEEP LAB - NIGHT \nHe unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. Finds the dispensary area and kneels beside a LOCKED REFRIGERATOR. Then he shuffles through the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled \"FRIDGE.\" \nOn the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label \"ONEIRIX\" with red DANGER stickers all over it. STU-BONE takes it out, flashes a sinister grin, and EMPTIES ITS CONTENTS into a similar beaker. Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it. \nHe's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of SIMIAN GRUNTS and SQUEAKS - which are TRANSLATED in SUBTITLE: \nFEMALE BABOON Hey, handsome. \nHe turns and spots a SEDUCTIVE FEMALE BABOON who's confmed to a CAGE in the corner. The conversation continues in MONKEY TALK. \nFEMALE BABOON Yeah, you. Come here, good-looking. (beat) Why don't you let me out of this cage? \nSTU-BONE Hey, I'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot water. \nFEMALE BABOON (caressing his chin) I know how to be very, very grateful. \nHe pulls out a MATCHBOOK and scribbles a number on it. \nSTU-BONE Tell you what, angel. When you get out, give me a call... \nA LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! STU-BONE tries to dive for cover, but the FEMALE BABOON grabs him by the belt and pulls him against the cage. \nStartled, he drops the ONEIRIX BEAKER - which rolls out into the hall! \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nShe looks up at him, feline eyes aglow. There's a three-foot-long RODENT'S TAIL dangling out of her mouth. \nSTU I'll really...never...forget you. \nHe races off as KITTY resumes her feast. The sound of fighting has roused the other DUNGEON DWELLERS, and when they realize the dungeon door is open they come rushing out en masse. \nThen the PANEL opens. They hear FOOD raining down behind them. HITCHCOCK is the first to turn back - then STEPHEN KING - then ATILLA. A moment later they're back to their old habits, climbing over one another to get at a half-empty box of Raisinets. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. SLEEP LAB - DAY \nThe usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals, etc. JULIE is coolly reading NOTEBOOK ENTRIES into a TAPE RECORDER. \nJULIE \"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet.\" \nALICE They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet. \nCLARISSA Great lead. I'll try and find it on the net. \nJULIE \"4/18: Subject climbs backyard tree...to perform elimination. When confronted with product... blames it on family dog.\" \nDEAD SILENCE from the mortified group. They never had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. JULIE somehow keeps a stiff upper lip - deeply embarrassed for STU, but a scientist nonetheless. \nHUTCH Seems perfectly obvious. He's been possessed by a monkey! \nThe others all GLOWER at HUTCH for this egregious display of bad taste. \nEXT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON \nSTU-BONE and HERB are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a crew of ZOO WORKERS load MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a pickup. \nHERB You're really gonna pop the question? \nSTU-BONE Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pi\u00f1ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts. \nHERB I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit. \nSTU-BONE Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you. \nHERB wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nJULIE is getting dressed for the benefit when the PHONE RINGS. \nJULIE Hello? Oh, Hutch - what? \nINTERCUT - JULIE AND HUTCH \nHUTCH is at the sleep lab, standing over the open refrigerator. \nHUTCH The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!! \nJULIE Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to - \nHer eyes move to the WINDOW - to STU-BONE out by the garage. \nJULIE Okay. Call the police. I'll be right over. \nINT. SLEEP LAB - LATE AFTERNOON \nTwo DETECTIVES examining the scene of the crime. \nJULIE The technical name is Oneirix. It's an enzyme. It's present in the brains of - \nDETECTIVE (cutting her off; writing) Yeah, yeah...Nightmare juice. \nDETECTIVE II And there's been no sign of a break-in? \nHUTCH Holy shit...the pants. (remembering) The janitor found a pair of torn-up pants. It was the same night the monkey tipped her cage over. Remember that, Julie? \nJULIE (suddenly afraid) Yeah...I remember it vividly. \nEXT. ZOO - DAY \nLEAD SURGEON I think it can still be saved. Put it on ice. \nEXT. ZOO - DAY \nGUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and habitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON. \nEXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY \nThe BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a tree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He sputters and coughs... \nThen he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them chase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in her formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification. \nEXT. STU'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY \nO.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in. \nINT. HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY \nO.D. STU rushes frantically from room to room. \nO.D. STU (o.s.) DOC? DOC?? - JULIE? \nNo reply - the joint's empty. O.D. STU enters the studio and spots a NEWSPAPER on his drafting table. The paper is folded back to a big DISPLAY AD for the benefit: \"MEET STU MILEY AND MONKEYBONE - 8 PM TONIGHT!\" He checks the wall clock: time is short. \nReaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a TACKLE BOX which contains old brushes...and a small VELVET BOX. O.D. STU opens the velvet box to reveal Grandma's ANTIQUE RING. \nHe hears GROWLING behind him - it's BUSTER. The dog looks up, cocks his head - and begins WAGGING HIS TAIL. Somehow, even though STU's in a different body, BUSTER recognizes him. \nEXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nO.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit - barking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along! \nA BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws everything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU. \nEXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY \nAs HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his face. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off ...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement... \nPOV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION \nThe nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at once he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!! \nEXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY \nJULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the food court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA. \nJULIE Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it. \nCLARISSA That's not true, Julie. It's not true. \nALICE This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could be innocent people in danger. \nCLARISSA He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu. (beat) I didn't want to tell you this, but the other day he pinched me on the butt. \nALICE I didn't want to tell you this, but the other day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you have to tell the police. \nJULIE Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete. All I have is a feeling. \nAll of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the reptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers. \nCLARISSA Oh my God, we've got a flasher. \nJULIE That...that's Herb! \nThe GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and CLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC: \nHERB CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working together. All of them. Shirts...pants... ENSEMBLES...! \nThe three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR. \nINT. MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON \nPASSENGERS are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the BELL ROPE to alert the driver that they want off. As we move toward the back we see O.D. STU sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side. \nHe looks rough. He's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with blood, and he never did find any shoes. Also, it's a hot night and he's starting to get a little ripe. FLIES are buzzing all around him. \nGUEST HEY MONKEYBONE!! \nSTU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd. \nSTU-BONE That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party! \nBy the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished! \nEXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON \nShe races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD. \nJULIE Please. Where did you take that man...? \nThe GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet... \nJULIE Who are you? Why did you say those things? \nO.D. STU Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he got my body, see? All they had left for me was this corpse! \nJULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away. \nO.D. STU Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give people nightmares! (no response) \nDoc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They were pulling the plug - I called out to you - and you heard me. Remember? \nThis stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single tear rolling down her cheek. And then... \nJULIE BUSTER?!? \nThe dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van, barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns - \nJULIE Stu...how? \nO.D. STU I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you this. \nTHROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's antique ring. \nO.D. STU I meant to give it to you before. The night we crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to remember me like that, okay? Not like this. \nShe slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise. \nJULIE What's wrong? \nO.D. STU I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm all dried up. \nJULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over. \nALICE Detective, please let this man out of the van. \nEXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PI\u00d1ATA AREA - THAT MOMENT \nThe PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PI\u00d1ATA, which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear... \nSTU-BONE Okay, folks, it's pi\u00f1ata time - you know the rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's all for the benefit of our friends the animals! (eyes brightening) Oooooh! This one's on me! \nThe next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat. \nSTU-BONE Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up! \nSuddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - \n- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS... \nORGANIZER I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit. Surely this can wait until - \nCOP Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on a most urgent matter. \nJULIE Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered with. They're toxic! \nO.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE. \nO.D. STU MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK. \nThe old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it. \nIt lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he can reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL TIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but a TIGER gets the other end - \n- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver... \nHEAD SURGEON Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved. \nANGLE ON BALLOON \nSTU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision ...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both ends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP... \nEXT. FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean punch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful when STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the table, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base... \n...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END... \n...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the SURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE CHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest... \n... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pi\u00f1ata, loading CONFISCATED MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill! \nThe COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE underneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs. \nThe HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got BEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse. \nHEAD SURGEON Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved! \nEXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON \nCOPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full of confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes ass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT... \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT \nHYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb. They see a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS, with clubs and spearguns, amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS. \nHYPNOS Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!! \nAERIAL SHOT - STU'S POV - MOVING \nSTU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE. He begins FEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when it's long enough, begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO! \nEXT. WATER BUFFALO HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON \nWATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them around the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds! \nANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE \nThe balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward, toward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically! \nEXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON \nA COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon. \nCOP I think I can bring 'em down. \nANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON \nBLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass. With a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE snaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air! \nON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - AERIAL \nAT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of the gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN... \nTHEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE \n...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up fast! \nEXT. ZOO - ON JULIE & CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON \nJULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward. \nON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - FALLING \n...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud. \nTheir BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling... \n", "test1_input": "JULIE I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand.

She settles in on the floor beside ALICE and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a quickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for... \nALICE Monkeybone? \nJULIE Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. (shrugging) And then the nightmares just...stopped. \nALICE Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with? \nJULIE smiles at the cartoon. She isn't telling. \nJULIE I've put a ton of work into that boy, Alice. I am not going to let him get away from me. \nINT. ICU - MORNING \nJULIE, in her white lab coat, wanders through Intensive Care and finds a WOMAN hunched over STU's bed, BAWLING HER EYES OUT. \nJULIE Kimmy...? \nKIMMY looks up. She's crying so much she can barely recognize JULIE. \nKIMMY Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother... \nJULIE When'd you get in? \nKIMMY An hour ago. (gathering herself) I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like this. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay? \nJULIE I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine. \nKIMMY I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring. \nJULIE The ring... \nKIMMY Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked me to send it to him - \nJULIE turns to look at STU in the bed. The certain knowledge that he was about to propose is like a knife in her heart. KIMMY feels bad as well, having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out - \nVOICE FROM BEHIND Mrs. Brewster? Julie? I'm Dr. Edelstein. \nCheery DR. EDELSTEIN enters. He shakes hands with the women, then checks STU's readouts, making notations on his clipboard. \nDR. EDELSTEIN Vital signs have stabilized. That's good. \nKIMMY Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances? \nDR. EDELSTEIN He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see. \nKIMMY But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right? \nThis remark sends a shiver down JULIE's spine, but she keeps silent. \nDR. EDELSTEIN At the moment, yes. \nKIMMY Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last? \nDR. EDELSTEIN Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now... \nKIMMY Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it - \nJULIE Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a - \nKIMMY Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a long time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out. \nJULIE It's too soon even to - talk about that! \nKIMMY Give me a date, Doctor. \nDR. EDELSTEIN Three months. (pause) \nThere's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day. \nKIMMY I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months. \nNo one says anything. But both women look at STU, and then at each other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands.

In a desperate, feeble attempt to buy time...he begins to SING. \nGEORGE I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair! \nIn fact he goes into a little softshoe, keeping the briefcase poised over his crotch.

Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then. \nBULL Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini. \nSTU I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares. And of course, I need not add - \nHe GRIMACES at MONKEYBONE, who's stretched out atop the mighty Wurlitzer at the other end of the room. The MERMAID CHANTEUSE is singing a Dietrich number, \"The Laziest Gal in Town\" - or at least trying to, because MONKEYBONE is caterwauling behind her. By the time she gets to the grand finale, he's practically BAYING AT THE MOON. \nPissed off, she SHAKES her FIST at MONKEYBONE and pulls the lid of her clamshell SHUT. This suits MONKEYBONE just fine, as it leaves him alone in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is. \nMONKEYBONE Thank you, thank you for that very modest \nresponse. I know you're all in comas, but still. And now...it's dedication time! \nHe gestures to JUMBO, the elephant organist, who begins to vamp. \nMONKEYBONE We've got a special dedication tonight. This one's from my ever-lovin' boss, Mr. Stu Mopey - I mean Miley - and we're sendin' it up to a very special lady in the land of the living. Yes, I do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie - who, if she has a brain in her head, is shacked up right now with some good-lookin' doc she met in the E.R.! (pointing at STU) JUST KIDDING, BUDDY! Because if we know anything about Miss Julie, we know she is faithful, loyal, and true. Even if her boyfriend is an eggplant. Which is why we're dedicating...this very special tune...to her. Jumbo? \nJUMBO's tasteful vamping gives way to a RAUNCHY ROCK BEAT - and MONKEYBONE begins STRUTTING across the top of the piano, bumping and grinding and shaking his booty to the tune of - \nMONKEYBONE MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH! MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH! \nMONKEYBONE sings the same poignant line over and over until STU comes storming over from the bar and YANKS HIM off the Wurlitzer by the scruff of his scrawny NECK. \nA trouper to the end, MONKEYBONE WAVES at the crowd even as STU drags him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room. \nSTU You have humiliated me in public for the last \ntime. \nMONKEYBONE I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination. \nSTU Then you can learn to act normally. I had to! \nMONKEYBONE Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me. \nSTU I am not. And I don't gotta. \nMONKEYBONE waves and winks at every female who passes by. STU whacks him upside the head. \nMONKEYBONE You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't count. \nSTU Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my species. \nCocktail waitress KITTY, a seven-foot cat-faced feline sex bomb, arrives in her skimpy black dress and shows STU a Cheshire-cat grin.

REAPERS drop what they're doing, point at the boys. Panic time! \nNearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch, YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war. \nSTU's bigger.

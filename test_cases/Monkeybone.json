{"test1_input": "INT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nSTU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter past outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around. \nThe bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV bottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny Mercer's \"DREAM.\" And over at the BAR... \nBULL (o.s.) New in town, huh? What're you drinking? \nOut of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns away to grab a fresh glass. \nSTU Chasing me - animals - horrible - \nBULL Animals? What kind of animals? \nSTU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a BULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side. \nBULL Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking? \nSTU Uhh - martini? \nBULL Olive or eyeball? \nSTU Olive. - Where exactly am I? \nBULL Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. \nSTU Stu Miley. \nBULL Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here. \nSTU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES. \nBULL I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on every channel...all the stuff people dream, after they have the extra anchovies. \nHe changes channels with a remote. Now we see a guy falling through midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling... \nSTU Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. \nBULL Sad commentary, huh? \nNow a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STU'S BACKPACK: \nDISEMBODIED VOICE (o.s.) \"Bull,\" huh? That's cute. What's your last name - \"Shit\"?? \nBULL (turning angrily to STU) I beg your pardon? \nSTU I didn't say anything. \nVOICE (o.s.) Nice face. Lemme guess. You were in a bullfight ...with a Mack Truck!! \nSTU claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking. BULL glowers at him, snorting STEAM out of both nostrils. \nSTU I was, uh, just getting ready to leave... \nBULL Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist here. \nThe ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over. \nVOICE (o.s.) Well, hello, sailor. Get a lot of dates with that ding-dong on your face?? \nBULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STU'S LIGHTS OUT. He's saying his prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL FURRY BEAST pops out, CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF!! \nMONKEYBONE Just kiddin', folks! Drinks for everybody - (pointing at STU) \nOn him!! HIYA, BOSS!! \nBULL and JUMBO back off, STUNNED. The monkey grabs STU'S FACE and plants a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE. STU SCREAMS. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON an EEG monitor. There's a sudden BLIP on the readout. \nNURSE Just a spike, ma'am. It happens. It's perfectly natural with coma patients. \n", "test1_true": "JULIE strokes STU's limp hand. He's COMATOSE, cocooned in a tangle of wires and tubes. His head and shoulders are heavily bandaged. He's hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room. \nDOCTOR Go home, Doctor. Rest. Come back when you can do us some good. \nINT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nDead on her feet, JULIE stumbles toward the exit. As she's leaving she passes the WAITING ROOM - \nWOMAN'S VOICE Julie? \nShe turns and sees an older colleague from work - ALICE - waiting in the doorway. Hovering right behind ALICE is HERB. And behind him - \nIt appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of JULIE and STU's. Disheveled and groggy, they rouse themselves and make their way over to JULIE's side. She's overcome with emotion. \nINT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT \nThe sound of the key in the lock is met by INSANE BARKING. JULIE and ALICE enter and are met by BUSTER, the pet basset - jumping and yipping like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company. \nALICE Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over. \nJULIE Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food... \nALICE kneels to play with the dog. She hears a sudden GASP from the kitchen. JULIE is standing by the open refrigerator, wearing an absolutely stricken expression... \nINT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nALICE finds JULIE holding a bottle of champagne - Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame 1989 - all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon. \nALICE Special occasion? \nJULIE I don't know. I guess it was... \nShe bursts into tears. ALICE sits her down at the kitchen table and takes the champagne from her. \nALICE Don't get all poignant. We're keeping this bottle on ice. When he comes around you're going to need it. \nINT. BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT \nA limp JULIE soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. On the vanity is a framed PHOTO STRIP, four poses for a dollar. In the first three, STU and JULIE are making outrageously goony faces. In the fourth, they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from American Gothic. \nShe gazes at it for a long, long time. Eventually she smiles. \nINT. SECOND BEDROOM/STUDIO - NIGHT \nOPEN on two PHOTOS, mounted in a single frame. On the left, BUSTER KEATON, droopy-eyed, in his familiar porkpie hat and vest. On the right, a Photoshopped image of BUSTER THE BASSETT HOUND, in the same pose, also wearing Keaton's hat and vest. \nThese photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as STU's studio and JULIE's office. MONKEYBONE STRIPS are scattered across the drafting table. ALICE is making up the sofa as a guest bed. \nAs she's hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an ACRYLIC CANVAS in the back, stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full of spiral-bound sketchbooks. She pulls it out. She's obviously disturbed by it, but she can't tear her eyes away... \nShe's still gaping at the painting when JULIE enters in a terrycloth robe. \nALICE Who did this? \nJULIE Stu. That was right about the time we met. \nALICE When he first came in to the sleep lab? \nJULIE Yeah...before your time. \nThe canvas depicts a group of SURGEONS with the faces of wolves. They're standing over a HUMAN PATIENT, replacing his internal organs with MACHINE PARTS. The style is at once cartoony and unsettling. \nALICE Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing him, but I never realized what you cured him from. \nJULIE He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... (chuckling) \nThat boy looked like pluperfect hell. \nALICE's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the MONKEYBONE strips tacked up over the drafting table. \nALICE How do you get from here - to there? \nJULIE Switch hands. \nALICE What? \n", "test1_id": 1077, "test2_input": "MONKEYBONE I'd like something with an umbrella in it and a really smutty name. Like a...Sex Behind the Sofa with Your Parents in the Same Room Watching \"The Brady Bunch.\" \nSTU Nothing for him! He's being repressed. \nKITTY Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense. \nMONKEYBONE Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me. \nSTU I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name? \nKITTY Hypnos? \nSTU Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. \nA softie at heart, KITTY sits across from STU and takes his hand. \nSTU I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least she'd know how I feel. That way she'd...wait for me. \nShe leans forward sympathetically. From this particular vantage, MONKEYBONE has an unobstructed view of KITTY's cleavage. And so does STU - although he's not quite as obvious about staring. \nKITTY She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. Guys like you don't come along that often. Believe me, I know. \nMONKEYBONE slinks over behind STU - up onto his shoulder - and whispers into his ear: \nMONKEYBONE My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before. \nSTU (trying to ignore him) \nI'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying? \nKITTY I mean it, Stu. You're one in a million. \nKITTY is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time. Her furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air. It's hypnotic - like a windshield wiper. \nSTU stares at it. MONKEYBONE stares at it. And MONKEYBONE'S TAIL responds by straightening...stiffening...bending upward slightly. \nSTU I'm not so special. I'm just - kind of - \nSTU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his shoulder. It's a TONGUE...dangling out of MONKEYBONE'S OPEN MOUTH. STU lets out a YOWL OF SHOCK. \nBlushing bright red, he GRABS THE TONGUE and shoves it manually back into the monkey mouth whence it came. \nMONKEYBONE Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment! \nSTU THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK! \nMONKEYBONE FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING - \nSTU LUNGES at MONKEYBONE - who JUMPS OVER HIM, BOUNDS off the edge of the table, and grabs hold of a CHANDELIER. \nMONKEYBONE I'm reportin' this to my union!! \nSTU What union? \nMONKEYBONE The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass! \nSTU grabs a CHAIR and swings it at the chandelier. MONKEYBONE makes a series of SUBMARINE NOISES - \nMONKEYBONE DIVE! DIVE!! \n- and DIVES - directly between KITTY's breasts into her skimpy black dress!! STU circles around KITTY, following the undulating monkey-sized BLOB that's tunnelling around under her dress. Finally MONKEYBONE pops out of the BACK of the dress and NUZZLES KITTY'S EAR: \nMONKEYBONE I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic. \nSTU Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey. \nMONKEYBONE runs under the pool table. STU is giving chase when - suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind. \nEVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place. \nFor there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most dreaded figure in all of Dark Town - \n- a GRIM REAPER, nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some hapless coma victim to the land of Death! \nEERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the REAPER looks from face to face. For a moment he focuses on STU. STU backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread...and MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully. \n", "test2_true": "MONKEYBONE Him. Whew. About time! \nREAPER EARL BIEGLER. I'VE COME - \nEARL Can't hear you, young fellow. Speak up! \nREAPER EARL BIEGLER, I'VE COME TO GIVE YOU - aw, hell. Here. \nGASPS OF ANTICIPATION all around the room as the REAPER hands EARL a long white ENVELOPE. EARL opens it slowly and removes... \n...an oversized rectangular TICKET...the size of a Hershey bar, made of SOLID GOLD, with the letter \"E\" stamped upon it. \nVARIOUS CHARACTERS around the barroom react, in hushed voices: \nBULL An E-Ticket! \nPATRON He got a reprieve. \nKITTY Good for him! He's gonna wake up! \nEARL throws his crutches aside, jumps out of his chair, and DANCES A JIG, waving the ticket over his head. STU stares at him with naked envy. \nSTU No. No. Not him. \nEARL So long, suckers! See you in the funny papers! \nEARL does an end-zone dance toward the door. One by one, OTHER PATRONS get up from their seats to watch EARL's departure. \nEXT. COMA BAR - STREETS - NIGHT \nThe COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway. \nIt's a \"TEST YOUR STRENGTH\" machine - the kind where you slam down a mallet and try to ring the bell. It's surrounded by crocodile moats and storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading PRIVATE - NO ADMITTANCE. \nEARL, still jubilant, inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the entrance. A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS, and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up, and CARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on, and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky... \nAll around them, faces turn skyward. CLOUDS are parting. An EDDY of swirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - and a PINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center. \nThe \"TEST YOUR STRENGTH\" machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where the bell-ringer should be. Once EARL has settled in, a GIANT MECHANICAL MAN lifts its enormous mallet... \n...and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine, sending EARL ROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky. DING!! The SEAT hits the BELL, but EARL keeps going - up - up - UP... \nThen, with a distinct POP, he's gone. Over the rainbow...home. \nSTU He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come he goes back and I stay here? \nMONKEYBONE Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket? \nSTU (turning abruptly) HEY!! HEY, YOU!! \nSTU marches across the street to the GRIM REAPER - who's climbing onto his WINGED BICYCLE and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with him. MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified. \nSTU He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get \nto wake up?? \nMONKEYBONE Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper. \nSTU I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna kick ass! \nMONKEYBONE Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass. \nMONKEYBONE practically swoons. But the REAPER just stares at STU: \nREAPER SORRY, BUD. OFF-DUTY. \nThe REAPER climbs onto his winged bike and PEDALS OFF down the midway. STU lets out a HOWL OF FRUSTRATION. \nMONKEYBONE Stu? Stu? Let's calm down, talk things over. How about some comedy relief? Okay. Brontosaurus walks into a gay bar... \nSTU BOOTS MONKEYBONE aside. They're at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie the Cow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. STU picks up a baseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER. \nThe ball hits the REAPER smack on the head, knocking him off his bike! \nSTU/MONKEYBONE (in unison - impressed) Damn. \n", "test2_id": 1078, "test3_input": "MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them. But STU isn't intimidated. He grabs another ball and winds up. \nMONKEYBONE Stu? Stu? I think weve got this backwards. Your behavior...is disturbing me. \nThe REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as the ball whizzes past. STU starts chasing after him! \nThe REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of the \"fingers\" of the hand that holds Dark Town. When the bike hits the end of the finger, it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING. \nSTU That's right. Run! And don't come back unless you've got my e-ticket!! \nThe REAPER vanishes. STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb. \nSTU Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of here. I'll never see her again. \nJust then, a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on a CHILD'S SCOOTER. He stops... \nMESSENGER BOY Miley? Stu Miley? \nSTU looks up. Six arms reach into six pockets. Finally the MESSENGER finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over. Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION: \nYOU Are Invited to a PAJAMA PARTY at HYPNOS' HIDEAWAY Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp \"If You Snooze, You Lose\" \nSTU'S EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off. \nSTU Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to hear my case. I'm going home! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - MORNING \nAs she's done every morning for the last three months, JULIE brushes STU'S TEETH. Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around STU - on the off chance that he might be aware of her presence. \nShe packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek. \nJULIE I think we can go another day without shaving. Long as you don't look like you're growing one of those stupid little goatees. \nShe opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper. \nJULIE Hey, there's an article about the Monkeybone show. They've run that one episode about eight times now. Herb says it gets higher ratings every time...they're hoping you'll give 'em some new material soon... (long, bored pause) Wanna hear another joke? \nShe refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback entitled The Book of Raunch. She pages through it for a moment. \nJULIE Okay...let me see...here we go. A plane full of explorers crashlands in New Guinea; they are captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the chief's hut, where...wait a minute. I know this one... (reading ahead) \nYou stinker! You swiped this joke for a Monkeybone strip! \nShe whacks him on the arm with the book. No response at all. \nJULIE Okay. Let's try again. Why did the pervert cross the road? \nThe sound of SOBBING interrupts her joke. She looks up and sees KIMMY standing in the doorway, red-eyed and crying. \nJULIE Kimmy! What's the matter? \nKIMMY This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... (long pause) I gave the order. \nJULIE just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand. Then it sinks in. Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nEXT. HYPNOSPIRE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nCAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up, up, THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds, to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of the building... \n...which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES. \nINT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT \nELEVATOR DOORS open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space-age bachelor pad of HYPNOS, God of Sleep. A giant flying CUPID welcomes us, tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft. \nHYP'S HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a party in full effect. A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS. \nMONKEYBONE Now this...is livin'. \nOf course, a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. DJ SLEEPY ZZZ'S has three turntables spinning at once. \n", "test3_true": "MONKEYBONE Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that. \nSTU Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...doodle. \nScowling at each other, the boys turn their backs and part ways. We follow MONKEYBONE to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into a statuesque GORGON with a full head of writhing SNAKES. \nMONKEYBONE Hey! Like the do. So tell me, are you a, uhh... natural snakehead? \nGORGON Only fifty dollars to find out. \nMONKEYBONE Fifty dollars?! Bite me! \nGORGON You got it, big boy. \nHe grins and shrugs: what the hell. As they head for a back room, the BARTENDER hands him a SNAKEBITE KIT. \nA look of apprehension crosses MONKEYBONE's face. But before he can change his mind, the GORGON'S HAND yanks him out of frame. \nSTU, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering animal-people who DANCE in their bizarre, uninhibited way. A FIVE-LEGGED WOMAN - the bottom half of her body a big human HAND - SMILES at STU as he passes. He tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five constantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close. \nSTU Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos? \nHAND WOMAN Hyp? He was here a while ago. Aren't you Stu Miley? The nightmare guy? \nSTU grins meekly, nods yes. She pulls him over to dance. \nHAND WOMAN I heard you were going to be here tonight. This is so cool! \nJUMBO the ELEPHANT GOD is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby. His trunk swings out and hits one of the HAND WOMAN'S arms - which SNAPS OFF like marble statuary. Before she can let out a squeal, he does it again. Now she's armless - a regular Venus de Milo! \nHAND WOMAN You fat slob! Watch what you're doing! \nJUMBO Why don't you slap me? Go on, slap me! \nHAND WOMAN Come on, Stu. Let's go where the real fun is. \nShe leads him over to the sunken living room. Among the other guests, we see a CYCLOPS, a YETI, a BBQ PIG. A number of sofas and lounge chairs are arranged around a big crystal ORB in the center of the room. \nThe ORB is where nightmares happen. Although the perspective shifts and the locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a 3-D quality - as if they're taking place right here in the room with us! \nSTU Wow. Live feed, huh? \nHAND WOMAN You bet. Hyp gets all the best stuff before it goes out to the theatres. \nSTU grins in anticipation. He finds an empty chair and starts to sit down - but there's a SLUG with a MAN'S HEAD already in it! \nSLUG WITH A MAN'S HEAD HEY! \nSTU Sorry. \nSTU picks another seat. The HAND WOMAN sidles up alongside him. \nHAND WOMAN Shh! There's a new one just starting. \nEXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) \nIn long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints. Emerging from a sylvan glade, they kiss in golden sunlight. Then the MAN breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of the field, where a picnic blanket is waiting. \nCLOSEUP - STU \nHIS FACE GOES PALE as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt. \nSTU That - that's me. \nCYCLOPS Nice shirt, dude! \nEXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY \nPaisley-shirted STU pours champagne for two. Toasts his beloved - who is, of course, JULIE, the dreamer of the dream. \nHe pulls out a little velvet RING BOX and offers it to her. But when she tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and STEALS A KISS. \nSuddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together through the flowers, LAUGHING, full of joy. \nINT.

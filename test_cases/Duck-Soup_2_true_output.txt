GROUCHO Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself - 
CUT OUTSIDE to Chico standing by his peanut stand which has a whistle on it conspicuously displayed - 
CHICO (Singing loudly) "P-E-A-N-U-T-S" 
CLOSE UP of whistle piping tune of "PEANUT VENDOR" - Trentino enters to Chico - 
CHICO (To Trentino) How'm I doing, boss? 
TRENTINO Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin? 
CHICO He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S 
Singing even louder than before - Trentino smirks approvingly and exits - the whistling of the tune following as we CUT inside to Groucho - and the well-known vamp of the "Peanut Vendor" is heard coming over scene with orchestra accompaniment... 
GROUCHO (Glaring angrily at window) I'll get rid of that pest - watch me -- 
He walks determinedly in direction of window and breaks into a rhumba - with hands on hips - dipping to ground a la Spanish dancer... as he reaches window we CUT outside.  Groucho is seen in the window - which is on the ground floor - Chico is by his peanut stand. 
GROUCHO (To Chico - angrily) Hey you!! 
CHICO All right - 
Chico takes bag of peanuts from stand - throws it to Groucho - The latter catches bag and throws Chico a dime - then starts to eat the peanuts. 
GROUCHO Have you got a license? 
CHICO No, but my dog he's a got millions of them -- 
GROUCHO (Munching peanuts as Chico walks over and stands under window) What kind of a dog is he? 
CHICO He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic -- 
GROUCHO Well - what is he now? 
CHICO He's half poodle and half watch dog - 
GROUCHO Half watch dog? 
CHICO Yeh, he's only got one eye. 
GROUCHO I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash - (Gives him a look of disgust) Look - what do you call your dog?

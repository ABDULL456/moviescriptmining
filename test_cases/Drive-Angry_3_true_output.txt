Milton climbs from the GTO and crosses toward the overturned Dodge. He lets the shotgun dangle at his side, keeping it hidden behind him. TATTOOED GUY and SKANKY GAL stand near the RV with MAN IN LEATHER JACKET. BUSINESS WOMAN paces on her cell phone. Milton glances at MAN WITH WIG sitting in the driver's seat of his station wagon, his face in his hands. LADY IN LEOPARDSKIN HOTPANTS kneels beside him. In the passenger seat, BURLY DUDE's on his phone. Watching Milton. There's a couple near the overturned Dodge. TRUCK DRIVING WOMAN gazes into the upsidedown cab. THIN OLD MAN rises and nods as Milton approaches. 
THIN OLD MAN I think he's gonna be okay. 
MILTON Is that right? In a swift move, Milton RATCHETS a shell into the chamber, drops to one knee, aims into the cab. 
MILTON'S POV The cab is empty. Somewhere near, we hear a MUFFLED BABY'S CRY. 
CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE Realization. Shit. But it's too late. A snub-nosed .38 appears at his temple. 
THIN OLD MAN I wouldn't. 
PIPER (O.S.) Milton! Milton rises slowly and takes in the situation. Tattooed Guy comes up fast behind the GTO. We get a good look at him. It's Man with Shovel. Piper's getting out, doesn't see Tattooed Guy until he's grabbed her. Presses the pistol in her ribs. 
PIPER Hey! Let me go, fucker! She goes to fight but Man in Leather Jacket approaches her with an axe. Burly Dude is with him. 
MILTON Don't Piper! (to Thin Old Man) Let her go. She's a pain in the ass you don't want. Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun. 
THIN OLD MAN Drop it. Or we'll gut her. To emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo Knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile. Milton drops the shotgun as -- --Man With Wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting rifle. Lady in Leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat with nails and spikes protruding from the end. Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV's door. Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He cradles a baby in his arms. 
JONAH KING Milton, isn't it? Why are you here? Why are you making such a fuss? 
MILTON Isn't that obvious, you sick fuck? I'm here for her. Milton gestures toward the baby. 
JONAH KING What's obvious is that you clearly abandoned your daughter. 
(MORE) 
JONAH KING (cont'd) Crushed her so completely that she told everyone you were dead. No, Milton, I cannot in good faith hand over this child to you. 
MILTON But sacrificing her under the full fuckin moon, that's okay? 
JONAH KING Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is unbelievably blessed. Look around. The world's on fire. Companies own our governments and the people suffer. Daily. And will continue to suffer until change comes. And change will come. Thanks to your granddaughter, Milton. She will open the door to a new world order. 
MILTON Your BS don't work on me. You killed my daughter but I won't let you kill my grandbaby. 
JONAH KING Your daughter's death was an accident. 
MILTON No shithead, it wasn't. I saw the whole damn thing. I saw who you are when no one's lookin'. And I saw what that night cost ya. Jonah's armor cracks a little as Milton faces the others. 
JONAH KING Milton, you're embarrassing your-- 
MILTON (to the crowd) --What was it three or four days before he showed after killin my little girl? You jerkoffs didn't notice he was walking a little stiff? Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business Woman. 
MILTON When's the last time he shared a bed with either of you? Before that night, right? 
The girls shoot a nervous glance at Jonah. 
MILTON You forced my daughter onto her knees, you sonofabitch. And she made you pay for it. Jonah stares at Milton in shock. How does he know? 
MILTON But don't take my word for it. Ask him. Leather Jacket was there. Jonah made him swear not to tell. Jonah lifts a .38 auto from within the baby's blanket and shoots Leather Jacket in the forehead. Piper SCREAMS. The Baby starts CRYING. Jonah shoves the baby into Skanky Gal's arms then swings the gun toward Milton.

Reggie goes to her and hugs her as CAVE CREEK POLICE VEHICLES pull into the parking lot, sirens blazing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- NIGHT. 
EVERYONE IS HERE NOW. FBI. All of them. Ted is loaded into a car. 
Macy rests against a SQUAD CAR, smoking a cigarette, too exhausted to care that she looks like she just got fucked outside a bar. 
Director Jennings walks up, leans against the car beside her. 
JENNINGS See what I mean? They try to react and make mistakes... you want a LITTLE -- 
MACY No. 
JENNINGS Then keep shaking the tree. Let's see what else falls. 
Jennings stands. 
JENNINGS (CONT'D) Finding that photo and luring him out. That was smart. 
His knowing smile says: our little secret. 
She nods in appreciation. 
MACY Thank you, Dave. 
JENNINGS Thank you. Unlike most of the perps we see, Phoenix PD officers facing thirty years in prison have plenty to lose. We'll know whatever he knows very soon. 
Jennings walks off. Macy pulls a long drag from the cigarette. She looks at it, and must accept the fact that she is once again a smoker... 
Reggie walks up to her. He hands her a new pack. They look at each other. Try not to, but can't help it. They laugh... But when Macy's laughter risks turning to tears, she stops. 
REGGIE Thought all you white girls shaved. 
She starts laughing again. 
MACY You saved my life. 
REGGIE Nah. Think he was meant to scare you, or test you, maybe... 
MACY Are they following us? 
REGGIE Don't know. They're gonna take your vehicle, look for a transmitter. Which would mean there's someone in our house involved too. (MORE) 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Maybe someone tailed us from the bank... I don't know. 
The not knowing scares her. 
MACY Thank you. I mean it. 
He accepts it with a nod. 
MACY (CONT'D) Where is he now? 
REGGIE Backseat of your car. With our shadows. 
Takes that in. 
MACY I hope they kill him. 
REGGIE You don't mean that. 
MACY ... No. 
They lean against the car in silence. 
INT. MACY'S VEHICLE -- CONT. 
Ted sits in the backseat, face destroyed. The reality of his situation now fully in front of him. Matt sits in the front seat, Alejandro beside him. 
TED Okay. Okay. Okay... 
MATT You said that Ted. 
TED Look... I. I. I was asked what her CASE INVOLVED- 
As quick as a cat, Alejandro stabs his thumb into Ted's eye. Ted pitches forward.

ISOLDE Any word of my betrothed? 
KING DONNCHADH Overdue. But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him. 
[The King leaves] 
[Isolde leaves the town to return to the hut on the beach. She sees Tristan bathing in the sea. Isolde tends to Tristans wounds back in the hut] 
TRISTAN What's your name? 
ISOLDE Oh, I think it's better if we don't bother with names. 
TRISTAN How can I thank you if I don't have your name? 
ISOLDE You just did. If you insist... my name is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My father would've left you where you fell. 
TRISTAN Tristan of Aragon. 
ISOLDE Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about you too, but I think I've already seen everything. 
BRAGNAE Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks we are taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able. 
[Bragnae leaves] 
TRISTAN She likes me. Shes right though, you do risk. 
[Finishes poulticing him] 
ISOLDE There. What of your parents? 
TRISTAN They also died when I was a child. 
ISOLDE Of what? 
TRISTAN A different type of Irish kindness.

Picard gets up and starts heading for the Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern of his. \nPICARD Secure from Red Alert. Number One, begin an investigation. I'll be in my Ready Room. \nTroi and Riker exchange a surprised look. \nRIKER Sir? \nPICARD (hard) Make it so. \nPicard EXITS. An awkward beat.

Only a few minutes have passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear view of the room. \nWORF These blast patterns are consistent with type-three disruptors. \nRIKER Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan. \n", "test1_true": "BEVERLY I'm picking up life signs... about twenty meters ahead. \nWORF That rules out Klingons. \nRiker gives him a look. \nWORF They would not have left anyone alive. \nBEVERLY Over here. \nThey pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of her medical kit and begins to treat him. \nRIKER Worf, you're with me. Paskall, you and Mendez search the upper deck. \nThe Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a collapsed bulkhead. \nWORF Under here... \nThey both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the man's hand. \nWORF It's all right... do not struggle. \nWorf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged at all over the years but he does have a permanent scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a few times, seems a little dazed. \nRIKER I'm Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. \nSORAN Soran...

He puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN, revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP  which is suspended in a glass and metal framework.

But I believe this may be the appropriate time. \nGEORDI Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net. \nDATA That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more \"human\" - to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor.

She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid. \nGUINAN You two just volunteered to be my first victims. (re: liquid) This is a new concoction I picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, you're going to love it. \nShe pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him closely. Data frowns. \nGEORDI Well...? \nDATA I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response. \nGEORDI Really? What do you feel? \nDATA I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions... I am unable to articulate the sensation. \nGUINAN Emotions? \nGEORDI I'll explain later... \nData finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one of disgust. \nGUINAN (to Geordi) I don't think he likes it. \nDATA (excited) Yes. That is it.

Soran is sitting at the table, staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart from everyone else in the room.

(brusque, to Soran) I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me. \nSORAN Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star. \nPicard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't sound that imperative to him. \nPICARD Doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then -- \nSORAN The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost. \nPICARD We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me... \nPicard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks. \nSORAN (cryptically) They say time is the fire in which we burn... and right now, Captain, my time is running out. (beat) We leave so many things unfinished in our lives -- I'm sure you can understand. \nFor some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard. \nHe looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment.

Worf is talking to Riker. \nWorf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram of sensor information. \nWORF One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium. \nRIKER Trilithium? \nWORF An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it. \nRIKER Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense. \nRiker considers. \nRIKER (cont'd) Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team...  tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium. \nWORF Aye, sir. \nCUT TO: \n62   INT.

{"train": "Star Trek: Generations \nScreenplay by Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore, Brannon Braga \nFINAL DRAFT \nMarch 16, 1994 \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           1 \nA vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, but we can't determine exactly what it is yet... \n2   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        2 \nA vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their conversation...and we can see that the two men are SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing. \nCHEKOV (points to sky) There he is -- there, to the South! \nSCOTTY (peers upward) What are ye, blind? That's a bird. \nAs they stare up at the sky... \n3   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           3 \nThe cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it is tumbling directly toward the camera... \n4   EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY                                         4 \nAs before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky. \nSCOTTY (concerned) Repelling the Crystalline Trench... rafting down lava flows... orbital skydiving. it's like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the galaxy. \nSuddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM. \nCHEKOV (re: sound) That should be him now. I think he's just crossed the sound barrier. \nThey shield their eyes against the sun and look up. \n5   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           5 \nThe bottle gets CLOSER... \n6   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        6 \nA man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a roller-coaster. \nKIRK Right on target! I jump out over the Arabian Peninsula... and I end up here, right on the dime. \nKirk gets to his feet. \nCHEKOV Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters... (points) That way. \nKIRK Thanks for pointing that out. \nKirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden pain in his back. \nKIRK Oh... \nSCOTTY I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it. \nKirk waves him away, and continues to remove his harness. \n6A   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                          6A \nThe tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space... \n6B   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                       6B \nKirk, Scotty and Chekov as before. \nKIRK Tomorrow I want to make a tri- elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China, and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry... \nCHEKOV Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony. \nThis strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face. \nKIRK I'm not going. (beat) Scotty, help me with this chute. \nSCOTTY What do you mean, you're not going? We promised. \nKIRK When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it. \nChekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height. \nKIRK But that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than... \nCHEKOV Twelve years, sir. \nKIRK Yes... well... congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm. \nDEMORA Thank you, sir. (to Chekov) Let me show you the new inertial guidance system. \nDemora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them for a long beat. The expression on his face changes from shock to sadness... Something is clearly bothering him. \nScotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face. \nSCOTTY (to Kirk) Damn fine ship if you ask me... \nBut Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as she moves to the Helmsman's position. \nKIRK You know, Scotty... it amazes me. \nSCOTTY And what would that be, sir? \nKIRK Sulu. When did he find the time for a family? \nSCOTTY It's like you always said -- if something's important enough, you make the time. \nKirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something... \nSCOTTY So... that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen-year-old. Finding retirement a little lonely, are we? \nKirk gives him a look. \nKIRK With that kind of tact, I'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist. \nHarriman interrupts. \nHARRIMAN Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll take your seats. \nKIRK Oh... of course. \n10   NEW ANGLE                                                   10 \nRevealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged to one side. \nScotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations. \nHARRIMAN (to all) Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping. (beat) Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway. \nKIRK No... no. Thank you. \nHARRIMAN Please, I insist. \nAll eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation. \nKIRK (to all) Take us out. \nEveryone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in acute embarrassment and  annoyance. \nCHEKOV (sotto) Very good, sir. \nSCOTTY (sotto) Brought a tear to my eye. \nCUT TO: \n11    EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                            11 \nThe great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. \n12    INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  12 \nA short time later. Harriman turns to his guests. \nHARRIMAN Well... we've just cleared the asteroid belt. Our course will take us out beyond Pluto and then back to spacedock. Just a quick run around the block. (beat) If we have time, we'll conduct a few tests of the warp -- \nSuddenly the communications console starts to BEEP. The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response. \nCOM OFFICER (to Harriman) We're picking up a distress call, Captain. \nThis grabs everyone's attention. \nHARRIMAN On speakers. \nWe hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent. \nNAVIGATOR Aye, sir.. releasing drive plasma... \nA tense beat. Harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action. \nNAVIGATOR (continuing) It's not having any effect, sir. I think -- \nDEMORA Sir! The starboard vessel's hull is collapsing -- \n15B   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)                                 15B \nSuddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge. \nCHEKOV How many people were aboard that ship? \nDEMORA Two hundred sixty-five. \nHarriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at a genuine loss as to what to do next. \nDEMORA (urgent) The Lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir. \nHarriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look incapable, but at the same time, he needs help. \nHARRIMAN Captain Kirk... I would appreciate any... suggestions you might have. \nKirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. He moves down to stand next to Harriman. \nKIRK (sotto) First -- move us within transporter range and beam those people to the Enterprise. \nHarriman looks at him with surprise. \nHARRIMAN What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart... \nKIRK (gently) Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair. \nKirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen. \nHARRIMAN Helm, close to within transporter range. \nKirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the light on them  all. \nKIRK And second -- turn that damned thing off. \nThe cameraman turns OFF the light. \nCUT TO: \n16   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           16 \nThe ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just missing it. \n17   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  17 \nAs before. \nDEMORA We're within range, sir. \nHARRIMAN (to lieutenant) Beam them directly to Sickbay. \nCHEKOV (concerned) How big's your medical staff? \nHARRIMAN (embarrassed) The medical staff... doesn't arrive until Tuesday. \nChekov turns to the two journalists. \nCHEKOV You and you. You've just become nurses. Let's go. \nChekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift. \nDEMORA Main Engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays. \nSCOTTY By-pass the relays and go to auxiliary systems. \nThe LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console. \nLIEUTENANT Sir, I'm having trouble locking onto them. They appear to be... in some sort of... temporal flux. \nKirk turns to Scotty. \nKIRK Scotty? \nScotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter console. \nSCOTTY What the hell... \nSCOTTY All things must end, Mr. Chekov. \nHarriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge. \nHARRIMAN Let's go home. \nHarriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes command of his ship. \nScotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone very dear to them both... \nCUT TO: \n38   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           38 \nThe crippled ship turns and heads away... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nSUPER: SEVENTY-EIGHT YEARS LATER... \n39   CLOSE ON A HALYARD                                          39 \nas a FLAG is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast. The flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind -- the blue and white banner of the United Federation of Planets waves in the breeze. \nMOVE TO REVEAL THE LOCATION \n40   EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY                                   40 \nA nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters. \n41   ON THE MAIN DECK                                            41 \nWhere PICARD and RIKER are standing before the assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at attention... the wind whistles through the rigging... the timbers creak... \nPicard grimly looks over his crew... then finally  he nods to Riker. \nRIKER Bring out the prisoner! \nA drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL. \n42   ON A HATCH                                                  42 \nas WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain. The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at him closely. \nPICARD Mister Worf... I always knew this day would come. Are you prepared to face the charges? \nWorf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side. \nTROI Answer him! \nWORF I am prepared. \nPicard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes Worf's shackles. \nRIKER \"We, the officers and crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound mind and judgment, hereby make the following charges against Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did knowingly and willfully perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions. Two. That he has been a good and solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years. And Three. Most seriously... that he has earned the respect and admiration of the entire crew.\" \nRiker puts away the scroll \nPICARD There can be only one punishment for such crimes... (beat) I hereby promote you to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, with all the rights and privileges thereto. And may God have mercy on your soul. \nEveryone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and shakes his hand. \nPICARD (cont'd) Congratulations, Commander. \nWORF (smiles) Thank you, sir. \nPicard continues to smile at him for a moment...then Riker steps in. \nRIKER Extend the plank!! \nWorf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is being pushed out over the water. \nCREWMEMBERS Into the sea with him... feed him to the sharks... walk the plank... etc. \nPicard gives Riker a questioning look. \nPICARD Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One? \nRIKER When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember? \nPicard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of tea, but he'll go along with it. \nWorf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike until Worf is nearly at the end. \n48   ON PICARD (VFX-P)                                           48 \nwhose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has just read something on the screen which is very disturbing. \nHe stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi moves to him. \nTROI (quiet) Captain, are you all right? \nPICARD Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me... \nHe turns OFF the screen. \nPICARD Computer, exit. \n48A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              48A \nThe Holodeck DOORS APPEAR within the Arch. Picard is clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi looks after him with concern. \n49   NEW ANGLE                                                   49 \nFavoring Riker. He takes a couple of steps toward Worf. \nRIKER Set the royals and the studding sails, Mister Worf. \nWorf looks at him blankly for a moment. \nWORF The Royal... studs...? \nRIKER (smiles, points aloft) You see the top yardarm, now look to the -- \nSuddenly a com voice interrupts. \nCOM VOICE Bridge to Commander Riker. \nRIKER Riker here. \nCOM VOICE We're picking up a distress call from the Amargosa observatory, sir. They say they're under attack. \nRIKER (to all) Red Alert! All hands to Battle stations! Captain Picard to the Bridge. \nEveryone on the ship reacts, and there is a general rush to the bow of the ship... \nCUT TO: \n50   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-D (VFX-I)                           50 \nThe great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g. a YELLOW SUN can be seen.) \n51   INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I)                                         51 \nPicard in command. Riker, Troi, Worf and Data at their stations They didn't have time to change, so they are all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony. The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN. \nRIKER It looks like we're too late... \nWORF (off console) There are no other ships in the system. \nDATA Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain. \nRIKER The station complement was nineteen. \nA grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern of his. \nPICARD Secure from Red Alert. Number One, begin an investigation. I'll be in my Ready Room. \nTroi and Riker exchange a surprised look. \nRIKER Sir? \nPICARD (hard) Make it so. \nPicard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the Captain? But they have their orders. \nAs Riker and  Worf head for the EXIT... \nCUT TO: \n52   INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P)                       52 \nThe station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering, lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear view of the room. \nWORF These blast patterns are consistent with type-three disruptors. \nRIKER Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan. \nGEORDI The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago. \nDATA I know. I just got it. (laughs) It was very funny. \nGEORDI Thanks. \nGeordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that direction... \n63   INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                      63 \nA short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what appears to be a standard bulkhead. \nGEORDI Wait a minute... there's a hidden doorway here. I can see the joint of the metal with my VISOR. \nGeordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what appears to be a smooth bulkhead. \nDATA (off tricorder) There appears to be a dampening field in operation. I cannot scan beyond the bulkhead. \nGeordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door. \nGEORDI I don't see a control panel...or an access port. \nDATA (off tricorder) It appears to be a magnetically sealed. \nData steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within. \nDATA I believe I can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo. \nData completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist over the door panel. \nDATA (joking) \"Open sesame.\" \nThere is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The door slides open. \nDATA (smiles) You could say I have a... magnetic personality. \nGeordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT to. \n64   INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    64 \nA small room with several probes stacked in holding racks. Geordi and Data scan. \nGEORDI I'm still not picking up anything. Someone went to a lot of trouble to shield this room. \nThey put their tricorders away and begin looking around the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to the side. \nGEORDI Data, take a look at this. (Data comes over) You ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration? \nData uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he opens and closes it like a mouth. \nDATA (making tricorder \"talk\") No, Geordi. I have not. It is most unusual. \nData giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of someone listening to a very bad comedian. \nGEORDI Just help me get this panel open. \nData helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi looks inside.he reacts to something. \nGEORDI Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up something in the theta band...it could be a trilithium signature. \nData suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in irritation. \nGEORDI Data, this isn't the time... \nDATA (laughing) I am sorry... but I cannot stop myself... I think something is wrong... \n64A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              64A \nData's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre \"emotional seizure.\" A rush of EMOTIONS race across his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops and he FALLS to the ground. \nGEORDI Data! \nGeordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up. \nGEORDI Data, are you all right? \nDATA I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays. \nGEORDI We better get you back to the Ship. (hits combadge) La Forge to Enterprise. \nThere's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we hear Soran's voice. \nSORAN Is there a problem, gentlemen? \nPICARD You know, Counselor... I'm not getting any younger. For some time now, I've been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind... (beat) But I always took comfort in the fact that when I was gone, my family would continue. But now... \nPicard moves back to the photo album, open it to the last page, an then flips through the remaining pages -- they are blank. \nPICARD I've had brushes with death... more than I care to contemplate. I always accepted it as a calculated risk that goes along with wearing this uniform. (beat) But now... the idea of death has a terrible sense of finality to it. \nHe looks at her. \nPICARD I'm the last Picard. \nA quiet beat as Troi considers him. \nTROI Captain, perhaps we -- \nSuddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to the window and shield their eyes against the glare. \nRIKER'S COM VOICE Red Alert! All hands to duty stations! \nCUT TO: \nTHRU    OMITTED                                                   THRU \n69    INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I)                                         69 \nPicard and Troi ENTER from a turbolift. Riker and Worf at their stations. The star is on the Viewscreen, getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris is being ejected into space. \nPICARD Report. \nRIKER A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclear fusion is breaking down. \nPICARD How is that possible? \nWORF Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago. \nRIKER The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes. \nSomething beeps on Worf's console. \nWORF Sir, the implosion has produced a level twelve shock wave. \nTROI (shocked) Level twelve? That'll destroy everything in this system. \nTRANSPORTER COM VOICE Transporter room to Bridge. I can't locate Commander La Forge or Mister Data, sir. \nRIKER (to Worf) Did they return to the ship? \nWORF (works) No, sir. They are not aboard. \nPICARD How long until the shock wave hits the observatory? \nWORF Four minutes, forty seconds. \nPicard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the turbolift. \nRIKER Mister Worf. \nRiker and Worf EXIT. \n70   EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I)                                70 \nThe star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of energy. \n71   INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P)                         71 \nSoran is standing at a console watching a graphic depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined earlier is now gone.) \nRIKER (to Worf) What the hell's he doing? \nWorf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen. \nPICARD'S COM VOICE Enterprise to Commander Riker, you have two minutes left. \nRIKER (yells to Soran) Soran, did you hear that? There's a level twelve shock wave coming. We've got to get out of here! \nSoran's only answer is another phaser blast. \n71A   OMITTED                                                    71A \n72  INT. BRIDGE                                                 72 \nAs before. ENSIGN HAYES is at Tactical. An ALARM suddenly BEEPS on the Tactical console. \nHAYES (urgent) Sir. A Klingon Bird of Prey is decloaking off the port bow. \nB'ETOR Perhaps we are tired of waiting. \nSoran is unfazed by this threat. \nSORAN Without my research... the trilithium is worthless... as are your plans to reconquer the Klingon Empire. \nLursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife away. \nSORAN Set course for the Veridian system. Maximum warp. \nLURSA (to Helm) Bosh-ta-JaH Veridian (Set course for Veridian) \nA KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi. \nKLINGON GUARD What shall I do with this? \nSoran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face. \nSORAN Bring him with me. I need some answers from Mr. La Forge. \nSoran EXITS. \nCUT TO: \n79   OMITTED                                                     79 \n80   INT. CORRIDOR                                               80 \nRiker and Worf are on the move down the corridor. \nWORF I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir.

He is sitting on a bio-bed, scanning himself with a tricorder. \nRIKER How is he? \nBEVERLY It looks like a power surge fused the emotional chip into his neural net. \nWORF Will that be a danger to him? \nBEVERLY I don't think so. The chip still seems to be working. I'd feel better if I could take a closer look, but I can't remove it without completely dismantling his cerebral conduit. \nRIKER (to Data) Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel? \nDATA I am quite... preoccupied with concern about Geordi. \nRIKER We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back. \nDATA I hope so, sir. \nData's expression is still one of concern. Beverly pulls Riker aside. \nBEVERLY Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's background. \nBeverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of Doctor Soran along with some biographical information appears. \nBEVERLY He's an El-Aurian... over three hundred years old. He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his world. Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul. The ship was destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon, but Soran and forty-six others were rescued by the Enterprise-B. \nRIKER (reacts) That was the mission where James Kirk was killed. \nBEVERLY I checked the passenger manifest of the Lakul... guess who else was on board? \nShe hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears on the screen. Riker reacts to the image... \nCUT TO: \n82   INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS                                      82 \nClose on Guinan as she looks up, surprised. \nGUINAN Soran? That's a name I haven't heard in a long time. \nMOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and subdued. \nPicard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross- legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an easy familiarity... two old friends who know each other well. \nPICARD Do you remember him? \nSORAN Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information, and I need it. (beat) Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium? \nGEORDI No. \nSORAN What about... Guinan? What has she told you about me? \nGEORDI Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about... \nOn the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi. \nSORAN My instincts tell me you're lying. And I know that can't be easy for you... (off PADD) I can see you have a good heart. \nSoran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps and starts to breathe. \nSORAN Oh... I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system... and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. (smiles) A little trick I picked up from the Borg. \nGEORDI (gasping) Yeah... they're full of great ideas. \nSORAN I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage? \nGEORDI No... I didn't know that... \nSORAN We learn something new about ourselves every day. (beat) Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows. \nGEORDI I told you everything... you might as well just kill me right now... \nSoran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity. \nSORAN I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. (beat) Let's try thirty seconds. \nSoran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and strains against an unimaginable pain. \nSoran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover... sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick away... \nCUT TO: \n84   INT.

Picard is standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data seems distracted and preoccupied. \nDATA According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty-nine point one years \nPICARD When is it expected back? \nData doesn't answer right away. \nPICARD Data? \nDATA Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours. \nPicard moves about the room... he's frustrated... tired... but determined to find out what's going on. \nPICARD Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon... if that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star. \nDATA The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon. \nPICARD Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed... no matter how insignificant... \nDATA It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information. \nData works the computer and then the computer begins to work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his hands. Picard finally has to say something. \nPICARD Data, are you all right? \nDATA No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate... I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of... remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory. \nPICARD What do you mean? \nDATA I wanted to save Geordi... I tried. but I experienced something I did not expect. (beat) I believe it was fear. \nPicard regards him sympathetically. \nPICARD Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with. \nDATA But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. (beat) Does that make me a coward? \nPICARD No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience... guilt. \nDATA (considers) Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling. \nDATA It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa. \nPICARD (grim) And destroy every planet in the system. \nPicard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread. \nPICARD Are any of them inhabited? \nDATA Veridian Three is uninhabited. but Veridian Four supports a pre- industrial humanoid society. \nPICARD Population? \nDATA Approximately two hundred thirty million. \nA grim beat. \nPICARD (to com) Picard to Bridge. \nWORF'S COM VOICE Worf here, sir. \nPicard heads for the exit, a sense of urgency and determination in his every move. \nPICARD Red Alert, Mister Worf.

Soran puts the watch away. \nSORAN You must think I'm quite the madman. \nPICARD The thought had crossed my mind... \nSORAN The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all.

Picard has made it inside the field. \nA quick fight ensues, during which Picard is knocked a few levels down on the scaffolding. He LANDS hard -- happens to look up into the sky. He sees something.-- \n144   PICARD'S POV - THE SKY (VFX-I)                             144 \nThe ENERGY RIBBON can be seen in the distant sky \n-- a bizarre snake of color streaking across the deep blue sky. Time is almost up. \n145   RESUME ACTION (VFX-I)                                      145 \n-- Picard avoids a vicious kick from Soran, glances down at the probe launcher, and realizes he's got one chance. He rolls to his feet, runs toward the probe launcher. \n-- There is a THUNDEROUS ROAR as the launcher FIRES THE PROBE into the sky. \nYOUNG BOY This is from all of us. \nPICARD Thank you... I can't imagine what it is. \nPicard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and gleaming brass. \nYOUNG BOY (excited) It's a sack-tent! \nPicard eyes it with delight. \nPICARD You mean a sextant. And it's a handsome one at that... from about eighteen twenty, I'd say. Wherever did you find it? \nGIRL It's a secret. \nPICARD (smiles) Oh, a secret... well, that makes it a doubly special gift. Thank you... thank you all... \nThe children react with pleasure. They cluster around him, showering him with hugs and kisses. \nCHILDREN Merry Christmas, Papa... I love You, Father... etc. \nPicard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. The children pull back and return to their own presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played out. \nWOMAN (to Picard) I'll go get dinner ready. they'll be starving in a minute. \nPicard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content. \nThe children continue to chatter and laugh among themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks over the ornaments and decorations... \n156   PICARD'S POV                                               156 \nof the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of color and light. \n157   PICARD                                                     157 \nHis eye is caught by something in particular on the tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it. \n158   PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)                                       158 \nHis eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT... and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands outward into the glass sphere. \nIt's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many ornaments on the tree. \n159   PICARD                                                     159 \nreacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something. \n160   PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)                                       160 \nreflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away... he can't hide from it. \nPICARD No... this isn't right... this can't be real... \nGUINAN'S VOICE It's as real as you want it to be. \nPicard turns to see \n161   GUINAN (VFX-P)                                             161 \nstanding before him. She is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. As they talk, the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if Picard and Guinan aren't there. \nPicard is stunned. \nPICARD Guinan... what's going on? Where am I? \nGUINAN You're in the Nexus. \nPicard looks around. \nPICARD This... is the Nexus? \nGUINAN For you. This is where you wanted to be... \nPICARD But I never had a wife, children, a home like this... \nGUINAN Enjoy them, Jean-Luc... \nPicard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on Guinan. \nPICARD Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise. \nGUINAN I am on the Enterprise...I am also here. (off his puzzled look) Think of me as... an \"echo\" of the person you know... a part of her she left behind... \nPICARD Left behind...? \nPICARD Oh. \nPicard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe. \nPICARD Captain, do you realize what -- \nBut Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c. \nKIRK Wait a second. I think something's burning. \nPicard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows... \n163   INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS               163 \nKirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house. \nKirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand. \nKIRK Looks like someone was cooking eggs... (to Picard) Come on in, it's all right. This is my house -- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago. \nPicard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on. \nPICARD I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise. \nBefore Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past. \nKIRK This clock... I gave this clock to Bones... \nPICARD (pressing on) I'm from what you would consider the future... the twenty-fourth century. \nKirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets Kirk with enthusiasm. \nKIRK (affectionately) Jake! Jake, you miserable old Mutt... How can you be here? (to Picard) He's been dead seven years. \nKirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see the shock on Kirk's face. \nANTONIA'S VOICE Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen? \nA beat. \nKIRK (amazed) That's Antonia... \nKirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to realize something. \nKIRK Wait a minute... \nKirk glances at Picard. \nKIRK The future... what are you talking about? This is the past... \nKirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe. \nKIRK This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet... \nKirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition. \nKIRK These were Ktarian eggs -- her favorite.I was cooking them to soften the blow... (re: horseshoe) And I gave her this. \nPicard steps in. \nPICARD I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't Really your house. We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus. \nBut Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the opportunity he suddenly has. \nKIRK Dill weed. \nKirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to it. \nKIRK There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg. \nKirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it to Kirk. \nPICARD How long have you been here? \nKirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs. \nKIRK I don't know. I was on the Enterprise-B... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you? \nKirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway. \nKIRK (continuing) The bulkhead in front of me Disappeared... then I was out there chopping wood. (back to stove) Thanks. \nKirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard. \nSoran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. The pocket watch has been shattered. \n175   PICARD                                                     175 \nturns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged breath. \nKIRK Nice shot. \nKirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast. \nPICARD I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right. \nKIRK Did we do it? Did we make a Difference...? \nPICARD Yes. (beat) Thank you. \nKIRK Least I could do...for a Captain of the Enterprise. \nKirk coughs again \nPICARD Try to hang on. \nKirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his face \nKIRK It was fun. \nKirk dies. \nHold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the quiet clearing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n176   EXT.

MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few rocks on Kirk's grave. \nHe reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave... and stands there silently for a few moments. \nA distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks up into the sky... \n177   PICARD'S POV (VFX-I)                                       177 \nAn Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky toward the mountaintop. \n178   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET                                  178 \nThe shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D. security guards jump out to meet him. \nWORF Captain, are you all right? \nPICARD Yes. \nLA FORGE What about Doctor Soran? \nPICARD You needn't worry about the Doctor anymore. \nPicard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on his face and Worf's uniform is torn. \nPICARD Was there a problem with the Klingons? \nWorf and La Forge exchange a look. \nGEORDI You could say that... \nCUT TO: \n179   EXT.

She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid. \nGUINAN You two just volunteered to be my first victims. (re: liquid) This is a new concoction I picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, you're going to love it. \nShe pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him closely.

Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory.

We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punch line. \n", "test2_id": 1120, "test3_input": "In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his feelings... \nKIRK (re: ravine) I must have made this jump fifty times. and every time it scared the hell out of me. But not this time. (beat) Because... it's not real. \nA quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse. \nPICARD (re: woman) Antonia? \nKIRK (nods) She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is... nothing here matters... \nAll euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of self-revelation. He glances around. \nKIRK It's kinda like... orbital skydiving. Exciting for a few minutes... but in the end, you haven't really done anything... you haven't made a difference... \nKirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, he's truly seeing him for the first time. \nKIRK Captain of the Enterprise, huh? \nPICARD That's right. \nKIRK Close to retirement? \nPICARD I hadn't planned on it. \nThere is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't seen until now. \nKIRK Well, let me tell you something - don't. Don't let them promote you... don't let them transfer you... don't let anything take you off the Bridge of that ship... (beat) Because while you're there, you can make a difference. \nThe two captains face each other for a moment. Picard hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and determination. \nPICARD You don't need to be on the Bridge of a starship. Come with me. Help me stop Soran. (beat) Make a difference again. \nA long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly, unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face. \nKIRK How can I argue with the Captain of the Enterprise? (a beat) What was the name of that Planet... Veridian III? \nPICARD That's right. \nKIRK I take it the odds are against us, and the situation is grim? \nPICARD You could say that. \nKIRK (musing) Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that... \nAnd for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back. \nKIRK Sounds like fun. \nThe two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE SCREEN, as seen before. \nFADE TO RED \nFADE IN: \n167   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P)                             167 \nSoran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing Picard. \nSORAN Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have an appointment with Eternity and I don't want to be late. \nWe realize we are watching the same events play out again. \nSoran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the field... \n167A   SORAN (VFX-P)                                             167A \nturns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard. \n167B   THE GROUND (VFX-P)                                        167B \nis BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily. \n-- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. \nSoran peers through the cloud of dust and debris. \n-- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground where he was crawling. \n167C   SORAN (VFX-I)                                             167C \nSoran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON, then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the head. \n168   REVEAL KIRK                                                168 \n", "test3_true": "169   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                          169 \nas Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher... \nThe following happens very quickly: \n-- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal. \n-- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues to race by. \n169A   THE SKY (VFX-I)                                           169A \nthe distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer... \n169B   THE MOUNTAINTOP   \t\t\t\t\t           169B \nSoran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon... \n-- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting buttons...looking for other control panels, anything to affect the launcher. \n169C   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                             169C \nSuddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR. \n169D   PICARD (VFX-P)                                            169D \nbegins working the control panel... desperate... he looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of the controls. \n-- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the movie. \nPICARD (desperate) Kirk -- there's a control PADD in his right pocket! \n169E   KIRK (VFX-P)                                              169E \nsees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He begins working it... \n170   CLOSE ON SORAN                                             170 \nHis eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet away, just beyond his reach... \n171   THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P)                                 171 \nDecloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls. \n171A   KIRK (VFX-P)            \t\t\t\t           171A \nhe smiles. \nKIRK The twenty-fourth century isn't so tough. \nWithout warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the weapon at Picard. \n172   MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE                                         172 \nThe probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads toward the sun... \n172A   THE PROBE (VFX-I)                                         172A \nmakes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We hear a muffled explosion. \n172B   SORAN (VFX-I)                                             172B \ncan't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding. \n173   PICARD                                                     173 \nmoves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly wounded. \n174   SORAN (VFX-I)                                              174 \nis standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears. \nSORAN No... \nHis look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns to Picard. \nSORAN YOU!! \n174B   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                         174B \nHe jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES SORAN IN MID-AIR . \n", "test3_id": 1121}

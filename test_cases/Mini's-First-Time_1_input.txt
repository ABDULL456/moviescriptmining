CONTINUED: 
She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one holds a HAND AXE. 
She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises the axe slowly. 
DIANE No...no...help! Help! 
She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room. 
INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife appears in the door frame. 
DIANE Oh, God! Help! Someone! 
Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles. 
DIANE (softly ) No, please, no. 
She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure D violently tugs at the handle. 
IANE Help! Someone please, help me! 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out the peep hole. 
PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear. 
She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on. 
THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE WIELDING FIGURE. 
It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her. She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper- ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears. 
DIANE Please God, please God...please! 
She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly, her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen. 
Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door. 
INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her. D iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice through her sobs. 
CLOSE ON: 
A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on its cradle. 
MINI (V.O.) Our work finished... 
INT. DOCTOR HOGGLY WOGGLY'S TYLER TEXAS BARBECUE - LATER. 
Mini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of beef put in front of them. 
MINI (V.O.) We rewarded ourselves on a job well done... 
INT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER. 
Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master bedroom. 
MINI (V.O.) And we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old. 
MINI Mom, we're home! 
MARTIN Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork plate! 
They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed. Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane could still be in there. 
MARTIN Honey? You okay?...Honey? 
MINI Mom? 
Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try to wake her up. 
MARTIN Diane, it's us, wake up. 
Mini slaps her hard across the face. 
MINI (feigning concern) Wake up, Mommy. 
MARTIN Mini. 
MINI Killjoy.

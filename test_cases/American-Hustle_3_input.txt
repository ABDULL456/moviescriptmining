Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him. He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him in. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (stares at her, upset) OK, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing. Then those guys will want to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy, take the sheik's money, see? 
Richie looks at Irving uncertain. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Only they can't get into his money unless you they know someone, and that someone is us. 
RICHIE DIMASO Oh that's good. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) So if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend -- Carl Elway -- you get him to want to buy- 
IRVING ROSENFELD Keep your voice down. 
RICHIE DIMASO -- or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit, he needs -- who does he need? -- he needs a rich sheik guy, and there you go -- we can pinch him! 
IRVING ROSENFELD Right, but I don't tell Elway shit. I wait for him to call me. The art world is a small world -- and one of Elway's acquaintances is clocking us right now. 
Richie starts to look around. 
RICHIE DIMASO Where? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Don't look. 
Richie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You have a good look? 
RICHIE DIMASO How do you know the Sheik? 
IRVING ROSENFELD This is my friend Al from Queens. 
AL FROM QUEENS/SHEIK I do aluminum siding and roofing. 
Richie stares, impressed. 
INT. ART MUSEUM - NEXT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT painting on the wall. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I want to show you something. This Rembrandt here? People come from all over the world to see this. 
RICHIE DIMASO Yeah, he's good. 
IRVING ROSENFELD It's a fake. 
RICHIE DIMASO Wait, what're you talking about? That's impossible. 
IRVING ROSENFELD People believe what they want to believe. Cause the guy who made this was so good that it's real to everybody. Now whose the master -- the painter or the forger? 
Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall. 
RICHIE DIMASO That's a fake? 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's the way the world works. Not black and white as you say. Extremely grey. 
ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and steps into the conversation. 
ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE Irving can I -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD How many times I gotta tell you. You can't meet the sheik, alright? 
Edith sees this and steps into the conversation. 
EDITH GREENSLY Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met before. 
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) I wanted to introduce you to Robert Spencer. We're advising the Sheik together. 
She looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand. 
RICHIE DIMASO (catching up) Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor to the sheik. 
70A   EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL -- ESTABLISHING - DAY                        70A 
71    INT. OFFICE OF CARL ELWAY - SUCCESSFUL, BUT SHADY - DAY         71 
CARL ELWAY, 40, preppie Waspy, very old fashioned with cigarette holder, but something vaguely criminal about him, in his conservative suit, natty white and red striped shirt, and navy blue tie sits with Irving. 
CARL ELWAY What's this I hear about a god damn Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of this? I gotta hear about it from my friends? 
IRVING ROSENFELD It ain't for you Carl. 
CARL ELWAY What do you mean it ain't for me? We gotta do certificates of deposit. I can print as many as you need. 
IRVING ROSENFELD This is not a one man operation. 
CARL ELWAY Look, I can get other guys. What are you talking about Irving? 
IRVING ROSENFELD You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week? 
The camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny microphone. 
CARL ELWAY Yes I can make that happen. Carl Elway can do what he says he's going to do. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's interesting but you know I've got other guys lined up. I've got a meeting with my associates. 
SUDDENLY CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT, OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS. Richie Dimaso and Edith ARE STANDING THERE -- MUCH TO IRV'S DISMAY. 
CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT Carl, his associates are here. He's got a meeting he's got to go to. 
CARL ELWAY No wait. Don't go anywhere.

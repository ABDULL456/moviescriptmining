SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nJERRY I know it's hard to understand, but I really want to see this tree. \nCAPT. SPAULDING OK, alright I'll draw you a map, but I still say it is a waste of time. \nJERRY Great. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nThrough the window we see Jerry talking to Spaulding. Spaulding draws a map, explaining as he draws. \nMARY Geez, he never gets tired does he. \nDENISE Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on \nMARY Maybe he's a cyborg. \nBILL (wearily, sips his coffee) I like sleep. \nDENISE Here he comes. \nJerry comes bouncing out towards the car and jumps in. \nHe is holding a map and a box of chicken. \nJERRY We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy. \nMARY Huh? \nDENISE Ugh, what's that smell? \nJERRY Fried chicken. (holds up a drumstick) Anybody want some? \nNo one responds. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nAn OLD FARMER and his WIFE stare directly into the camera. \nOLD MAN I don't know where that skunk ape sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all... all I know is he eats squirrels to survive and he had impure relations with my wife. \nWIFE That's true. He performed lurid acts upon me and my person while my husband Russell was a fix'n to our hound Clarence. \nOLD MAN If I see that thing again... I'm a gonna kill that skunk ape. \nBILL (off screen) What does it look like? \nWIFE It looked just like that chubby fella from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine. \nOLD MAN Hold up the picture. \nThe wife holds up a pencil sketch of a Bigfoot like creature and a newspaper photo of Ernest Borgnine. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nBill's car moves past empty farmlands. A HEAVIER RAIN is now falling. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJerry directs Bill from Spaulding's hand-drawn map. \nJERRY Keep straight on this road here. \nBILL How much further? \nJERRY I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet? \nBILL I don't know. \nMary and Denise sit bundled up in blankets. \nMARY Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway. \n", "test1_true": "JERRY Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to. \nBILL What's that? \nThrough the windshield we see a LONE FIGURE hitch-hiking by the side of the road. It is a girl, BABY, 27, in a worn cowboy hat and long fur coat. She is soaked to the bone. \nJERRY It's a hitchhiker. \nBILL Way out here? \nMARY Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days. \nBILL (looking closer) It's a girl. \nJERRY Hey, maybe she knows where this is? \nDENISE (sarcastically) That seems likely. \nMARY Should we stop? \nBILL We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area. \nMARY She looks like a freak. \nDENISE Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked. \nMARY She looks like she stinks. \nBILL (imitating Mary) She looks like she stinks. \nJERRY (makes cat noises) Cat fight, cat fight. \nDENISE Hardy har, har. \nThe car pulls over and Baby jumps in. The car moves off. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nOnce inside the car they see that the girl is a bit odd. \nBABY Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years. \nJERRY Really, that's a long time. \nBABY Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty. \nJERRY Yikes. \nBABY Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey. \nDENISE Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest way for a girl to travel. \nBABY Yeah, but it's fun. \nMARY Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland. \nBILL Where ya headed? \nBABY Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing. \nBILL Where's that? \nBABY Couple more miles up this road. \nJERRY Hey, you might know... (shows her the map) ...you know where this tree is at? It's an old hanging tree from... \nThe Baby PERKS UP at the mention of the tree. \nBABY Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya. \nJERRY Really, wow, so it's really a real thing. \nBABY Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood. \nJERRY Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us? \n", "test1_id": 129, "test2_input": "BILL How much further? \nBABY Almost there... are you in a hurry or something? \nBILL Well, yeah, kind of. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJerry is stretched out across the front seat, reading a book on Freak Shows. Denise and Mary sit in the back, curled up under layers of blankets and clothes. \nDENISE Fuck, it's freezing. \nJERRY Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan. \nDENISE Oh, yeah. \nJERRY Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder. \nDENISE Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree? \nJERRY It says, \"records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility.\" \nDENISE So. \nJERRY Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16. \nDENISE Why? \nJERRY (scanning the book) Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, \"criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946.\" \nDENISE Yeah? \nJERRY These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms. \nDENISE So what? \nJERRY I don't know, I just thought it was interesting. \nDENISE You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point? \nJERRY I don't... (to himself) ...I just thought it was weird. \nMARY (bursting in) God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch. \nJERRY Huh? \nMARY That stupid hillbilly slut. \nJERRY Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion. \nMARY You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something. \nDENISE Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us. \nJERRY When? \nDENISE When you were outside with Bill. \nMARY She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that. \nDENISE Yeah, she said we looked queer. \nJERRY Aw, get over it, she's just some dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough to be up to nothing... I mean anything... chicks. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nAn old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely overgrown. \nBill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the main drive. \nBaby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house. \nThe front of the house is covered with strange junk art. Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls. \nBABY These are all my dolls. I use to like to chop their heads off. \nBroken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird HUMAN FIGURES, ANIMAL SKINS stretched over bone armatures form a makeshift roof. \n", "test2_true": "BABY The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here. \nBILL OK. \nBaby RUNS OFF around the side of the house. \nBill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate farm grounds. The rain continues to hammer down. \nFrom BILL'S POV we see a silhouette of a LONE FIGURE walking in the distance. The shape of a large dog follows behind him. \nBill JUMPS, startled by the sound of the heavy front door opening. \nBILL Christ, you scared the shit out of me. \nBABY Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet. \nBILL Is your brother ready to go? \nBABY Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on. \nBILL He left! \nBABY Yeah, come on. \nBaby GRABS Bill by the arm and pulls him into the house. The heavy iron door slams shut. \nINT. CAR - SAME \nDenise and Mary sit facing one another, playing cards. \nMary deals from a deck. \nJerry naps in the front seat. \nMARY How long has it been? \nDENISE I don't know... about half an hour. \nA metal KLANG is faintly heard. \nMARY What was that? \nDENISE What? I didn't hear anything. \nMARY Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio. \nMary reaches over the front seat and turns off the radio. \nDENISE Now... listen. \nThey sit in silence. \nMARY I don't hear anything. \nDENISE (whispering) Shhhhhh, quiet. \nMARY I still don't. \nDENISE Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there. \nMary turns on the headlights. Denise lets out a blood-curdling SCREAM. Jerry bolts up. \nJERRY What... what! \nStanding dead center in the road is the GIANT SHAPE of a MAN holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end. \nMARY Lock the doors... quick, quick. \nEverybody scrambles to lock the doors. \nDENISE Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck. \nOn closer inspection, Jerry notices the chain is attached to the back of a TOW TRUCK. \nJERRY Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy. \n", "test2_id": 130, "test3_input": "JERRY Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill? \nBILL Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache. \nJERRY Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken. \nBILL Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat. \nJERRY (shrugs) Tasted pretty good. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nIn a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body of GRAMPA. \nGrampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand. \nGRAMPA God damn it, I can do it. I can do it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't dead yet... so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet. \nGrampa steadies himself against Tiny. They slowly walk out of the room. \nGRAMPA God damn, my dogs are barking. \nAs they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that Grampa is in his late 80's. \nGrampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room. \nAs they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE OBJECT sitting on a shelf. \nA LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973. \nThe sound from the TV fades up in the background. \nBELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard. \nBELA LUGOSI (V.O.) Your hands, please. Your left hand shows your past... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTV SCREEN \nBela is seen as a fortune teller holding a woman's hands. This is a scene from The Wolfman. \nBELA LUGOSI ...and your right hand shows your future. \nCLOSE UP \nWe see a tight shot of the woman's palm. A pentagram appears. \nINT. DENISE'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe PULL BACK from the TV to find Donald Willis sitting in a old easy chair. The room is modest, but comfortable. \nHe reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock, notices the time, concerned look comes over his face. \nThe phone rings. He quickly answers it. \nMR. WILLIS Hello, Denise? \nDisappointment. He mutes the TV. \nMR. WILLIS Oh, yeah... no, Fred. I was hoping you were Denise, she's a little late. (pausing) Yeah, yeah I'm sure the rain just slowed 'em down... yeah... uh-huh, yeah... no, no you can keep it 'til Tuesday... alright, talk to ya tomorrow, bye. \nUnmutes the sound on the TV. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe feast is on. Mother, Tiny, Grampa, Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise are gathered around the table. \nMOTHER OK, everyone, put on your masks. We can't very well eat with our everyday faces exposed. \nMother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow. Jerry, Bill and Denise slowly raise up their masks, Mary hesitates. \nGRAMPA (to Mary) Christ kid, put it on. She ain't letting any of us touch the grub 'til you're wearing the damn thing. \nMary rolls her eyes and complies. \nJERRY I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm. \n", "test3_true": "JERRY Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan? \nBILL Here we go. \nGrampa shifts his eyes onto Mother. \nMOTHER (nervously) Well, I'm not much for local gossip an this and that, but I've heard it mentioned in passing over the years but... I mean folks is queer and they say things, crazy things you know what I mean? \nGRAMPA It's all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of hungry chipmunks... Christ, Dr. Satan. That takes the bull's nuts alright... (starts laughing) ...hey, I hear some genius up north got a hot line on the Easter Bunny for ya. \nA voice from the shadows interrupts. \nOTIS (slowly) I know all about what you want to know about. \nA PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner of the room. This is OTIS. \nHe stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO. \nHe is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one head. The label reads WOLF. \nMOTHER (happy surprise) Otis! I can't believe you decided to come down and join us... and you brought little Wolf. This really is a special night... all my babies together. \nOtis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table. He leans forward onto the jar, resting his chin. \nOTIS Now, I don't know where you heard all your little fairy fables about Dr. Satan but... \nBILL From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum. \nOTIS (laughing) That old bitch hog don't know shit. He tells cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth. \nJERRY But something happened, right? I mean the story is based on a real incident, right? \nGRAMPA (mouth full of food) What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter for the Daily Asshole? \nMOTHER Grampa... watch the language. \nOTIS I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs. \nJERRY I really want to know. \nGRAMPA Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten him. \nOTIS Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in the fire if I told ya you'd see Hell... meanwhile you too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing, \"Holy Miss Moly, I got a live one.\" \nDENISE Can we please change the subject? \nThe CLOCK on the wall strikes TEN. \nGRAMPA (shouting) Dinner's over. (pushes his plate back and stands up) Ladies and Germs... it's showtime. \nGrampa hobbles out of the room. \nBILL What's he so excited about? \nDENISE Yeah, showtime for what? \nMOTHER For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show. \nJERRY Oh, you mean on TV. \nMOTHER No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love. \nJERRY Great. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT \nBilly, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an old barn. Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings them open. \nStanding inside waiting is Mother. She is all dressed up for the occasion. \nMOTHER Please, come in... how many in your party... (she counts the heads) ...one, two, three and four... right this way. \nMother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which serves as a program book. Hand drawn on each is an orange pumpkin. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 131}

{"train": "\"HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES\" \nWritten by \nR.W. Zombie \nRevised 3-31-00 \nFADE IN: \nINT. OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe see a LITTLE GIRL dancing around in a grainy super 8 home movie. A LITTLE BOY wearing a monster MASK enters the frame. He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun. He points it at the girl and pretends to SHOOT. \nGIRL (V.O.) (whispering slowly) Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest little guy. Then one day he got sick and died. My heart was broken. My whole body hurt. \nShe continues dancing. The little boy imitates her. \nGIRL (V.O.) After that, I saw things differently, everything could be summed up with three simple words... fuck the world. \nThe camera swings over to some ugly, toothless relations watching the show. They laugh. \nEXT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nWe open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop. \nOff to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC's Halloween monster weekend. I'm Jimmy Ray and I'll be bringing you the oldies, the goldies and sometimes the moldies. The good, the bad and the uglies straight from the WJRC vaults. \nA weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S WORLD OF MONSTERS AND MADMEN, sits atop the building. \nA smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Hey, kids still trying to decide on the right costume? Well why not head on down to Randall's Penny Save located on Kimball Rd. just off route 1 in Mackin County. Choose from a wide array of ghosts and ghouls, jeepers and creepers... (scary sound effects) ...everything you need for your Halloween needs. \nSHERIFF HUSTON, a tall southern good old boy, leans against his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette, pumping gas into his tank. \nINT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nInside is a poorman's Ripley's Believe It or Not. \nBizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover the dirty walls. Wax figures of JACK THE RIPPER stand guard before oil paintings by JOHN WAYNE GACY. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Alright let's get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called The Teddy Bear's Picnic. \nPerched on a stool behind the counter sits CAPTAIN SPAULDING, a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared make-up. The word LOVE is tattooed across his right knuckles and HATE is tattooed across the left. \nHe is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man wearing coke bottle glasses named STUCKY. \nStucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs. \nSTUCKY (speaking through voicebox in his throat) I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots. (holds up a picture of June Wilkinson) See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it... (looking at the photo) to Stucky, love June. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Hmmmmm. \nSTUCKY Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb. \nCAPT. SPAULDING The retard over at Molly's fruit stand. \nSTUCKY Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook. \nSpaulding brushes cracker crumbs off his paper and continues reading. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Fascinating. \nSTUCKY That kid is one horny retard. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat. \nSTUCKY Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Worse than a fucking rabid baboon. \nSTUCKY Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes. \nCAPT. SPAULDING What? \nINT. SPAULDING'S - BACKROOM - NIGHT \nA silent RED LIGHT FLASHES. In the dim glow, we see RAVELLI, a large hunched figure, sitting on the edge of a bed. The figure is heavily bandaged. \nRavelli reacts to the flashing light, he RISES and puts a huge mask over his head. He EXITS the room. \nINT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT \nStucky sits on the toilet pasting stamps on large yellow envelopes. \nKiller Rich KICKS OPEN the stall, GRABS Stucky by the neck and PULLS him out. \nRICH Come on, fatboy! \nEXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nWe move around the outside of the building watching the scene inside unfold. HEAVY BREATHING is heard. \nRich DRAGS Stucky into the main room. \nINT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nKarl grows increasingly HOSTILE, knocks a candy display over, raises his gun over his head and fires into the ceiling. \nKARL (screaming) That's it. I'm gonna count to ten and you're gonna hand over the cash or I'm gonna splatter your grease paint mug across the stateline... one. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Fuck your mother. \nKARL Two. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Fuck your sister. \nRICH Come on, man. Just shoot him. \nSTUCKY (recognizing Rich's voice) Hey, I know you. We were in high school together. Wood shop, right? ...Richard Wick... right? \nHe looks nervously at Stucky. \nRICH Shut up, shut up, shut up! \nKARL Quiet down... three. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Fuck your grandmother. \nSTUCKY Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that? \nRICH (temper rising) Shut up! \nSTUCKY (singing) Little Dick Wick, play with his prick Don't his smell, just make you sick. \nEXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nFrom Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody inside starts SHOUTING at each other. \nSuddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against the wall, screaming in pain. \nWe move QUICKLY towards the entrance. \nINT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nSuddenly... CRASH! Ravelli SMASHES through the front door knocking Karl to the ground. In the light we see that Ravelli is wearing an OVERSIZED CLOWN HEAD. In his hand is a sledgehammer. \nRich TURNS toward the COMMOTION. The Captain quickly WHIPS OUT a GUN and FIRES. Rich falls dead. \nRavelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the hammer. Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the floor. We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red. \nKarl hits the floor and begins CONVULSING violently. \nSpaulding STEPS DOWN from behind the counter, puts his foot on Karl's throat and points his pistol at Karl's head. \nCAPT. SPAULDING And most of all... fuck you! \nBOOM! Spaulding SHOOTS Karl in the head. \nThe screen EXPLODES RED, then TURNS BLACK. \nCAPT. SPAULDING (V.O.) God damn it, that motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit. \nBILL Perfect. \nJERRY I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12. \nThe car drives past. We turn and hold on the billboard. We see the happy smiling face of a young Captain Spaulding. \nEXT. CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nThe car pulls up to one of the gas pumps. Bill and Jerry get out. Inside we see Spaulding, now in army pants and a hunting jacket, mopping the floor. \nBILL I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about. \nJERRY (salutes) OK, Boss. \nJerry walks inside and immediately comes back out. \nJERRY Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome. \nBILL How awesome? \nJERRY Really fucking awesome. \nBILL Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome? \nJERRY Hell yeah. \nJerry sticks his head back inside the car. \nJERRY Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey. \nINT. CAR - BACK SEAT - NIGHT \nA dark haired girl, DENISE WILLIS, 27, sleeps curled up under a blanket. \nJERRY Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a kick ass place. \nShe opens her eyes. \nDENISE Huh? \nJERRY Grab Mary and come inside. \nDenise shakes a lump of jackets and sweaters lying next to her. She removes a sweater from the top of the pile to REVEAL the face of MARY KNOWLES, 29. \nDENISE Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work. \nMARY (half asleep) Sleeping. \nDENISE Rise and shine. \nMARY (groggy) No please, let me sit this one out. \nDENISE (removing the blanket) Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer. \nMARY I resign. \nDENISE Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug. \nMARY (opening her eyes) Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap. \nDENISE Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. (sarcastic) ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa? \nMARY Aw, shit... (exhales deeply) I gotta pee anyway. \nINTERLUDE \nGrainy super 8 footage shows us an OLD MAN standing in front of a small shack. His name is Lewis Dover. The shack is painted white and covered with SIMPLISTIC RELIGIOUS WRITINGS. \nLEWIS I ain't no rich man, but I see the truth. You do not have to go to Hell. You are in Hell. This is Hell. All American Hell. (holds up a gun) ...true heaven in my hands... I'm gonna blow Satan back through the door to Hell. \nSurrounding the shack are strange sculptures of various half- human/half-animal creations. \nINT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nSpaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor, he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood. \nBill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object in a glass case over the counter. In the case is a shriveled up looking half human and half fish figure. It is the size of a small child. A banner above reads: \nMARY If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl. \nDENISE Scattered, smothered and covered. \nMARY Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me. \nINT. SPAULDING'S - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT \nJerry knees over a box of magazines labeled TRUE CRIME $1.00, he flips through an issue, tosses it back. \nBill leans against the wall next to him, sipping a hot cup of coffee. \nThe girls return from the bathroom. Jerry jumps up with excitement. \nJERRY Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets. \nDENISE Tickets for what? \nJERRY This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem. \nDENISE I don't want to see that. \nMARY How about if we skip it and just hang out here. I can get some great shots of this stuff. \nJerry PULLS Denise over and puts his arm around her. \nJERRY Aw, come on. It will be fun. \nDENISE Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun. \nBill grabs Mary by the hand and kisses it. \nBILL (smiling) We'll need pictures of the inside too. \nMARY Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer. \nBill and Mary kiss. \nSpaulding waits, unamused. He rolls his eyes. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Anytime this year, people. Alright line your asses up in front of the black door. The tour is about to begin. \nSpaulding disappears through a curtain behind the counter. The kids wait. \nThe black metal door CREAKS open. \nThey enter the darkened room. \nINT. SPAULDING'S - MUSEUM - NIGHT \nDarkness. A blue light comes on. Spaulding is standing on a MOTORIZED PLATFORM. He begins the tour, speaking through a small megaphone. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to enter a world of darkness. A world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God. (pointing with a cane) To your left you see the infamous Albert Fish. \nA lifeless wax figure POPS forward with a loud metal CLANG. Mary jumps back with fright. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Sadist, masochist, child killer and most of all importantly cannibal. Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning himself with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin. On the right, notice the X-ray... \nCLOSE UP - X-RAY \nCAPT. SPAULDING ...showing clearly 29 sewing needles inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish was executed in 1936 at the age of \nSpaulding rolls backwards and continues the tour. \nCLOSE UP ON: a dummy face of a grizzly looking old man in hunting attire. \nCAPT. SPAULDING To your right. One of our most popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein. \nBehind the figure of Gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain woman. \nMary recoils in disgust. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Murderer, cannibal and momma's little bitch boy. Mr. Gein found special pleasure in playing with the dead bodies of women, especially their sexual organs. He was quite a handy little dandy, fashioning lamp shades, jewelry and human skin suits from his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA wax figure of a young man in doctor's scrubs. He is covered in blood. \nDENISE Yeah so... OK, expect us more around eleven or so. OK yeah, I will... love you, too, bye. \nShe hangs up the phone, opens the doors and heads back to the car. \nINT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT \nJERRY I know it's hard to understand, but I really want to see this tree. \nCAPT. SPAULDING OK, alright I'll draw you a map, but I still say it is a waste of time. \nJERRY Great. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nThrough the window we see Jerry talking to Spaulding. Spaulding draws a map, explaining as he draws. \nMARY Geez, he never gets tired does he. \nDENISE Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on \nMARY Maybe he's a cyborg. \nBILL (wearily, sips his coffee) I like sleep. \nDENISE Here he comes. \nJerry comes bouncing out towards the car and jumps in. \nHe is holding a map and a box of chicken. \nJERRY We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy. \nMARY Huh? \nDENISE Ugh, what's that smell? \nJERRY Fried chicken. (holds up a drumstick) Anybody want some? \nNo one responds. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nAn OLD FARMER and his WIFE stare directly into the camera. \nOLD MAN I don't know where that skunk ape sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all... all I know is he eats squirrels to survive and he had impure relations with my wife. \nWIFE That's true. He performed lurid acts upon me and my person while my husband Russell was a fix'n to our hound Clarence. \nOLD MAN If I see that thing again... I'm a gonna kill that skunk ape. \nBILL (off screen) What does it look like? \nWIFE It looked just like that chubby fella from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine. \nOLD MAN Hold up the picture. \nThe wife holds up a pencil sketch of a Bigfoot like creature and a newspaper photo of Ernest Borgnine. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nBill's car moves past empty farmlands. A HEAVIER RAIN is now falling. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJerry directs Bill from Spaulding's hand-drawn map. \nJERRY Keep straight on this road here. \nBILL How much further? \nJERRY I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet? \nBILL I don't know. \nMary and Denise sit bundled up in blankets. \nMARY Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway. \nBABY Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate? \nJERRY What? \nBABY Cone. \nJERRY Huh... what cone? \nBABY Any cone, yeah... (looking out the window) I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either. \nJERRY I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese. \nBABY I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous. \nBILL What about the tree? \nBABY Oh yeah, the tree. \nMARY This is crazy. She don't know nothing. \nBaby turns her attention toward Mary. \nBABY Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love. \nJERRY Cool. \nBILL Which way? \nBABY Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there. \nINT. MENTAL HOSPITAL \nThe camera FLOATS through the hallways of the Peabody Mental Institution. It is HALLOWEEN. \nPATIENTS wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns and cheap plastic masks. Some are laughing, some are screaming. \nWe move into a private room. Where we see DOCTOR SATAN completely covered except for his eyes, hovering over a BOUND AND GAGGED PATIENT. \nWe move off the doctor to a crayon child's DRAWING of a JACK- O'-LANTERN. Tortured screams fill the room. \nEXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - NIGHT \nFrom a STRANGER'S POV we see the car STRUGGLING down a dirt road. \nINT. CAR - SAME \nEveryone rides in silence, music plays on the radio. \nThe song ends and a NEWS REPORTER comes on. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.O.) This is WJRC News at the top of the hour... Investigators in Clairemont County are no closer to identifying the body of a young woman found crucified to the doors of St. Mary's Church yesterday morning. \nBaby lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. \nMARY Excuse me, could you not smoke in here? \nBaby puts out the cigarette on the back of her hand. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Local police and State Officials have released this report... \nJERRY What's that? \nBILL I don't know. Looks like some kind of animal. \nBill stops the car. \nEXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - NIGHT \nSitting dead center in the middle of the road is a HUMONGOUS DOG. The dog stares straight ahead. Long strands of drool hang from its mouth to the ground. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nMARY Why are we stopping? \nBILL There's a dog in the road. \nDENISE Honk at him. Scare him. \nBaby is leaning on her chin staring at Mary and Denise. The car radio plays in the background. \nMARY Can I help you with something? \nBABY I was just wondering. \nMARY Wondering what? \nBABY Are you two gals all funny with each other? \nMARY What? \nBABY You know... a couple of queers. \nMARY Do you believe this fucking girl? \nBABY (turning her attention to Mary) I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch. \nDenise tries to QUICKLY defuse the situation. \nDENISE No. No pussy licking here, but thanks for your concern. \nBill and Jerry slide back into the car. \nBILL Well, I got some bad news and some bad news. \nMARY What? \nJERRY (fake Scottish accent) Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now. \nBILL And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage. \nDENISE For fucking sake Jerry, what the fuck are we gonna do? \nBaby starts laughing. \nMARY What the hell are you laughing about? \nBABY I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV. \nMARY Oh, wonderful. (muttering to herself) Fucking psycho. \nBILL I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road. \nBABY If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier. \nMARY Just back up. \nJERRY I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right? \nBABY Oh wait! I love this song! \nBaby reaches over and TURNS UP the VOLUME. She loudly sings along with the song. \nBILL Fine. I'll go straight. \nMARY What! \nBILL (over the loud music) Fine! I'll go straight! \nThe car moves forward. After about fifty yards the car HITS something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog. \nBILL Fuck! We are fucked! \nDENISE Turn that fucking radio off! \nBill shuts off the radio. \nDENISE Now what are we gonna do? \nBABY We can walk to my house from here. My brother's got a tow truck, he can come get your car. \nA silence falls over the car. \nMARY I think I'm going fucking crazy. \nDENISE I can't believe... \nBILL How much further? \nBABY Almost there... are you in a hurry or something? \nBILL Well, yeah, kind of. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nJerry is stretched out across the front seat, reading a book on Freak Shows. Denise and Mary sit in the back, curled up under layers of blankets and clothes. \nDENISE Fuck, it's freezing. \nJERRY Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan. \nDENISE Oh, yeah. \nJERRY Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder. \nDENISE Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree? \nJERRY It says, \"records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility.\" \nDENISE So. \nJERRY Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16. \nDENISE Why? \nJERRY (scanning the book) Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, \"criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946.\" \nDENISE Yeah? \nJERRY These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms. \nDENISE So what? \nJERRY I don't know, I just thought it was interesting. \nDENISE You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point? \nJERRY I don't... (to himself) ...I just thought it was weird. \nMARY (bursting in) God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch. \nJERRY Huh? \nMARY That stupid hillbilly slut. \nJERRY Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion. \nMARY You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something. \nDENISE Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us. \nJERRY When? \nDENISE When you were outside with Bill. \nMARY She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that. \nDENISE Yeah, she said we looked queer. \nJERRY Aw, get over it, she's just some dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough to be up to nothing... I mean anything... chicks. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nAn old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely overgrown. \nBill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the main drive. \nBaby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house. \nThe front of the house is covered with strange junk art. Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls. \nBABY These are all my dolls. I use to like to chop their heads off. \nBroken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird HUMAN FIGURES, ANIMAL SKINS stretched over bone armatures form a makeshift roof. \nMARY What! \nDENISE Jesus Christ. \nMARY I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. \nJERRY (Scottish accent) OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality. \nMARY Enough with the stupid voices. \nThe brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising it with his truck. \nA SIGN on the side of the truck reads FIREFLY TOWING. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE UP - TV SCREEN \nWe are watching a scene from THE OLD DARK HOUSE. GLORIA STUART, RAYMOND MASSEY and MELVYN DOUGLAS are standing in the rain pounding on a huge wooden door. \nGLORIA STUART Knock again louder. \nMELVYN DOUGLAS I should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead... that's an idea. \nRAYMOND MASSEY What is? \nMELVYN DOUGLAS Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them. \nGLORIA STUART I'm sure it would be very amusing. \nWe pull back from the TV to see Bill's clothes drying by the fireplace. Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt, is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa. \nBILL So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother? \nBABY (speaking from the next room) No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows? \nBILL Um, yeah sure, I guess. \nBABY You sure do a lot of guessing. \nBaby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to Bill. She hands him his drink and sits down next to him. \nBILL Thank you. \nBABY You're welcome. \nBaby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous. \nBILL Hey, um... (pointing to the mounted animal head over the fireplace) ...what kind of animal is that? \nBABY A dead one. \nBILL (sipping his drink) Mmmmm, this is tasty. \nBABY (scoops out some marshmallow with her finger) Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. (licks it off) \nBILL I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late. \nBABY Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me? \nBILL What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long. \nBABY Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody? \nBILL That's not something to joke about. \nBABY (rolls her eyes) OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up. \nFinally, the SOUND OF A TRUCK pulling up can be HEARD. \nBill jumps up and goes to the window. \nBILL Hey, great they're back. \nBABY (sarcastically) Whoopie fucking doo. \nTV SCREEN - SAME \nJERRY Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown. \nMOTHER (flirting) Oh, really... (puts her hand on Jerry's knee and winks) ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen. \nJERRY I don't doubt that. \nDENISE No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house... (glances at Jerry) ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down. \nMOTHER That's nice. \nDENISE Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters. \nJERRY And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples. \nMOTHER I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya. \nJERRY I was just kidding. \nBill and Mary snicker at Jerry's comments. Denise tries to keep a straight face. \nMOTHER Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween. \nMARY No, just a little too old. \nMOTHER Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day. \nBaby returns from the garage. \nBABY Tiny's home. \nMOTHER What about R.J.? \nBABY Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel. \nBILL The yard, what's that? \nMOTHER It's an old auto junkyard out in Baldwin. \nDENISE How long is that gonna take? \nMOTHER He should be back in a couple hours. \nMARY A couple hours! \nDENISE Can't Tiny drive us to a phone? \nMother and Baby laugh. \nMOTHER (laughing) Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle. \nDENISE How's he get around out here? \nBABY He walks, duh. \nMARY Fucking great. \nMOTHER I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you. \nMARY Sorry. \nMOTHER Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner. \nUnder the circumstances they realize they have no choice. They grin and bear it. \nDENISE Thank you. \nJERRY (imitates Elvis) Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. \nMOTHER (Mother touches Jerry's shoulder suggestively) You're a strange one, aren't ya honey. I think you and me are get on like... (she thinks for a second) ...like something real good. \nCamera moves over to the TV. THE END fades up on screen. Dr. Wolfenstein appears over the credits. \nDR. WOLFENSTEIN There well, who knew there was love to be found in The Old Dark House. Coming up next, do not move a muscle, an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic... are you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby? \nINT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM \nBill, Jerry, Mary and Denise are now all seated around a large dining room table. A thick mountain of candles sits burning dead center on the table, giving off a warm glow. Dozens of Halloween decorations dangle from strings over the table, spiders, bats and black cats. \nMARY Don't worry, I'm gone. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nBill, Jerry, Denise and Mary climb back into their car. \nBILL Don't look back, just get in the car. \nDENISE Lock the fucking doors. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nBill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway towards the road. The heavy rain makes visibility difficult. \nBILL (straining to see through the darkness) Almost there. \nJERRY Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you? \nMARY (leaning her forehead on the window) Of course she was gonna cut me, she's a fucking nut... (closes her eyes and takes a breath) I knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up. \nSLAM! Suddenly, Baby pounds her fist against Mary's window. Mary jumps back in terror. \nBABY (screaming) You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna die like a dog! \nBaby disappears into the darkness. \nMARY Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here! \nBill pulls the car up to the front gate. It is chained shut with a huge padlock. \nLIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows. \nFLASH CLOSE-UP CUTS - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer down from above. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nBill opens the car door, starts to get out. \nMARY (hysterical) What are you doing! \nBILL I gotta open the gate. \nMARY Drive through it! \nBILL It won't work. \nJERRY Holy fuck, hurry up. \nJerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates. \nSUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops to his knees. \nMARY Bill! Help him! \nJerry throws open his door to get out. He's SHOVED BACK into the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door. This scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a METAL PIPE. \nBill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker turns his attention on the car. He also begins smashing the car's windows. \nEXT. CAR - NIGHT \nFrom a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten. The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle. The scarecrows continue to pound on the car. \nAs we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - MAGIC \nFrom a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning sunrise. All is still. \nThe sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind it. \nEXT. WILLIS HOUSE - SUNRISE \nDarkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is 7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off. \nA hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep groan. A light turns on. \nWhoosh! He pulls her through the curtains. From behind the curtain we hear Mary SCREAMING and Otis LAUGHING. \nMARY (behind curtain) Bill? No, no, no! What have you done? Bill! \nINT. CURTAIN ROOM - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY \nUgliness. Decay. Pain. Carefully arranged on a model's platform is the severed torso of Bill sewn to a large homemade fish tail. He is lying on his ride side posing. \nBill's face is frozen in a death scream. \nOTIS Behold... The Fish-Boy! \nMARY (repeating to herself) This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real. \nOTIS Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma... (grabs his canvas and holds it in her face) ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes. \nPainted on the canvas is the gruesome scene of Bill as the Fish-Boy. \nMARY (crying) Fuck you, you fucking freak! \nOTIS Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way... (twitches and shakes) ...but if you'll notice... (points to a blank spot in the painting) right here, needs a little something, heh? \nOtis slowly puts down the canvas, turns and picks up a huge hunting knife. \nMARY What are you doing? (squirming) ...no, stop... please, please. \nOTIS You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized. \nOtis draws back the knife. \nMARY (screaming) Noooooooooooo! \nOtis swings the knife forward, directly into the camera. \nCLOSE UP - CLOWN FACE \nRavelli's clown head bobs back and forth. \nPULL BACK TO: \nRavelli, wearing his clown head, stands by the road side waving to passing cars. \nEXT. SPAULDING'S - DAY \nA police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop. OFFICER GEORGE WYDELL, 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car. \nFollowing close behind, OFFICER STEVE NAISH, 29, tall athletic. \nWYDELL (pauses, looks around, pulls up his belt) Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us. \nNAISH Right. \nThey walk to the door. \nINT. SPAULDING'S - DAY \nThe door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit. \nWydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter. \nNo one is around. \nA rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a handwritten note, \"ring for service\". Wydell rings it once, waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response. \nNAISH (looking around the room) Get a load of all this crap... this is one sick place. \nWydell begins ringing the bell non-stop. \nSpaulding shouts from the backroom. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Whoever's a jerking off on that bell better be gone when I get out there... 'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off. \nSpaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry. He sees the troopers and puts on a phony grin. \nCAPT. SPAULDING Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about. \nWYDELL (pulls a paper from his pocket) What I need are some answers. (unfolds the paper to reveal a picture of Denise) \nBill's car is down in a ditch, run off the side of the road. \nINT. POLICE CAR - MIDDAY \nNaish checks the license plate number with his sheet. \nNAISH Plates match. \nWYDELL Call the chief... We found 'em. \nEXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY \nA small, crummy liquor store stands next to a sleazy motel. A filthy looking hooker leads her customer to a waiting room, a homeless bum stands screaming obscenities in the parking lot. \nINT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY \nThe store is decorated for Halloween. \nOff to one side is a curtained room. A sign reads \"XXX 8mm loops\", sex noises can be heard inside. \nBaby and Rufus stand at the counter waiting for the CASHIER, a skinny geek with glasses, to total up their purchases. The counter is loaded with bottles. \nThe cashier is packing the bottles into cardboard boxes. \nCASHIER You all having a Halloween party tonight? \nBABY Now, what makes you think that? \nCASHIER You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people. \nBABY Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean? \nCASHIER Yeah, yeah... (giggling) ...I like to fuck shit up. \nBABY I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya... (looks at his name tag) ...Goober? \nCASHIER (looking down at his tag) Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes. \nBABY (uninterested) Great story Goober, how much? \nCASHIER Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars. \nBaby throws down three hundred dollars. \nBABY Keep the change and get yourself a new name. \nCASHIER Holy crap, thanks! \nRufus picks up the boxes from the counter. He and Baby start to walk away. \nBABY Come on, bro. Let's go. \nCASHIER (holding out a flyer) Hey, wait take this. \nBaby stops and grabs the flyer. \nBABY What's this? \nCASHIER A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird. \nThe flyer reads MISSING, KAREN MURPHY, 18. The picture on the flyer shows the smiling chubby face of a young girl. \nBABY Now isn't she a happy little cherub... oh well (stuffs it in her pocket) ...nobody just up and disappears. \nRUFUS JR. (mutters) Aliens. \nBABY Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens. \nEXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUOR - MIDDAY \nBaby and Rufus exit. Rufus loads the boxes into the back of the truck. Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette. \nEXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY \nBill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road. The back is attached to a police tow truck. An additional police cruiser arrives on the scene. \nSheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser. \nTiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal and milk into the bowl. He stirs it with the spoon. \nTiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby. Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. After a few spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of the room. \nHe pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. In the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin female bodies. \nTiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage. \nOne of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do not. They are dead. \nTiny turns off the overhead light. \nINT. POLICE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON \nWydell and Naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking lot. \nNAISH You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird. \nWYDELL (scanning the parking lot) Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help. \nNAISH Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way. \nWYDELL Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop. \nNAISH I guess not. \nWYDELL That must be him. \nEXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON \nA rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road. \nA filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars. \nTwo fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards. \nA Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station. Willis leans against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup. \nA police cruiser pulls up. Wydell and Naish step from the car. \nWYDELL Mr. Willis? \nMR. WILLIS Yes, sir. \nWYDELL I'm Wydell... this is Naish. \nWydell extends his hand, they shake hands. \nNAISH Hey. \nMR. WILLIS George Willis... (to Wydell) ...any leads? \nWYDELL Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point. \nMR. WILLIS That's it? \nWYDELL Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan. \nMR. WILLIS Dr. Satan? \nNAISH Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with. \nWYDELL Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms. \nMR. WILLIS What about the body you found? \nWYDELL (slightly surprised) Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one. \nNAISH Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway. \nMR. WILLIS Fit the profile? \nNAISH No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble. \nWYDELL Her part in this I can't figure... but I will. \nMR. WILLIS (wipes his brow) Christ, you know it's crazy... (gets choked up) I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know? \nOTIS What! God damn, how many? \nGRAMPA (watching TV) What? How many? \nOTIS Don't worry about it. \nOtis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver. \nMOTHER I don't know. I only saw one. \nOTIS I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs... (handing the gun to Mother) ...here, take this. \nMOTHER (takes the gun) What should I do? \nOTIS Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME \nNaish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of garbage. \nNAISH Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away? \nMR. WILLIS Shhhh... you hear that? \nThe soft sound of moaning can be heard. \nNAISH Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from? \nMR. WILLIS Over here, inside the smokehouse. \nNaish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The thick door is chained shut. \nNAISH (knocking on door) Anybody in there? \nThe moaning gets louder. \nMR. WILLIS We gotta break it open. \nNAISH I ain't got a warrant. \nWillis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open the door. \nMR. WILLIS Tell it to my daughter. \nNAISH (grabbing hold to help) Shit... fuck procedure. \nTogether they struggle to open the door. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - SAME \nMother slowly opens the front door. The revolver is behind her back, tucked in her apron strings. \nMOTHER (trying to be sexy) Well hello, officer. \nWYDELL (holding up his badge) Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon. \nMOTHER Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think? \nWYDELL My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions. \nMOTHER Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know. \nWYDELL I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... (holds up picture) ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her? \nMOTHER Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry. \nShe begins to close the door. Wydell stops her. \nWYDELL Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something. \nMOTHER I um... no, I don't think so... \nWYDELL Please, just a minute. \nMOTHER Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all. \nShe opens the door. \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nThe rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night. \nOtis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary. \nBringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child. He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam. \nThe group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure. \nOTIS (handing Baby the lantern) Hold this. Point it over here. \nBaby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in the base of the wooden structure. \nOtis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, attached to the hook is a chain. \nOtis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank. Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the end of the chain. \nOtis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground. He flips open the lid. \nOTIS Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here. \nRufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck. \nBABY Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming. \nMOTHER Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting. \nRufus cuts loose the gag. \nJERRY Please don't kill us, please don't kill us. \nBABY (imitating Jerry) Please don't kill us, please don't kill us. \nOTIS Bitch, shut your mouth and get your shit in the box. \nJERRY Let us go, please... let the girls go. \nBABY (imitating Jerry) Let us go, please... let the girls go. \nOtis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry. \nOTIS Get in... now! \nMOTHER Wait, I want to say good-bye. \nMother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss. \nMOTHER Bye sweety, we could of been great together. \nJERRY Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody. \nMOTHER Aw, honey you know I can't do that. \nBABY We won't tell anybody. \nOtis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards the coffin. \nOTIS Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot... alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking night. \nJERRY Please, please this is insane. You can't do this. \nRufus pushes Jerry into the coffin. \nOTIS It is and I can... next. \nDenise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts to run. \nOTIS (laughs and raises his pistol) Where's she think she's a gonna get to? She's gonna run all the way home. \nBABY No! Let me get her... (turns to Mother) ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun... can I get her? \nMOTHER That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but... \nOTIS (rolls his eyes) Well, go get her. \nBaby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field after Mary. \nEXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT \nBehind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the many automobiles beneath. \nRufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and starts the engine. He drives off. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nRufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland. He turns on the overhead flashing lights. \nEXT. FIELDS - NIGHT \nThe police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields. \nINT. PIT - NIGHT \nDenise stands knee deep in the sludge. Broken bits of the coffin's remains are scattered around her. \nDENISE Jerry please answer me. \nA soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of the pit. \nDENISE Jerry... (moving slowly forward) ...is that you? \nDenise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. She turns the corner to see: \nTWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry. \nThe two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, they stare at Denise, then return to their prey. \nDenise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness. \nThey reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nPrimitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter. \nLaying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with rope. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThrough the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in the fields with several large dogs. She is firing a gun as she dances. \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nBaby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to laugh. \nThe car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The car drives off. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nTiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll. Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the stake. \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nOtis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe, walks solemnly through the tall grass. \nINT. PIT - NIGHT \nDenise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched animal sounds. \nA GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer, CLAWING at her face. \nDenise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces and starts to run. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nOtis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin. Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head. \nTiny stands behind him holding a lit torch. \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nThe police car drives wildly through the fields. \nINT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \n", "test1_input": "JERRY Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill? \nBILL Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache. \nJERRY Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken. \nBILL Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat. \nJERRY (shrugs) Tasted pretty good. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nIn a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body of GRAMPA. \nGrampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand. \nGRAMPA God damn it, I can do it. I can do it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't dead yet... so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet. \nGrampa steadies himself against Tiny. They slowly walk out of the room. \nGRAMPA God damn, my dogs are barking. \nAs they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that Grampa is in his late 80's. \nGrampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room. \nAs they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE OBJECT sitting on a shelf. \nA LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973. \nThe sound from the TV fades up in the background. \nBELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard. \nBELA LUGOSI (V.O.) Your hands, please. Your left hand shows your past... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTV SCREEN \nBela is seen as a fortune teller holding a woman's hands. This is a scene from The Wolfman. \nBELA LUGOSI ...and your right hand shows your future. \nCLOSE UP \nWe see a tight shot of the woman's palm. A pentagram appears. \nINT. DENISE'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe PULL BACK from the TV to find Donald Willis sitting in a old easy chair. The room is modest, but comfortable. \nHe reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock, notices the time, concerned look comes over his face. \nThe phone rings. He quickly answers it. \nMR. WILLIS Hello, Denise? \nDisappointment. He mutes the TV. \nMR. WILLIS Oh, yeah... no, Fred. I was hoping you were Denise, she's a little late. (pausing) Yeah, yeah I'm sure the rain just slowed 'em down... yeah... uh-huh, yeah... no, no you can keep it 'til Tuesday... alright, talk to ya tomorrow, bye. \nUnmutes the sound on the TV. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe feast is on. Mother, Tiny, Grampa, Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise are gathered around the table. \nMOTHER OK, everyone, put on your masks. We can't very well eat with our everyday faces exposed. \nMother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow. Jerry, Bill and Denise slowly raise up their masks, Mary hesitates. \nGRAMPA (to Mary) Christ kid, put it on. She ain't letting any of us touch the grub 'til you're wearing the damn thing. \nMary rolls her eyes and complies. \nJERRY I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm. \n", "test1_true": "JERRY Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan? \nBILL Here we go. \nGrampa shifts his eyes onto Mother. \nMOTHER (nervously) Well, I'm not much for local gossip an this and that, but I've heard it mentioned in passing over the years but... I mean folks is queer and they say things, crazy things you know what I mean? \nGRAMPA It's all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of hungry chipmunks... Christ, Dr. Satan. That takes the bull's nuts alright... (starts laughing) ...hey, I hear some genius up north got a hot line on the Easter Bunny for ya. \nA voice from the shadows interrupts. \nOTIS (slowly) I know all about what you want to know about. \nA PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner of the room. This is OTIS. \nHe stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO. \nHe is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one head. The label reads WOLF. \nMOTHER (happy surprise) Otis! I can't believe you decided to come down and join us... and you brought little Wolf. This really is a special night... all my babies together. \nOtis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table. He leans forward onto the jar, resting his chin. \nOTIS Now, I don't know where you heard all your little fairy fables about Dr. Satan but... \nBILL From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum. \nOTIS (laughing) That old bitch hog don't know shit. He tells cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth. \nJERRY But something happened, right? I mean the story is based on a real incident, right? \nGRAMPA (mouth full of food) What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter for the Daily Asshole? \nMOTHER Grampa... watch the language. \nOTIS I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs. \nJERRY I really want to know. \nGRAMPA Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten him. \nOTIS Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in the fire if I told ya you'd see Hell... meanwhile you too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing, \"Holy Miss Moly, I got a live one.\" \nDENISE Can we please change the subject? \nThe CLOCK on the wall strikes TEN. \nGRAMPA (shouting) Dinner's over. (pushes his plate back and stands up) Ladies and Germs... it's showtime. \nGrampa hobbles out of the room. \nBILL What's he so excited about? \nDENISE Yeah, showtime for what? \nMOTHER For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show. \nJERRY Oh, you mean on TV. \nMOTHER No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love. \nJERRY Great. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT \nBilly, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an old barn. Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings them open. \nStanding inside waiting is Mother. She is all dressed up for the occasion. \nMOTHER Please, come in... how many in your party... (she counts the heads) ...one, two, three and four... right this way. \nMother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which serves as a program book. Hand drawn on each is an orange pumpkin. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT \n", "test2_input": "We follow Mother inside. \nThousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through the rotting wood rafters. Crates, barrels and an odd assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. Filling these seats are LIFELESS DUMMIES. \nMOTHER Please be seated. \nMother motions toward four empty seats in the front row. \nJERRY (whispering) This is way too fucked up for words. \nMARY (loud whisper) I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words. \nBILL Just grin and bear it. \nDENISE That food... (holding stomach) ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke. \nJerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats. \nMary flips open the program. Inside, written in crayon, are the words: HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA -- starring the Comedy Legend GRAMPA and the World Famous BABY. \nMARY (to Bill) Check this out. \nBILL Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace. \nThe sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge music. \nA small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage. Mother Firefly stands behind the controls. \nShe is smiling proudly. \nThe curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL: \nA stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage. \nA giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded by dancing skeletons and demon girls. \nA microphone stands center stage. \nBILL (quietly) I can't believe what I'm seeing. \nJERRY I know, this is fucking nuts. \nMARY This is starting to make me real uncomfortable. \nBILL Just sit back and enjoy the show. \nThe sound of CANNED APPLAUSE fills the room. Bill begins to applaud, Jerry and Denise join in. Mary does not. \nGRAMPA (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, straight from his smash six week sold out run at Tiki-Ti Club... the Stardust lounge is proud to present Mr. Sexy himself... Grampa Hugo. \nGrampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to speak. \nGRAMPA Hey, let me tell ya a story... so I'm hanging out with my buddy Hal Jackowictz and I'm like, hey Hal let's go get some booze and chase the chickens... fucking Hal says no, no the old battle axe at home will break my balls... I gotta get my ass home. \nThe kids stare in shock at Grampa. Jerry begins to laugh. \nGRAMPA So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the secret. Go home tonight, crawl into bed, get under the covers and eat your wife's pussy... I mean jam your face right in the bush. \nJerry starts to giggle. \nDENISE (quietly) What are you laughing at? \nJERRY I don't know, I think he's funny. \nDENISE This isn't funny, it's twisted. \nGRAMPA So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts chomping and licking away at her pussy, she's screaming and howling... totally passes out from the experience. \nMARY Dear God, let this end. \nGRAMPA Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good, so he goes into the bathroom for a quick shave... (pauses) ...suddenly he lets out a horrible scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! \nThe recorded crowd chuckles. \nGRAMPA Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's wife Gloria... and she says, \"Quiet down, you'll wake Grandma!\" \nThe recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry. Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy. \n", "test2_true": "The curtains close and the stage goes dark. \nDENISE Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous. \nBILL (looking at his watch) Man, it's already ten thirty. \nMARY I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid. \nJERRY Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero. \nBILL Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else. \nDENISE I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless. \nMARY I fucking hope so. \nThe stage lights come up. The recorded applause and music begin. \nBaby enters the stage. She is dressed in a home-made showgirl outfit. She begins to dance clumsily to the music. She appears to be somewhat intoxicated. \nThe vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song. \nDENISE You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted. \nJERRY Shhhhhh. \nMARY How much is a person supposed to stand? \nBILL (motioning for Mary to keep her voice down) Quiet. \nMARY (sarcastically) Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure? \nBaby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. She gyrates and seductively TEASES one of the dummy audience members. \nBaby moves over to Jerry. Stroking her hand down his face. Denise tries to look amused. Jerry smiles uncomfortably. \nBaby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary. \nBaby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks. Mary is FURIOUS. \nBaby moves over to Bill. Mary watches like a mother hawk. \nBaby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on Bill. \nBaby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap. Mary BOLTS FORWARD and SHOVES Baby off of Bill. \nBaby crashes onto the floor. \nMARY Take that, you fucking slut! (Mary spits at Baby) Fucking redneck whore! \nBABY You shouldn't a done that. \nMARY Why? You gonna do something about it? \nBABY (standing up) Yeah, I'll do something. \nBaby takes out a straight razor from behind her back. \nBABY I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat. \nMOTHER Baby! Stop! \nMrs. Firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight and intercedes. \nBABY Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming. \nMOTHER No, I told you... \nSCREECH! The garage door slides open. Rufus has returned. \nRUFUS JR. (interrupting) Car's done. \nDENISE Thank God. \nMOTHER I suggest you kids leave now. \n", "test3_input": "OTIS Interlock your fingers behind your head... (Naish hesitates) ...do it! \nNaish obeys. \nOTIS Kneel. \nNaish kneels down. \nFrom a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side. \nThe scene fades to blood red. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes, a heavy rain falls. \nBurning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises from the chimney. \nIt is Halloween night. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP TV \nDr. Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant hammer. \nDR. WOLFENSTEIN It is midnight my little boils and ghouls, the witching hour. Time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and madmen to go to work... so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back and prepare for a fright night classic... (lightning crashes) ...The House of Frankenstein. \nThe movie begins and we move off the TV to see: \nHundreds of CANDLES are lit, illuminating everything with a flickering light. Music blares from a cheap stereo. BLACK and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped from ceiling to floor. \nDead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall, it is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations. A long chain connects the object up into the rafters. \nThis is the Halloween party from Hell. \nAn intoxicated Grampa, dressed as FLASH GORDON, sits in his wheelchair watching the TV, drinking MOONSHINE from an unmarked bottle. \nGRAMPA (slurred drunken yelling at the screen) Get those motherfucker... those high water bitches and rocketship daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em. \nCRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly banging on a large oil drum. He is dressed like a low budget BATMAN, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape. \nA drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE MEGAPHONE. \nMother and Baby, both dressed as SUPERHEROES, dance around the covered object. Both are swigging moonshine from jugs. \nRUFUS JR. (shouting through megaphone) Show me, show me, show me, show me! \nMother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering from the object in the middle of the room. They RIP at the paper, spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual. \nAs the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. Denise is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit. They are gagged. \nMother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing moonshine in their faces. \nBABY Drink up, it's party time. \nMOTHER Enjoy your last night... (looking around) ...where's Otis? \nBABY Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year. \nRufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around and around. \nRUFUS JR. Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis! \nMOTHER Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come down with all this hoop-dee-doo bouncing off the walls. Now, calm down. \nGRAMPA I shot an elephant in my pajamas this morning... how he got in my pajamas I'll never know. \nBABY Grampa, shhhhhhhh. \nGRAMPA Then we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge 'em. \nMOTHER (gesturing at Grampa) Let him finish. \nGRAMPA Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant. \nThe room goes silent. All eyes are focused on the stairs. \n", "test3_true": "Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. As Otis reaches the last step Rufus hands him the megaphone. \nDenise, Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in turn rotate past the scene unfolding. \nOTIS (through the megaphone) I'm the one who brings the Christmas candy... now tell me (pauses and raises his arms) ...Who's your Daddy? \nOtis walks closer to the rotating captives. \nOTIS I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... (waits) \nMOTHER Who's your Daddy! \nOTIS Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad... \nBABY Who's your Daddy! \nMOTHER Who's your Daddy! \nOtis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly before Denise. \nHe drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF SKIN sewn together from pieces of Denise's father. \nDenise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely able to comprehend the madness around her. \nOtis moves in close and licks her across the face. \nOTIS I'm the one who loves you when you're fucking dead! \nEveryone chants \"Who's your Daddy?\" \nOTIS (imitating Willis) Now, I say my little darlings... (rotates the chain to Mary) maybe prancing around where you don't belong ain't such a winner of an idea... (slaps Mary across the face) \nSlowly turns the chain to face Jerry. \nOTIS And you, the great rusher of fools, what were you after... (slaps Jerry) Huh, speak to me... (slaps him again) Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan... everybody got to know about Dr. Satan, Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest for fuck sake, he's already got one foot in the grave and the other's tap dancing around the edge... (gets nose to nose with Jerry) ...well, I can see the disappointment on your sad little puppy face... so I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big favor. You owe me, boy. I'm gonna let you meet the old bastard. \nGRAMPA That's a horse's ass alright, I told you. \nJerry's eyes widen in fear. \nOTIS Baby, roll that old love machine over here, so this boy can meet his hero. \nBaby rolls Grampa over to Jerry. \nOTIS (lifts his skin mask) You see it's all true, the boogieman is real and you found him... (Jerry stares in shock) ...why so sad? Isn't this what you begged for? There he is, the living legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan. Now, don't get shy on me... ask your hero some questions, don't blow this last in a lifetime opportunity. \nGRAMPA Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the air, the earth... the universe. \nMother moves in close to Jerry. \nMOTHER Look at the way he lights up... Grampa just loves meeting his fans. \nOtis grabs Jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a ventriloquist dummy, provides Jerry's voice. \nOTIS Aw gee whiz, I'm so excited... I really think you're the coolest... you're tops on the playground, cooler than the Fonzie. \nBaby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine. \nBABY Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a question. \nBaby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated. \nBABY (squeezing Mary's face, hard) I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do you like to kiss on the first date or is that considered slutty? \nGRAMPA What the fuck are you saying? Who the hell is talking to me? \nTiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum. KLANG - KLANG - KLANG. Rufus joins in, clapping his hands. \nMOTHER Come on, my babies are getting restless. \nRUFUS JR. Dump in the pit, dump in the pit, dump in the pit. \nMother, Baby, Grampa join in chanting with Rufus. \nOTIS Alright, alright. Cut 'em down, it's time they get what they came here for. \n"}

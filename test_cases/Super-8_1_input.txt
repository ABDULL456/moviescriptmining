CHARLES Martin, I have a new line for you. 
He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB. 
TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him, watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge. He looks to her. A beat. 
JOE You mind? 
Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a girl he's admired for some time. After a beat: 
ALICE My dad works at the mill. 
And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too much for him to bear. 
JOE Close you eyes. Please. 
He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Then, PRE-LAP: 
CHARLES (O.S.) So this is very emotional. 
EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera. 
Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat. 
CHARLES Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga-- 
ALICE I know, we read it, we get it. 
CHARLES Okay, I'm just directing. Martin get on your mark. Martin, you're going to have to reassure her. Do you know what "reassure her" means? 
MARTIN Yeah, I think so. 
CHARLES Okay-- we're starting on Alice's side first-- Preston: a couple seconds after "action" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy-- 
PRESTON I know what that looks like. 
POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker: 
CHARLES Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera? 
CARY Sorry man. 
CHARLES Let's rehearse this -- save your real performances for when we're filming, though. 
Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera- height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Ready? Here we go... action! 
Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY: 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you leave town. 
MRS. HATHAWAY John. I don't like it. This case. These murders. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? 
Preston walks past them, acting in the background. 
MRS. HATHAWAY Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year. 
We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role -- 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY Sweetheart. This is my job. 
MRS. HATHAWAY The dead, coming back to life...? I think you're in danger-- 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I have no choice-- 
MRS. HATHAWAY You do have a choice. We all do... 
And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real. 
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away. 
Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set: 
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) But I'm asking you now-- please. For me. Don't go back. Don't leave me. (MORE) MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) I need to know this isn't the last time I'll see you. (BEAT) I just love you so much. 
Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.

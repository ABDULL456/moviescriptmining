He stumbles backward. The others crowd around, keep him from falling, also from getting away. Billings starts to help, but people grab him: this is Danny's problem. 
Steroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge and goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny is stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In seconds, Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up him, leans close: 
DANNY Enough? 
Steroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hits him four more shots to the face. Even this crowd winces. Steroid drops with a wet thud. 
As Danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands, people instinctively step back. 
DANNY Which was his room? 
KYLE (ferrety, glasses) Number ten. 
On the end: has an extra window. Danny walks into the room. Steroid's stuff starts flying out the door. 
EXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT 
Danny on a pay phone. 
DANNY Yeah, I'm trying to reach Carla, is she?... Did she get my other message?... No, I'll call back.... 
EXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT 
Danny hangs up the phone, glances into a room where we dimly glimpse Nazis taking drugs, drinking beer, screaming... 
VARIOUS VOICES Fucking niggers... Fucking niggers? Fucking gooks!... 
Then incomprehensible shrieking rage, a fight, breaking glass... 
Danny sighs, bored. He spots two nerdy Nazis, KYLE and WHIT, playing some battle re-creation board game and rehashing WWII.... 
WHIT ...Look, if Hitler had knocked out the RAF in '39, which he could easily, easily have done, he'd have taken England, and the U.S. wouldn't have had -- 
KYLE ...A staging ground for the invasion, yeah. But he blew it going after civilian targets. Just like he blew the Russian front, diverting supplies to Auschwitz.... 
Danny looks up the hill toward a farmhouse perched above them. One light burns inside. 
DANNY Where's Mrs. Moebius? 
KYLE Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes. 
Danny squats to look at the board game. 
DANNY What is this, Stalingrad? 
WHIT Gettysburg. But we're refighting it with World War I technology. It's a fucking bloodbath. 
He grins maniacally. Danny smiles. Kyle is emboldened by Danny's unexpected friendliness, lowers his voice.... 
KYLE That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. 
DANNY You could do it. 
KYLE Get out of here.... 
DANNY You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy. 
As Kyle and Whit contemplate his wisdom... 
DANNY Either of you know anything about explosives? 
They both look up, very interested. 
TWO FAMILIES IN TABLEAU -- WOODEN CUTOUTS -- DAY 
Jews: MAN (black hat, beard), WOMAN (sheitl, shawl), BOY (kippah, twerpy), GIRL (fat, ugly), even a DOG, a Star of David on its side. 
Blacks: MAN (watermelon, pitchfork), WOMAN (fat, fried chicken), BOY (syringe, 9mm), GIRL (twins, welfare check), DOG (black). 
VOICE (O.S.) Take a breath, let out a little, relax, then squeeze. (a RIFLE SHOT; nothing's hit) Again... 
Another SHOT. A bullet hits the Jewish boy in the rear end. Sunlight streams through the hole. We are: 
EXT. REAR OF MOTEL -- DAY 
Danny peers down the barrel of an M-16. Kyle squats beside him.

JUDGE You'd recently been offered a promotion. Why did you prefer to join the SS? 
HANNA has a DEFENCE COUNSEL, a young man, beside her, who is about to get up. But the JUDGE forestalls him. 
JUDGE I'll re-phrase my question. I'm trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely. Of her own free will. 
Everyone waits. 
JUDGE Well? 
HANNA I heard there were jobs. 
JUDGE Go on. 
HANNA I was working at Siemens when I heard the SS was recruiting. 
JUDGE Did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do? 
HANNA They were looking for guards. I applied for a job. 
MICHAEL is intent now, so are the STUDENTS beside him. 
JUDGE And you worked first at Auschwitz? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE Until 1944. Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow? 
HANNA Yes. 
ROHL leans into MICHAEL. 
ROHL Are you OK? 
MICHAEL I'm fine. 
JUDGE You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches? 
INT. TRAIN. DAY 
MICHAEL is hanging out of the window of the train, smoking a cigarette. 
INT. TRAIN. DAY 
MICHAEL sits down in his seat. ROHL moves to sit opposite him. 
ROHL So what did you think? 
MICHAEL I don't know. It wasn't quite what I expecting. 
ROHL Wasn't it? In what way? What were you expecting? 
ROHL is looking at him. MICHAEL doesn't answer. 
DIETER I thought it was exciting. 
ROHL Exciting? 
DIETER Yes.

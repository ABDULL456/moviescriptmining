{"train": "LES MISERABLES \nWritten by \nWilliam Nicholson Alain Boublil, Claude- Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and Herbert Kretzmer \nAdapted from the Stage Musical \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" \nBased on the novel by Victor Hugo \nMay 20, 2012 \nBLACK SCREEN \nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: \nThe year is 1815. \nThe French revolution is a distant memory. Napoleon has been defeated. France is ruled by a King again. \nA1   EXT. TOULON PORT - DAY                                     A1 \nRISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air. Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest of tall masted warships. \nThe great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their rigging. \nThrough the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships under construction, and warships being refitted. \nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: \nToulon Home port of the French navy \n1    EXT. TOULON DOCK - DAY                                        1 \nStorm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal: these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved, wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched onto them. \nNow we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts broken, rising and falling on the surge. \nAs yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we follow the straining ropes down into the base of the slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he seems to feel nothing. \nThe convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the rope - \nCONVICTS Ha - Ha - \nCONVICT 3 Ha - Ha - Look down, look down Don't look them in the eye \nCONVICTS Look down, look down You're here until you die. \nCONVICT 4 No God above And Hell alone below \nCONVICTS Look down, look down There's twenty years to go. \nThe camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. \nBehind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. \nFOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray. \nCONVICT 2 I've done no wrong Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer! \nCONVICTS Look down, look down Sweet Jesus doesn't care. \nCONVICT 5 I know she'll wait I know that she'll be true - \nCONVICTS Look down, look down They've all forgotten you. \nCONVICT 1 When I get free You won't see me Here for dust! \nCONVICTS Look down, look down Don't look'em in the eye. \nCONVICT 3 How long, O Lord Before you let me die? \nCONVICTS Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave. \nWith a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. \nCRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean. Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. \nJavert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. \nJavert approaches Jean Valjean. \nJAVERT Now Prisoner 24601. Your time is up And your parole's begun. You know what that means? \nThe camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick factory buildings. \nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: \nEight years later \nMontreuil-sur-Mer, 1823. \nThe camera closes in to ground level to reveal the horseriders: \nJavert, flanked by two policemen. \n16A   EXT. GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY                               16A \nAs the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to get in. \nBEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living. \nJavert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless as ever. \nBEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying! \nTRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown onto a cart. \nThe police enter the harbour. \n17    EXT. HARBOUR - MONTREUIL - DAY                              17 \nThe beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police. \nBEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day! \nJavert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on. \n18      SCENE OMITTED                                                18 \n19      EXT. FACTORY YARD, MONTREUIL - DAY                           19 \nHeavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods. Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver, FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate. \n19A     INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - MEN'S SECTION - DAY               19A \nThe foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first floor office. \n20-22   INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - WOMEN'S SECTION - DAY        20-22 \nThe long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed business office. The figure of a man within. \nFOREMAN (flirtatiously, to women) At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread! \nFACTORY WOMAN 4 There are children back at home - \nFACTORY WOMAN 2 And the children have got to be fed. \nFACTORY WOMAN 7 And you're lucky to be in a job - \nThe Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman. As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. \nFOREMAN (quietly, to Fantine) And in a bed! \nFACTORY WOMAN 8 (to Fantine, as a warning) And we're counting our blessings! \nThe Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to speed up their work. \nFOREMAN At the end of the day just be glad to be working For a master who cares for the lives of the poor. \nFACTORY WOMAN 7 He's a riddle.. \nFACTORY WOMAN 4 He's no fool.. \nFACTORY WOMAN 6 He's the answer to anyone's prayer \nFACTORY WOMAN 8 And he paid for the brand new school \nFACTORY WOMAN 4 It's no wonder they made him the mayor! \nFACTORY WOMEN Bless the man who leads the way! At the end of the day! \nThey get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in the office above. \nThe Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her. \nMAIN FACTORY WOMAN Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today With his terrible breath and his wandering hands? \nJavert stares at him. \nOn the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine out, as she struggles against him. \n23   INT. FACTORY OFFICE - DAY                                    23 \nJavert bows. \nJAVERT I introduce myself, Inspector of Police. I've come to take the watch I'm here to keep the peace. Please know me as Javert. \nI'm here at your command With honour due to each. With justice in our hands No man's beyond our reach. Let all beware. \nVALJEAN Welcome, sir Come guard our laws I'm sure we're here In common cause. \nJavert turns to look through the high window onto the men's factory floor below. The last men are leaving for the day. \nJAVERT You've done the city proud, You've raised their banner high. (more) \nJAVERT (cont'd) You manufacture gems That anyone can buy Your people thrive. \nValjean shows some demonstration samples of their work. \nVALJEAN The dignity of toil To stay alive. \nJavert is puzzled. He's sure he recognises Valjean, but from where? \nJAVERT It seems to me We may have met. \nValjean throws him a sharp glance. \nVALJEAN Your face is not a face I would forget. \nA CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts - \n24   EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24 \nValjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover - \nA heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver - Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate. \nThe   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the   mud. \nValjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him. Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces himself to lift it from beneath. \nVALJEAN Get back! It may fall! \nFOREMAN No, Monsieur le Mayor! \nCROWD It'll kill you as well! \nJavert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a memory stirring in him. \nJAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast. The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal determination. \nValjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth. Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and gasping man, the others pull him clear. \nValjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him. \nJAVERT Can this be true? I don't believe what I see! A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared. \nHe shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions are. \nJAVERT Forgive me, sir. I would not dare - \nVALJEAN Say what you must. Don't leave it there. \nValjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue. \nValjean goes to help Fauchelevent. \nVALJEAN Let me help you up. \nFauchelevent groans as he rises. \nFAUCHELEVENT Monsieur le Mayor, you come from God! You are a saint! \nVALJEAN No more cart driving for you! \nJavert stares. He can't rid himself of his suspicion. \nJAVERT Monsieur le Mayor. \nHe draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he discusses something with his assistant. \nHAIR CRONE Go and see them. \nFantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore. \nTOOTH MAN                        HEAD WHORE Come over here,                   Come here my dear. I'll pay well for your youth. I pay ten francs for a tooth. \nFantine heads to the tooth man. \nTOOTH MAN You have, my dear, The clear advantage of youth. \nHEAD WHORE (whispers) Just the back ones. \nTOOTH MAN The pain won't last, You'll still be able to bite. \nShe grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth. \nTOOTH MAN I do it fast, I know my business all right. It's worth a go. \nThe pimp pushes her down. \nFANTINE You'll pay me first What I am due. \nTOOTH MAN You'll get twice If I take two! \nShe opens her mouth, and the pincers go in, as everyone gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth is removed. \n26B   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - NIGHT                    26B \nThe pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're all fit for business. \nWHORES God, we're weary, Sick enough to drop! \nLOVELY LADY 1 Belly burns like fire, Will the bleeding ever stop! \nPIMP Cheer up, deary! Show a happy face! Plenty more like you here If you can't keep up the pace. \nLOVELY LADY 1 Only joking! Deary knows her place! \nThe pimp gestures at Fantine, now slumped in a doorway, her cropped head in her hands. \nA shy captain watches Fantine. The pimp notices. \nPIMP Gimme the dirt - Who's that bit over there? \nWHORE 1 A bit of skirt, She's the one sold her hair. \nHEAD WHORE She's got a kid, Sends her all that she can. \nPIMP I might've known There is always some man. \nHe moves in on Fantine. \nPIMP Lovely lady, come along and join us! Lovely lady! \nFantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth. The whores cluster round her, hands reaching out to draw her in to their world. On the rotting warship, more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus. \nWHORE 1 Come on, dearie, why all the fuss? \nWHORES ... why all the fuss. \nWHORE 2 You're no grander than the rest of us. \nWHORES ... than the rest of us. \nWHORE 3 Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap. \nWHORES ...at the bottom of the heap. \nWhore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge Fantine's cheeks. \nHEAD WHORE Join your sisters - \nWHORE 1 Make money in your sleep! \nWHORES ... make money in your sleep. \nWHORE 2 That's right, dearie, Show him what you've got! \nWHORES ... show him what you've got. \nWHORE 3 That's right, dearie, Let him have the lot! \nWHORES ...let him have the lot. \nHe shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine. \nJAVERT She will answer for her actions When you make a full report. You may rest assured, M'sieur, That she will answer to the court. \nFantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he approaches Fantine. \nFANTINE There's a child who sorely needs me, Please, m'sieur, she's but that high. Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die. \nJAVERT I have heard such protestations Every day for twenty years. Let's have no more explanations, (more) \nJAVERT (cont'd) Save your breath and save your tears. \nJavert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away. \nValjean steps out of the shadows. \nVALJEAN A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale. \nJAVERT Monsieur le Mayor! \nVALJEAN You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail. \nJAVERT Monsieur le Mayor! \nJavert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream - \nFANTINE Can this be? \nVALJEAN Where will she end - This child without a friend? \nHe holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face. \nVALJEAN I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this? \nFANTINE M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray It's hard enough I've lost my pride. You let your foreman send me away. Yes, you were there And turned aside. I never did no wrong. \nVALJEAN Is it true what I've done - \nFANTINE My daughter's close to dying. \nVALJEAN - to an innocent soul? \nFANTINE If there's a God above - \nVALJEAN Had I only known then! \nFANTINE He'd let me die instead. \nVALJEAN In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital. \nValjean picks Fantine up in his arms. \nJavert is quietly coldly furious. \nJAVERT Monsieur le Mayor! \nFANTINE Bring Cosette back to me. \nVALJEAN Where is she? \nFANTINE At an inn in Montfermeil... \nJAVERT Monsieur le Mayor! \nVALJEAN I will see it done! I will send for her immediately! \nAs Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them, then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them. \n30   EXT. POLICE STATION, MONTREUIL - DAY                       30 \nAs Javert walks up the steps to his police station his assistant stops him with an urgent letter. \nJAVERT'S ASSISTANT From Paris, Monsieur. \nJavert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a terrible mistake. \n31   INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                              31 \nValjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and stands before him. He looks up. \nJAVERT Monsieur le Mayor I have a crime to declare! I have disgraced The uniform that I wear. I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same. \nVALJEAN I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert? \nVALJEAN `Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this? \n34   INT. HOSPITAL, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                             34 \nFantine lies in bed, delirious. She is dressed in pure white. Her eyes are closed. \nFANTINE Cosette, it's turned so cold! Cosette, it's past your bedtime! You've played the day away And soon it will be night. \nFantine's eyes open and she sees Cosette, playing in the room. She looks healthy and is dressed prettily. \nCome to me, Cosette, the light is fading. (more) \nFANTINE (cont'd) Don't you see, the evening star appearing? Come to me, and rest against my shoulder, How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder? \nValjean enters, and sees at once that Fantine is close to the end. He drops to his knees by her bed. \nVALJEAN Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side \nFANTINE (trying to get out of bed) Come Cosette, the night has grown so cold! \nVALJEAN (putting her back in bed) Be at peace! Be at peace ever more. \nFANTINE My Cosette - \nVALJEAN - shall live in my protection. \nFANTINE Take her now! \nShe pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which she's written her wishes. \nVALJEAN Your child will want for nothing. \nFANTINE Good m'sieur, you come from God in heaven. \nVALJEAN And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living. \nFantine has stopped looking towards the window. All her fading strength is now directed towards Valjean. She tries to reach up to him. \nFANTINE Take my hand... The night grows ever colder. \nVALJEAN Then I will keep you warm. \nHe wraps her in his arms. \nFANTINE Take my child I give her to your keeping. \nVALJEAN Take shelter from the storm. \nFANTINE For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping... And tell Cosette I love her And I'll see her when I wake... \nFantine starts to spasm. She sees something over Valjean's shoulder. Valjean doesn't realise. Her eyes go glassy as she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice of Javert behind him. \nJAVERT Valjean, at last We see each other plain! `M'sieur le Mayor' You'll wear a different chain! \nValjean stands to face Javert. \nVALJEAN Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return... \nJavert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean. \nJAVERT You must think me mad! I've hunted you across the years. Men like you can never change - A man such as you! \nValjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof. \nThe men start to circle each other. \nThey sing at the same time, duelling in song. \nVALJEAN Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done! \nJAVERT Men like me can never change. Men like you can never change. No, 24601! My duty is to the law. You have no rights. Come with me, 24601! \nThe two men fight. \nVALJEAN I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run! \nJAVERT Now the wheel has turned around - Jean Valjean is nothing now. Dare you talk to me of crime And the price you had to pay. Every man is born in sin Every man must choose his way. \nJavert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an attic door. \nYou know nothing of Javert! I was born inside a jail. I was born with scum like you. I am from the gutter too. \nValjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden loading platform beneath a hoist. Below, the walls of the factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide. Javert is triumphant. \nMadame Thenardier is trying to sell something unappealing from her stall to a portly looking man when slushy snow from the stall's roof falls on the man's head. Madame Thenardier ushers him inside. \n37    INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - DUSK                                37 \nTHENARDIER Welcome, m'sieur! Sit yourself down And meet the best Innkeeper in town! \nMadame Thenardier pretends to accidentally drop a comb from her hair and the customer helpfully picks it up, allowing Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as he stands up. Monsieur Thenardier takes his coat which allows the couple to see the customer transfer a pocket watch from coat to jacket pocket. \nTHENARDIER As for the rest - All of them crooks Rooking the guests And cooking the books. Seldom do you see Honest men like me A gent of good intent Who's content to be - \nHe pours a strong drink for the new customer - \nTHENARDIER Master of the house! Doling out the charm Ready with a handshake And an open palm \nThenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake as a distraction. He passes this off to Madame Thenardier. \nTHENARDIER Tells a saucy tale Makes a little stir Customers appreciate a bon-viveur Glad to do a friend a favour Doesn't cost me to be nice But nothing gets you nothing Everything has got a little price! \nTHENARDIER Master of the house!

Over the chorus she shouts at little Cosette to get out. \nTHENARDIER/CUSTOMERS Servant to the poor Butler to the great Comforter, philosopher and lifelong mate Everybody's boon companion Everybody's chaperone - \nTHENARDIER But lock up your valises - Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone! \nA FAMILY enters the inn. Thenardier fusses over them. \nTHENARDIER Enter, messieurs! Lay down yer load Unlace yer boots And rest from the road.

What to say Shall you carry our treasure away? What a gem! What a pearl! Beyond rubies is our little girl! How can we speak of debt? Let's not haggle for darling Colette! \nMADAME THENARDIER Cosette! \nTHENARDIER Cosette - Dear Fantine - gone to rest - Have we done for her child what is best? Shared our bread - shared each bone - Treated her like she's one of our own! Like our own, m'sieur! \nVALJEAN Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed. \nHe gives Thenardier money. \nVALJEAN Now may I say we are agreed? \nMADAME THENARDIER That would quite fit the bill If she hadn't so often been ill. Little dear, cost us dear! Medicines are expensive, m'sieur. Not that we begrudged a sou - It's no more than we Christians must do. \nValjean gives more money. \nTHENARDIERS One thing more! One small doubt! There are treacherous people about! No offence! Please reflect! Your intentions may not be correct! \nValjean hands over more money. \nVALJEAN No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget. \nHe leads Cosette to the door. \n44   EXT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               44 \nValjean lifts Cosette into the waiting cab. \nVALJEAN Where I go, you will be. \nCOSETTE Will you be like a Papa to me? \nVALJEAN Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you! \nThe cab sets off down the road. \n45   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               45 \nMadame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her husband's hand and inspects them. \nTHENARDIER Not bad! \nMADAME THENARDIER Not enough! \nThrough the open door Thenardier sees a man on horseback rattling up to the inn. \nMADAME THENARDIER There's a copper at the door! What the devil have you done? \nJavert strides into the inn. \nJAVERT Where's the child Cosette? \nMADAME THENARDIER She's gone with a gent, Didn't tell us where they went, Didn't leave his home address. \nJAVERT Did you catch the fellow's name? \nBoth Thenardiers shake their heads. \nJavert stares once, contemptuously, round the seedy inn, and departs without a further word. Thenardier goes to the doorway to watch him leave. \nMADAME THENARDIER You're a bloody fool Look at what we got. \nTHENARDIER Should have struck the iron, Struck it while it's hot. \nTHENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER Next time round we'll be here And we're gonna get the lot. \n46   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS - NIGHT                              46 \nValjean's cab, moving fast, passes down the road into the city. \nIN CAB - Valjean has one arm round Cosette to protect her from the jolting of the cab. He gazes at her as she slips into a fitful sleep. \nVALJEAN Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace (more) \nVALJEAN (cont'd) And delight. \nHow was I to know That so much love Was held inside me? Something fresh and young Something still unsung Fills the night. \nHow was I to know at last That happiness can come so fast? Trusting me the way you do I'm so afraid of failing you Just a child who cannot know That danger follows where I go There are shadows everywhere And memories I cannot share \nNevermore alone Nevermore apart You have warmed my heart Like the sun. You have brought the gift of life And love so long denied me. \n51   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE, PARIS - DAY                       51 \nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: \nNine years later \nThe dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument, made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far side, the remains of the great fortress that was the Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the new regime. \nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: \nParis, 1832. \nThe streets that run from the square lead in one direction to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction into the slums. \nThe camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant. \nA head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes - GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey, Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band. \n52   EXT. PARIS BOULEVARD - DAY                                   52 \nFOLLOW GAVROCHE in as he races down a grand boulevard, dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars, weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to make their way in either direction. These are the conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill, they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite. \nAs he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony- faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory - \nBEGGARS CHORUS Look down and see the beggars at your feet! Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down and see the sweepings of the street! (more) \nBEGGARS CHORUS (cont'd) Look down, look down, Upon your fellow man! \nThe fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world. \nGavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH OCCUPANT. \nGAVROCHE `Ow do you do? My name's Gavroche! These are my people, here's my patch. Not much to look at - nothing posh! Nothing that you'd call up to scratch. This is my school, my high society! Here in the slums of St Michel. We live on crumbs of humble piety Tough on the teeth - but what the hell! Think you're poor? Think you're free? Follow me! Follow me! \nBEGGARS CHORUS Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down, look down, upon your fellow man! \nSTILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting after to hear his political lecture. \nGAVROCHE There was a time we killed the King We tried to change the world too fast. Now we have got another King, He is no better than the last. This is the land that fought for liberty - Now when we fight we fight for bread! Here is the thing about equality - Everyone's equal when they're dead. Take your place! (more) \nGAVROCHE (cont'd) Take your chance! Vive la France! Vive la France! \n53   EXT. LAMARQUE'S HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                         53 \nThe carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two altar boys. \nGavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd. The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd. \nSTUDENTS/BEGGARS CHORUS Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down, look down, upon your fellow man! \nCOURFEYRAC When's it gonna end? \nBEGGAR 1 When we gonna live? \nJOLY Something's gotta happen now! \nBEGGAR 2 Something's gotta give! \nSTUDENTS AND BEGGARS It'll come, it'll come, it'll come... It'll come, it'll come, it'll come... \nA student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS. The occupant of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND, Marius' Grandfather. He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity. \nIn the crowd a young street girl, EPONINE, has her eyes fixed longingly on the handsome Marius. \nENJOLRAS Where are the leaders of the land? Where are the swells who run this show? \nMARIUS Only one man, General Lamarque Speaks for the people here below! \nMarius looks towards Lamarque's house behind him. \nENJOLRAS Lamarque is ill and fading fast - Won't last a week out, so they say. \nMARIUS With all the anger in the land, How long before the Judgement Day? \nENJOLRAS Before we cut the fat ones down to size? \nSTUDENTS Before the barricades arise? \nMounted Police ride in to break up the crowd. \nPOLICE Look down, look down, don't look us in the eye! Look down, look down, stay here and you die! \nThe crowd breaks up. The students shout to the crowd: \nEPONINE (shouts from up the street) It's the police! Disappear! Run for it! It's Javert! \nThe gang spill out into the street to find themselves confronted by Javert now with his men. Marius watches, as does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus. \nJAVERT Another brawl in the square! Another stink in the air! Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert! \nHe sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face. \nJAVERT Monsieur, these streets are not safe. But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done! \nHe turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage. \nJAVERT Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid. \nHe turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone. \nJAVERT But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run? \nTHENARDIER You will have a job to find him! He's not all he seems to be - And that girl he trails behind him She's the child he stole from me! \nMarius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them. \nJAVERT Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him. \nThenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest. So Valjean is a crook like him. \nJAVERT And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean? \nTHENARDIER In the absence of a victim, Dear Inspector, may I go? And remember when you've nicked him It was me what told you so. \nJAVERT (to himself) Let the old man keep on running I will run him off his feet! (to the crowd) Everyone about your business! \n(to Gavroche) Clear this garbage off the street! \nGavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it when Javert surprises him. \nHe is furious. He sings to Javert's departing back, and to Marius who is close by. \nGAVROCHE That inspector thinks he's something But it's me who runs this town! And my theatre never closes And the curtain's never down! Trust Gavroche! Have no fear! You can always find me here! \nEPONINE Cosette! Now I remember... Cosette! How can it be? We were children together. Look what's become of me. \nShe turns back to find Marius gazing down the street. \nMARIUS Eponine! Who was that girl? \nEPONINE That bourgeois two-a-penny thing! \nMARIUS Eponine, find her for me! \nEPONINE What will you give me? \nMARIUS Anything! \nEPONINE Got you all excited now, But God knows what you see in her. Aren't you all delighted now? No, I don't want your money, sir. \nMARIUS Eponine, do this for me, Discover where she lives. But careful how you go - Don't let your father know. Eponine! I'm lost until she's found. \nEPONINE You see? I told you so! There's lots of things I know! Eponine, she knows her way around. \n56-61   SCENES OMITTED                                         56-61 \n62      EXT. PARIS POLICE HQ - NIGHT                                 62 \nWIDE of the Police Headquarters on the Isle de la Cite: a huge bureaucracy. The camera finds Javert standing inside looking out of a door leading onto the roof. As he sings he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city. Javert too has a God, and this is his prayer. \nJAVERT There, out in the darkness A fugitive running Running from God Fallen from grace - God be my witness I never shall yield Till we come face to face - Till we come face to face... \nHe knows his way in the dark Mine is the way of the Lord Those who follow the path of the righteous Shall have their reward And if they fall As Lucifer fell - The flame! \nThe sword! Stars in your multitudes! Scarce to be counted Filling the darkness With order and light - You are the sentinels Silent and sure Keeping watch in the night - Keeping watch in the night... \nYou know your place in the sky You hold your course (more) \nJAVERT (cont'd) And your aim And each in your season Returns and returns And is always the same And if you fall As Lucifer fell You fall In flame! \nAnd so it must be, and so it is written On the doorway to paradise That those who falter And those who fall Must pay the price! \nLord, let me find him That I may see him Safe behind bars! I will never rest till then! This I swear This I swear by the stars! \nJavert stands silhouetted against the stars, his arms raised up to the night sky. \n63   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - NIGHT                             63 \nENJOLRAS (cont'd) Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer! \nSTUDENT Let us take to the street with no doubt in our hearts \nCOURFEYRAC But a jubilant shout! \nLESGLES They will come one and all! \nSTUDENTS They will come when we call! \nAs the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to Marius. Marius sees her. \n65   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE, RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                     65 \nCosette is pacing in her bedroom. It's a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. She looks at herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the first time. \nCOSETTE How strange - This feeling that my life's begun at last! This change - Can people really fall in love so fast? What's the matter with you, Cosette? Have you been too much on your own? So many things unclear - So many things unknown... \nIn my life There are so many questions and answers That somehow seem wrong. In my life There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song And it sings Of a world that I long to see - Out of reach Just a whisper away Waiting for me! \nDoes he know I'm alive? Do I know if he's real? (more) \nCOSETTE (cont'd) Does he see what I see? Does he feel what I feel? \nIn my life I'm no longer alone - Now the love in my life Is so near... Find me now! Find me here! \nValjean knocks and opens her door. He closes her shutters. \nVALJEAN Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company. \nCOSETTE There's so little I know That I'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago... There's so little you say Of the life you have known, Why you keep to yourself, Why we're always alone. So dark! So dark and deep, The secrets that you keep! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good. But papa, dear papa, In your eyes I am still like that child Who was lost in a wood. \nVALJEAN No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid. \nCOSETTE In my life I'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know Of the years... Years ago! \nValjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom. A simple wooden shack at the back of the summerhouse, Valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity - he has given the best room to Cosette. \nCosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to Cosette. \nVALJEAN You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn. \n66   EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                       66 \nMarius rushes down the street, Eponine following. At the far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's house. \nMARIUS In my life She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun! And my life seems to stop As if something is over And something has scarcely begun! Eponine, you're the friend Who has brought me here. Thanks to you I am one with the Gods And heaven is near! And I soar through a world that is new, That is free! \nEPONINE Every word that he says Is a dagger in me! In my life There's been no one like him anywhere, Anywhere, where he is If he asked... I'd be his! \nMARIUS/EPONINE In my life There is someone who touches my life - \nMARIUS (sees Cosette in the garden) Waiting near! \nEPONINE Waiting here! \nMARIUS A heart full of love! \nCosette sees Marius. She comes up the garden path towards him. She sees Eponine by Marius's side. \nMARIUS A heart full of song! I'm doing everything all wrong - Oh God, for shame - I do not even know your name. Dear Mad'moiselle, Won't you say? Will you tell? \nCosette holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both hands, eyes on Marius. Eponine looks on and suffers. Marius wraps his hands round Cosette's. \nCOSETTE A heart full of love! No fear, no regret! \nMARIUS My name is Marius Pontmercy. \nCOSETTE And mine's Cosette. \nMARIUS Cosette... I don't know what to say - \nCOSETTE Then make no sound. \nMARIUS I am lost - \nCOSETTE I am found! \nMARIUS A heart full of light - \nCOSETTE/MARIUS A night bright as day - \nMARIUS And you must never go away, Cosette - Cosette! \nHe goes to the gate and opens it. \nEponine screams. \n67   SCENE OMITTED                                               67 \n68   INT. RUE PLUMET, PARIS - NIGHT                              68 \nValjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns to the window. \n69   EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                     69 \nThenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows, as Eponine's scream ends at last. \nTHENARDIER Make for the sewers! Get underground! Leave her to me, Don't wait around! \nHe turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face. \nTHENARDIER You wait, my girl! You'll rue this night! I'll make you scream! You'll scream all right! \nHis men have levered up a grating, and now Thenardier and the gang disappear down into the sewers. \n70   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE - RUE PLUMET, PARIS - NIGHT            70 \nValjean comes running into Cosette's room. Valjean takes her in his arms. \nVALJEAN My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street. \nCOSETTE Three men I saw beyond the wall... Three men in shadow moving fast! \nVALJEAN This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past! \nHe moves away to his own bedroom. \nVALJEAN Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns. \nHe comes back to Cosette. \nVALJEAN We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette! \nCOSETTE To where? \nVALJEAN Rue de L'Homme Armee. \nCOSETTE No! No! \nVALJEAN And then a ship across the sea. \nVALJEAN Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away! \nCOSETTE (overlapping) No! Please no! We can't go! \nVALJEAN Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day! \nValjean leaves to start packing. \nFeverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter. \n71   SCENE OMITTED                                                71 \n72   EXT. GARDEN, RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                              72 \nCosette hurries down the   garden to the gate, and goes to put the folded letter in   the grill where her and Marius' hands entwined. Then she   sees Eponine. Eponine steps forward. She thrusts her   letter into her hand. \nCOSETTE Please give this to Marius! He must know where to find me. \nShe runs back inside. \n73   EXT. RUE PLUMET/BRIDGE/RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - NIGHT          73 \nEponine crumples up the letter. \nShe walks sadly away down the street. \nRain is just starting to fall. \nEPONINE And now I'm all alone again - Nowhere to turn, no one to go to. Without a home, without a friend, (more) \nEPONINE (cont'd) Without a face to say hello to. The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head. \nOn my own Pretending he's beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me. \nShe crosses a bridge over the river. \nMARIUS Do I stay and do I dare? \nENJOLRAS (from top of stairs, for Grantaire's benefit) Will you take your place with me? \nGrantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs. \nALL The time is now! The day is here! One day more! \n81   INT. PARIS POLICE HQ - NIGHT                                 81 \nJavert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police Headquarters. \nJAVERT One day more to revolution. We will nip it in the bud. We'll be ready for these schoolboys. They will wet themselves with blood! \n82   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                        82 \nVALJEAN One day more! \n83   INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - GROUND & 1ST FLOOR - NIGHT                83 \nMonsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar, slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the stairs disguised in a piece of cloth. \nJoly takes a tray and collects empty tankards. As he ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to give the tankards back. \nTHENARDIERS Watch'em run amuck! Catch'em as they fall! Never know your luck When there's a free-for-all. Here a little dip, There a little touch - Most of them are goners So they won't miss much! \nThe drinkers in the bar raise their glasses to the students with their rifles. The students appeal to them. Grantaire is drunk already. Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot to make more bullets. Marius enters the ground floor and takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup that she has just finished. The citizens on the ground floor join the students. \nSTUDENTS/CROWD One day to a new beginning! Raise the flag of freedom high! Every man will be a king! Every man will be a king! There's a new world for the winning! There's a new world to be won! Do you hear the people sing? \nMarius enters the first floor to join them at last. \nMARIUS My place is here!

I will learn their little secrets, I will know the things they know. \nVALJEAN/JAVERT One day more! \nMARIUS/COSETTE Tomorrow you'll be worlds away And yet with you my world has started. \nJAVERT One more day to revolution We will nip it in the bud We'll be ready for these schoolboys - \nTHENARDIERS Watch'em run amuck Catch'em as they fall Never know your luck When there's a free-for-all! \nVALJEAN Tomorrow we'll be far away. \nVALJEAN/JAVERT Tomorrow is the judgement day. \nALL Tomorrow we'll discover What our God in heaven has in store - One more dawn! One more day! One day more! \nWe pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at the first floor window with the students beyond them to see that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the street and have all joined in the final chorus. \n85   EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY                                     85 \nAll is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums. The tramp of feet. \nAll down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical students. \nPolice and national guardsmen control the growing crowds. \nNow into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a military tatoo. \nINTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly, black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a COFFIN. \nSoftly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin to sing. \nCROWD Do you hear the people sing Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of a people Who will not be slaves again! \nEponine dies in Marius's arms. \nMarius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears. \nENJOLRAS They were the first to fall. The first to fall upon this barricade. \nMARIUS Her name was Eponine! Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid! \nCOMBEFERRE We fight here in her name... \nPROUVAIRE She will not die in vain... \nLESGLES She will not be betrayed... \nThey pick up Eponine's body and carry her into the tavern. \nCOURFEYRAC (to Gavroche) Are you alright? \nGAVROCHE That was my sister. \n88   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                       88 \nMarius reads the letter Eponine has given him. He takes out pencil and paper and writes a note. Looking round, he sees Gavroche. \nMARIUS Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de l'Homme Arm\u00e9? \nGAVROCHE Course I do! \nMARIUS Will you take this for me? \nHe holds out his note. \n89   INT. INN, RUE DE L'HOMME ARMEE, PARIS - NIGHT               89 \nThe LANDLADY climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The landlady indicates the door, and Gavroche knocks boldly. The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean. \nGAVROCHE Letter for Cosette. \nVALJEAN I'll take it. \nGavroche holds out the letter with one hand, not quite giving it, the other hand open for a tip. \nValjean gives him a coin, which he pockets as he hands over the letter. \nGAVROCHE Something for you, something for me. Who needs charity? \n90   INT. VALJEAN'S ROOM, LODGING HOUSE - NIGHT                  90 \nON VALJEAN - As he reads the note. \nVALJEAN `Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.' \nHe looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought of losing Cosette. \nVALJEAN They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy \n91   EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT                                   91 \nValjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes, struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade being dismantled. And bodies. \nSuddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on. \nHe continues on his way in the dark. \nLooking up he sees that he's been walking all the time towards the very barricade where Marius waits. \nNow looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through their lines, and into the shadows. \nAs he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the rooftops. \n92   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                       92 \nGlimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching from the far end of the narrow street. \nThe figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns. Gavroche jumps up. \nVALJEAN Don't shoot! \nJOLY Here comes a man in uniform! What brings you to this place? \nVALJEAN I come here as a volunteer. \nJOLY Approach and show your face! \n103   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                       103 \nValjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner - and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out. \nThen his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the ground. A storm drain. \nON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the end of the alley. They look round. It's empty. \nSOLDIER Nothing here! \nThe soldiers depart. A moment of silence. \nThen into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round. He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the grating has been lifted. \nHe stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for him. \nHe straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does the drain lead? \n104   INT. PARIS SEWERS - DAY                                     104 \nValjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide, then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies. \nValjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground to rest. He lets his eyes close. \nA voice echoes in the shadows. \nTHENARDIER Here's a hint of gold Stuck into a tooth - Pardon me, m'sieur, You won't be needing it no more. Shouldn't be too hard to sell. \nA figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No sign of life in either Valjean or Marius. \nTHENARDIER Well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, Before the little harvest Disappears into the mud. Someone's got to collect their odds and ends When the gutters run with blood. \nNow we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on Marius's finger and pulls it off. \nTHENARDIER Here's a tasty ring Pretty little thing Heart's no longer going And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet. \nIt's a world where the dog eats the dog. Where they kill for the bones in the street. And God in his heaven, He don't interfere Cos he's dead as the stiff at my feet! I raise my eyes to see the heavens And only the moon looks down. The harvest moon shines down! \nValjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm, slams him against the sewer wall. \nVALJEAN How do I get out of here? \nTHENARDIER There! That way! \nValjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off. \nThenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the wrong way. \nLATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water. \nAs he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half- submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is dropping - \nThen up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes burning with his refusal to be beaten. \nLATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the rushing sound of the river. \nRound a bend and at last - moonlight ahead. \nHe drags himself on through the shallow running water towards the moonlight. \nHe reaches the exit at last. Before him the river. \n105   EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT, PARIS - NIGHT                          105 \nValjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer onto the embankment that runs beside the river. \nHe looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert. \nValjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near the end of his strength. \nVALJEAN It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care. \nJAVERT I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed! \nVALJEAN Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid. \nJAVERT The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice! \nVALJEAN Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave! \nHe starts to move past Javert. \nJavert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head. \n108   INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                        108 \nMarius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper room. He's still weak from his wounds. He enters the room where his friends died, and looks round. He sinks into a chair. \nMARIUS There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone. \nHe sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill. The blood of Enjolras. \nMARIUS Here they talked of revolution Here it was they lit the flame Here they sang about tomorrow (more) \nMARIUS (cont'd) And tomorrow never came... \nFrom the table in the corner They could see a world reborn And they rose with voices ringing And I can hear them now! The very words that they had sung Became their last communion On the lonely barricade at dawn. \nHe looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade. He seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke and the gunfire, the young men falling. \nMARIUS Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on... \nPhantom faces at the window Phantom shadows on the floor Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more. \nOh my friends, my friends, don't ask me What your sacrifice was for Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will sing no more. \nSlowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway. There stands Cosette, waiting for him. \n109   INT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                    109 \nCosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the house. \nCOSETTE Every day You walk with stronger step, You walk with longer step. The worst is over. \nMARIUS Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade. \nCosette leads him into the room where Valjean and Gillenormand wait. \nCOSETTE Don't think about it, Marius! With all the years ahead of us! I will never go away And we will be together Every day. Every day We'll remember that night And the vow that we made. \nAs Valjean and Gillenormand look on, Marius and Cosette sing their love to each other. \nCOSETTE A heart full of love A night full of you The words are old But always true. \nVALJEAN She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free... \nMARIUS Cosette, Cosette! \nCOSETTE I saw you waiting and I knew - \nGILLENORMAND Thank God, thank God you are here! Thank God, thank God you are home! \nMARIUS Waiting for you! At your feet! \nCOSETTE At your call! \nVALJEAN/GILLENORMAND Love is the garden of the young Let it be Let it be! A heart full of love This I give you this day. \nMARIUS/COSETTE And it wasn't a dream Not a dream after all. \n110   INT. PARLOUR, MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE - DAY                  110 \nMarius stands before Valjean, alone in this more private room. \nMARIUS M'sieur, this is a day I never can forget. Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette? Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass But we will prove our love To you, whom we shall call A father to us both, A father to us all. \nVALJEAN Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done... \nHe's prepared himself to make this confession, but it's still hard. \nVALJEAN There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime. \nMarius hears this with shock. \nVALJEAN Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I? \nMARIUS You're Jean Valjean! \nMarius can't conceal that he's disturbed by this revelation. \nMARIUS Monsieur, you cannot leave! Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette She will never believe me. \nVALJEAN Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know... \nMARIUS I give my word. \nVALJEAN ...What I have spoken, why I must go. \nMarius rushes to Cosette and we see him telling her where Valjean is. They hurry away. \nThenardier clambers to his feet, helped by his wife. He gestures to the band to continue. They stand by the tiered wedding cake. As Thenardier recovers his composure, Madame Thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it collapses on the floor. She then pushes it under the table with her foot. \"LES MISERABLES\" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012            121. \nTHENARDIER Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat? Hob-nobbin' here Among the elite? Here comes a prince There goes a Jew This one's a queer But what can you do? (pulling Madame Thenardier onto the dance floor) Paris at my feet! Paris in the dust! And here's me breaking bread With the upper crust - \nAs he pivots Madame Thenardier, stolen silver drops out from Madame Thenardier's dress. The music stops dead in the clatter. The Thenardiers look up, as if implying that the silver dropped from the ceiling. The dance continues. Monsieur Gillenormand motions to the Majordomo to remove these unwanted guests. \nTHENARDIER Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance! Life is easy pickings If you grab your chance! \nMADAME THENARDIER Everywhere you go Law-abiding folk Doing what is decent \nTHENARDIER But they're mostly broke! \nMADAME THENARDIER Singing to the Lord on Sundays \nTHENARDIER Praying for the gifts he'll send - \nTHENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER But we're the ones who take it - We're the ones who make it in the end! \nThe Thenardiers are carried off, singing as they go. \nTHENARDIER Watch the buggers dance \nMADAME THENARDIER Watch'em till they drop! \"LES MISERABLES\" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012            121A. \nTHENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER Keep your wits about you And you stand on top! \nTHENARDIER Masters of the land \nMADAME THENARDIER Always get our share \nTHENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER Clear away the barricades And we're still there! We know where the wind is blowing Money is the stuff we smell - And when we're rich as Croesus, Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell! \nAs they are thrown out, the Thenardiers steal a tiara and a candlestick. \"LES MISERABLES\" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012          122. \n115     EXT. CONVENT, PARIS - NIGHT                              115 \nIN ON A WINDOW - Where two candle burn. \n116     INT. CONVENT CHAPEL, PARIS - NIGHT                       116 \nValjean prays in the chapel, on his knees. He's very weak. \nNext to the crucifix on the altar are Valjean's two silver candlesticks, in which two candles burn. \nVALJEAN Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home! \nVALJEAN is joined by the ghost of Fantine. She takes his hand as he prays. \nFANTINE M'sieur I bless your name... \nVALJEAN I am ready, Fantine... \nFANTINE M'sieur lay down your burden... \nVALJEAN At the end of my days... \nFANTINE You raised my child in love, \nVALJEAN She's the best of my life... \nFANTINE And you will be with God. \n116A   EXT. CONVENT CLOISTERS - NIGHT                             116A \nCosette and Marius rush round the cloisters and enter the chapel in the middle of the cloisters. \n116B   INT. CONVENT CHAPEL - NIGHT                                116B \nThe sound of the door opening. Valjean looks round. It's Cosette entering, followed by Marius. \nVALJEAN Cosette? \nTears form in his eyes. Cosette goes to him, kneels before him, takes him in her arms. \nCOSETTE Papa, papa, I do not understand - Are you all right? Why did you go away? \nVALJEAN Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day! \nMarius comes to him. \nMARIUS It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool! It's you who must forgive a thankless man! It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint! When they wounded me He took me from the barricade, Carried like a babe, And brought me home to you! \n", "test1_input": "VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of refusal. \nINNKEEPER My inn is full. \n7A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           7A \nValjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways, but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'. \nPassing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife before him, his children on either side. Nothing special, and yet everything he's never had. \n8    EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT                                    8 \nHe stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open. \nVALJEAN Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? \nJAILER This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you. \nThe grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some children who have been following begin throwing stones at him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter. \n8A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8A \nHe sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret. Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel. \n8B   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8B \nSnow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry, weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from where the dog has bitten him. \nAt the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a dark churchyard. \n9    EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT                               9 \nSnow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the shelter of a doorway. \nA lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches, throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest on the crumpled figure of Valjean. \nHe stirs and opens his eyes. \nVALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness. Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The BISHOP. \nBISHOP Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share. \nBewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church. \n10   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                10 \nA simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates. \nBISHOP There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong. \nBISHOP Sit, my brother. \nThe Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire. \nBISHOP Madame, set one more place. (to Valjean) Please sit. \nThe Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair. \nValjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him. Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a short grace. \nBISHOP May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest. (To Valjean) Please, eat. Where are you travelling to my brother? \nVALJEAN Pontarlier. \nBISHOP Is that where your family is? \nVALJEAN No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. \nBISHOP Then let this be your home, for as long as you need it. \n11   INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          11 \nThe Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage, Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom. There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard. \nHe turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him. \nBISHOP Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot. \nThe Bishop turns away to go to sleep. \nVALJEAN You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? \nValjean laughs a strange laugh. \n", "test1_true": "LATER THAT NIGHT - \nValjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep. \nOutside a dog barks. \nValjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door. \nThere, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. \nValjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown. He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver. \nCarefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door. \n12   EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT                                      12 \nValjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's gone. \n13   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY                                    13 \nThe Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the Bishop's eyes. \nCONSTABLE Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this! \nHe upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out. \nThe Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. \nBISHOP That is right. \nAmazed, Valjean looks up. \nBISHOP But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind? \nThe old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks. \nBISHOP (to policemen) Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you. \nSilenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. \nValjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks. \nBISHOP But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, (more) \nBISHOP (cont'd) By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God. \n14   INT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY                                   14 \nValjean kneels in the church. \nHe takes out his yellow passport and stares at it. \nHe turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it. \nVALJEAN What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. \nIf there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! \nTake an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! (more) \nVALJEAN (cont'd) I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? \nSlowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. \nVALJEAN I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. \nValjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church. \nVALJEAN I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! \n15   EXT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY                                     15 \nValjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below. \nVALJEAN Another story must begin! \nHe rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind. \nFOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through time and space - down to discover - \n16   EXT.

Two smaller barricades protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing she steals it back defiantly. \nENJOLRAS Red, the blood of angry men! \nALL Black, the dark of ages past! Red, a world about to dawn! Black, the night that ends at last! \n87A   EXT.

The students have been waiting for hours. \nA single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles underlights a fluttering red flag. \nThere is no sign yet of any opposition. \nA boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. Marius realizes its Eponine. She sits down with her back to him. \nMARIUS Hey, little boy, what's this I see? God Eponine the things you do! \nEPONINE I know this is no place for me, Still I would rather be with you! \nMARIUS Get out before the trouble starts! Get out, `Ponine, you might get shot! \nEPONINE I've got you worried now, I have!

I have been to their lines, I have counted each man. I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel. \nENJOLRAS Have faith! If you know what their movements are We'll spoil their game. There are ways that a people can fight - We shall overcome their power! \nJAVERT I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight. They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force, Hit us when it's light - \nGAVROCHE Liar! \nThey all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the barricade. \nGAVROCHE Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear! I know this man, my friends. His name's Inspector Javert! So don't believe a word he says Cause none of it's true. This only goes to show What little people can do. \nGuns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in defiance. \nGavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's delighted embrace. \nCOURFEYRAC Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class! \nGavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own head, mimicking the students. \nPROUVAIRE So what are we going to do With this snake in the grass? \nEnjolras faces Javert. \nENJOLRAS Tie this man and take him To the tavern in there! The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert! \nJAVERT Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport! Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court! \nENJOLRAS Take this man. Bring him through. There is work we have to do. \nJavert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied to the staircase. \nENJOLRAS When are they coming!? \nSilence. \nSuddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer. Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the street. \nEnjolras and all the students man the main barricade. \nSilence. \nThey peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection from the torch. \nA voice shouts out from the darkness. \nARMY OFFICER Who's there? \nAt the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled. \nENJOLRAS French Revolution. \n", "test2_true": "A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut. \nA dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound several men. \nENJOLRAS (as students return fire) Comrades, do not fire back! Do not waste powder! \nIn the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop reloading weapons. \nEnjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the top of the barricade. \nARMY OFFICER Who's there? Get down! \nMABEUF Vive la France! \nARMY OFFICER Fire! \nA second volley. \nFather Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of darkness to creep down the street. \nAll at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over the barricade. The students run for their guns and return fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe. \nThey are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is fierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost unless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to the top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of deadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel. \nMARIUS Clear out or I'll blow up the barricade! \nEveryone freezes. \nARMY OFFICER Blow it up then and take yourself with it! \nMARIUS And myself with it! \nMarius brings the torch closer to the powder keg. \nBut already the soldiers have cleared out. \nMarius comes down from the barricade. \nFEUILLY (to Marius) Thank you! \nLESGLES What were you thinking! \nAs everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine lying propped against the barricade. \nMARIUS Eponine! What have you done? \nHe kneels by her side. Eponine is dying. \nEPONINE Here... It's from Cosette... I kept it from you... \nWith a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and pushes it into his hand. \nEPONINE Don't be too hard on me... \nMarius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound. \nMARIUS Eponine, you're hurt! You need some help! \nRain begins to fall. \nEPONINE Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius - I don't feel any pain. A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here - that's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain will make the flowers grow... \nMARIUS But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love - \nEPONINE Just hold me now, and let it be. Shelter me... Comfort me... \nMARIUS You will live a hundred years If I could show you how... I won't desert you now... \nEPONINE The rain can't hurt me now... This rain will wash away what's past And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close I'll sleep in your embrace at last. \nMarius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms. \nMARIUS Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine You won't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I'm here. \nEPONINE So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius I don't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now... \nMARIUS I will stay with you Till you are sleeping. \nEPONINE That's all I need to know And you will keep me safe (more) \nEPONINE (cont'd) And you will keep me close And rain.. Will make the flowers... Grow... \n", "test2_id": 2866, "test3_input": "ENJOLRAS Marius, rest. \nGrantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is taken up more seriously by Feuilly. Bottles are passed round. \nGRANTAIRE Drink with me to days gone by! \nFEUILLY Sing with me the songs we knew! \nPROUVAIRE Here's to pretty girls Who went to our heads! \nJOLY Here's to witty girls Who went to our beds! \nSTUDENTS Here's to them - (Marius sings to Valjean) And here's to you! \nGRANTAIRE Drink with me to days gone by! Can it be you fear to die? Will the world remember you when you fall? Can it be your death Means nothing at all? Is your life just one more lie? \nGrantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe. \nALL Drink with me To days gone by! To the life That used to be! At the shrine of friendship Never say die... Let the wine of friendship Never run dry! Here's to you And here's to me! \nValjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius through a window. He moves to the window. Marius sits beneath it. \nMARIUS Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please don't weep, Cosette, Should Marius fall. Will you weep, Cosette, For me? \nValjean listens to Marius's song, and he's moved. \n93   EXT. BARRICADE/ INT. CAFE MUSAIN - NIGHT                      93 \nLook-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping. \nValjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window. \nVALJEAN God on high Hear my prayer (more) \nVALJEAN (cont'd) In my need You have always been there. He is young He's afraid Let him rest Heaven blessed. Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! He's like the son I might have known If God had granted me a son. The summers die One by one How soon they fly On and on And I am old And will be gone. Bring him peace Bring him joy He is young He is only a boy. You can take You can give Let him be Let him live, If I die, let me die Let him live Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! \nValjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius. \nCRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many that we know the little band can never win. \nCRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the centre of the bright lights of Paris. \n94   EXT. PARIS - DAWN                                             94 \nThe sun still below the rooftops. Every house is tightly shuttered. \n95   INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAWN                                       95 \nGrantaire is fast asleep in the upstairs room, dead drunk. \n96   EXT. BARRICADE - DAWN                                      96 \nEnjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate. He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the students are up and getting ready. \nENJOLRAS The people have not stirred. \nCOURFEYRAC Yet we will not abandon those Who still live in fear. \nENJOLRAS The people have not heard, Yet we will not abandon those who cannot hear. Let us not waste lives! Let all who wish to Go from here! \nThere is silence. Uncertainty. Yet no one moves to go. \nGAVROCHE (from top of barricade) Do you hear the people sing \nGAVROCHE/COURFEYRAC Singing the song of angry men \nSTUDENTS/CITIZENS (joining) It is the music of the people Who will not be slaves again When the beating of your heart Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes! \nUnder this: \nFEUILLY Enjolras! Ammunition's short. \nMARIUS I will go into the streets. There are bodies all around. Ammunition to be had. Lots of bullets to be found. \nENJOLRAS I can't let you go. \nVALJEAN Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear. \nGavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of the smoke. \nGAVROCHE I volunteer! \nCOURFEYRAC Come back, Gavroche! Don't you dare! \n", "test3_true": "GAVROCHE Look at me, I'm almost there! \nGAVROCHE Little people know When little people fight We may look easy pickings But we've got some bite! So never kick a dog When he's just a pup - We'll fight like twenty armies And we won't give up! \nThe rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up Gavroche. \nGAVROCHE So you'd better run for cover When the pup grows - \nCrack! A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the barricade. \nCOURFEYRAC No-o! \nHe runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the gate in the barricade. \nAt the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees this gate. And talks to the Army Officer. \nAs the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is lining up the big guns carefully. \nARMY OFFICER You at the barricades listen to this! The people of Paris sleep in their beds! You have no chance, No chance at all! Why throw your lives away? \nEnjolras gazes on his pitifully small group. \nENJOLRAS Let us die facing our foes! Make them bleed while we can! \nCOMBEFERRE Make'em pay through the nose! \nCOURFEYRAC Make'em pay for every man! \nENJOLRAS Let others rise to take our place Until the earth is free! \nThe sun now appears above the rooftops of the city. \nAnd the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! \nThe bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake a massive barrage of musket fire. \nThe big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit. \nBullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the attackers. \nEnjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again. \nValjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting down the dead, regardless of his own safety. \nMarius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs towards him - \nCRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Caf\u00e9 Musain. \n97    INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                       97 \nStudents and soldiers fight in the caf\u00e9, on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink. \n98    EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                         98 \nValjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers - \n99    INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                       99 \nThe students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students are falling. \n100   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                       100 \nValjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the soldier flying - \n101   INT. CAF\u00c9 MUSAIN - DAY                                      101 \nThe soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window, knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from his drunken slumber. \nGRANTAIRE Long live the republic! \nHe sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him. Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his now-ragged red flag. \nThe rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground. Enjolras falls back - \n102   EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                        102 \nEnjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands, streaming like blood down the wall. \nPULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble for any last pockets of resistance. \nBACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene. INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of law over rebellion. \n", "test3_id": 2867}

{"test1_input": "VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of refusal. \nINNKEEPER My inn is full. \n7A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           7A \nValjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways, but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'. \nPassing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife before him, his children on either side. Nothing special, and yet everything he's never had. \n8    EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT                                    8 \nHe stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open. \nVALJEAN Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? \nJAILER This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you. \nThe grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some children who have been following begin throwing stones at him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter. \n8A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8A \nHe sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret. Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel. \n8B   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8B \nSnow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry, weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from where the dog has bitten him. \nAt the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a dark churchyard. \n9    EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT                               9 \nSnow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the shelter of a doorway. \nA lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches, throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest on the crumpled figure of Valjean. \nHe stirs and opens his eyes. \nVALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness. Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The BISHOP. \nBISHOP Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share. \nBewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church. \n10   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                10 \nA simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates. \nBISHOP There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong. \nBISHOP Sit, my brother. \nThe Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire. \nBISHOP Madame, set one more place. (to Valjean) Please sit. \nThe Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair. \nValjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him. Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a short grace. \nBISHOP May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest. (To Valjean) Please, eat. Where are you travelling to my brother? \nVALJEAN Pontarlier. \nBISHOP Is that where your family is? \nVALJEAN No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. \nBISHOP Then let this be your home, for as long as you need it. \n11   INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          11 \nThe Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage, Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom. There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard. \nHe turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him. \nBISHOP Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot. \nThe Bishop turns away to go to sleep. \nVALJEAN You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? \nValjean laughs a strange laugh. \n", "test1_true": "LATER THAT NIGHT - \nValjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep. \nOutside a dog barks. \nValjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door. \nThere, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. \nValjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown. He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver. \nCarefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door. \n12   EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT                                      12 \nValjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's gone. \n13   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY                                    13 \nThe Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the Bishop's eyes. \nCONSTABLE Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this! \nHe upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out. \nThe Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. \nBISHOP That is right. \nAmazed, Valjean looks up. \nBISHOP But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind? \nThe old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks. \nBISHOP (to policemen) Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you. \nSilenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. \nValjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks. \nBISHOP But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, (more) \nBISHOP (cont'd) By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God. \n14   INT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY                                   14 \nValjean kneels in the church. \nHe takes out his yellow passport and stares at it. \nHe turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it. \nVALJEAN What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. \nIf there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! \nTake an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! (more) \nVALJEAN (cont'd) I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? \nSlowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. \nVALJEAN I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. \nValjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church. \nVALJEAN I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! \n15   EXT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY                                     15 \nValjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below. \nVALJEAN Another story must begin! \nHe rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind. \nFOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through time and space - down to discover - \n16   EXT.

Marius sees her. \n65   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE, RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                     65 \nCosette is pacing in her bedroom. It's a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. She looks at herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the first time. \nCOSETTE How strange - This feeling that my life's begun at last! This change - Can people really fall in love so fast? What's the matter with you, Cosette? Have you been too much on your own? So many things unclear - So many things unknown... \nIn my life There are so many questions and answers That somehow seem wrong. In my life There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song And it sings Of a world that I long to see - Out of reach Just a whisper away Waiting for me! \nDoes he know I'm alive? Do I know if he's real? (more) \nCOSETTE (cont'd) Does he see what I see? Does he feel what I feel? \nIn my life I'm no longer alone - Now the love in my life Is so near... Find me now! Find me here! \nValjean knocks and opens her door. He closes her shutters. \nVALJEAN Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company. \nCOSETTE There's so little I know That I'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago... There's so little you say Of the life you have known, Why you keep to yourself, Why we're always alone. So dark! So dark and deep, The secrets that you keep! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good. But papa, dear papa, In your eyes I am still like that child Who was lost in a wood. \nVALJEAN No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid. \nCOSETTE In my life I'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know Of the years... Years ago! \nValjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom. A simple wooden shack at the back of the summerhouse, Valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity - he has given the best room to Cosette. \nCosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to Cosette. \nVALJEAN You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn. \n66   EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                       66 \nMarius rushes down the street, Eponine following. At the far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's house. \nMARIUS In my life She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun! And my life seems to stop As if something is over And something has scarcely begun! Eponine, you're the friend Who has brought me here. Thanks to you I am one with the Gods And heaven is near! And I soar through a world that is new, That is free! \nEPONINE Every word that he says Is a dagger in me! In my life There's been no one like him anywhere, Anywhere, where he is If he asked... I'd be his! \nMARIUS/EPONINE In my life There is someone who touches my life - \nMARIUS (sees Cosette in the garden) Waiting near! \nEPONINE Waiting here! \nMARIUS A heart full of love! \nCosette sees Marius. She comes up the garden path towards him. She sees Eponine by Marius's side. \nMARIUS A heart full of song! I'm doing everything all wrong - Oh God, for shame - I do not even know your name. Dear Mad'moiselle, Won't you say? Will you tell? \nCosette holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both hands, eyes on Marius. Eponine looks on and suffers. Marius wraps his hands round Cosette's. \nCOSETTE A heart full of love! No fear, no regret! \nMARIUS My name is Marius Pontmercy. \nCOSETTE And mine's Cosette. \nMARIUS Cosette... I don't know what to say - \nCOSETTE Then make no sound. \nMARIUS I am lost - \nCOSETTE I am found! \nMARIUS A heart full of light - \nCOSETTE/MARIUS A night bright as day - \nMARIUS And you must never go away, Cosette - Cosette! \n", "test2_true": "MARIUS Do I dream? \nCOSETTE I'm awake. \nMARIUS A heart full of love - \nEPONINE He was never mine to lose Why regret What could not be? \nCOSETTE A heart full of you - \nEPONINE These are words he'll never say Not to me, not to me Not for me! \nMARIUS A single look and then I knew! \nCOSETTE I knew it too! \nEPONINE His heart full of love... \nMARIUS From today - \nEPONINE He will never feel this way. \nCOSETTE Every day... \nMARIUS/COSETTE For it isn't a dream - Not a dream After all! \nValjean comes to the door. \nVALJEAN Cosette! Cosette! \nCosette turns and runs in to the house. \nValjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate. \nMarius moves quickly away, instinctively nervous of discovery, and hides behind the wall. \nValjean peers into the shadows. He senses that perhaps Cosette has been talking to someone. He looks pensive. \nValjean returns inside. \nCosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. Marius picks it up. \nMarius makes his way back down the street, filled with thoughts of his love. Completely forgetting Eponine is there. \nShadows move up the street from the other direction. It's Thenardier and his gang. They gather at the wrought-iron gate. \nMONTPARNASSE This is his lair! I've seen the old fox around. \nBABET He keeps himself to himself He's staying close to the ground. \nTHENARDIER I smell profit here! Ten years ago He came and paid for Cosette. I let her go for a song. It's time we settled the debt. This'll cost him dear. \nBRUJON What do I care Who you should rob? Gimme my share! Finish the job! \nTHENARDIER You shut your mouth! You'll get what's yours! \nBrujon starts working on the gate lock. He finds Eponine lurking in the shadows. \nBRUJON What have we here? \nTHENARDIER Who is this hussy? \nBABET It's your brat Eponine! Don't you know your own kid? Why's she hanging about here? \nTHENARDIER Eponine, get on home! You're not needed in this. We're enough here without you. \nEPONINE I know this house, I tell you! There's nothing here for you! Just the old man and the girl. They live ordinary lives. \nTHENARDIER Don't interfere! You've got some gall! Take care, young miss, You've got a lot to say! \nBRUJON She's going soft! \nCLACQUESOUS Happens to all! \nMONTPARNASSE Go home, Eponine! Go home, you're in the way! \nThey huddle round the garden gate, which is now broken open. \nEPONINE I'm gonna scream!

Leave her to me, Don't wait around! \nHe turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face. \nTHENARDIER You wait, my girl! You'll rue this night! I'll make you scream! You'll scream all right! \nHis men have levered up a grating, and now Thenardier and the gang disappear down into the sewers. \n70   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE - RUE PLUMET, PARIS - NIGHT            70 \nValjean comes running into Cosette's room. Valjean takes her in his arms. \nVALJEAN My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street. \nCOSETTE Three men I saw beyond the wall... Three men in shadow moving fast! \nVALJEAN This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past! \nHe moves away to his own bedroom. \nVALJEAN Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns. \nHe comes back to Cosette. \nVALJEAN We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette! \nCOSETTE To where? \nVALJEAN Rue de L'Homme Armee. \nCOSETTE No! No! \nVALJEAN And then a ship across the sea. \nVALJEAN Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more.

Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him. 
LONGSHANKS The French will grovel to anyone with strength! But how will they credit our strength when we cannot rule the whole of our own island?! 
He punches the map, then sees the Princess enter softly. 
LONGSHANKS Where is my son? 
PRINCESS Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead. 
Longshanks' eyes expand in fury; it is frightening to see. 
LONGSHANKS I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?! 
PRINCESS Shall I leave, M'lord? 
LONGSHANKS If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him. 
He spins back toward his generals. Ignored, the princess settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat. 
LONGSHANKS Nobles are the key to the Scottish door. Grant their nobles land here in England. Give our own nobles estates in the north. Make them too greedy to oppose us. 
One OLD ADVISOR speaks up hesitantly. 
OLD ADVISOR Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant to relocate. New lands mean new taxes, and they are taxed already for our war in France. 
Longshanks glares at him, but takes the point. The wheels grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the Princess, he is inspired. 
LONGSHANKS Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an old custom. Grant them prima noctes, "First night." When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married, our lords shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding. That should fetch just the kind of lords we want in Scotland. 
INT. PRINCE EDWARD'S ROYAL APARTMENTS - DAY 
The prince and a muscular young friend, PHILLIP, are stripped to the waist and fencing. They pay no attention to the 
KNOCK, or to the Princess as she enters. She watches them -- they are dancing more than fencing. Edward loses his sword; it clatters to the polished floor. He looks up at his wife, as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness. 
EDWARD What is it?! 
PRINCESS You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended. 
EDWARD So I did! And what was so important about it? 
PRINCESS Scotland. He intends -- 
But Edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself. 
PRINCESS He intends to grant -- 
Edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her. 
EDWARD Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?! 
PRINCESS ...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand -- 
EDWARD All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it! 
For an instant, anger flares into her eyes. She glances at Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes and starts to back out. But Edward has noticed. 
EDWARD Stop there. 
She stops, but does not raise her eyes. 
EDWARD Do you disapprove of Phillip? 
He lifts his hand and draws his friend Phillip to his side. 
Still the Princess does not lift her eyes. 
PRINCESS (barely audible) No, M'lord. 
EDWARD Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME! 
She lifts her eyes. But she could not brace herself enough for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men glistening with sweat and sexual excitement. 
The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away. 
EDWARD Now, my flower, do you understand? 
PRINCESS Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.

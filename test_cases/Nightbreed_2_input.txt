MELISSA: Coming... 
Melissa disappears from the bottom of the stairs. 
18. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT 
Melissa enters, moves out of sight. We stay at the door. A figure appears dressed in black, knives in both hands, and crosses to leave the screen again. We do not see his face. But we hear his labours: the sound of the blades slicing Melissa. She staggers into view, grabbing hold of her slit throat. Blood bubbles between her fingers. The figure appears behind her. She turns, as the knife descends. 
19. INT. RICKMAN LOUNGE NIGHT 
Lou hears a sound, rises and moves towards the kitchen door. 
LOU: Melissa? 
At the top of the stairs, Lou Two watches wide-eyed. 
20. INT. RICKMAN STAIRS NIGHT 
Lou Two's P.O.V. - We see blood running along the highway. 
21. INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT 
Lou reaches the kitchen door and sees Melissa laid out, dead, on the kitchen table 
LOU: Oh God - GOD! 
Lou enters, the figure emerges from behind him. While we remain at the door watching, detached, Lou fights back, throwing himself back and forth around the kitchen. But the figure is much stronger. We glimpse its face now, it is a mask, with a zipper for a mouth and buttons for eyes, blank. Devoid of compassion, hatred or regret. A death's head, made by a mad child. 
Atop the stairs, Lou Two listens. His baby sister cries in her cot. He looks her way then back downstairs. The sounds cease. Silence. Terror on his face. Then the child's perfect nightmare appears at the bottom of the stairs. The figure, heavy knife in hand, starts to climb, dragging Lou's bloody body after him by the hair.

24. EXT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT 
Three patrol cars, an ambulance, policeman restraining a small crowd gathered outside. A n.d. sedan roars up, red bubble light flashing, and Inspector Joyce gets out and moves towards the house. He's greeted by the Medical Examiner, Dr Burton, just exiting, carrying a medical bag. 
BURTON [bitter]: Brace yourself, Inspector. 
JOYCE: Same profile? 
BURTON: Unmistakable. Doesn't miss a trick. 
JOYCE [anguished]: Kids? Two kids? 
BURTON: If it's any comfort, they went quickly. 
JOYCE: Yeah. Makes me feel a whole lot better about the sick fuck. 
BURTON: Find this guy, Joyce. They say these guys want to be caught. I think this one likes it too much. 
A rookie patrolman stands on the doorstep, on the verge of tears. 
JOYCE [gently]: Let's get these tourists back, Officer. 
POLICEMAN: Yes sir. 
JOYCE [to Burton]: If we can't protect the kids, what the hell use are we?

29. INT. DR DECKER'S OFFICE DAY 
Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two years. They're on Decker's desk. 
DECKER: I've been listening to the tapes of our sessions. All two years' worth... 
We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and moves around to the other side. Boone is sitting on the other side of the desk, his posture far from relaxed. He hates this room. As Decker moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls. Dance pictures, photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc. 
BOONE: Why? 
DECKER: Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But you...you intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember Midian? 
BOONE: That wasn't me. I heard about Midian from other people. 
DECKER: But you made it part of your private mythology. 
BOONE: I suppose I did. It was a place of refuge. 
DECKER: When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven? 
Boone's looking uneasy now. He wipes sweat from his upper lip.

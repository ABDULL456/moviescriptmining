CUT TO: 
INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME 
LOW ANGLE on the door -- as a pair of men's shoes pass through frame. 
CLOSE ON CLAIRE, inside a stall SHE HEARS FOOTSTEPS QUIETLY ENTER, followed by a CLICK of a DOOR.  It's not the click of a stall door, because the FOOTSTEPS then proceed inward; WE HEAR A STALL DOOR CLOSE and LOCK.  It gives her momentary pause, but she dismisses it, looking for her purse -- realizing she left it on the sink -- opening her stall door and heading out. 
She barely hears the "click" of the bolt sliding behind her -- and looks up, into the MIRROR, SEEING VENZA appear behind her.  She SPINS -- but doesn't have time to CRY OUT.  He's grabbed her by the THROAT. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BALLROOM - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT 
MIKE and the PRETTY YOUNG THING:  she doesn't notice him trying to drift away. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING You know what?  I don't think you're a policeman at all.  I think you're just some schmuck who uses that "policeman" line as a come-on. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 
CLAIRE attempting to breathe -- her FACE being brought to within an inch of his. 
VENZA Christ, you're one beautiful woman. I could kill you right now, but I'm not gonna... 'cause you're gonna help me.  You're gonna see me in a police line-up and say it wasn't me. And if you don't do that, someone will come after you.  They're gonna find you dead, with your face missing -- understood... Good... Because otherwise, it'd be this easy. 
CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  her eyes wide with TERROR.  He rubs his thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick. 
VENZA Now walk outta here.  And if you ever see me again... you never saw me before. 
To make his point, he SQUEEZES HARDER -- CLAIRE'S eyes bulging, as TEARS run from her eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MUSEUM - UPPER TIER - SAME - NIGHT 
MIKE, finally putting distance between him and the "PRETTY YOUNG THING." 
ANGLE:  MIKE, as he catches sight of a back of a man (VENZA) moving out of the ladies' room.  Stunned, MIKE PIVOTS, TURNING, SPRINTING IN THE DIRECTION of the ladies' room. 
OUTSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  Two women just go in.  MIKE pushes his way in, slamming the door behind him.  The OTHER WOMEN GASP, seeing MIKE invading their sanctuary. 
INSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  MIKE 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE, disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and face, but otherwise uninjured. 
MIKE turns, calling to the TWO WOMEN coming in. 
MIKE Take care of her! 
MIKE TAKES OFF AFTER VENZA -- 
INT.  UPPER TIER 
OUT OF LADIES' ROOM, AND UP THE RAMP TO THE NEAREST (THE UPPER) LEVEL. 
ANGLE:  He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR.  These is only one place for it to go -- DOWN.  MIKE CHANGES DIRECTION and FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP trying to keep pace with the descent of the elevator.  At the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and VENZA EXITS AMIDST THE PARTY. 
ANGLE ON VENZA:  VENZA MAKES HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND EXITS THE BUILDING. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  MIKE HURTLES DOWN THE RAMP AND DESPERATELY FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE CENTER of the PARTY and OUT the FRONT ENTRANCE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT 
MIKE EXITS the BUILDING bewildered; lost him... RUNS BLINDLY amidst PEDESTRIANS -- SPOTS VENZA AHEAD. 
ANGLE ON VENZA reaching someone MIKE CAN'T SEE.  MIKE puts his hand in his jacket for his gun. 
MIKE Venza! 
VENZA HEARS and SLOWS, but DOESN'T TURN.  ONLOOKERS turn. VENZA is talking to someone, taking his time. 
ANGLE ON VENZA:  untroubled, turning; raising his arms, and SMILING. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  confused -- seeing that the man VENZA stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give himself up. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  breathless as he moves toward VENZA.  MIKE frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.

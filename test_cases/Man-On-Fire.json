MEXICO CITY - DAY \nHigh over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets: the sounds of a Mass being sung. \nA CATHOLIC CHURCH \nThe big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin. They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes 500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them... \nA GRAND MARQUIS \nSqueals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff- arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins... \nThe Grand Marquis pulls away. \nINT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY \nThey shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat. These guys are not the police. \nA switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels. Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf. \nDuct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head. \nEXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY \nThe Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over from one group to the other. \nINT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nThe phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall) answers. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    2. \nREVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin. \nINT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY \nA wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf. \nA MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear scratched. \nAt a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed. \nCUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA newspaper, being interviewed, \"...organized crime syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last two years.\" \nEXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY \nAs a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear. \nEXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT \nA MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag. \nEXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM) \nFootbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway. Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown neighborhood. Looks more like \"war torn Beirut\", burnt out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi- derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves. \nEXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT \nRUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                        3. \nHORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded, is dumped on the median. The car pulls away. \nHe stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING for help. More horns, shouts, no help. \nEND MAIN TITLES.   Goes to black. \nCREASY'S VOICE Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nSamuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40, already has the patrician look that has served the male members of his family for generations. They discuss the kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside. \nJORDAN The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later. (laughs; chews) His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass. \nSAMUEL And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included. \nJORDAN If she pisses you off, you get another one. \nSAMUEL (laughs grimly) Do you know what she told me last night? \nFLASH TO: \nINT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT \nSamuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him: \nFLASH.   Fingers being fingerprinted. \nJUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels, glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of suitcase. \nThe seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles. \nEXT. JUAREZ, MEXICO FOUR BIG BURLY SUV'S - DRIVING ACROSS THE BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY \nINT. SUV - DAY \nSix Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. PAUL RAYBURN sits up front trying not to spill coffee on the mini Uzi cradled in his lap. As his own cell phone rings, he answers. \nRAYBURN Rayburn here. \nINT. CUSTOMS HOLDING TANK - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nCreasy on payphone. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                        8. \nCREASY When did Mexican Customs start getting smart? \nRAYBURN's SUV \nRAYBURN Creasy???   Where the fuck are you? \nCUSTOMS JAIL \nCREASY I'm here. \nRAYBURN's SUV \nRAYBURN What do you mean, I'm here? \nCUSTOMS JAIL \nCREASY I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it. \nINT. CUSTOMS AREA - A BACK OFFICE Rayburn has 5K U.S. dollars laid out on      the desk between him, the Customs official, and Creasy.       The remains of the suitcase are spread around the room.       The main offender, the gun being front and center      next to the cash. Looks like the official is going       to fold. \nRAYBURN This is going to cost you big time. \nINT. STRIP BAR - Rethink Location \nA stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'. \nRAYBURN You got a secondary search and you had a gun. \nCREASY Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught. \nRAYBURN Everything happens once if you live long enough. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     9. \nCREASY It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane. \nRAYBURN This is Mexico, they do everything backwards. \nCreasy hits the 'Jack'. \nRAYBURN So what's wrong? \nCREASY Nothing wrong. \nRAYBURN Don't give me that bullshit. \nCreasy changes subject. \nCREASY So how's business? \nRAYBURN Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking-Wayne. \nCREASY But don't you stay in El Paso? \nRAYBURN Fuck, I love Mexico.   I live like a king down here. \nCreasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar. \nCREASY Yeah, right... \nRAYBURN Oh, like you haven't been in worse places. \nCREASY And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable. \nRayburn laughs. Creasy takes the bottle.     Creasy's hand is mottled by old burn marks. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    10. \nRAYBURN You been working? \nCREASY Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting. \nRAYBURN How long you staying, Crease? \nCREASY (shrugs) Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse. \nRayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks that weren't there last time they met. \nRAYBURN You did something on impulse? \nCREASY Everything happens once if you live long enough. \nCreasy smiles. \nINT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT \nNine-year-old PINTA MARTIN RAMOS stares out at the garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare. Pinta's eyes brim with life. She folds her hands, closes her eyes, prays. 'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs. Samuel on the baby grand. \nSamuel hands back the gun. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   14. \nSAMUEL You will meet my wife first. She would like it if you are presentable, polite and respectful. You'll be the fifth candidate she's seen this week. \nSamuel flips through a manila folder. \nSAMUEL Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch? \nCREASY (honest) I drink. \nSAMUEL How does it affect you? \nCREASY My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay. \nSAMUEL And what if amateurs try it? \nCREASY I'll probably kill them.   Is that likely? \nSAMUEL No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife. \nAs they pull up to the Ramos' impressive hacienda. \nINT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT \nWhere Lisa is flipping through TV channels; Sky News, CNN, etc... Each one showing some terrorist act - West Bank protest, Madrid car bombing. \nSamuel and Creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her.      She clicks it off, looks back at them. \nLISA The world of our children.   How dare they? \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      15. \nCREASY (shrugs) It's war. The weakest suffer the most. \nLISA You're American. \nCREASY So are you. \nSAMUEL (introducing) My wife, Mr. Creasy. \nLISA Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy. \nLisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand.    Gives him a quick once over. \nLISA (CONT'D) Would you like a drink? \nCreasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has no irony in his answer. \nCREASY Thank you.     Scotch and a little water. \nShe steps to the bar to make it. \nCREASY - FROM SOMEONE'S POV \nSlightly sinister.   Watching from the frame of the door. \nLISA You've done much of this work before? \nCREASY Never. \nSamuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence. \nSAMUEL He has experience in related work.     A great deal of it. \nLISA Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy? \nCreasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat. \nCREASY No.   I do not have family. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                          16. \nAnd then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched.        His eyes flicker over, just in time to see... \nPINTA \nCrouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a beat, then disappears around the corner. \nSITTING ROOM \nCreasy frowns.    Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink. \nCREASY Thank you. \nShe makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks back into hers with complete indifference, something she has not experienced even from dying men. \nShe abruptly turns away.    Confused for a moment. Finally: \nLISA Pinta! \nA few moments and Pinta arrives.       'Cool Hand Pinta'. \nPINTA Yes, mom? \nLISA This is Mr. Creasy. \nPinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand. Creasy shakes it. An odd beat. \nLISA Pinta, show him to his room. \nSamuel reacts.    Creasy got the job. \nPINTA This way, Mr. Creasy. \nWhat an actress. As he follows her out.        Samuel sits at his baby grand and begins to play. \nLISA Well, think about going to sleep.   Good night, baby. \nLisa exits.   Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear. \nPINTA Just like you, a big old bear. \nCUT TO: \nCREASY \nIn his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins loading up. The full magazine joins with those already loaded. \nAnother glass of scotch is poured. \nCreasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed. \nA map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's school. \nThe macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the cage door. \nCREASY Now's your chance. \nThe bird flies, disappears out the window. \nINT.   LISA & SAMUEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSpent, glistened in sweat, the couple lay side by side. \nLISA She likes him. \nSAMUEL Hmm? \nLISA Creasy.   Pinta likes him. \nSAMUEL Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   21. \nLisa just smiles, knows her daughter better. \nCUT TO: \nCREASY'S ROOM \nCreasy's drinking in the dark next to the window, listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night. \nThe empty scotch glass is set down.    Ominously sober. \nINT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nBrushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks underneath... \nThe \"Car Wash Guy\", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy. Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro. \nINT.   MERCEDES - DAY \nCreasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The back of the right one is swirled with scars. \nPINTA Where are you from, Creasy? \nCREASY The United States. \nPINTA I know.    But which state? \nCreasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him. \nCREASY No state in particular. \nPinta frowns; this is going to take some work. \nPINTA My mom and me are from Houston, Texas. Have you been there? \nCreasy has his eyes on the mirror. \nCREASY No. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   22. \nPINTA You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you? \nCREASY (turns left) No. \nPINTA Why not? \nCREASY I'm looking for potential. \nCreasy checks the mirror. The white Corolla continues the way it was going. False alarm. \nPINTA Potential?     I don't understand. \nCREASY Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking. \nPINTA Are you going to quit?     My last bodyguard quit. \nCREASY Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking? \nPINTA Someone gave him more money than we could. \nCREASY I'm a bargain. \nPINTA Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico? \nCREASY Time will tell. \nPINTA There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy? \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     23. \nEXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY \nCreasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less. \nThe doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in marble. \nINT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY \nPinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy.     She looks out the window, realizes... \nPINTA We're taking a different way home. \nCREASY That's right. \nPinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles. \nPINTA I understand.     Smart. \nNo answer from Creasy.     It's hard not to feel foolish around this kid. \nPINTA Did you like school, Creasy? \nCREASY No. \nPINTA Not at all? \nCREASY No. \nPINTA But why not? \nCreasy's hoping she'll just shut up. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    27. \nPINTA Hmmm? \nCREASY It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna. \nPINTA So you were unhappy? \nCREASY Being unhappy is a state of mind.   I never thought about it. \nPINTA Oh... \nPinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in. She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel. \nThen, as she reaches out... \nPINTA What happened to... \nAnd touches it. \nPINTA ...your hand? \nCreasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an instant. \nCREASY No more questions. \nWhen he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something. \nCREASY I'm not paid to be your friend.   I'm paid to protect you. \nThey drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over. Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering. \nCREASY (exasperated) And don't start crying. \nPINTA I'm not crying. \nBut she is.   As Creasy stops at a red light... \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      28. \nCREASY Look, this is the way I am.   I don't like questions. I -- \nAnd she's out the door. \nCREASY Shit. \nCreasy shoulders open his door, bolts out. \nINTERSECTION \nCreasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is already getting back in the car. This time in the backseat. \nCreasy sighs. The light goes green.     Scooters whine away and horns blare. \nMERCEDES \nCreasy sits back behind the wheel. \nPINTA You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy. \nCreasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead. As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving. \nINT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nCreasy sits at the table   with the old gardener GOMEZ (we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier exteriors). Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going after any remnants with a   crust of bread. Creasy hasn't touched his. \nMARIA, the cook, enters.    As she clocks Creasy's plate... \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET \n'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very accomplished player. \nCreasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door. \nCREASY Come in. \nPINTA You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead. \nSAMUEL You enjoy it for us, Pinta. \nLisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Finally, Pinta nods. \nCreasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door. \nINT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY \nCreasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms. \nCREASY They'll be back in a week. \nPINTA They can stay for two weeks.   I don't care. \nShe's got a toughness Creasy likes.   As she looks out the window, he looks ahead. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       39. \nINT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nCreasy eats. \nCREASY The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a real talent. \nMaria beams with pleasure. \nMARIA My pleasure, Creasy. \nPinta enters  in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table from Creasy.   As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and no place to  go. \nWrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room.        As Maria and Creasy exchange a look... \nEXT./INT.   WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nPinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof. \nEXT.   ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nPinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she crosses, disappears over the peak. \nIt's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The bird moves away, just out of her reach each time. \nCHIMNEY \nPinta coming down the other slope.      There's the macaw. \nPINTA Come on.   Come on.   Bird! \nThe fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away. She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard barking loudly. \nNear the edge, she manages to stop.      Whew! \nShe scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She slides again. This time right off the edge. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      40. \nShe catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks: \nINT.   KITCHEN - DAY \nPINTA'S VOICE CREASY! \nCreasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat. \nEXT.   SIDE YARD - DAY \nCreasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet... \n...landing in a hedge.   Creasy dashes over. \nCREASY Pinta! \nShe's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head. Frank's licking her face. \nPINTA It hurts. \nCREASY Where? \nPINTA (Short) Everywhere! \nShe puts her hands to the left side of her ribs.     Creasy carefully probes with his fingers. She winces. \nCREASY I don't think they're broken.     Anywhere else? \nPINTA My ankle. \nAs Maria huffs and puffs her way up. \nCREASY I'm going to get you out, okay? \nPinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her, lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in his arms. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     41. \nPINTA Oh, Creasy... \nAnd she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty foot fall. Begins to cross herself. \nCREASY It's okay.    She's just scared. \nCreasy cradles her, pats her back.      As Pinta says his name like a mantra... \nINT.   HOTEL ROOM - DETROIT - NIGHT \nLisa on the phone. Fantastic in a black evening dress. The Ford car industry dinner awaits her entrance. \nPINTA It must be difficult having lots of wives. \nCREASY You feel sorry for the husband? \nPINTA (in Spanish) Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand? \nMaria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory. \nPINTA Creasy, you're smiling. \nHe reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing. And Creasy can't help but smile again. \nCREASY I guess I am. \nPinta changes subject. \nPINTA So how come you know so much about those countries? \nCREASY I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                  45. \nPINTA What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes? \nCREASY No, that was in Columbia. \nCUT TO: \nGOMEZ \nHumming to himself as he brushes the leaves out of the empty SWIMMING POOL. \nCUT TO: \nCU of a water faucet unloads 100 gallons a minute. \nA MAN'S HAND.   BLACK. \nRaises up against the blue sky. Like a kid playing Cowboys and Indians. The finger pulls an imaginary trigger. \nRAMOS POOL \nIn her swimsuit and cap, Pinta crouches in makeshift starting blocks. \nCREASY Bang! \nPinta takes off. Splashes into the water.     Not to Creasy's satisfaction. \nCREASY No, no, come back. \nPinta turns in the water, looks back at him. \nCREASY You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself. \nPINTA I don't understand. \nCREASY Don't worry.    You will. \nCreasy points at the blocks.    Pinta gets out of the water. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                  46. \nShivering, Creasy throws a towel around her and rubs her down. \nINT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING \nOn the way to school. Pinta is stealing looks at Creasy's right hand. She knows the answer must be serious, but she has to ask. \nPINTA Creasy, what happened to your hand? \nCreasy looks at her a moment, deciding. Pinta practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the answer may come. Creasy checks the mirror, watches the road. \nCREASY A man asked me questions once.   He smoked a lot. There was no ashtray. \nThat's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues watching the road. Pinta watches him. \nCREASY Remember you asked me what state I was from? \nPINTA Yes. \nCREASY Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you. \nPINTA Good things happen, too, Creasy. (smiles big) Like meeting me. \nCREASY (after a beat) I guess that really does make me a hard case. \nAs the two of them share a LAUGH... \nINT.   3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT \nLisa walking toward Creasy's room. As she moves to knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. She peeks in. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     47. \nCreasy and Pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a book spread out before them. Doing her history homework. \nLISA'S POV - OF CREASY \nHe's charming and great with Pinta.     And sexy... Evelyn was right. \nPINTA Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? \nCREASY No. \nPINTA Did you used to? \nCREASY Yeah.   Two or three. \nPinta considers this.   Then.. \nPINTA I'm not afraid you, Creasy. \nCREASY I know you're not. \nPINTA Are you afraid of me? \nCreasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding. \nCREASY I used to be.     At first.   But not anymore. \nHer smile is huge. \nPINTA Good. \nEXT.   GARDEN POOL - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nHeated. Steam rising off the water. PINTA stands with her eyes closed. Creasy, standing beside her, brings TWO BLOCKS together with a WHACK! \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       51. \nPinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head. Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around her. Frank oversees the whole program. \nCREASY The gunshot holds no fear.    Say it. \nPINTA The gunshot holds no fear. \nCREASY You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound. \nEyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face. \nPinta smiles at the sound.     Creasy smiles at the sight. \nEXT.   RAMOS POOL - DAY \nWHACK!   Pinta bolts from the blocks.    SPLASHES. \nWHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Pinta surges.      Pinta arcs.    Pinta knifes into the water. \nPinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line. Creasy checks his watch, claps. \nPINTA I'm tough, Creasy.    I'm tough as you. \nCREASY There's no such thing as tough.    You're either trained or untrained. \nPinta raises her arms overhead, makes like Rocky across the shallow end. Creasy shakes his head in amusement. \nINT.   LISA'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nFirst light is just tracing outlines against the window. Lisa alone in bed, staring at the ceiling. Frightened at what she's feeling. \nCUT TO: \nCREASY \nSleeping, looking sexy. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   52. \nEXT.   COURTYARD - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY \nAs the Mercedes pulls in, another car is ahead of it. Samuel is home, a DRIVER pulls his LUGGAGE from the trunk. \nPinta gets out of the Mercedes. \nPINTA Hi, Dad. \nHe gives her a pat on the head. Simultaneously, Samuel fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. He thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's. \nSAMUEL I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what you did for my wife. \nCreasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past Samuel to Pinta who looks bemused. He doesn't even want to know exactly what she knows. \nThe Car Wash Guy, - Pedro, ingratiates himself with Samuel. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCreasy's finger presses play. \"Blue Bayou\" begins. Plaintive, haunting. As he moves to sit in his chair, he passes the scotch bottle. It has gone unopened. \nHe ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, smoothly catches it on the back of his hand. Rock steady. Frank's tail wags. \nINT.   PINTA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWhere the song drifts down. Pinta smiles, closes her eyes. Now she can go to sleep. \nINT.   LISA & SAMUEL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSamuel makes love to his wife. But Lisa looks past him, through the walls and floors to where that song plays. \nLINDA RONSTADT I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     53. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM -NIGHT \nCU of Creasy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   PARKING LOT - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY \nThe big swim meet. Race day. A lot of security, men speaking into their wrists. For a public gathering the mood almost seems ominous. Creasy and Pinta exit the Mercedes. Pinta watches wistfully as her fellow STUDENTS stream toward the water with their PARENTS. \nPINTA What's so important in Los Angeles? \nCREASY Your father has business. \nCREASY I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I got it. \nAlicia blows Creasy a kiss. \nCREASY Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone to bed? \nLaughter. \nPINTA Okay, I think now is as good as time as any. \nShe takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate drawstring. \nPinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple, but fine MEDALLION and chain into the palm of his hand. \nPINTA I bought it with my own money.     I saved it. \nCreasy is really affected, tries to hide it.    She takes it, slips it over his head. \nPINTA It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. \nRAYBURN And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St. Jude became a Saint in the first place. \nPINTA Yeah, that's right. \nCreasy looks at it, considers. \nCREASY Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                  57. \nPinta kisses him. As the Mariachi band drifts over, Rayburn grabs his wife by the hand. \nRAYBURN Come on, baby. I feel like a third wheel. Watch the kid. \nThey dance. A waiter steps over, refills Creasy's water glass. As he drinks... \nPINTA Could I ask you a question? \nCREASY Could I stop you? \nPINTA You don't drink like you used to. \nCREASY That's not a question. \nPINTA I know because I go in your room and check the bottles. \nCREASY Still not a question. \nPINTA My mom drinks, too...    Why do people drink, Creasy? \nCREASY Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears. \nPINTA You think too much? \nCREASY Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough. \nPinta nods, thinks she understands. \nINT.   AIRPORT - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nSamuel and Lisa on the moving escalator. Home from Los Angeles. They look down through the glass, see Creasy waiting for them below. And finally, Lisa frowns. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      58. \nLISA He has to go, Samuel. \nSAMUEL What?   Who? \nLISA Creasy. \nSAMUEL Why?    You were so pleased with him. \nLISA Pinta likes him too much. (a beat) She thinks of him as a father. \nSAMUEL That's ridiculous. \nLISA It's not. \nSamuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic. \nSAMUEL I've just been so busy, Lisa. \nLISA He has to go. \nSamuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy. \nSAMUEL The three month trial ends in a week. I just won't confirm the position. That possibility was understood when I hired him. \nLisa gives him a look. She wants it done today.     But for once, Samuel is stronger than his wife. \nSAMUEL I won't create bad feelings. And another week won't make a difference. \nOff the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting unaware. \nSAMUEL It will be a hard break. \nLISA She's young.     She'll get over it. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    59. \nSAMUEL I wasn't thinking of Pinta. \nAs Lisa looks over at Samuel, he's reaching out his hand, smiling big. \nSAMUEL Creasy, how are you? \nAs they shake hands... \nSlides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat... \nCREASY (drawing his 9mm) Run, Pinta, run! \nBut she's rooted with fear. \nAnd the men are almost on her. \nCreasy raises the 9mm overhead.    BANG! \nAnd the sound frees her.   Pinta runs! \nDucking under a flailing arm.    Quick and lithe.   Trying to reach her bodyguard. \nThe cops drawing Uzi's.. \nCreasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.     He fires twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest. \nPinta runs.   Chased by the TWO MEN. \nCOP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten bullet line. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                        63. \nCreasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high in the chest and throat. Precise. \nCreasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! \nMAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs. \nA bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the Corolla. \nCreasy fires back.    BOOM!    BOOM! \nMAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit in the shoulder. \nAnd Pinta disappears into the traffic.        Gone. \nMAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again. \nCreasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He falls to his knees. \nThe dandelion starts to come apart.      Drifting away, piece by piece. \nSlack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans for Pinta who's nowhere in sight. \nShe got away!   Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on his side. \nPINTA'S VOICE CREASY! \nAnd Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back. \nCREASY NOOO... \nShe runs to him, wraps her arms around him. \nPINTA Creasy... \nMAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the sedan. Creasy can only blink after them. \nPINTA Creasy! \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       64. \nIt's not a cry for help.     It's anguish for him. \nCREASY Pinta... \nMAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away. \nWe just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield. An anguished image before she's pulled back down. \nCreasy makes a wish.     Not for himself, but for her. \nCREASY Don't die, Creasy, don't die. \nAnd everything goes very, very, \nBLACK \nSound breaks through first. The whir and beep of medical equipment. And we fade back into: \nINT.    HOSPITAL ROOM - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nCreasy hooked up. Tubes running in and out of the unconscious man. And he's suddenly surrounded. \nThe CHIEF of the Judicial Police and several uniformed OFFICERS. At the foot of the bed several NEWSPAPER REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. \nCHIEF This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an American citizen, is under arrest for the murder of two police officers, Hector Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara.

A HUBBUB drifts up from the rooms below. \nINT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nBut as he tries to enter Creasy's room, he's met in the door by TWO THUG COPS, in uniform. \nCOP ONE No visitors. \nCop two pokes a finger into Rayburn's chest. \nCOP TWO Who are you? \nRAYBURN I'm here to see my friend. \nCop two pokes him again.     Goading him. \nCOP TWO Identification. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     69. \nRayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO PLAINCLOTHES. \nIgnoring the proffered salutes, Manzano finishes his pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards Rayburn. \nMANZANO When I heard it was this hospital I was so pleased. There's a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it? \nRayburn shakes his head. \nMANZANO The best pastries in Mexico. \nManzano holds out his right hand. \nMANZANO (CONT'D) Miguel Manzano. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY \nCreasy out of it still.    Rayburn and Manzano at the foot of the bed. \nRAYBURN He's not a cop killer. \nMANZANO I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing. \nRAYBURN He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him. \nMANZANO So am I. \nAnd Creasy stirs.   Rayburn leans into his friend, Manzano just behind him. \nRAYBURN You hear me, Crease? \nCreasy's eyes slit open. \nRAYBURN (CONT'D) (whispers) You got three of the fuckers.   All dead. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     70. \nCREASY Pinta... \nRAYBURN Two days gone.

Samuel picks it up and listens. \nManzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders. Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   75. \nMANZANO Nothing? \nCreasy shakes his head. \nMANZANO Excellent work by the way. Three men dead. Only ten rounds fired. \nCreasy shakes his head at the next shot. \nMANZANO If two of the men in my division could shoot like that, I could get rid of the other thirty-six. \nOne of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet. Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages. \nCREASY What am I doing here? \nMANZANO Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. (re: book) This page? \nCREASY No. \nThe adjutant reaches the last page.   Creasy shakes his head. \nMANZANO You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long. \nCREASY Am I a suspect? \nMANZANO No.   It would be convenient, but no. \nAs Manzano packs up his mugshot books... \nCREASY Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.

Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital. \nCreasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy sits up.

Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines' where the policemen fell. A pyre of flowers where Pinta was scooped up, Creasy's blood still staining the sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up... \nRosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the shrine. \nRosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else. \nAcross the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher, surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of Rosanna \nCREASY (FLASHBACK) \nCorolla.   Muzzle flashes.    Pinta screaming... \nFEMALE VOICE Creasy... \nCreasy wheels.

I'm writing a story. \nCreasy walks away from her.     Rosanna catches up and holds out a plastic ziploc. \nROSANNA This might interest you.       I found it across the street. \nCreasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand. A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle. Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo. \nFLASH:   Creasy at the police station.      His photo taken. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     78. \nROSANNA It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

Can you knock up a case for fifteen of each? \nHe picks up a double barrel shotgun, checks the line of it. He flicks open the breach, snaps it shut. \nCREASY (indicating) Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. (looks around) Rocket launchers? \nRAYBURN Different door.

They're struggling. Rosanna hands the piece of paper with the license plate number to Manzano. \nMANZANO He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything. \nROSANNA He sounded strong to me.      Stronger than we are. \nRosanna pauses. \nROSANNA Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are. \nMANZANO We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this. \nManzano plays back a recording of the Kidnapper. \nVOICE \"I used to run through the streets of Neza because I was scared of being fucked with. I swore one day I would cross the street walking. Now I walk.\" \nROSANNA He's protected by La Hermanidad. \nMANZANO I know this.    Your point? \nROSANNA Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us. \nRosanna waits for a response.    None. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       84. \nROSANNA Then what do you have to lose? \nMANZANO It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys. \nFinally deciding, Manzano turns, holds out his hand.

A 17-year-old GIRL under the sheet. \nGIRL (nods) When will I see you again? \nPulling  on his suit coat, Sandri steps to the door. He mimes a  pistol action with his forefinger and thumb. He opens it  to find himself staring square into the eyes of Creasy.   He rests the twin barrels of the sawed-off shotgun  square against Sandri's chest. \nCREASY Her name was Pinta. \nSandri registers the name.

As he rolls, kicks off, it's Pinta who emerges from the bubbles swimming back the over way. \nPinta swims through the a maroon cloud filtering through the water. \nCUT TO: \nCU of Pinta's diary. Creasy opens it up. The bullet sits in the center crease. He thumbs through the pages stopping on different days. Pinta's V.O. Illustrating those pages. \nEXT. CHAPULTEPEC PARK - DAY \nHandball court. Intense game with big money stakes. A sea of criminal faces cheer on the gladiators from the bleachers. It's a close match. \nA 200 pound Guardian removes his T-shirt before serving. Turns to reveal a huge tattoo across two-thirds of his back. Creasy registers his prey. \nEXT. BARRIO SUNSET \nA small Russian Taurus crests a hill and descends into Hell. A frightening looking Barrio. Burnt out cars and dead dogs line the sidewalks. Creasy tails the Guardian on his moped into the center of a trash dump. The focal point being a semi-derelict church within a gated compound. Our 'tattooed handball genius' exits the Taurus. Reaches in back for the groceries. \nRelief for Tazinari as the .44 Is withdrawn. Creasy walks around the car Tazinari now looking like a naked hood ornament. Butt first. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                  107. \nEXT. FREEWAY EMERGENCY OFF RAMP - DAY \nAverage speed 80 m.p.h. This is Mexico.

In the middle of the cloud is Jordan face down floating on the surface dressed in his beige linen suit. \nUNDERWATER \nCLOSE UP of Jordan face down. We glimpse what we don't want to see. Black holes where his eyes and mouth were. His ears missing. \nCreasy not terribly impressed.   Just pissed that he's late. \nCreasy on a cell phone talking to Rosanna \nCREASY Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos. \nROSANNA How do I contact you?   We still don't have the ATM info. \nCREASY You don't, I'll call you. Oh!

Even great marriages cannot survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death. \nThe door opens and they expect to see Maria with the deserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a dinner guest. \nCREASY (to Samuel) I'm going to talk to your wife. If you move or say one word, I'll kill you. \nHe takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol out of his waistband and lays it on the table in preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns to Lisa. \nCREASY I'm going to tell you a story. Your lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million into his U.S. bank account. Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. If my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains. \nCreasy looks to Samuel. \nCREASY Your husband magically had five million deposited in a U.S. bank account last Friday. \nLisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern whether this is true or not. \nCREASY They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus. \nLISA Planned what? \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     109. \nCREASY An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity. \nLisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips. \nCREASY On the surface it was low risk and high return. This was the third autosequestra Jordan had organized for clients. The other two succeeded. \nSamuel looks to Lisa. \nSAMUEL Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination. I wasn't sure about whether to go through with it or not. Then I woke up one day and it was done. (beat) Jordan was supposed to take care of it. \nThrough all of the above, Creasy removes the special bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.     He empties the other cartridges from his gun. \nLisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the first time. \nCreasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's eyes. \nCREASY A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the truth. And the truth will set you free. \nCreasy hands Samuel the gun. \nCREASY In many ways I think this bullet should be shared between you and Lisa. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    110. \nCreasy exits the room.

He watches    and thinks. He never smiles. I wish I    was back in the front seat with him. I    wish he would smile. \nCreasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city. And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless. \nIt's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials a number on a cell phone. \nCREASY Hola... \nCREASY Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death? \nManzano laughs again.   Genuine.   Creasy cracks him up. \nMANZANO My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works. \nCREASY So you are going to talk me to death. \nMANZANO You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.

What do you want? \nMANZANO I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing. \nCREASY My deal is with Rosanna.

Name and address. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       115. \nMANZANO You have no interest in making things easy, do you? \nCREASY I'm not... easy. \nManzano reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a folded PIECE OF PAPER and a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. He hands the bottle out first. \nMANZANO Percodan.   I imagine you need handfuls by now. \nCreasy makes no move to take it. Manzano sighs, sets it down in front of him. Regarding the paper... \nMANZANO Account belongs to a woman we think is The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas, who is 8 months pregnant. \nCreasy holds his hand out.     Manzano hesitates. \nMANZANO The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll arrest him. Agreed? \nCreasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it. Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts out. \nMANZANO Creasy...

A man sits on it waiting, wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well known features. Creasy. \nCREASY - VIDEO FEED \nIt's difficult to say where they are coming from. The view passes from one screen to another. As Creasy's passes, we hear the whispered crackle of radio communications. \nGROUND LEVEL \nCREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out. Creasy checks the digital \"8x10\" even though this face is indelibly imprinted on his brain. \nIt's not \"The Dreamer.\"    Not as handsome, but there's a resemblance. \nThe MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first and then enters. \nCreasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his bicycle through the doorway. \nCreasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he strides across the street. \"Man on Fire.\" \nThe bicycle makes it in.    And the door is closing... \nCreasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside. \nCUT TO: \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      117. \nMANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ \nManzano listens to a radio over a desk speaker. \nVOICE He's inside.

Suddenly the wall next to Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets. \nWe realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina is screaming. \nHear a door torn open. Creasy      moves to the sound.   A MAN has run out the back... \nEXT.

The Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead. \nCREASY Sorry. \nLISA The traffic takes some getting used to. \nAs Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes by headed the opposite way.

MANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ - NIGHT \nA beehive. Cops. Photos of dead kidnappers on the wall: Jorge and Sandri. Sandri emasculated, one hand missing. Jorge behind the wheel, fingers stubs and a missing ear. \n", "test2_true": "Manzano studies the photo of Jorge. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    97. \nMANZANO Whoever did this was methodical, unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy? \nADJUTANT No, I checked. But right   after Sandri was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found naked, hysterical in the  street. She said it was a man fitting  Creasy's description who shot him. \nMANZANO Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a very lethal human being. \nADJUTANT You don't seem very surprised? \nManzano looks at his Adjutant, pleased with his perception. But he isn't sharing. \nMANZANO What's surprising these days? \nAn AFI agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken. Manzano takes a bite, moans in pleasure. \nMANZANO Your sister?    Only a virgin cooks like this. \nAGENT (laughs) Your man's here. Interrogation room two. \nCUT TO: \nSURVEILLANCE ROOM \nSeen through a two-way mirror.   Manzano watches as... \nRayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor. Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly, his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as, slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing. \nThen, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a laugh. \nCUT TO: \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    98. \nINTERROGATION ROOM TWO \nRayburn opens his eyes, looks over as Manzano enters. Still eating, he hands Rayburn a second plate of chicken. \nMANZANO Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really. \nRAYBURN (sets it down) I already ate. \nManzano enjoys another bite, then... \nMANZANO Tell me about your friend Creasy. \nRAYBURN You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say. \nMANZANO I read the file. You and Creasy have seen quite a bit together. \nRAYBURN Two tourists who never went home. \nMANZANO You helped him get this job. \nRAYBURN That's what friends do. \nMANZANO Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better. \nRAYBURN I can take care of myself. \nMANZANO You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders. (laughs) You two were a married couple. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    99. \nRAYBURN The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. \nMANZANO What happened to him?   What happened to Creasy? \nRayburn flinches at some bitter memory. \nRAYBURN None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say. \nMANZANO This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does. \nRAYBURN He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way. \nMANZANO I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that. \nRAYBURN Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead. \nMANZANO What was she to Creasy then? \nRAYBURN Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again. \nMANZANO And they took that away. \nRAYBURN A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece. \nThe words sink in.   Manzano understands their magnitude. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   100. \nRAYBURN Me? I got Jap businessmen to drive across the border. So, if you'll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here... \nEXT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nFramed commendations fall to the carpet as Rosanna slams up against the wall of Manzano's office. Skirt up around her waist, Manzano moves inside of her. Between breaths: \nMANZANO Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday. \nROSANNA And left three more dead men. \nShe bites the heel of his palm to keep from crying out. \nMANZANO When you talked to him, did he look sane? \n", "test2_id": 289, "test3_input": "ROSANNA No. Not by the rules of polite society at least. \nMANZANO I think he's... magnificent. \nAs they both climax, pressed up hard against each other... \nMANZANO (smiles) You only fuck me to get information. \nROSANNA (smiles back) You only give information so you can fuck me. \nMANZANO A beautiful circle. \nHe kisses her, turned on again already. \nROSANNA Let's put Creasy to press. There's a vigilante cleaning up Mexico. An unstoppable hero. \nAs Manzano considers this, likes it, Rosanna takes the ATM card out from her bra. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      101. \nROSANNA And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well. \nMANZANO (as he takes card) I should start going for your tits first. \nEXT. SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY \nUnderwater as Pinta swims. As she spins, kicks off the wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side. A plume of red blossoming off his side. \nThis is done over and over, faster and faster, closer and closer. The blood becomes darker, bigger. And we push into that blood until it's finally obscuring everything. \nEXT.   NEWSSTAND - MEXICO CITY - EARLY MORNING \nA row of newspapers being set out.     Creasy's face on the front page of every one of them. \nEXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING \nA quaint old Mexico neighborhood. We follow a long canvas bag being carried through the streets. Carried by Creasy. Toward the end of the street and a ground floor apartment. Walks past a canary yellow Coup deVille, which has seen better days. \nINT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - MORNING \nAn elderly couple eating lunch. The HUSBAND looks over at a knock on the door. He stands, answers it. Creasy slides in, eases the door shut behind him. Gun in hand. \nCREASY I'm not here to hurt you. I need to borrow your house and your car. Are you the proud owners of the Coupe deVille? \nEXT.   JUDICIAL COMPOUND - MORNING \nA military operation as Tazinari is led out to his car. Two heavy gray sedans wait. Tazinari gets in the back of the second car with his AIDE-DE-CAMP. The door is shut behind them. \nMERCEDES \nThe door closes with an hermetic whump. The two cars pull away toward the opening FRONT GATES. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    102. \nINT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY \nCreasy has just finished taping the old couple to two chairs. \nCREASY If you promise to speak softly and not to shout, I won't have to tape your mouths. \nThe old man looks to his wife, then back to Creasy. Nods. \nThe old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a ROCKET LAUNCHER. Next he pulls out a cone-shaped missile. The old man is starting to look curious. \nCREASY Did you know you have a dishonest policeman living in your neighborhood? \nCreasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it back into the tube. \nOLD MAN I know of you. You're the American. The bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper. \nCreasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room. \nOLD MAN In the church, they say to forgive. \nCREASY Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting. \nCreasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows and in a line to the wall with a household Catholic alter. Christ on the cross sits front and center. \nCREASY Do you have an old blanket you don't care about? I don't want to burn that wall. \nINT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY \nA figure rises, framed in the window. \nAnd Pinta stands beside him.   As she puts her fingers in her ears... \nCreasy looks back over his shoulder, but of course she's not there. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      103. \nCreasy fires the rocket launcher. A gout of flame erupts from the back. But Creasy has hung a blanket on the wall. \nINT.   LEAD CAR - DAY \nEyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them. The driver stands on the brakes. The car explodes, is obliterated really, from the inside out. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTazinari's car slams into the debris of the lead car and slides sideways against a wall wedging it in. Real tight. \nCUT TO: \nCREASY \nA 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust. A shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left hand. \nWithout missing  a stride he unloads both barrels into the drivers window.   A scary prospect even though it's bullet- proof. The lit   Molotov explodes beneath the car. Silence. Then a   dull impact explosion. 30 feet of flames envelope  the car. The driver and Tazinari both prisoners inside  their own car. \n", "test3_true": "Tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS UNDERPASS- MEXICO CITY - NIGHT \nThere sits the canary yellow Coupe deVille. Eyes and mouth taped shut, hands and ankles bound by flex-cuffs. Tazinari stands there. \nCreasy steps up, pulls the tape off Tazinari's eyes.     He looks about, relatively calm considering. \nCREASY You know where you are? \nAs Tazinari tries to process... \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     104. \nCREASY Under the bridge. Where the deal went south. Now why don't you tell me what went down? \nCreasy tears the tape off his mouth. \nTAZINARI Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division. \nCREASY And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad. \nTAZINARI Correct! \nCreasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips  it open. As Tazinari reacts, Creasy spins him round,   slits his clothes up from ankle to neck. The cloth drops   away, some hanging at Tazinari's wrists. Tazinari has a   sudden loss of attitude. \nCUT TO: \nClose up: Tazinari hands being cuff flexed and tied to side view mirrors of the Coupe deVille. \nCut back to see Tazinari, naked other than his Calvin Klein skivvies, spread-eagled across the grill of the car, butt forward (Reminiscent of 'the woods scene' in DELIVERANCE) \nCreasy rips down his Calvins. CU of Tazinari's face winces with either pain or extreme discomfort. \nCREASY That's not my dick. That's the barrel of your own gun. Shoved up your own ass. \nAs Tazinari reacts... \nCREASY (CONT'D) .44 Magnum. Now, how's your hearing? \nWe hear the CLICK of the trigger being cocked back. \nTAZINARI Please, don't... \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                  105. \nCREASY It's all up to you, commandante.    Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'. \nCreasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the record button. \nTAZINARI I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky. \nCREASY Lucky how? \nTAZINARI That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement. \nCREASY And? \nTAZINARI And I had my men ready. \nCREASY You stole the drop. \nMORE FLASHES: As we see this happen. POV from opposite side of the bridge. POV from the drop car. See the money drop get ambushed by unknown faces. 'The nephew' gets shot. The kidnapper running the show sounds like Woody Woodpecker, high pitched squeaky voice. \nCREASY (CONT'D) You done it before? \nTazinari doesn't answer.   Creasy gives the Magnum a tweak. \nTAZINARI Yes.   Many times. \nCREASY O.K.   So tell me more. \nTAZINARI There was no ten million dollars. \nCREASY The ransom was ten. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    106. \nTAZINARI Two and a half. That's how much there was. \nCREASY Don't lie to me! \nTAZINARI Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper! \nFLASHBACK:   Tazinari, in his office, sifting through the paper. \nCREASY Maybe your men stole from you. \nTAZINARI No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange. \nCREASY Who gave the bags to Ramos? \nTAZINARI His lawyer.   Jordan Kalfus. \nFLASHBACK: Ramos House. Bags of cash being switched from the Mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd Mercedes in the garage. See that Jordan does the switch, four bags on the floor. \nCUT TO: \nAs Creasy thinks.   Tazinari has been stretched to his limit. \nTAZINARI That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional. \nCREASY That's what everybody keeps saying. \nCreasy switches off the tape recorder and pockets it. \n", "test3_id": 290}

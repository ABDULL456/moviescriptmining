{"test1_input": "EXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY \nCreasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less. \nThe doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in marble. \nINT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY \nPinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy.     She looks out the window, realizes... \nPINTA We're taking a different way home. \nCREASY That's right. \nPinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles. \nPINTA I understand.     Smart. \nNo answer from Creasy.     It's hard not to feel foolish around this kid. \nPINTA Did you like school, Creasy? \nCREASY No. \nPINTA Not at all? \nCREASY No. \nPINTA But why not? \nCreasy's hoping she'll just shut up. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    27. \nPINTA Hmmm? \nCREASY It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna. \nPINTA So you were unhappy? \nCREASY Being unhappy is a state of mind.   I never thought about it. \nPINTA Oh... \nPinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in. She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel. \nThen, as she reaches out... \nPINTA What happened to... \nAnd touches it. \nPINTA ...your hand? \nCreasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an instant. \nCREASY No more questions. \nWhen he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something. \nCREASY I'm not paid to be your friend.   I'm paid to protect you. \nThey drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over. Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering. \nCREASY (exasperated) And don't start crying. \nPINTA I'm not crying. \nBut she is.   As Creasy stops at a red light... \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                      28. \nCREASY Look, this is the way I am.   I don't like questions. I -- \nAnd she's out the door. \nCREASY Shit. \nCreasy shoulders open his door, bolts out. \nINTERSECTION \nCreasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is already getting back in the car. This time in the backseat. \nCreasy sighs. The light goes green.     Scooters whine away and horns blare. \nMERCEDES \nCreasy sits back behind the wheel. \nPINTA You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy. \nCreasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead. As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving. \nINT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nCreasy sits at the table   with the old gardener GOMEZ (we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier exteriors). Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going after any remnants with a   crust of bread. Creasy hasn't touched his. \nMARIA, the cook, enters.    As she clocks Creasy's plate... \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET \n'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very accomplished player. \nCreasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door. \nCREASY Come in. \n", "test1_true": "Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  29. \nLISA Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need. \nCREASY I'm fine. \nLISA Is the food alright?    Maria tells me that you didn't eat. \nCREASY The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat. \nLISA (smiles) It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment? \nHe shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed. \nLISA How are you getting along with Pinta? \nCREASY We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy. \nLISA (smiles) Yes, she told me.   Do you have children, Mr. Creasy? \nCREASY No. \nLISA You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends. \nCREASY You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right? \nA beat and then Lisa nods. \nCREASY Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    30. \nLISA No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that. \nLisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's proximity. \nLISA I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know that's silly to say. \nCreasy doesn't answer, just watches her. \nLISA It makes it all seem so serious. \nCREASY It is serious, Mrs. Ramos. \nLISA Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends. \nFinally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door. Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch. \nINT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her prayer. \nPINTA Give me God what you still have.    Give me what no one else asks for. \nThen, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's \"Blue Bayou\" starts to drift through the open window, down from the room above. \nRONSTADT \"I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou...\" \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHe stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the stereo. The empty bag from the record store. This is the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back- up button. \"Blue Bayou\" begins again. Creasy takes the 9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair... \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    31. \nINT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCreasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No good. \nHe chambers another round.     Tries again.   Nope. \nLINDA RONSTADT Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come true, on Blue Bayou... \nINT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her every move, perplexed. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAs the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round. Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell. Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his actions. Pinta still dances. \nINT.   RAYBURN'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 3.A.M. \nRayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican WIFE and their four-year-old SON. \nAs she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings. Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES there, one of them ringing. Rayburn finds it. \nRAYBURN Rayburn...    Creasy! What's wrong? \nEXT.   RAMOS HOUSE - NIGHT \nCreasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark behind him. On his cell phone. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     32. \nCREASY I said, have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just didn't go off? \nINTERCUT THE FOLLOWING: \nRayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed. \nRAYBURN You mean a misfire? \nCREASY I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer. \n", "test1_id": 288, "test2_input": "Pinta considers this.   Then.. \nPINTA I'm not afraid you, Creasy. \nCREASY I know you're not. \nPINTA Are you afraid of me? \nCreasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding. \nCREASY I used to be.     At first.   But not anymore. \nHer smile is huge. \nPINTA Good. \nEXT.   GARDEN POOL - RAMOS VILLA - DAY \nHeated. Steam rising off the water. PINTA stands with her eyes closed. Creasy, standing beside her, brings TWO BLOCKS together with a WHACK! \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       51. \nPinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head. Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around her. Frank oversees the whole program. \nCREASY The gunshot holds no fear.    Say it. \nPINTA The gunshot holds no fear. \nCREASY You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound. \nEyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face. \nPinta smiles at the sound.     Creasy smiles at the sight. \nEXT.   RAMOS POOL - DAY \nWHACK!   Pinta bolts from the blocks.    SPLASHES. \nWHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Pinta surges.      Pinta arcs.    Pinta knifes into the water. \nPinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line. Creasy checks his watch, claps. \nPINTA I'm tough, Creasy.    I'm tough as you. \nCREASY There's no such thing as tough.    You're either trained or untrained. \nPinta raises her arms overhead, makes like Rocky across the shallow end. Creasy shakes his head in amusement. \nINT.   LISA'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nFirst light is just tracing outlines against the window. Lisa alone in bed, staring at the ceiling. Frightened at what she's feeling. \nCUT TO: \nCREASY \nSleeping, looking sexy. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   52. \nEXT.   COURTYARD - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY \nAs the Mercedes pulls in, another car is ahead of it. Samuel is home, a DRIVER pulls his LUGGAGE from the trunk. \nPinta gets out of the Mercedes. \nPINTA Hi, Dad. \nHe gives her a pat on the head. Simultaneously, Samuel fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. He thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's. \nSAMUEL I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what you did for my wife. \nCreasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past Samuel to Pinta who looks bemused. He doesn't even want to know exactly what she knows. \nThe Car Wash Guy, - Pedro, ingratiates himself with Samuel. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCreasy's finger presses play. \"Blue Bayou\" begins. Plaintive, haunting. As he moves to sit in his chair, he passes the scotch bottle. It has gone unopened. \nHe ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, smoothly catches it on the back of his hand. Rock steady. Frank's tail wags. \nINT.   PINTA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWhere the song drifts down. Pinta smiles, closes her eyes. Now she can go to sleep. \nINT.   LISA & SAMUEL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSamuel makes love to his wife. But Lisa looks past him, through the walls and floors to where that song plays. \nLINDA RONSTADT I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     53. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM -NIGHT \nCU of Creasy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   PARKING LOT - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY \nThe big swim meet. Race day. A lot of security, men speaking into their wrists. For a public gathering the mood almost seems ominous. Creasy and Pinta exit the Mercedes. Pinta watches wistfully as her fellow STUDENTS stream toward the water with their PARENTS. \nPINTA What's so important in Los Angeles? \nCREASY Your father has business. \n", "test2_true": "Creasy shrugs. No comforting answer for her.     He looks around at some of the other bodyguards. \nCREASY Good luck. I'll be waiting here when you're done. \nBut she's shaking her head adamantly.    Determined. \nPINTA You're coming with me. \nEXT.   SWIMMING MEET - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY \nA big MARQUEE has been set up alongside the pool. Coltish girls in swimsuits. Parents socialize, drink cocktails. Richly dressed. Bodyguards and security are outside of it, on the perimeter. \nCreasy looks completely out of place. \nPINTA Stand near the finish line. \nPinta starts away. \nCREASY Pinta. \nShe turns, looks back at him. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     54. \nCREASY The blocks. \nPINTA (smiles; knows) I'm a prisoner in them.    Until the gunshot sets me free. \nCreasy nods. He smiles. He's serious now. As he watches her head off for the track, Sister Anna steps up. \nSISTER ANNA Mr. Creasy, nice to see you. \nAnd now Creasy is completely out of place. \nCREASY (apologetic) Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles.      I was going to wait in the courtyard, but... \nShe takes his arm, pats his hand. \nSISTER ANNA Today you are her father. \nAs Creasy lets this sink   in, looks out where Pinta is warming up. Sister  Anna   smiles, heads off to a group of parents. We're left  with   Creasy. Confused Creasy. But clarity is creeping in.    As the sky opens up around him... \nCUT TO: \nSTARTER'S PISTOL \nPointed up at precisely 45 degrees.    BAAAANGG! \nSTARTING BLOCKS \nEyes closed serenely, Pinta surges forward, leaving everyone behind. \nCREASY \nSees it. She hasn't even hit the water and he already knows she's won. \nPINTA \nSPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface. Her head sweeping left and then right. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   55. \nWherever her competitors are, it's somewhere behind her. And the future, everything ahead, is wide open. \nTURN WALL - UNDERWATER \nPinta somersaults, kicks off and is gone. \nSURFACE \nAnd the finish line seems to come to her. \nTHE CROWD \nCheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall. \nCREASY \nWatches her, satisfied with what he's done. \nPinta hauls herself out of the water and runs. \nA beeline for Creasy. And the poor fucker doesn't even understand, until she's leaping the last few feet... \nInto his arms. \nPINTA I won, Creasy! I won! \nShe loves him...   Creasy hugs her.   He loves her back. \nINT.   TRADITIONAL RESTAURANT - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT \nA MARIACHI BAND roams. We see Creasy but not who he's with. A date? As we come around it's Pinta. Sitting with them, Rayburn and his wife. And a sleeping four- year-old. \nNOTE: Rethink following dialogue with reference to Creasy / Rayburn background. \nPINTA My Dad said all your friends were dead. \nRAYBURN All but one. The most important one. When we were eighteen, we made an agreement to \"take the world\" together. \nCREASY Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan? \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                    56. \nRAYBURN I said the plan was right here. \nRayburn looks at beautiful 19-year-old Alicia and their four-year-old son sleeping. \n", "test2_id": 289, "test3_input": "Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside the bed.

Three men dead. Only ten rounds fired. \nCreasy shakes his head at the next shot. \nMANZANO If two of the men in my division could shoot like that, I could get rid of the other thirty-six. \nOne of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet. Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages. \nCREASY What am I doing here? \nMANZANO Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. (re: book) This page? \nCREASY No. \nThe adjutant reaches the last page.   Creasy shakes his head. \nMANZANO You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long. \nCREASY Am I a suspect? \nMANZANO No.   It would be convenient, but no. \nAs Manzano packs up his mugshot books... \nCREASY Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.

BACK SIDE - VETERINARIAN CLINIC - NIGHT \nAn SUV rolling away. Lights out, engine off. It coasts a hundred yards before the engine turns over. Rayburn behind the wheel. As it sweeps past camera... \nINT.   SUV - ROLLING - NIGHT \nRayburn constantly checking the rear view.   No pursuit in sight. He looks over at Creasy. \nRAYBURN How do you feel? \nCreasy looks over at him, finally shrugs. \nCREASY Stomach's gone. But... okay. \nRAYBURN I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital. \nCreasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy sits up.

Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines' where the policemen fell. A pyre of flowers where Pinta was scooped up, Creasy's blood still staining the sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up... \nRosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the shrine. \nRosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else. \nAcross the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher, surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of Rosanna \nCREASY (FLASHBACK) \nCorolla.   Muzzle flashes.    Pinta screaming... \nFEMALE VOICE Creasy... \nCreasy wheels.   There's Rosanna. \nROSANNA A lot of people are looking for you. \nCREASY I guess that makes you the smart one. \nROSANNA We're interested in the same thing.         I'm writing a story. \nCreasy walks away from her.     Rosanna catches up and holds out a plastic ziploc. \nROSANNA This might interest you.       I found it across the street. \nCreasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand. A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle. Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo. \nFLASH:   Creasy at the police station.      His photo taken. \nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     78. \nROSANNA It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

As he turns to go. \nROSANNA What are you going to do? \nCreasy doesn't answer. \nROSANNA I can help. I have a situation Mr. Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le Hermanidad which protects both high ranking Government officials, corrupt police, and organized crime at a level that is very difficult for me to touch.

Rayburn grinds out another cigarette, mutters to himself. \nINT.   CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN \nBruno lets him in. Nothings been touched.     Creasy retrieves his bullet from his shrine along   with the 'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts    his few possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he    silently crosses out into the hall, heads toward... \nPINTA'S ROOM \nHe stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own.

Then he notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page references her day to day relationship with Creasy. \"I love you Creasy Bear.\" He hears soft footsteps. Creasy turns. \nLisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes drilling through Creasy. \nLISA (softly) You let them take her.     She loved you and you let them take her. \nCreasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him. \nLISA Why are you here?     Why didn't you die? \nCREASY Because...

Underwater slow motion, a wall turn. It looks remarkably like Pinta. \n\"Blue Bayou\" drifts through the air. Soft, in the ether somewhere. Creasy hears it, half raises his head. \nPINTA'S VOICE Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where you're from? \nShe's standing behind him. Wearing the all too familiar one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair. \nCREASY Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta.

Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed. \nCREASY Yes or no? \nRAYBURN (after a beat) I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else?

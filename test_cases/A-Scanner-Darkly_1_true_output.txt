Arctor, Barris, and Luckman are looking under the hood. White smoke drifts from the oil caps. Water fizzles from the overflow spout of the radiator. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN The linkage from the pedal to the carb fell apart. 
BOB ARCTOR Shouldn't this locking ring hold the nut in place? 
JIM BARRIS The idle screw has been turned all the way out. So when the linkage parted, the override went up instead of down. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Could it screw itself all the way out like that accidentally? 
JIM BARRIS No. A special tool would be needed. A couple, in fact. I have the tools to fix this, but back at the house. 
Is Barris saying he did it? Arctor looks over at Barris. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) So we'll have to get to gas station and borrow tools from them. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Hey, man, did this happen by accident or was it done deliberately? Like the cephscope. 
JIM BARRIS (still grinning) It's hard to say. (glances over at Arctor) You should've cut the ignition as soon as you realized what happened. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR For a second I couldn't figure it out. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN (spinning and lashing out with bost fists) MOTHERFUCKER! Somebody did this intentionally! They fucking almost killed us! 
Barris pulls out a snuffbox, removies a few tabs of Death, and swallows them. He passes the snuffbox to Luckman, who takes a few with a shaky hand, then passes the box to Arctor. Arctor hands it back to Barris without taking any. 
BOB ARCTOR (irritably) Maybe this is what's fucking us up, messing up our brains. 
JIM BARRIS Dope can't screw up a carb-idle adjustment, my friend. (holds box out to Arctor) You'd better take at least three of these. They're primo, but mild. 
BOB ARCTOR Put the fucking snuffbox away! 
Barris smiles, puts it away. Arctor tries to focus back on the engine. He sways lightheadedly and supports himself against the car. The hot sun beats down on the back of his head. Cars whiz by, the traffic noises intensified. He hears singing, quiet at first, but soon overwhelming. It's awful, discordant. He looks at Luckman and Barris, silhouetted against the sun. Luckman says something, but Arctor can't make it out over the singing and the traffic noise. An awful smell permeates the air. Arctor sniffs at it. His face contorts. He feels nauseated, shuts his eyes. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN (barely audible above singing) Hey, do you smell something, man?   A clue? Some engine smell that -- 
BOB ARCTOR (eyes suddenly wide) Dog shit! Do you smell dog shit? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ERNIE LUCKMAN (eyeing Arctor) No. (to Barris) Were there any psychedelics in that dope? 
Barris smiles and shakes his head.   Arctor studies the engine, sniffs it. 
BOB ARCTOR It's an illusion, right? There's no dog shit smell. How could there be dog shit in the eng... 
He spots ugly, dark brown stains around the motorblock. 
BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) (freaked) Dog shit! Dog shit! (trying to focus) Oil. Spilled oil. Thrown oil. That's all. Maybe a leaky head gasket. 
Arctor reaches down to touch the dark stain.    His hand jerks back in revulsion. 
BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) Dog shit!   Fuck! It is dog shit! 
Now he looks around the engine and sees it everywhere: all over the block, on the wires, on the fire wall. He looks up, sees it smeared on the soundproofing under the hood. The smell is overwhelming. He lurches away from the car, shuts his eyes, staggers. Luckman grabs Arctor's arm. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Hey, man, you're getting a flashback. 
JIM BARRIS (chuckling) Free theater tickets. 
Luckman guides Arctor to the driver's seat, sits him down. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Now just take it easy. Nobody got killed and now we're warned. It's okay. It's okay. Everything's okay. 
Arctor closes his eyes. 
EXT. KIMBERLY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Kimberly walks, catatonic and terribly bruised. Dan pops up and stabs her repeatedly. She falls onto a big wet pile of dog shit. Barris appears in an apartment window, waving. 
JIM BARRIS Hey, Bob, want a lump of dog shit?   To chew on? 
EXT. ARCTOR'S CAR - DAY 
Arctor opens his eyes fast. Barris, looking on compassionately, squats next to him outside the car. 
BOB ARCTOR What, Jim?   What'd you say? 
Barris begins to laugh and laugh. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN (punches Barris on the back) Leave him alone, man. Fuck off. 
BOB ARCTOR (to Luckman) What did Barris say just now? What the hell exactly did he just say? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN I don't know, man. I can't figure out half the things he lays on people. 
Arctor again looks at Barris.   He is smiling sweetly.

LECTER What's your worst memory of childhood? (she hesitates) Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention. \nCLARICE The death of my father. \nDR. LECTER Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know. \nClarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. She looks past him, hesitating again. \nCLARICE He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him. \nDR. LECTER Killed outright? \nCLARICE No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old. \nDR. LECTER You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life. \nCLARICE Quid pro quo, Doctor. \nDR. LECTER The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one... \nCLARICE (puzzled) Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive. \nDR. LECTER Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that? \nCLARICE No. Tell me why. \nDR. LECTER After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next? (Clarice drops her gaze) I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice. \nCLARICE I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch. \nDR. LECTER A cattle ranch? \nCLARICE Horses - and sheep... \nDR. LECTER How long did you live there? \nCLARICE Two months. \nDR. LECTER Why so briefly? \nCLARICE I - ran away... \nDR. LECTER Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you? \nCLARICE (angrily) No. \nDR. LECTER Did he try to? \nCLARICE No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor. \nDR. LECTER Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect. \nCLARICE You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him. \nDR. LECTER There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected. \nCLARICE On what basis would they reject him? \nDR. LECTER The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual. \nCLARICE How would he test? \nSuddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice take a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tray. \nDR. LECTER That's enough, I think. Happy hunting.

You should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers... \nPULLING BACK \nwe see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths.

Check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records... \nCONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE \nat about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar. \nAs we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming knives... \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence... Possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration... Then go to their personality tests... \nWe pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar...

No pets, no toys, no flowers, no sun... \nWe TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself. As we APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old- fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. A female wig rests near him on a head form. He wears a hairnet and a beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet. \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) His females will be more crudely sketched than him males - but he'll compensate by adding exaggerated adornments... jewelry, big breasts... And his tree drawings - oh, his trees will be frightful... \nNext to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the MUSIC. His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles. As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, the music starting to fade behind us... \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Billy hates his own identity, he always has - and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. But his pathology is a thousand times more savage... He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He will be reborn... \nAt the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette.

Bad news, Hannibal... \nWIDER ANGLE \nshows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell. \nCHILTON (V.O.)

LECTER'S CELL - DAY \nChilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his large stack of private correspondence, and making notations with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops the floor. \nCHILTON Perhaps you should have been less specific about what kind. (to Barney) Stand him by the toilet. Then leave us. \nBarney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies go. Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily. \nCHILTON Such a lot of correspondence! I can hardly wait to analyze it in more detail... But first things first. \nTossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from underneath Clarice's desk. He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. Lecter. \nCHILTON I thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in Migg's death, so I bugged you... Not a word to me in all these years, Hannibal. Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff over here, and you just turn to jelly. It's too pathetic. \nSIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT \nas Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the front of Dr. Lecter's mask. \nCHILTON You still think you're going to walk on some beach, and see the birdies? I don't think so, Hannibal... I called Senator Ruth Martin, and she never heard of any deal with you. She never heard of Clarice Starling, either. They scammed you, Hannibal... \nCLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits. \nCHILTON When Crawford gets through milking you, he's giving you to Baltimore Homicide for the Raspail murder. And they're preparing some special surprises for you right now, in my electroshock room. \nDR. LECTER'S POV (FRAMED BY EYE-SLITS) \nfirst looking at Chilton's moving lips... then LOWERING to his soft, white, inviting throat... \nCHILTON The Starling bitch wants you to rot here, in this little box, till your teeth fall out and you're soiling diapers. You've seen the old ones, Hannibal. They weep when their stewed peaches get cold. That'll be you, too. Unless - you trade with me. \nFAVORING CHILTON \nas he sits chummily on the table. \nCHILTON There never was a deal with Senator Martin - but there is now. I've been on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on your behalf. Here's what you get: if you identify Buffalo Bill, and the girl is found in time, Senator Martin will have you transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee... \nCLOSE AGAIN ON DR. LECTER'S EYES \nas they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly lock onto something. They widen with interest. \nCHILTON (O.S.) The Governor has already agreed. You get books, a view of the woods, and plenty of exercise time... \nDR. LECTER'S POV - EXTREME CLOSEUP \nOn the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under the letters and the rumpled sheet... is Chilton's gold pen. \nCHILTON (O.S.) And best of all, you'd be out of Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The Senator will verify these terms on the phone, and guarantee them in writing... \nBACK ON DR. LECTER \nas he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his eyes towards Chilton. We can almost hear his brain clicking. \nCHILTON (O.S.) In exchange, I get your full cooperation in publishing a professional account of this - my successful interviews with you. You publish nothing. And I get exclusive access to any material from Catherine Martin... So. Do you accept my demands? (pause) Answer me, Hannibal. \nA beat. Dr. Lecter is silent. Chilton sticks his face INTO SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask. He is agitated. \nCHILTON You'll answer me now, or by God, you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide. Who is Buffalo Bill? \nDR.

LECTER (without turning) Good afternoon, Clarice. \nShe stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars. \nCLARICE I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view. \nDR. LECTER How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case? \nCLARICE Nobody sent me. I came on my own. \nHe spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. A coy smile. \nDR. LECTER People will say we're in love. (beat) Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock... \nHe spins again in his chair, playfully. \nMOVING ANGLE - FAVORING CLARICE \nas she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight. \nCLARICE Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this \"William Rubin\", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you? \nDR. LECTER Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying. \nCLARICE I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now. \nDR. LECTER I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is. \nCLARICE Then tell me how. \nDR. LECTER First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek? \nCLARICE He kills w- \nDR.

LECTER What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing? \nCLARICE Anger, social resentment, sexual frus- \nDR. LECTER No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer. \nCLARICE No. We just - \nDR. LECTER No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want? \nCLARICE All right, then tell me how - \nDR. LECTER No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch? \nCLARICE Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll - \nDR. LECTER We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have. \nCLARICE Later, listen, I'll - \nDR. LECTER I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ? \nCLARICE And - one morning I just - ran away... \nShe turns from him. He presses closer, gripping the bars. \nDR. LECTER Not \"just,\" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time? \nCLARICE Early. Still dark. \nDR. LECTER Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it? \nIN FLASHBACK \nThe 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened. She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn.

And I ran away, as fast as I could... \nIN FLASHBACK \na vast Montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the little Clarice, holding a lamb in her arms. \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Where were you going? \nCLARICE (V.O.) I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy... \nThe tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the ground, hunched over in dispair. \nCLARICE (V.O.) I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again... \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) But what became of your lamb?

Beside it, on the table, the pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. The top one is an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice.

Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of metal protrudes from his lips.

Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and pushes it inward. Boyle goes inside with the tray. \nDR. LECTER \nwatches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from him.

{"train": "THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS \n\"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS\" \nby \nTed Tally \nBased on the novel by \nThomas Harris \nFADE IN: \nINT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT) \nA woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads. \nCLOSE ON \nA guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and the door bursts open. \nWITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT \nas she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at the ready in both hands... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nCLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her... \nClarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts. \nCLARICE Freeze! FBI! \nCLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION \nall natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers... \nTHE SUSPECT'S HANDS \nare taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and - \nTHE \"HOSTAGE\" \npulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar in these close quarters, but - \nClarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send - \nTHE \"HOSTAGE\" \npitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal ACTION and SOUND are restored. \nBRIGHAM (O.S.) Okay, people, good exercise... \nClarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten. \nPULLING BACK \nwe see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the \"hotel room\" and its \"corridor\" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex- Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says \"Firearms Instructor / FBI Academy.\" \nBRIGHAM Starling's reaction time was excellent. Let's break. Critique in five. \nA class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. \nClarice nods amiably to the \"Suspect\", then gives her \"Hostage\" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of southern accent. \nARDELIA Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me? \nCLARICE (indicating her gun) Never cock. Just squeeze. \nARDELIA (grins) I love it when you talk dirty. \nAs Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly. \nBRIGHAM What're you laughin' at, Junior G- Man? She got off four rounds to your two. \nHe takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her palm. \nBRIGHAM (continuing) One hundred reps, each hand, every day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief wants to see you. \nHe nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile finally fading, looks out into the auditorium. \nSPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD \nsits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one arm. \nArdelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze. \nCLARICE What'd I do? \nARDELIA Stay cool. Just remember to call him \"God.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY \nCHILTON I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her... \nHe hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton. \nCHILTON The doctors managed to re-set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes. His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he ate her tongue. (pauses, he smiles) I keep him in here. \nHe turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, tranquilizer guns. \nCLARICE (quickly blocking him) Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think? \nCHILTON (annoyed) You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time. \nCLARICE But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company. \nShe holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching. \nCHILTON When she's finished, bring her out. \nHe turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly. \nBARNEY Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the bars? \nCLARICE (shaking his hand) Clarice Starling. Yes, he did. \nBARNEY Okay. Past the others, it's the last cell. Stay to the middle. I put out a chair for you. \nSensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor. \nBARNEY I'm watching. You'll do fine. \nClarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY \nMOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses. \nDARK FIGURE I c-can sssmell your cunt! \nClarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on. \nDR. LECTER'S CELL \nis coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted- down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon. \nClarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears her throat. \nCLARICE Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you? \nDr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice is cultured, soft. \nDR. LECTER Good morning. \nCUTTING BETWEEN THEM \nas Clarice comes a measured distance closer. \nCLARICE Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire. \nDR. LECTER \"We\" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect. \nCLARICE I am, yes. \nDR. LECTER May I see your credentials? \nClarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly. \nDR. LECTER Closer, please... Clo-ser... \nShe complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. Then he smiles, glancing at her card. \nDR. LECTER (continuing) That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you? \nCLARICE I'm - still in training at the Academy. \nDR. LECTER Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? \nCLARICE We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified? \nDR. LECTER Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please. \nShe sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily. \nDR. LECTER Now then. What did Miggs say to you? (she is puzzled) \"Multiple Miggs,\" in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say? \nCLARICE He said - \"I can smell your cunt.\" \nDR. LECTER I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you? \nCLARICE (beat) Yes. \nDR. LECTER It's much better than your shoes. \nCLARICE Maybe they'll catch up. \nDR. LECTER I have no doubt of it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice rushes out the front doors. She is badly shaken, almost stumbling, as she rubs at her face. She looks around for, and finally, with some relief, spots - \nHER CAR \nan old Pinto, parked nearby. This image begins to BLUR... \nCLOSE ON \nher face, fighting tears, as the CAMERA begins to WHIRL AROUND her, almost dizzily. She is seeing, in her mind's eye - \nIN FLASHBACK \na screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to - \nMOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV \na car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. A MAN, Clarice's father, is just climbing out. He's tall, handsome, and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. He grins, seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as... \nTHE YOUNG CLARICE \nrushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to - \nTHE ADULT CLARICE \nalone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. SOUND UPCUT - a steady, rapid series of GUNSHOTS, as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY \nClarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at \nA MOVING TARGET \nThe silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target stops, quite close to her, still swaying. \nClarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S FOREHEAD. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story (\"New Horrors in Cannibal Trial\"), dated 1980. \nClarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees study at nearby tables. \nShe pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, carrying an armful of books. \nARDELIA Phone call, Clarice. It's God. \nCLARICE Thanks, Ardelia. \nMOVING ANGLE \nas Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia past high metal bookstacks. \nARDELIA You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon? \nCLARICE Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face. \nArdelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs. \nARDELIA Damn. Wish I had time for a social life. \nClarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting on the check-out desk, then moves on. Clarice picks it up. \nCLARICE (on phone) Mr. Crawford? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT \nCrawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- lined study of his suburban home. He turns the pages of Clarice's memo as they talk. His tone is sharp. \nCRAWFORD I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out? \nINTERCUTTING \nCLARICE It's all there, sir, practically verbatim. \nCRAWFORD Every word, Starling? Every gesture? \nCLARICE (a bit heatedly) Right down to the kleenex I used. (he is silent) Sir, why? Is something wrong? \nCRAWFORD He mentioned a name, at the very end. \"Mofet...\" Any followup on her? \nCLARICE I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But \"Split City\" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages. (glancing at her notes) It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice. \nShe pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her cleverness. \nCRAWFORD Well? Why aren't you there right now? \nCLARICE Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on - \nCLARICE (beat) Good idea. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK) \nClarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening. As she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal edge of the door. She curses softly, shining her flashlight on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood. \nMR. YOW (O.S.) Okay, Miss Starling? \nCLARICE Okay, Mr. Yow... \nShe shines her light around. In its narrow beam, we see - \nCLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING \nspiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying of loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing... an old upright piano. \nMR. YOW (O.S.) You're playing a piano, Miss Starling? \nCLARICE That wasn't me. \nMR. YOW (O.S.) Oh. \nClarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting clouds of dust make her cough. \nTHE CAR \nis an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS. \nCLARICE \npeers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight. \nHER POV - SHIFTING \nas the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs. \nClarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself. \nCLARICE Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car. \nMR. YOW (O.S.) Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling. \nCLARICE Not yet! - just wait for me. (under the breath) Maybe in about two seconds. \nShe leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends the tip into a hook. \nCLOSE ANGLE \nas she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK. \nClarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her flashlight. \nHER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM \nrevealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head. \nCLARICE \nsighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK loudly. \nONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. \nClarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening bag's drawstring. \nA SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded material slides away. \nClarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart- pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more closely. \nThe head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white. \nCLARICE \nstaring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself. \nCLARICE Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING) \nA loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum. \nMOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard admits her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT) \nOn a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his arms. Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes. \nCLARICE (O.S.) It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor? \nPAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it. \nCLARICE Hester Mofet... \"The rest of me.\" Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT \nCatherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away - \nA MAN \nstanding at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast- high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. \nCatherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man. \nCATHERINE Help you with that? \nMAN Would you? Thanks. \nHis voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, then together they easily lift the chair into the truck. \nMAN (O.S.) Let's slide it up, you mind? \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT \nHe climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats. \nMAN Are you about a size 14? \nCATHERINE (surprised) What? \nSuddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. He bends over her face with the lamp. \nWe hear her shallow BREATHING. \nMAN Good. \nHe peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size tag. \nMAN Good. \nHe carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily. \nMAN Gooood... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nLOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FBI ACADEMY CLASSROOM - QUANTICO - DAY \nCLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric. \nINSTRUCTOR (O.S.) Electron microscopy reveals fiber \"signatures\" that are nearly as distinct as fingerprints... \nClarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. Ardelia is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but straightens, hearing - \nINSTRUCTOR (O.S.) Both of these blouses were worn by victims of Buffalo Bill. They were found in two different states, and four months apart. He always slits them up the back, like a funeral suit... \nON THE SCREEN \nsuccessively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. The cuts match. \nINSTRUCTOR (O.S.) The bunching you see - this compression - is characteristic of scissor cuts, rather than a single blade. And, as you see - Bill always uses the same pair... \nANGLE ON THE DOOR \nas John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in. \nBRIGHAM Clarice Starling! Are you in here? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY \nClarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other trainees. He carries a small canvas bag. \nBRIGHAM Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford. \nCLARICE Where? \nBRIGHAM Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it? \nCLARICE (thinking quickly) I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING) \nBrigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an airstrip. Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend bag. \nBRIGHAM Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient... \nCLARICE Sometimes. \nBRIGHAM He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never. \nBy now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree- lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in the background. They slow, turn. \nCRAWFORD Number Three, I didn't bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics. If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him. And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way I do things. But you do have to keep a cool head. Especially now... Because from here on out, you'll know everything I do. Are we straight on that? \nClarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's likely to get. She stares out the windshield. \nJUST AHEAD OF THEM \nthe highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other police cars, facing a big white frame house. Its sign reads \"Potter Funeral Home.\" Two troopers climb from the car. \nCrawford parks too, then kills the engine. He turns to her, removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file. \nCRAWFORD (softly) You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... You let me know when that happens, Starling. Live right behind your eyes, today. Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy. Just stay open and let him show you... \nOne of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, peers in through Crawford's window. Crawford nods to him, then turns back to Clarice. \nCRAWFORD School's out, Starling. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY \nSOUND of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. She stops, seeing - \nCOUNTRY PEOPLE \nin their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. The music - \"Shall We Gather At The River?\" - is issuing from the open double doors. Several of the mourners glance over at her curiously. \nANGLE ON CLARICE \nstaring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense memory is triggered in her... \nIN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING \nas we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from the flanking pews. The b.g. organ hymn is \"Shall We Gather...?\" \nTHE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE \nin her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons. \nCHILD'S POV \non the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel. \nCRAWFORD (V.O.) Starling...? \nNEW ANGLE (PRESENT DAY) \nas the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford. Like her, he carries a large case. \nCRAWFORD We're around back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY \nA young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter. The dim, cluttered corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle. The MUSIC is closer. Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff. \nCRAWFORD Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... This is Officer Starling. We appreciate your phoning us. \nSHERIFF (grim, unsociable) I didn't call you. That was somebody from the state attorney's office... 'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' find out if this girl's local. It could just be somethin' that outside elements has dumped on us. \nHe casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice. \nCRAWFORD Well sir, that's where we can help. If - \nSHERIFF I don't even know you, Mister... Now we'll extend you ever courtesy, just soon as we can, but for right now - \nCRAWFORD Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects I'd rather discuss just between the two of us. Know what I mean? \nHe indicates Clarice with his eyes. The sheriff hesitates, nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, closing the door behind them. Muffled WORDS from there. \nCLARICE \nburning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who peek at her with shy curiosity. She pulls her blazer a bit tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster. \nANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR \nas, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy. \nSHERIFF Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel. And tell Lamar to come on when he's done playin' that music. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY \nCrawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak loudly. \nCRAWFORD I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can you hear me...? \nHe looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere. \nCLARICE \nis pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, turning up her natural accent by several notches. \nCLARICE Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! Listen here a minute, please. There's things I need to do for her... \nNEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT \nas Clarice looks at Crawford. \nCLARICE I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls... \nCRAWFORD They weren't there. Get close-ups. \nClarice raises her camera, leans in for another FLASH. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY \nClarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of Coke. \nCLARICE Thanks, I'm not thirsty. \nLAMAR No, hold it under your chin, there, and on your temples. Cold'll make you feel better. It does me. \nShe smiles, touched, and takes the can. When Lamar sees Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits beside her; there's a brief silence. She soothes herself with the can. \nCRAWFORD When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it? (she is silent) That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there. \nCLARICE It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters. \nCRAWFORD (beat) Point taken. \nShe looks at him a moment, then offers the can. He opens it. \nCRAWFORD When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit. \nCLARICE I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that? \nCRAWFORD (shakes his head) The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but - \nCLARICE Then have the lab check Raspail's head. (he looks at her) Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon. \nCRAWFORD You seem pretty sure of that. \nCLARICE Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum. \nHe looks at her for a moment, then sips again. \nCRAWFORD Before we caught him, Lecter had a big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. But he traveled all over the country - teaching, consulting... Christ, even testifying in murder trials. Who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it...? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) \nA shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the edge of a deep hole. He holds a little white poodle in his arms, stroking it. This is MR. GUMB, aka \"Buffalo Bill.\" \nMR. GUMB (softly) Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it in gooood... \nCATHERINE MARTIN \nlooks up at him. She is standing on the cement bottom of the pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. The pit is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, from which a thin string rises up to the basement. She's soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle of skin lotion. She struggles to sound calm. \nCATHERINE Mister... my family will pay cash. Whatever ransom you're askin' for, they - \nREVERSE ANGLE - UP TOWARDS MR. GUMB \nMR. GUMB Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose again. \nThe little dog squirms in his arms, BARKING excitedly. \nMR. GUMB Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It will get the hose! \nSIDE ANGLE - AT PIT BOTTOM \nas Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him. \nCATHERINE (under her breath) Oh God... oh God... \nShe unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the lotion onto a palm. She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on. \nCATHERINE Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges, I promise. You've only had me here a couple days, and - \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) No. Just one day... \nCATHERINE Is that all...? See - see, my mom is a real important woman... Well, I guess you already know that. She'll pay you, no questions asked. Whatever cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - she'll see that - \nA sudden blinding glare of light silences her. She looks up, shielding her eyes. \nHER POV \na floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket. \nMR. GUMB Put the bottle in the basket. No funny business, or you'll be sorry... \nNEW ANGLE - CATHERINE \nas the basket stops, and she steadies it. But as she slips the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe of the light. She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to scream, hysterically, again and again. Her outflung hand hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on the concrete walls, all around her - \nBLOODY FINGER TRACKS \ndried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands... \nRODEN Of course it counts. How do you play? \nPILCHER (grins) Officer Starling. Welcome back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ENTOMOLOGY CORRIDOR - DAY \nMOVING ANGLE as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes. Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box. \nRODEN Where the hell did this one come from? It's practically mush. \nCLARICE You really don't want to know. \nPILCHER Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin. \nRODEN I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? (Clarice nods) Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I? \nPILCHER Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LABORATORY - DAY \nVERY CLOSE (MAGNIFICATION) on the sliced cocoon, as Roden uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden chrysalis. \nRODEN (O.S.) The whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it... The wings are just like wet tissue paper... \nTHE TWO MEN \nare hunched over a formica table, peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays. Clarice watches curiously. Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on towel paper. \nPILCHER (without looking up) What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling? \nCLARICE I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher. \nPILCHER Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...? \nCLARICE (smiles) Not lately. But maybe someday. \nHe looks up at her, shyly. A little moment passes between them, before Roden straightens, exultant. \nRODEN Positive match! \nCLARICE You're sure? \nRODEN (points with his dental probe) West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer Starling, meet Mister Acherontia Styx. \nHe moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's specimen. She leans forward, intently. \nHER POV (MAGNIFICATION) \nthe wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull. \nRODEN (O.S.) Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth... \nPILCHER (O.S.) The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that? \nFAVORING CLARICE \nas she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling. \nCLARICE And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies? \nPILCHER (shakes his head) They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs. \nCLARICE (pause, then softly) Dr. Lecter... \nAs the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - the wail of police SIRENS - and... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. U.S. ROUTE 95 - DAY (AERIAL SHOT) \nAn awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway patrol cruisers. \nThe lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - SIRENS going, tires SQUEALING, red flashers... \nCLOSER ANGLE \non a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade. \nCRAWFORD (V.O.) Maybe we can trace how he buys the bugs, starting with U.S. Customs... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING) \nThe van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING. Burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a computer. \nCRAWFORD (O.S.) Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's old lovers. Maybe, someday... \nCLARICE AND CRAWFORD \nsit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention. \nCRAWFORD But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to. \nDR. LECTER Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be \"turns\" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no? (she is silent) Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock... \nShe looks at him. A beat. They are standing uncomfortably close. \nCLARICE Go, Doctor. \nDR. LECTER What's your worst memory of childhood? (she hesitates) Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention. \nCLARICE The death of my father. \nDR. LECTER Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know. \nClarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. She looks past him, hesitating again. \nCLARICE He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him. \nDR. LECTER Killed outright? \nCLARICE No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old. \nDR. LECTER You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life. \nCLARICE Quid pro quo, Doctor. \nDR. LECTER The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one... \nCLARICE (puzzled) Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive. \nDR. LECTER Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that? \nCLARICE No. Tell me why. \nDR. LECTER After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next? (Clarice drops her gaze) I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice. \nCLARICE I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch. \nDR. LECTER A cattle ranch? \nCLARICE Horses - and sheep... \nDR. LECTER How long did you live there? \nCLARICE Two months. \nDR. LECTER Why so briefly? \nCLARICE I - ran away... \nDR. LECTER Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you? \nCLARICE (angrily) No. \nDR. LECTER Did he try to? \nCLARICE No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor. \nDR. LECTER Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect. \nCLARICE You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him. \nDR. LECTER There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected. \nCLARICE On what basis would they reject him? \nDR. LECTER The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual. \nCLARICE How would he test? \nSuddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice take a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tray. \nDR. LECTER That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize? \nCLARICE (shaken) Yes, Doctor. Please. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY \nVERY CLOSE ON a cocoon, split along its back, as a living Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free. Trembling and damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade. \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) You should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers... \nPULLING BACK \nwe see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. They crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings pumping lazily. In the distant background, the incongruous SOUND of show music. \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records... \nCONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE \nat about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar. \nAs we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming knives... \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence... Possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration... Then go to their personality tests... \nWe pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty background. \nCRAWFORD Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away. \nDanielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee. \nDR. DANIELSON (adamantly) Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will. \nCRAWFORD You want to see a violation? This is a violation... \nHe takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it down in front of Danielson. From our angle, we can't see it clearly. \nCRAWFORD Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin. \nDR. DANIELSON That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture. \nBurroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford. \nBURROUGHS Phone, Jack. Director Burke. \nCRAWFORD (snaps) In a minute! \nBurroughs hurriedly retreats. Crawford strains for patience. \nCRAWFORD Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated. \nDR. DANIELSON I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose? \nCRAWFORD Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this. (right in his face, enraged) He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks. \nDR. DANIELSON (pause; stiffly) It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you. \nCRAWFORD Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY \nCrawford is on the scrambler phone. Burroughs watches silently. \nCRAWFORD (on phone; stunned) Transferred...? \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY \nHAYDEN BURKE, the FBI Director, swivels in his big chair. Lean, late 40's, very distinguished. His desk is flanked by flags. \nDIRECTOR BURKE (on phone) Already airborne for Memphis. Senator Martin's meeting him at the airport. (uneasily) Jack - did you make some sort of promise to Lecter, in the Senator's name? \nListening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, very tanned, modish haircut. Krendler is irritable, impatient. \nDIRECTOR BURKE (on phone) We're going to have to talk about this, Jack. The Senator's mad as hell. Paul Krendler's over here from Justice, she's asking him to take charge in Memphis... I know that... But you're still in command of the task force, and Lecter's plane can still be ordered back. It's your call, Jack - but I want it now. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY \nBurroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills him with a hand motion. He is taut, frustrated. Long pause. \nCRAWFORD (into phone) Let him land. \nCUT TO: \nINT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - DOORWAY - DAY \nClarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford. She's just slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster. She's furious. \nCLARICE Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone. \nCRAWFORD Let's get some coffee and talk. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO - DAY \nMOVING ANGLE on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. The surveillance van trails them slowly, radios CRACKLING. \nCLARICE Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you? \nCRAWFORD I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are... (beat) You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it. (he stops, looks at her) Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me. \nCLARICE If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home. \nHe looks at her steadily, then nods. They walk on. \nCLARICE Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before. \nCRAWFORD Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip. \nShe smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's quit. \nCLARICE I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell? \nCRAWFORD Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio. (he crumples his cup, tosses it) Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours. \nCLARICE (hesitates) Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter? \nCRAWFORD (grimly) They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention... \nMURRAY Every cop in Tennessee wants a look at this guy. 'Sit true what they're sayin' - he's some kinda vampire? \nCLARICE (beat) I don't have a name for what he is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - 5TH FLOOR \nPembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the unrolled pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. \nPEMBRY You know the rules, ma'am? \nCLARICE Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned him before. \nHe waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now. \nMOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE \nas she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. A massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; Officer Boyle sits facing its barred door. He rises, nods, moving away to allow her privacy. \nINSIDE THE CAGE \na cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. Dr. Lecter sits at the table, his back to her, studying the Buffalo Bill case file. He now wears a green prison jumpsuit. A small cassette player is chained to the steel table. \nDR. LECTER (without turning) Good afternoon, Clarice. \nShe stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars. \nCLARICE I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view. \nDR. LECTER How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case? \nCLARICE Nobody sent me. I came on my own. \nHe spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. A coy smile. \nDR. LECTER People will say we're in love. (beat) Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock... \nHe spins again in his chair, playfully. \nMOVING ANGLE - FAVORING CLARICE \nas she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight. \nCLARICE Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this \"William Rubin\", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you? \nDR. LECTER Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying. \nCLARICE I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now. \nDR. LECTER I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is. \nCLARICE Then tell me how. \nDR. LECTER First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek? \nCLARICE He kills w- \nDR. LECTER (sharply, as he stops) No! That's incidental. \nCLOSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT as he rises, pained by her ignorance, and crosses to the bars. \nDR. LECTER What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing? \nCLARICE Anger, social resentment, sexual frus- \nDR. LECTER No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer. \nCLARICE No. We just - \nDR. LECTER No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want? \nCLARICE All right, then tell me how - \nDR. LECTER No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch? \nCLARICE Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll - \nDR. LECTER We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have. \nCLARICE Later, listen, I'll - \nDR. LECTER I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ? \nCLARICE And - one morning I just - ran away... \nShe turns from him. He presses closer, gripping the bars. \nDR. LECTER Not \"just,\" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time? \nCLARICE Early. Still dark. \nDR. LECTER Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it? \nIN FLASHBACK \nThe 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened. She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn. Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside. \nClarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment. \nDR. LECTER Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming? \nCLARICE (moving closer to the bars) Yes. I'll tell you. \nDR. LECTER Promise...? (she nods. He smiles) Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore. \nHe holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. She hesitates, then reaches to take it. \nVERY CLOSE ANGLE - SLOW MOTION \nas the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, and lingers there, just for a moment. \nDR. LECTER'S EYES \nwiden, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave. \nDR. LECTER Good-bye, Clarice. \nCLARICE \nhugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as the men crowd in on her, pushing her away. \nHER POV - MOVING \nas Dr. Lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GARMENT SWEATSHOP - DAY \nMOVING ANGLE - MR. GUMB'S POV as he pushes a rolling rack of completed leather garments, each wrapped in plastic, down as aisle. SOUND of many sewing machines, all clattering at once, as he passes row on row of work tables. The seamstresses, mostly black or Hispanic, glance up as he passes, then quickly avert their eyes, his presence disturbing them in some nameless way. \nA thin FOREMAN in a flowery shirt, sees him approaching. He rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully, as the rack rolls to a stop. \nFOREMAN Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And what have you brought us today? \nHe seizes one of the dangling jackets, pulling up the plastic wrapper. He examines it, stroking the sleeve. \nFOREMAN Oh, marvelous... You know, I always say you're the Leonardo of leather. \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) (a harsh whisper) Oil. \nFOREMAN Pardon...? \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) You're leaving oil on the skin. \nThe foreman quickly releases the jacket. \nFOREMAN Of course... You'll be wanting your - \nMr. Gumb's hand reaches INTO SHOT, snatching an envelope from him. The foreman is watching him walk away, as a seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments. The foreman is vaguely troubled, but shakes it off. He strokes the jacket again, admiringly. \nFOREMAN (to seamstress) I wish we had a dozen like him... \nSOUND UPCUT - Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg Variations... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - LOUNGE AREA - DUSK \nClarice, in a line of other passengers, is moving slowly towards a departure ramp. Through a huge plate glass window, we can see her plane. She glances back over her shoulder at \nA pair of UNIFORMED COPS brawny and impassive, their arms folded, waiting to make sure she board the flight. \nClarice sighs, turning wearily back towards the jetway. The BACH CONTINUES, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHELBY CO. COURTHOUSE - HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - \nNIGHT \nCLOSE ON a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried by Pembry, as he approaches Dr. Lecter's cell. \nPEMBRY (shouts) Ready when you are, Doc! \nIN THE CELL \nthe BACH is issuing from the cassette player. Beside it, on the table, the pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. The top one is an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice. Beyond the table, we see Lecter's shadowy form, seated behind the paper screen. He calls out from there. \nDR. LECTER (O.S.) Just another minute, please! \nPembry grunts, sets the tray down. Boyle joins him, handing him a riot baton and a Mace cannister, which Pembry fastens to belt clips. Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring of keys. \nPEMBRY Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for dinner, extra rare. \nBOYLE (laughs) What you reckon he'll want for breakfast - some fuckin' thing from the zoo? \nINSIDE THE SCREEN \nDr. Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in his cheek. Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of metal protrudes from his lips. He plucks it out, opens his eyes. \nIN EXTREME CLOSEUP \nhe is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar at one end, a square edge at the other. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT \nA small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, from both sides. Tate crouches next to the SWAT COMMANDER. \nSWAT COMMANDER (into radio mike) We're coming into the car, we're opening the hatch. Watch his hands. Any fire will come from us. Affirm? \nPETERSON'S VOICE Got it. \nThe SWAT commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks at Tate. A long, tense moment. Then he waves a signal. \nMOVING ANGLE \nas we follow a picked team of four SWAT cops, in full body armor, rushing into the elevator car. Two men move to the corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. A third man sets a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch. \nCLOSE ON \n...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught at the waist. We see the back of the head. \nSGT. TATE \nshoulders through the SWAT cops for a closer look. He turns towards the SWAT commander, astonished. \nSGT. TATE That's Pembry! \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMS AMBULANCE - MOVING \nIn the rear chamber, a young EMS ATTENDANT is braced against the vehicle's sway. Behind him, the stretchered form of his patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver. SOUND of the siren. \nATTENDANT (into radio mike) He's comatose, but his vital signs are good. Pressure's 130 over 90... Yeah, 90! Pulse 85... \nBehind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure sits slowly upright... \nATTENDANT His convulsions have stopped, but he's got so much loose skin on his face, it's hard to tell if - \nSuddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING. He turns, puzzled... \nTHE POCKETKNIFE BLADE \nin Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIX-LANE FREEWAY - NIGHT (ARC LIGHTS) \nMOVING ANGLE on the EMS ambulance, as it races along normally, its SIREN blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make way for it. \nThen suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways. Cars swerve to avoid hitting it, HONKING angrily... \nCLOSER ANGLE \non the stopped ambulance. After a long, still moment, the wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop. Then the SIREN is shut OFF, and the flashers. The ambulance starts rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing speed. We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - and we LINGER on... \nBIG GREEN INTERSTATE SIGN \n...that reads \"Memphis International Airport / 2 miles.\" \nCLOSE ANGLE - THROUGH AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD \nDr. Lecter's face is slowly REVEALED, as he wipes across it with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MONTANA PLAIN - DUSK - (IN FLASHBACK) \nMOVING ANGLE, rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, over waving grasses... a long passage... before we come at last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in despair. She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from us. Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - NIGHT - BRIGHT MOONLIGHT \nMOVING ANGLE, very rapid, down this road... coming at last to a stopped highway patrol car. Clarice, with her lamb, is standing in the car's headlights. She starts wearily towards the sheriff... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RANCH BARNYARD - NEAR DAWN \nCRANE ANGLE - sweeping rapidly DOWN into the barnyard towards the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops... RUSHING to the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb. \nThe dark figure of the rancher ENTERS FRAME. As he roughly takes the lamb from her, we HOLD on a CLOSEUP of her face - stunned, blank. She EXITS FRAME... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARN - NIGHT \nMOVING ANGLE - CLARICE'S POV as she walks towards the open barn doorway... It looms CLOSER... The rancher is revealed, a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table. His knife hand sweeps up high, then holds... He turns TO CAMERA, his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr. Lecter. He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI DORM - PAY PHONE IN HALLWAY - NIGHT \nMOVING ANGLE - coming in very CLOSE on the adult Clarice's face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the dangling receiver... \nCUT TO: \nCRAWFORD Who the hell's fault is - \nKRENDLER - a U.S. Senator who's half out of her head because her daughter's going to be murdered today! And all because of your mind games with fucking Lecter! \nCRAWFORD If you hadn't interfered, he'd still be in custody in Baltimore! \nBURKE Jack - \nKRENDLER You sent in a green recruit, with a phony goddamn offer - \nCRAWFORD You're just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape! \nBURKE THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you... \nA long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice. \nBURKE (very reluctantly) Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. You're suspended from the Academy. (Crawford starts to interrupt) Not another word! (to Clarice) This is pending a reevaluation of your fitness for the service. I promise you'll get a fair hearing. (pause) Jack... you're ordered to take compassionate leave. You'll spend the rest of the day briefing the AG's office, then transfer command of the task force, effective by 1800 hours. (beat) I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take care of Bella. \nClarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY \nClarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other. \nCLARICE All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. (beat) I have to go to Belvedere. \nCRAWFORD You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore. \nCLARICE You do until six p.m. \nHe stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, defeated, old beyond his years. \nCRAWFORD Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals. \nCLARICE But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me! \nCRAWFORD I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now. \nCLARICE But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to. \nCRAWFORD With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony. \nCLARICE He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it... \nHe stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it. \nCRAWFORD (pulls out his wallet) There's about $300 here... And a hotline code number. They'll patch you through to me, wherever I am. \nShe raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card. \nCLARICE Thank you. \nHe watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van. \nSOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) \nCLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in background. \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) (calling out) Preeeeecious...! \nCLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult moths flutter out. \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) Precious, come on Precious! Busy busy day today... \nCLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives. \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful! \nCLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice. \nMR. GUMB (O.S.) You come here this minute, you little scamp! \nLOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. Genuinely scared. \nMR. GUMB Precious...? \nLOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING \nTowards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows. \nMR. GUMB Sweetheart...? \nFrom the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice. \nCATHERINE (O.S.) She'd down here you sack of shit. \nMr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with a series of YIPS. \nUPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM \nas Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge. \nshe and the cat stares back at their own reflection... \nCUT TO: \nCLARICE \nsitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school yearbook. The cat is curled on her lap... \nCUT TO: \nCLARICE \nkneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs and singles. The cat has wandered off... \nCUT TO: \nCLARICE \npulling a string to light up the closet. She is surprised and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from the rod. A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer look. \nTHE DRESS \nis very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back. \nFAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE \nas Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind. \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see... \nShe turns, looks again at the unfinished dress. Suddenly she straightens, her attention riveted by something... \nCLARICE'S POV \nOn the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined dress, are two bold black triangles. We RUSH CLOSER to there shapes, before jumping back to - \nCLARICE \nwho stares at them, starting to tremble. \nDR. LECTER (V.O.) Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one... \nIN FLASHBACK \nthose missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in the funeral home in West Virginia... \nCLOSE ON CLARICE \nas she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy. \nCLARICE Sewing darts. You bastard. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BIMMEL PARLOR - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY \nClarice paces, in an exuberant rush, amidst the worn furniture. \nCLARICE (into phone) He's making himself a \"woman suit,\" Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor - \nCRAWFORD (V.O.) Starling - \nCLARICE That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that - \nCRAWFORD (V.O.) Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now. \nCLARICE (pause; surprised) Where? \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI TURBOJET - FLYING - DAY \nCrawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, in headphones, by his side. This forward section of the cabin is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and WHIRRING. Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing. \nCRAWFORD (into speaker phone) Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll be on the ground in 45 minutes with the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in charge, Starling. He's mine. \nINTERCUTTING \nas Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt. \nCLARICE (on phone) Sir, that's great news. But how - \nCRAWFORD Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries. (takes a paper from Burroughs) Subject's name is \"Jamie Gumb,\" AKA \"John Grant.\" Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name. \nINSIDE THE JET - MOVING ANGLE \nfrom the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly PASS the twelve-man HRT. They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades... \nCRAWFORD (O.S.) This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade... \nINTERCUTTING \nCLARICE Sewing... \nCRAWFORD Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was \"John Grant.\" Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other. \nCLARICE (eagerly) Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in - \nAn HRT cop, prone beneath a hedge, is joined by a 2nd HRT Cop, who throws himself to the grass beside him. They both take aim with their scoped rifles at - \nTELEPHOTO ANGLE (WITH RIFLE CROSSHAIRS) \nThe front door of a big, nearby, split-level house... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) \nCLOSE ON a fuse box, as Mr. Gumb reaches in, flips a switch. The lights go out. SOUND of a second switch, and the cellar is bathed in a green glow... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - DAY \nA little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of - \nA MEMBER OF THE HRT \ncrouched by his garage, armed to the teeth. As the little boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, covering his mouth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) \nMr. Gumb, in his kimono and goggles, creeps silently through his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past him in the eerie light... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET IN CALUMENT CITY - DAY \nA florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street and stops at the curb in front of the split-level. The driver, in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of the van, and slides it open. He leans in, comes out with a long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards the house... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) \nMR. GUMB'S POV - MOVING ANGLE on the top of the oubliette, a glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and closer... and then Catherine comes INTO VIEW, at the bottom of the pit. She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness. Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep. The futon is up to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head and neck. \nMR. GUMB \nLooking down at her, smiles... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - SUSPECT'S HOUSE - DAY \nMOVING ANGLE on the \"deliveryman,\" seen from behind, as he mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch. Tucked into the small of his back if a 9 mm. automatic. \nCRAWFORD AND BURROUGHS \nhave slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, with drawn guns, watching tensely as - \nTHE \"DELIVERYMAN\" \nsettles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches out with his right hand towards the buzzer... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) \nSlowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees - \nDUSTY BLACK METAL BOX \nthe extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, off screen, as - \nMR. GUMB \nraises his gun again, spinning back towards - \nHIS POV - THE PIT BOTTOM \nwhere Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly yanks the futon over both herself and the dog. Instantly the two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass. \nMR. GUMB \nbites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY \nThe door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling. \nCLARICE Good afternoon... I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family? \nMr. Gumb frowns out at Clarice. For the first time ever, we get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face. \nMR. GUMB They don't live here anymore. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FRONT DOOR OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY \nThe \"deliveryman\" yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the floral box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, blowing it through as - \ncenters her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something lower down catches her eye. \nShe leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at first, that she's seeing - \nFEMALE HAND AND WRIST \nsticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish and a dainty wristwatch. As - \nCLARICE \nis reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance. Clarice stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches the door frame... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S WORKROOM - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) \nClarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes. She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past - \nMR. GUMB \nwho has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his gun in both hands, aiming... \nCLOSE ON \nthe Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and - \nCLARICE \nspins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her gun muzzle, as we see - \nTHE TWO FIGURES \nalmost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly - \nCLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE - \nwith NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps eight feet away... \nMOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE \nas she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him. \nOVERHEAD ANGLE \ndown at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers on their pillow. Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto - \nA DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH - \nperched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping slowly. \nSOUND UPCUT - wailing SIRENS, many excited VOICES, as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MR. GUMB'S HOUSE - DUSK \nThe front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a glare of TV lights, police and ambulance flashers. Cars and vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, EMS workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective barricades. The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as \nCLARICE \ndazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney. \nThey are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at once, pulling her sleeve. She tries to fight free of them, desperate for a familiar face. \nAN OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL CAR \npulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat. He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, stopping when he sees Clarice. \nTHEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER \nfor a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any words. And then he does. \nCRAWFORD Starling... your father sees you. \nAnd then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely. HOLD ON them for a long beat. \nDIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) Congratulations! You are now officers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GROUNDS OF THE FBI ACADEMY - WEEKS LATER - DAY \nThe forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then turn happily to wave to their audience, as APPLAUSE mounts. Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands behind his podium. \nCLARICE AND ARDELIA \nlook at one another solemnly. Ardelia holds up both fists, in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own. She is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin scar on her cheek almost healed. Ardelia turns, waving towards the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere. She turns, searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she locates \nCRAWFORD \nwho smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little salute. \nCLARICE \ngrins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to wave towards the crowd with the others. \nMOVING ANGLE \n", "test1_input": "CATHERINE Get my legs round your neck, you goddamn creep, I'll send you home to Jesus... \nHER FINGERS \nare tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it meets the string. The other end of the string is tied to her wrist. \nSHE STANDS \ngathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement floor. \nCATHERINE Okay, Precious. Time for a treat... \nShe hurls the bucket upwards. \nAT THE LIP OF THE OUBLIETTE \nthe bucket sails out, bounces LOUDLY, then falls back inside. \nANGLE ON THE DOG, PRECIOUS \nwho is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. She cocks an ear, making a low GROWL, then sets off to investigate. \nDOWN IN THE PIT \nCatherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast. \nTHE BUCKET LANDS \ntwo feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops. \nPRECIOUS TROTS UP \nthen pauses, staring curiously towards... \nVERY LOW ANGLE (DOG'S POV) \nthe enticing chicken bone, six feet away. It twitches as Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards the pit. \nPrecious with her tail wagging, BARKS - greedy but suspicious. \nCATHERINE \nstaring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string. \nCATHERINE (softly) Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice yummy bone... c'mon, you little shit... \nPRECIOUS \nedges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth. She tries to run away with it, but Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like a hooked fish. Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop. \nCATHERINE \nstares desperately, unable to see how she's doing. \nCATHERINE Hang on, boy... hang on... \nPRECIOUS \nstill fights for the bone, GROWLING, as the bucket rocks precariously on the edge of the pit. A long, seesaw battle... until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go. The bucket flops over the edge. \nCATHERINE \ncrouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her. \nCATHERINE Nooooo...! \nTHE LITTLE DOG \nfurious, BARKS down at her, then trots away in disgust. \nCLOSE ON CATHERINE \nas she sinks to the cold cement. She slaps aside the foil tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON a framed photo of Sen. Martin and Catherine, held in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands. Powdered fingerprints on the glass. \nClarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at - \nA young STATE TROOPER sitting in Catherine's easy chair. He smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper. He also wears gloves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN \nClarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around. \nA big REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER has been set up on the breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone. Two new red phones are hooked up as well. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM \nClarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks inside. She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions. \n", "test1_true": "INT. ATTIC CRAWL-SPACE \nA ceiling hatch bangs open, sending up dust clouds. Clarice, lit from underneath, pokes her head through, looking around. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM \nFlat on her back, Clarice wriggles out from under Catherine's bed. She sits up, brushing dust from her face and hair. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM \nCLOSE ON an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a bureau, as Clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry. \nClarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure suddenly looms INTO SHOT, giving her a bad start; she cries out softly. \nSenator Martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously. \nSEN. MARTIN Who are you, please? I thought the police were through in here. \nCLARICE I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI. \nSEN. MARTIN (softly, very angry) Clarice Starling... (calls out) Paul? Would you come in here, please...? \nKrendler enters from the hallway, looks at Clarice. \nSEN. MARTIN Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul, this is the trainee that Jack Crawford sent to Lecter... She lied to him, pretending to have my authority, and thus jeopardized this entire investigation. Now she has the further gall to invade my daughter's privacy, again without permission. If her little games have killed my baby... \nOvercome, she hurries from the room. Krendler shuts the door behind her, points sternly at Clarice. \nKRENDLER You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico. \nCLARICE Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me - \nKRENDLER Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it. \nCLARICE (stubbornly) I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico. \nKRENDLER Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes. \nClarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back. \nCLARICE Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just - \nKRENDLER Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill. \nClarice reacts, surprised. Krendler takes a folded computer sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. She takes it, reads. \nKRENDLER He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer. \nCLARICE Sir, doesn't this \"William Rubin\" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague? \nKrendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger. \nKRENDLER Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself? \nCLARICE Yes sir. I can find it by myself. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHELBY COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY \nThe old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with an armada of police cruisers parked at the curb. \nClarice climbs from her rented car, SLAMMING the door angrily. Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr. Lecter's drawings - she starts determinedly up the steps. A nearby commotion makes her pause. \nDr. Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-cams, is preening grandly. \nClarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps and inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY \nSGT. TATE, a Memphis policeman, is studying Clarice's ID. He looks up at her from his command desk, a bit doubtfully. \nSGT. TATE Are you with Mr. Krendler's people? \nCLARICE I just left him. \nSGT. TATE Access to Lecter is strictly limited. We've been getting death threats. (hesitates again) Log in, and check your weapon. \nHe picks up a phone, murmurs into it. As he does so, Clarice glances around this main ground floor lobby. \nHER POV \nThe building looks like an armed fort. Cops with shotguns guard the front door, both ends of the hall, the foot of the stairs, the single elevator. More of them are coming and going. \nMURRAY (V.O.) Shoot, we haven't had this kinda security since the President came through town... \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Another cop, JACOBS, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in the lobby. \nSGT. TATE What is this shit...? Did somebody go up to five? (Jacobs shakes his head) Call Pembry, ask him what - \nA GUNSHOT, and then, moments later, TWO MORE quick ones, echo down the nearby stairwell. Sgt.

Outside posts look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly shit. \nTHE BRONZE ARROW \nhas begun to descend. Down to 4, then past 4... \nBACK ON SGT. TATE \nas he reacts. The other cops, behind him, are now in a full uproar, shouting, pulling out guns. \nSGT. TATE (to the others) SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up on your outside posts. Bobby, get the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover that fucking elevator if it comes all the way to - \nA COP (O.S.) It stopped! \nTHE BRONZE ARROW \nhas, indeed, frozen at 3. Sgt. Tate lifts the microphone again. \nSGT. TATE (into mike) Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance, double quick. We're going up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT) \nHIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a ghostly echo in here... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT) \nA thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator door. We can't see inside. The MUSIC sounds closer. \nSGT. TATE \napproaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the various office doors - all locked - as they creep up. \nMOVING ANGLE - OVER TATE'S SHOULDER \nas he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away. \nSGT. TATE (shouts at ceiling) Pembry? Boyle...? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT (BRIGHTLY LIT) \nANGLE on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on the frosted glass. The Bach is VERY LOUD. \nAfter a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. They all freeze, staring in utter horror. \nSGT. TATE Oh no... no... \nTHEIR POV \nis a brief snapshot from hell. The two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife. Blood and gore everywhere. The faces are unrecognizable. \nSGT. TATE \nstruggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around him, into the room. He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt. \nSGT. TATE (into mike) Command post... Two offi- (a beat; clears his throat) Two officers down. Prisoner is missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing... He's stripped the bed, might be making a rope, check all windows. Where the fuck is my ambulance? \nIN THE CELL \na cop angrily punches OFF the music. Jacobs kneels with his fingers on Boyle's neck. \nJACOBS Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's gone... \nAT THE OTHER BODY \na cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. Murray, the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the gory face. A bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage GROANS, very softly. \nMURRAY This one's alive! \nTate crosses, kneels to see for himself. Murray looks green. \nSGT. TATE Take ahold of him where he can feel your hands, son. Talk to him. \nMURRAY What's his name, Sarge? \nSGT. TATE It's Pembry, now talk to him, God dammit. (into radio, looking around) Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad. Lecter is missing and armed - he took Boyle's gun... \nThe other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds up one finger to Tate. \nSGT. TATE (into radio) Pembry got off one round - there's a chance Lecter was hit. We heard a total of three shots fired, so he's got four left... He's got a knife, too. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF COURTHOUSE - NIGHT \nVARIOUS ANGLES on a floodlit scene of barely controlled pandemonium. Flashing red lights, men shouting commands, SIRENS in the distance. SWAT members, in full gear, leap from a black van... fan out... swarm up the steps... EMS orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance... Cops kneel for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the windows... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT \nA trio of EMS orderlies work fast over the body, already strapped on its gurney. They bandage a big plastic airway into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at the neck. Young Murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody fist. \nMURRAY You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' good, buddy, you're gonna make it... \nOne orderly massages the heart. Another is popping a plasma bag, ready to insert the needle, when the body starts convulsing. \nORDERLY Downstairs - let's go! \nQuickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, SWAT men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the ready... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE ELEVATOR - DESCENDING - NIGHT \nSgt. Tate, riding down with Jacobs, has his radio out. \nSGT. TATE (into mike) Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the elevator, bringing it down. Pembry and Boyle are both cleared, top three floors secured, main stairwell secured. He's somewhere on - \nA spot of blood falls on his cheek. He and Jacobs stare at each other. Another spot hits his shoulder. They look up. \nTHEIR POV \nBlood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch. \nSgt. Tate motions for silence, as both men draw their guns. \nSGT. TATE (into mike) Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir... That's all for now, over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT \nThe elevator doors open, and Tate and Jacobs hurry out, stepping quickly to the side. Tate reaches back in and - \nCLOSE ANGLE \nLocks the elevator into position, with its doors open. \nOTHER COPS are rushing up to them, curious, as Tate frantically pushes them aside, gesturing for silence. \nSGT. TATE (whispers) He's on the roof of the elevator! \nCUT TO: \nINT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTwo SWAT officers, PETERSON and KUBELL, turn a key, unlocking and opening this floor's elevator doorway. The shaft is dark. Lying prone, they inch up to the edge, Peterson extends a mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft. \nIN THE MIRROR (DISTORTED BY THE ANGLE) \nIs a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on his stomach, atop the elevator. A shiny revolver is near one hand. \nPETERSON \nwhispers into a radio, as Kubell carefully tips an assault rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge. \nPETERSON I see him... There's a weapon by his hand. He's not moving... \nRADIO VOICE Can you get the drop? \nPETERSON We got the drop. \nRADIO VOICE One warning. Then take him out. \nPeterson nods to Kubell, who switches ON the flashlight, as Peterson shouts down the shaft. \nPETERSON Quinn!! put your hands on your head!! \nIN THE MIRROR \nthe green figure shows no movement. \nANGLE ON THE COPS AGAIN \nas Peterson mutters to Kubell. \nPETERSON Put one in his leg. \nVERY CLOSE ON \nThe figure below, as Kubell's gunshot ROARS, echoing hugely in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg. The figure doesn't stir. \nPETERSON \nstaring down the shaft, raises his mike again. \nPETERSON No movement. \nRADIO VOICE Okay, Johnny, hold your fire... \n", "test2_id": 2056, "test3_input": "MR. GUMB Do you have his description yet, or some fingerprints...? \nCLARICE \nunaware, is still glancing around the room. For several agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm. \nCLARICE No... no, we don't. \nVery carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, lowers the bag to the floor. With her fingertips she brushes back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape. \nMR. GUMB \nturns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business card. \nMR. GUMB Ahhh. Here's that number. \nCLARICE \nkeeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart. \nCLARICE Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you have a phone I can use? \nMR. GUMB \nis about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open. \nHER EYES \nare unmoving, locked on his. \nHIS EYES \nstare back at her, widen. And they know each other. \nMR. GUMB (softly) In the kitchen. I'll show you. \nCLARICE \nwhips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands. \nCLARICE Freeze! \nMR. GUMB \nslowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her. \nCLARICE \ntries to force more authority into her voice. \nCLARICE Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under arrest. Down on the floor, hands and legs spread, move it. \nMR. GUMB \nturns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen. \nCLARICE \nhesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - and then it's too late. \nCLARICE Shit! \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S KITCHEN - DAY \nClarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun. \nHER POV - MOVING \nThe kitchen is empty. To one side, a door still shuddering on its hinges... \nCLARICE \nrushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming her gun down - \nAN EMPTY STAIRWELL \nbrightly lit, leading to the cellar. Two doors facing the bottom, both open. No sign of Mr. Gumb. \nCLARICE \nhates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: she is very scared, but suddenly hears - \nThe distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there in that killing maze. \nCLARICE \nrushes through the doorway, and down the stairs. \nBEHIND HER, ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER there's an empty space; the Colt Python is gone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY \nMOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE - hurrying down the steps. More SCREAMS; they seem to be coming from the left door. Clarice goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over- head, naked bulbs. The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; Mr. Gumb has switched off his infra-red system. Clarice comes to a T-shaped intersection, stops. Another SCREAM, again to her left, and the BARKING of a dog... \n", "test3_true": "follows her gun around the corner, looking right. \nEMPTY PASSAGEWAY \nbut doors opening off it - he could be lurking behind any of them. She looks left... sees an opening onto some kind of chamber. The noises are LOUDER, coming from there. \nCLARICE \nmoves cautiously towards this chamber... \nCUT TO: \nINT. OUBLIETTE CHAMBER - DAY (DIMLY LIT) \nClarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling... \nHER POV - MOVING \nthe open top of the pit... beyond it, the other two doorways, opening onto this room - Jesus, he could come through either one of them, or come up behind her... She moves to the pit, looks down, very briefly, sees Catherine SCREAMING, hysterical, and a little white dog BARKING... \nCLARICE \nkneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing there? \nCLARICE FBI, Catherine, you're safe. \nCATHERINE Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT! \nCLARICE You're all right! Where is he? \nCATHERINE Get me out! \nCLARICE I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up. (still swivelling) Is there a ladder? Is there a rope? \nCATHERINE I don't know! Get me out!! \nCLARICE Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but - \nCATHERINE NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU \nCLARICE Shut UP! (then, louder) The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now! \nIgnoring Catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it quickly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW PASSAGEWAY - DAY (DIMLY LIT) \nCLARICE'S POV - MOVING down this passageway, towards a new room... pausing at the doorway, straining to hear... no sound except Catherine's CRYING, not in the background, and Clarice's own RAPID BREATHING. Then she crouches - \nLOWER ANGLE - bursts forward, through the doorframe, sidestepping... \nCUT TO: \nINT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT) \nClarice weaves back and forth, half-crouched, gun out, back to the wall. Her face glistens with sweat, as she takes in... \nHER POV - MOVING NERVOUSLY \nMr. Gumb's sewing machine... his swivel chair... the old Victrola... Big moths are crashing into the light bulbs, overhead; they're everywhere. Suddenly, from just behind her, a CLICK and a HUM, and - \nCLARICE \nspins, almost shoots, before seeing - \nA SMALL REFRIGERATOR \nwith its thermostat just switching ON. \nCLARICE \ngasps for breath, fighting for calm. She turns again, slashing her free hand at the moths, moving quickly on... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SKINNING ROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT) \nClarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now... then quickly past the huge Chinese armoire, ready to shoot into it. Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several padded hangers... She moves on, past the big sink, with its DRIPPING faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... the rows of chemical jars. At the end of this room is \nA CLOSED DOOR \nClarice starts to open it, then hesitates. Looking around, she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, sealing off this section of the cellar. With her back thus defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT) \nPassing again through the workroom, Clarice pauses, seeing a half-curtained door, to one side, that she had previously skirted. She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob. She twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun inside, all in one quick move... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY (BRIGHTLY LIT) \nAn old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a big, free-standing tub. An opaque shower curtain, suspended from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside. \nCLARICE \n", "test3_id": 2057}

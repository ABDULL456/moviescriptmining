EXT. WALLY'S CAR - BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
They come out of the woods, walking toward the car, Candy leading. We hear Candy talking just before we see her and Homer. 
CANDY (increasingly upset) *Nobody* volunteers for the Burma run--he said so himself. And nobody knows *me* better than him! So how am I supposed to feel? He's a bomber pilot and I'm just selfish, I know. Well, I'm *not* a brave little girl and I'm *not* sorry. 
She sits in the passenger seat, Homer in the driver's seat. 
CANDY I *know* this was right. (pause) I told you. I'm not good at being alone. (pause; in a whisper) I told him, too. 
Homer concentrates on starting the car. 
CANDY (repeating herself) I *know* this was right. 
HOMER Right. 
Their expressions, as the car pulls away, belie their words. 
EXT. CIDER HOUSE - END OF DAY 
Homer and Mr. Rose sit opposite each other at the picnic table. Rose Rose stands behind her father, her hands on his shoulders, watching Homer snip out Mr. Rose's stitches--very quickly. 
MR. ROSE Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry. 
HOMER This is easy--I'm not hurrying. 
MR. ROSE You still doin' it too fast! 
Job done, Homer leaves the table and hurries to the bicycle, pedaling away. Rose Rose watches Homer go, as Mr. Rose flexes his healed hand. 
ROSE ROSE He's in a big hurry, all right. I told you he's in trouble. 
EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - EVENING 
Candy and Homer sit on the dock. Candy still seems to be wrestling with her conscience. Homer throws snails in the sea. It's cold. 
HOMER Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay? 
CANDY It will be okay. 
HOMER *What* will be okay? 
CANDY We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see. 
Homer throws a snail with more force. 
HOMER I'll just move on, get another job somewhere. 
Ray comes out onto the dock; he sees Homer throwing another snail. 
RAY Every time you throw a snail off the dock, you're makin' someone start his whole life over. 
Candy throws a handful of snails into the water. 
CANDY Maybe we're doing the snails a favor, Daddy. 
Ray looks at the two of them; he sighs. 
RAY It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in. 
CANDY Good night, Daddy. 
Ray nods good night; he leaves. Homer looks expectantly at Candy. 
CANDY We'll just have to wait and see. 
INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Olive and Homer sit at the dining-room table, the remnants of an apple pie in front of them. Homer is still eating. Pictures of Wally are on the wall. 
OLIVE I used to hate it when Wally went back to college--even when it was just college! And this was when his father was still alive... I hated it even then. Naturally I hate this more. 
Homer nods in sympathy. His mouth is stuffed with apple pie. 
OLIVE What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer. 
HOMER (wiping his mouth) Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here. 
OLIVE There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone. 
Olive's thoughts drift; her eyes look up at a photo of Wally. 
HOMER I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me. 
OLIVE (distracted) I don't know. (intently at Homer) Just promise me one thing. 
Homer is tense. Does Olive suspect about Candy? 
HOMER Uh... sure.

LILY (CONT'D) What, you have some kind of lezzy wet dream? 
Nina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard. 
NINA You're lying. 
LILY (TICKLED) Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me. 
NINA Stop. 
LILY Was I good? 
NINA (BARKS) Shut up! 
Other dancers look over. 
Nina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away. 74-76A. 
A77 INT. STAGE - DAY A77 
Nina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide. 
LEROY The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain. 
Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff," stopping at the precipice. 
LEROY (CONT'D) You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance. 
Nina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a HARD FLOOR surrounds it. 
LEROY (CONT'D) You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump! 
She hesitates, fearful. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Go ahead. You'll be fine. 
Nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive. 
She falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause from the other dancers. 
LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Everybody get a drink then it's notes. 
Nina lies in the pads, completely exhausted. 
B77 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER B77 
Nina sits backstage, toweling herself off. 
She pauses, noticing Leroy and Lily conversing near the doorway. 
Lily nods and touches his arm. He smiles warmly, then notices Nina watching. His serious demeanor returns and he pulls away. He says goodbye to Lily. 
Lily follows his gaze and smirks at Nina, rubbing it in, before exiting herself. 74-76B.

A81 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A81 
Nina kneels in front of the toilet, a finger down her throat. She gags, but nothing comes up. 
Her eyes tear up, and she tries again, but still just heaves. 
Frustrated, she wipes her mouth and flushes. 
81 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 81 
Nina exits the bathroom and approaches her mother's bedroom door. It's closed, but the light's on underneath. 
She's about to knock, but hesitates. Through the door, she can hear the sound of her mother watching an INFOMERCIAL on TV. An unfamiliar, lonely noise. 
Nina stands there for a moment, just breathing. She strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door. 
82 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 82 
Nina collapses on her bed. 
She opens the JEWELRY BOX sitting on her night stand. 
She watches the ballerina spin for a moment... 
Then suddenly SLAMS the lid shut and throws the box hard against the wall. 
She shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish possessions--stuffed animals, dolls, keepsakes, etc.

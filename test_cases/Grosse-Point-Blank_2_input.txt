Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car. 
WIDE SHOT 
of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the clerk inside. 
MARTIN What are you doing here? 
CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question. 
CARL A double shift. What's it look like? (softening) Can I help you with something? 
Martin's head pans the room, processing. 
MARTIN I don't think so. 
EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING 
Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar landscape. 
MARTIN (into phone) Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick up if you're there... It's Martin Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not here. My house is gone and now there's a 7-11 here... And that's unfortunate... You can never go home again, Dr. Oatman. 
Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go. 
MARTIN (to himself) But I guess you can shop there. 
INT. NURSING HOME - DAY 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating. 
NURSE Mary, your son's here. 
The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They start out of the room. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes and hacks. 
MARY I bought a new rug. 
MARTIN That's wonderful, Mom. 
MARY What's a revival tent? 
MARTIN It's a place where religious people-- 
MARY (knowingly) Marlin Perkins and Jim! 
MARTIN Jim? 
MARY His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass! 
Mary coughs horribly. 
MARTIN It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing. 
MARY I spoke to your father the other day. 
MARTIN I imagine that'd be rather difficult. 
MARY Nature made him then broke the mold. 
Martin decides to change the subject. 
MARTIN They told me you're taking lithium, mom. 
MARY Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache. 
MARTIN You have a headache?

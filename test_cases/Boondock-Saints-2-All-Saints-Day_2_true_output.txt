He slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click." 
CONNOR (CONT'D) Well, praise the Lord. 
The terrified ex-gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling out of his bonds. Just as he touches the door. 
CONNOR (CONT'D) George? (George turns) All good boys go to heaven. George nods and exits. Romeo is confused as our trio gathers. Connor tosses the bullet he palmed to Romeo and he nods. 
MURPHY Now, that was, perhaps the finest example of spiritual guidance that I have ever had the good fortune ta witness. 
CONNOR Well, thank you very much.     Mysterious ways. Mysterious ways. 
SLO-MO: Suddenly, Eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels her weapon at the brothers and Romeo. Romeo levels back. 
Eunice fires as the boys dive on Romeo. Crew Cut is revealed behind our trio, firing from the shadows. Eunice and Crew Cut exchange fire as the boys reload. 
Eunice hits Crew Cut in the side. The assassin has a moment of outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit. 
In the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is gone. Silence falls. Presently, Romeo and the boys bolt up. Romeo goes for the door and the boys level at Eunice. 
CONNOR (CONT'D) Drop the gun! Drop it! 
She "places" her gun on a nearby table. 
EUNICE Easy fellas. I'm alone. 
The boys are before her as Romeo returns. 
ROMEO He's gone. 
CONNOR Who are ya? 
EUNICE My name is Eunice Bloom...and I'm your new guardian angel. A torch was passed to me by a mutual friend, gone but not forgotten. 
The boys reholster.    She drops her arms. 
MURPHY We heard about Smecker.    He was a good man. 
CONNOR Aye.   You have our condolences. 
EUNICE And you have mine. 
They shake. 
CONNOR 
CONNOR 
MURPHY Murphy. 
EUNICE Very well...Connor, Murphy. 
The boys nod.   Romeo points to the front door. 
ROMEO Who the fuck was that guy?! 
EUNICE That, I suspect, was the shooter you boys have been looking for. 
The boys look at each other.   Frustration.   Anger. 
ROMEO Fucking...what the fuck?! Who the fuck is this brawd?! And what the fuck's going on, here?! 
EUNICE Let's speed this up before your new sidekick's got to dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary. 
The boys chuckle. 
ROMEO Oh, no you didn't. 
EUNICE I am an FBI agent who is controlling this investigation from within, in order to ensure that you gentlemen never see the inside of a prison cell. I am conspiring to do this with three like minded individuals who have aided you in the past. Though I have yet to inform them of my agenda because, well, girl's gotta have her fun. 
MURPHY Dolly, Duffy and Greenly? 
EUNICE The very same. 
CONNOR How are the lads? 
EUNICE Two of them are scared.   One's just horny. 
MURPHY Bet'cha I can guess which one. 
EUNICE Bet'cha can but let's save it for group. Right now, we have a big problem. 
CONNOR What's that?

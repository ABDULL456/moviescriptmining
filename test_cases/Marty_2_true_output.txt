VIRGINIA (heavy whisper) Don't you think I feel lousy about this too? 
THOMAS All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it. (sits on a wooden chair, unrolls a fresh pair of socks he's been holding) I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night. (raises one leg to put a sock on, pauses with his heel on the edge of his chair) Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that? 
VIRGINIA Tommy... 
THOMAS (snapping) I don't wanna talk about it! 
He pulls his sock on angrily, then lets his leg fall back to the floor and just sits, one sock on, one sock in his hand. He looks sullenly in the direction of his wife. 
THOMAS (continuing, huffy) I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think? 
VIRGINIA Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse? 
THOMAS (in a furious whisper) Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it! 
He stands, then becomes aware he has to put on his other sock. He sits down again and pulls the second sock on. Virginia has had a hot reply in her mouth, but she forces it back. She rocks the baby a little. 
VIRGINIA Tommy, I love you, and I know you feel lousy right now, but we're never gonna be happy unless we have a chance to work out our own lives. We can't keep talking in whispers like this the resta our lives. We gotta have some privacy. We... 
Thomas has risen, a slim, dark, unsettled young man in undershirt and trousers, holding his shoes in one hand. He starts toward the... 
FOYER. 
Thomas strides down the little foyer. He turns and looks into the living room. He watches his mother packing strange brown parcels into her bag. 
THOMAS (scowling) Can't you wait five minutes? I'll drive you over inna car. I just gotta put my shirt on, that's all. 
The old lady nods brusquely. 
LIVING ROOM. 
Thomas stands with his head bowed to hide the tears he feels sweeping into his hot eyes. Then he returns to his bedroom in his stocking-feet, carrying his shoes. 
BEDROOM. 
Thomas comes in just as Virginia bends over the bassinet, having gotten the baby back to sleep. Thomas cries to her in a furious whisper. 
THOMAS All right, get dressed, because we're gonna drive my mother over. Why couldn't you get along with her?! Why couldn't you make just a little effort?! She's a little hard to get along with! All right! All I asked you was try a little. 
He turns from her, sits down on the bed miserably angry with the world, his wife, his mother, himself. The baby begins to whimper again. Virginia turns wearily to her husband. 
VIRGINIA Tommy... 
THOMAS (roaring out) I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me? 
MARTY'S HOME, FRONT PORCH. DAY. 
A small procession consisting of Thomas carrying his mother's carpet bag, his mother carrying small paper-wrapped bundles, and Virginia holding the baby comes across the front hedge. Thomas leads the parade with a muffled sorrow. They turn up the porch to the front door. Virginia remains in the small front yard. She is miserable. 
PILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. DAY.

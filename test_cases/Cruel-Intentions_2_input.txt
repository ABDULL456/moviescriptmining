KATHRYN Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you. 
CECILE Is it that obvious? 
Kathryn nods. 
CECILE (cont'd) He sends me letters you know. Love letters. 
KATHRYN That's so romantic. Have you responded? 
CECILE No. 
KATHRYN Well do you like him? 
CECILE I don't know. 
KATHRYN Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me. 
CECILE (beat) I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. 
Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her. 
CECILE (cont'd) What am I going to do? If my mother found out about Ronald she would kill me. 
Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye. 
KATHRYN Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. 
CECILE Okay. 
KATHRYN Did you hide the letters? 
CECILE Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. 
KATHRYN I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. 
CECILE Why? 
KATHRYN Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. 
CECILE You'd do that for me? 
KATHRYN Of course I would. We're friends, right? 
CECILE Best friends. 
Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn. 
23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23 
Little touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother) adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony. 
24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24 
Annette steps onto the balcony. 
HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German. 
ANNETTE (calling out) Excuse me. Excuse me! 
SEBASTIAN You talking to me? 
ANNETTE Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read. 
SEBASTIAN What'cha reading? 
ANNETTE The Fountainhead. 
SEBASTIAN Great book. 
ANNETTE (skeptical) You've read The Fountainhead? 
SEBASTIAN Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. 
ANNETTE Romantic? He rapes her. 
SEBASTIAN That's a matter of opinion. 
ANNETTE You need help. 
SEBASTIAN Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it. 
ANNETTE At this hour? I don't think so.

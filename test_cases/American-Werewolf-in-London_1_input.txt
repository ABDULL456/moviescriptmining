DAVID Jack, we'd better go. 
JACK What do you mean?  I'm starving. 
DART PLAYER There's no food here. 
The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a bit urgent. 
DAVID Come on, Jack, shall we go?!! 
JACK Apparently so. 
The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door. 
WOMAN (to men) You can't let them go. 
DAVID (worried) How much do we owe you? 
CHESS PLAYER Nothing, lads.  Go, God be with you. 
DAVID Uh, thank you. 
WOMAN Wait!  You just can't let them go! 
DART PLAYER Go!  And stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors. 
DAVID Yes, well, thanks again. 
CHESS PLAYER Beware the moon, lads! 
David pushes Jack out. 
6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT 
It is very cold. 
JACK What the hell was that all about? 
DAVID I don't know.  Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road. 
JACK Beware the moon? 
DAVID Come on, I'm freezing. 
They start up the road into the night. 
7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT 
It is quiet. 
WOMAN You can't let them go. 
DART PLAYER (angry) Should the world know our business?! 
CHESS PLAYER It's murder then. 
DART PLAYER Then murder it is!  It's in God's hands now. 
The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the floor. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK 
walking on the road surrounded by darkness. 
DAVID That was weird.  I guess leaving was the best idea. 
JACK I don't know.  Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood- thirsty mob.

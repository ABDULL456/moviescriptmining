41. INTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. AUDIENCE. 41. LEWIS fires over MAYOR's head as he rushes to stage help MRS. MALLORY. BODYGUARDS run for their lives. FIDGET tear gases STUDIO EXECUTIVES and their WIVES as they attempt to flee. CHARDONNAY rifles pocketbooks of SOCIETY LADIES and steals their wallets as they cower in fear on the floor. 
42. INTERIOR SENATOR BOXOFFICE. 42. DINAH stuffs cash into shopping bags, robbing the charity of its fund, pulls a large gun and runs out of cashier's booth. 43. Cut back to INTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. STAGE. 43. MAYOR is giving MRS. MALLORY emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as LITTLE WILLIAM laughs maniacally. 
44. EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. 44. Complete pandemonium as premiere AUDIENCE comes stampeding out of theater in a panic. MOTORCYCLE COP ESCORTS leap from motorcycles and pull guns but PETIE jumps from limo, grabs a piece of lumber from sawhorse and knocks them unconscious with 
it. DINAH comes running, firing into the air, and throws bags of money into back of limo and jumps in. CHERISH, LYLE, RAVEN, FIDGET, CHARDONNAY and PAM come charging out of theater, firing their guns to cover their escape. CECIL drags HONEY outside, still in a chokehold as RODNEY fires wildly to keep anyone at bay. 
HONEY (To HORRIFIED FANS who duck for cover) 
HELP ME! CALL THE STUDIO! 
CALL JACK VALENTI! HELLLPPP! PETIE opens the trunk of the limo and RODNEY and CECIL throw HONEY inside and slam it shut. HONEY continues screaming and banging on trunk door as CECIL and GANG pile into limo. 
CECIL 
(TO GANG) 
POWER TO THE PEOPLE WHO 
PUNISH BAD CINEMA! PETIE peels out in limo as PREMIERE GUESTS and FANS dive out of the way and GANG chants "Battle of Algiers"-type revolutionary yell. CECIL fires his gun out back window and shatters the "Some Kind Of Happiness" logo on marquee. 
45. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 45. CHERISH lunges for CECIL and they french kiss hotly. From PETIE's POV behind the wheel we see COP CAR #1 with sirens wailing and lights flashing heading towards premiere. In rear view mirror, PETIE sees three other COP CARS speeding up to Senator Theater and screeching to a stop. 
46. EXTERIOR YORK ROAD. NORTH OF SENATOR THEATER. 46. COP CAR #1 screeches into a U-turn and COP in passenger side fires his gun at CECIL's limo. 
47. INTERIOR SPEEDING WHITE LIMO. 46. 
Back window is blasted out by COP's bullet. 
CECIL I fuckin' hate car chase scenes! 
PETIE (Flooring the accelerator, 
PISSED) Yeah, but "Bullit" was good! LYLE snorts cocaine off a coke-spoon and nonchalantly picks glass out of his hair. 
LYLE But it lead to the "French Connection." 
CHARDONNAY 
(VICIOUSLY) Which inspired a sequel! 
LEWIS And lead to "Smokey and The Bandit" and that kinda shit! PETIE sees another cop car speeding up behind him in the rear view mirror. DINAH leans out limo window and fires gun back'at cop car. 
PAM 
(FURIOUS) "Smokey and The Bandit" even had fuckin' sequels... Another cop car speeds towards them from the front trying to cut them off. 
PETIE (Insane, driving like a lunatic) Yeah, Part fucking Two, 1980!... 
DINAH 
(IN DISGUST) Part Three, 1983! 
CECIL 
(PSYCHOTICALLY) "Smokey and The Bandit" ruined my childhood! CECIL fires his gun in the nick of time and shatters approaching cop car's windshield. 
PETIE makes a hard right and zooms up church driveway as two cop cars collide behind him. FIDGET cheers like a kid and starts absentmindedly playing pocket pool. 
48. EXTERIOR CHURCH ROAD. 48. Another cop car is speeding to premiere from behind the church and almost hits the limo as PETIE veers right in the "V" in the road, narrowly missing a MINISTER and a suspiciously SENSITIVE TEEN as they leave the church rectory.

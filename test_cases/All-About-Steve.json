{"train": "ALL ABOUT STEVE \nWritten by \nKim Barker \nNovember 2006 \nTNT. KITCHEN - DAY A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second between each one. \nMARY (V.O.) Vita aenigma est. Life is a puzzle. It is. Specifically, life is most like a crossword puzzle. There are a million reasons why, not the least of which is that life, like crosswords, requires the use of your whole entire brain- Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills all over the puzzle. \nMARY Crap. The puzzle answers all run together. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nTen plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty except for one. In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to herself. \nMARY Four letter word for... vomit. She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help. \nMARY Not \"barf\". For sure not \"barf\". That's too easy. \"Puke\" is okay, but maybe a bit pedestrian (that means boring)... I like \"hurl\". I do. I like the way it rolls off your tongue -- the word, I mean. But my all time favorite is none of those. She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it together. \nMARY Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E- W. Spew... Sp-ew. A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER walks out. A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals to Mary. \nTEACHER We're ready for you now. (a plastic Kroger shopping Mary jumps up, grabs her purse bag). \nMARY Jesus help me. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nMary stands in front of the chalkboard, \"CAREER DAY\" written in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the class of 10 year old KIDS. The Teacher reads from her notes. \nTEACHER Here's a treat, students. Our final guest for Career Day, Miss Mary Horowitz, is the crossword constructor for the Atlanta Citizen. You know the crossword puzzles you see every week in the newspaper? It's her job to create them. Isn't that fun? Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers. \nMARY You weren't supposed to tell them. \nTEACHER Pardon me? \nMARY I made a crossword puzzle to help them guess what my job is. You ruined it. \nTEACHER Oh, I'm so sorry. \nMary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at them like lost puppies. \nTEACHER Maybe you could tell them a bit about what your job is like? watche s hit \nGARBAGE Mary drops thu p file out her the bottom She p lls u hearsed enthusiasm. bag, reads with re \nMARY People do crossword puzzles all the time but they don't often think of the person who made all the words fit together, and who thought up the clues, and who made sure the little black squares at the top mirror the ones at the bottom. She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile. \nMARY Crossword constructors usually have above average intelligence, with knowledge of just about every subject you can imagine. And it helps if they can spell. The card in Mary's hand reads \"LAUGH\". She laughs. Nobody else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets serious, sweeps her hand through the air. \nMARY Imagine, for a moment, a world without crossword puzzles. A world- Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her off. \nTEACHER Daniel, you have a question? \nDANIEL You make a living doing that? Just making puzzles? The Atlanta Citizen only comes out on Fridays. One puzzle a week can't make you enough to live on. A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up. \nLARGE KID How do you pay your rent? \nMARY My parents - \nBETTY Nine dollar twenty. Mary fishes in her bag for money. \nMARY We could bring your dad if you want. I don't think the show is ageist. That means he won't feel like a loser for being old. As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her. \nBETTY Pecha kucha! Do Itta! Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next customer. \nMARY So no then? That's a no? Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her bag. \nMARY (V.O.) Sometimes crosswords are even better than life. Here's how. They don't discriminate. Crosswords don't care if you're young or old; black or white; male, female or intersex. Crosswords only care if you're an idiot. And, really, that's okay, because if you have the IQ of a yam, finishing a crossword should be the least of your worries. Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then walks away. \nINT. CNN LOADING BAY - DAY \nA half dozen NEWS CREWS rush to load and unload CNN news ECHS -- vans. JOURNALISTS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, PRODUCERS, SOUNDyT all in a mad rush to go get An unshaven and surprisingly calm STEVE balances camera equipment in one hand while he scratches a barely legible \"Steve\" onto a clipboard. A young PA takes the clipboard, hands Steve a bunch of gas masks. \n50'S Steve heads to an open van where a disheveled, mid producer ANGUS MCCORMACK checks his watch. \nANGUS Where the hell is he? \nSTEVE Probably doing his nails. -- paper 40ish reporter HARTMAN HUGHES rushes to the van on his face. napkin tucked in his shirt collar, bread crumbs \nHARTMAN What do you mean \"the big one\"? Terrorists, natural disaster, what? \nANGUS Pandemic. Hartman's eyes light up. \nANGUS Half of the Midwest and spreading. Nobody's safe. Steve tries on a gas mask. \nHARTMAN Please let it be the bird flu. \nSTEVE Bird flu is for pussies. This thing's unstoppable. \nHARTMAN How's it spreading? Angus looks at Steve. \nSTEVE Squirrels. Hartman can barely contain his excitement. \nHARTMAN Oh my God, they're everywhere! \nSTEVE Exactly. \nHARTMAN Al Qaeda connection? \nANGUS Always a possibility. \nSTEVE Who wishes he was in Iraq now? \nHARTMAN Not me!. Hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the van's side mirror. \nHARTMAN I need blush. No, wait. I'll go pasty. It'll look like I could be the first media victim. \"Hartman Hughes, no such thing as too close to the story\". Hartman looks back at Steve and Angus. They're just standing there, unable to keep a straight face. Hartman deflates. \nHARTMAN Assholes! I knew it was too good to be true. He throws his gas mask down, storms off. \nANGUS Hartman, come on. Hartman gets in the elevator, hollers out to them. \nHARTMAN I had a perfectly good bologna sandwich going on upstairs. Wasted! Angus and Steve watch the elevator door close, shrug it off. \nSTEVE Next E-coli story breaks, he'll be fine. \nEXT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY \nAn 1890 Colonial Revival home surrounded by White Oaks. Oversized statue of the Blessed Virgin in the flower bed. Mezuzah on the door. Face still in the newspaper, Mary trips up the steps and skids onto the porch. Her knee starts to bleed. \nMARY Crap. \nMARY Please don't mean on the inside. \nMRS. HOROWITZ Beautiful and smart. And fun. And interesting. Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast. \nMARY Let's hope all that does it for him. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nA bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs. Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes each step like her knees are fused together but still manages to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised. With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir is screaming \"hallelujah\" in her brain. As Mary reaches the bottom step -- \nSTEVE Mary, hi. I'm Steve. She puts up a finger - \"just a second\". She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs. Horowitz, confused. \nMRS. HOROWITZ And how's your mother? \nSTEVE Great. Thanks. She just stares at him and smiles. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer. \nMARY Gods. You may have noticed that I'm wearing clean socks. Translation: I'm really trying and thus should be amply rewarded. Thanks for your support. She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees. \nMARY And by support I don't mean, you know - She hikes up her bra. \nMARY I mean your assistance, your furtherance, your advocacy of my efforts to get out there and... do what I'm supposed to do. She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nSteve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a bit more relaxed. \nMRS. HOROWITZ There we go. Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red boots. Her mother cringes. Steve's a bit surprised at the boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up. \nSTEVE Ready? Mary nods a bunch of times. \nSTEVE Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight. (calling into living room) Sir. \nMR. HOROWITZ (O.S.) You kids have fun. \nMRS. HOROWITZ Be careful now. Don't forget your seatbelts. Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to hide her worry but failing miserably. \nMR. HOROWITZ She'll be fine. They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nSteve unlocks the driver's side door of his SUV while Mary waits at her door, nervous but smiling. \nSTEVE Sorry about this blind date thing. My mother - \nMARY I never went to kindergarten! He looks at her, totally confused. \nMARY They skipped me to the forth grade. \nSTEVE Okay. She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates then heads to the driver's side, gets in. \nMARY I missed finger painting. He has no clue what to say. \nSTEVE Sorry? \nMARY Me too. She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back inches short. \nSTEVE Whoa! Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and tries again, this time making contact with Steve's lips. He's more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway, all the while straining to see the Horowitz house. \nMary's parents hear the door open then Mary's footsteps hit the stairs. Mrs. Horowitz jumps up, rushes to meet her. \nMRS. HOROWITZ Sweetie, what's wrong? What happened? My God, you've barely been gone ten minutes. Mary stops on the stairs, turns back. \nMARY Mom, sometimes that's all you need to know he's the one! Mary smiles big, takes the rest of the stairs up two at a time. Mrs. Horowitz is about to follow her. \nMR. HOROWITZ That girl makes up her mind the moon is green, it's green. Leave her be. It'll pass. Eventually. Mrs. Horowitz moves away from the stairs, no less worried. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMary leaps from the doorway and lands on her bed in pencil pose, smiling up at the ceiling. \nMARY Eleven letter word for serendipity. She screams into her pillow. \nMARY The perfect answer: S-E-R-E-N-D-I-P- I-T-Y. Serendipity. Why would you ever need a better word than that? She sits up, grabs her notebook, starts to draw out a new crossword puzzle. \n- DAY \nINT. ATLANTA CITIZEN NEWSPAPER OFFICES \nA busy newspaper office. COURIERS make deliveries, JOURNALISTS talk at their desks, SECRETARIES count the minutes until they can go home. In the Editor's office, JIM SOLOMAN looks over the newspaper layout with an ASSISTANT. \nSOLOMAN Let's split the gardening feature into two weeks. Keep them in suspense. He steps back, looks at the whole layout. \nSOLOMAN Looks good. How are we doing here? \nHe checks his watch. \nSOLOMAN Five minutes to spare. Look at that. The Assistant points to a blank corner of page 26. Soloman's surprised, and not particularly impressed. \nSOLOMAN Horowitz. \nINT. ATLANTA CITIZEN BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY \nMary stands at the front of the full elevator, smiling, a piece of paper gripped in her hand. \nMARY (V.0.) When I was a fledgling (that means novice) crossword constructor, I would find comfort in the words of the learned crossword sages. Above all, my hero is Manny Nosowsky, frequent New York Times contributor and all around cruciverbial master. \nINT. ATLANTA CITIZEN NEWSPAPER OFFICES - DAY \nMary walks out of the elevator and heads through the office. Nobody seems to notice her. \nMARY (V.O.) Manny says that a crossword puzzle's greatness can be determined by asking three simple questions. She marches in the direction of the Editor's office. \nMARY (V.0.) Is it solvable? She almost collides with a mail cart but keeps walking. \nMARY (V.0.) Is it entertaining? She arrives at the Editor's office, plants her feet in the doorway. \nMARY (V.O.) Does it s arkle? She looks down at the crossword puzzle in her hands, smiles, holds it out for Soloman. Soloman grabs the crossword and hands it right to the Assistant, who rushes it out the door. \nINT. HAIR SALON - DAY \nTwo OLD LADIES sit under the hair dryers, each doing the Atlanta Citizen crossword puzzle. They're stumped. The first Old Lady hollers over the noise of the dryer. \nOLD LADY \nI CAN'T GET ANY OF THESE! The other Old Lady holds up her blank crossword, shrugs. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nThe TAXI DRIVER sits in the parked taxi doing the crossword. \nMR. HOROWITZ And Steve? \nMARY He works a lot, you know. Travels all the time. 'Tis possible he has not yet espied it. She picks up the crossword, admires it. \nMARY But when he does, I'm sure he'll say, \"that Mary Horowitz... is a catch. Where oh where has she been all my empty life? From here onward my life will be divided into 'before I met Mary' and 'after I met Mary' with the second part being far superior. I am lonely no more. The missing letter in my puzzle has at last been found.\" \nMR. HOROWITZ I don't want you getting your hopes up too much. \nMARY I'm not. \nINT. CNN ATLANTA - DAY \nAn exec office. Steve relaxes on the sofa next to Angus while Hartman noses around the office. \nANGUS We're going to hit rush. We'll have to take the second flight. Exec. Producer DAN CORBITT walks in, heads straight for his desk. \nCORBITT You're set. KDFW's on site now. Angus and Steve start to get up. \nCORBITT Hang on. They sit. Corbitt grabs the remote control, turns the TV on. \nCORBITT Anybody want to tell me about this? He fast forwards through footage of Hartman reporting from a greenhouse. Corbitt slows it to normal speed, mutes it. They watch as Hartman interviews an attractive female BOTANIST holding a test tube with a seedling in it. Hartman keeps pointing to the seedling - which happens to be right in front of the Botanist's generous breasts. The camera gets closer and closer - each time it pulls away Hartman points to the seedling again to force the camera in close - basically turning the piece into a giant boob-fest. \nANGUS Take a look at those... plants. Corbitt pauses it on the worst shot, looks at Steve. \nCORBITT We can't use this. Hartman fakes disgust. \nHARTMAN Of course not. Nice camera work, Stevie. Steve glares at Hartman. Corbitt points at the frozen shot on the TV screen, looks at Steve. \nCORBITT You want to go back to the Weather Channel, try that again. Corbitt checks his watch, points them out the door. \nCORBITT Get out of here. Don't embarrass me in Dallas. Hartman, Angus and Steve walk out. Steve nods to Hartman - thanks asshole. In the hallway, Steve's cell phone rings. He answers it. \nSTEVE What?... Mom, let me call you back. \nHe listens, signals to Angus he needs a minute, then stops at a reception area. He sorts through the newspapers, pulls out the Atlanta Citizen, flips through it. \nSTEVE What page? He finds Mary's crossword. He looks at it closely, totally confused. It takes him more than a second to get it. He laughs -- then suddenly reality sets in. \nSTEVE Jesus. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMary does a crossword while soaking in the bathtub. Without missing an answer, she reaches over the side of the tub, grabs the telephone on the floor. She checks the dial tone, hangs up quickly, continues with the puzzle. \nMARY Four letter word for am I going to wait my whole life for Steve to call? She suddenly stops writing. \nMARY Nope. She flails out of the tub like a salmon heading upstream, grabs a towel barely big enough to cover her. Without any effort to dry off, she runs out of the bathroom. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nTowel wrapped around her but barely covering, Mary reaches the top of the stairs. Her wet feet sliding all over the place, she opts for the safety of a banister slide. She gets up on it, slides a few inches before realizing what a bad idea it was. \nMARY Ow ow ouch. She gets off the banister, slops the rest of the way down the stairs, jumps into the doorway of the living room. \nMARY The news is Steve's life! It's not just what he does, it's who he is, imbedded deep down in his polymer of nucleotides. I should be out there by his side. That's what girlfriends do, isn't it? Let him concentrate on his work. I'll concentrate on the relationship. It won't be easy, I know, but neither is quantum physics or... the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle or... paper mache, but I've managed to do fine with those, haven't I? She looks at her parents. They sit at a table playing bridge with MR. and MRS. HANCOCK. \nMRS. HOROWITZ Mary, you remember the Hancocks. \nMARY Top of the evening. Mr. Hancock checks out Mary's bare legs as she stands in a puddle of bath water. Mrs. Hancock lifts her husband's chin, snaps him out of it. \nMRS. HANCOCK Loved this week's puzzle, dear. Whoever Steve is, he must be a very lucky young man. Mr. Horowitz gives Mrs. Hancock a look - \"don't encourage her\". \nSTEVE But then we wouldn't have heard about horse heaven. Josh and Angus laugh. \nHARTMAN It's that kind of genius that won me the Southeast Idaho Christian Family Coalition's Journalist of the Year award, you ingrates. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT \nThe bus is full. Most PASSENGERS sleep. Mary sits in the aisle seat of the first row, a BURLY MAN in his 60's beside her. The light above their seats illuminates the crossword puzzle he's working on. Mary looks over his shoulder, points to the blank spaces in his puzzle. \nMARY Omaha... Einstein... cholera... grenade... Bach... oui... potbelly... Oreo. The man drops the crossword, glares at her. \nMARY Sorry. She looks away, starts biting her nails, then spots a sign on the freeway, calls-out to the Driver and anybody else who will listen. \nMARY Bessemer, Alabama! Named after Sir Henry Bessemer, a Brit. Guess what he did? Perfected the way steel is made, of course. \n(MORE) \nMARY (cont'd) I won't bore you with the whole story, just the best parts, like how it involves molten pig iron which does not, as one might think, have anything to do with pigs. It's actually a raw iron made from iron ore, plus limestone, plus coke - and by coke I mean the carbonaceous residue, not the cola, or the booger sugar. Mary looks around for a response -- nothing. \nMARY You know what else is in Bessemer? The city, I mean? Hitler's typewriter. It's crazy, I know. That guy was such an asshole. The Driver's eyes glaze over. Please let this and. \nEXT. REST STOP - NIGHT \nThe bus pulls into the rundown rest stop. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT \nThe Driver looks at the passengers. Most of them are still sleeping. \nDRIVER We'll just take five minutes here. He steps off the bus. Mary turns to the man next to her. \nMARY Can you watch my stuff? He glares at her -- you have got to be kidding. Mary grabs her backpack and Kroger bag and steps off the bus. \nINT. REST STOP - NIGHT \nMary walks into the restaurant, heads toward the ladies room. On her way, she spots a television behind the counter. A few DINERS watch. Mary joins them. On the TV: \"MEDIEVAL TIMES HOSTAGE CRISIS\". \nHARTMAN (on TV) Perhaps the greatest obstacle the hostage negotiators face is the suspect's refusal to communicate using modern day technology. In keeping with his role as a medieval knight, he's insisting on an eleventh century messenger to deliver all communication. The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR. \nANCHOR What are we talking about here, Hartman? Carrier pigeons? \nMARY Homing pigeons. A few of the Diners overhear. \nHARTMAN Actually, homing pigeons. The Diners look at Mary. \nMARY Carrier pigeons, despite their name, are more or less useless when it comes to actually carrying anything. Homing pigeons are better for messenger work... The Diners lose interest. Mary catches the eye of a WANDERER at the end of the counter. He's hanging on her every word. \nMARY You know who used them all the time? Genghis Khan. Loved the pigeons, scared to death of pooches though. The Wanderer just stares at her. \nMARY You know, dogs, canines, de honden? Still nothing. She looks back at the TV. \nANCHOR Have the negotiators located any homing pigeons? Where do you even get them in this day and age? \nHARTMAN You can buy them on the internet for twenty-five bucks a pop. Mary looks at the Diners, smiles, points to the TV. \nMARY My boyfriend is probably holding that camera right now. The Diners ignore her and just eat their pie. Mary realizes the time, runs out of the rest stop. \nEXT. REST STOP - NIGHT \nMary runs out into the parking lot. The bus is gone. \nMARY Crap! Crap, crap, crap! She looks down the road -- no sign of the bus anywhere. She takes her paper bag out of her pocket, breathes into it. A TRUCK DRIVER passes her with coffee in hand, on his way to his rig. \nSTEVE Tell me you didn't come all the way here just to see me. \nMARY Of course not... I went to Dallas looking for you first. And you know why? Steve grabs his head. This is not happening. \nMARY Because you're inimitable and I'm intransigent. \nSTEVE No, we're not. I don't know what that means but trust me. We're so not. \nMARY It means you're awesome and I'm unstoppable. \nSTEVE Great. Listen, Mary, you seem like a nice girl, and the ten minutes we spent together were -- \nMARY Mind blowing. At a complete loss, he just goes along. \nSTEVE Sure, but I'm working here. Working. \nMary points to the partially hidden side door of the hospital. A MAN with his face covered, in a nurse's uniform and dress shoes, sneaks out the door unnoticed. \nMARY I know. I'm just here to support you, show you I care, and also ask why you aren't following that guy pretending to be a nurse but obviously not wearing sterilizable, non-slip footwear. Steve looks toward the hospital, spots the Man. \nMARY If I was Baby Peggy's dad, that's how I'd avoid the press too. Steve takes off running. Mary yells out to him. \nMARY I'll be right here in case you want to make out later on! Steve looks back, a bunch of people stare. Mary waves to him then watches until he's out of sight. A SECURITY GUARD approaches her. \nSECURITY GUARD Miss, if you want to be here, you're going to have to stay behind the fence. Mary turns to see what he's pointing at - the growing crowd of protestors off in the distance. They wave their signs around, cry, sing and sway together, their painful song barely audible from afar. \nPROTESTORS Near, far, wherever you are, we believe that the leg should stay on... Mary watches, paralyzed with awe, like seeing herself in the mirror for the first time ever. At last, she has found her people. \nEXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - DAY \nAn overweight 30ish woman ELIZABETH (who shouldn't be wearing those low rise pants and cropped tee) lights a bunch of candles in the grass behind the protestor fence. She reaches the last candle in line just as Mary walks up to join the group. Elizabeth looks up at Mary, smiles. \nELIZABETH I like your boots. \nMARY Thanks. I found them in an alley. Elizabeth looks at the boots again, impressed. She stands up. \nELIZABETH Are you pro-leg or anti-leg? \nMARY Neither really. \nELIZABETH This is the pro-leg group over here. We're supporting Baby Peggy's dad in his fight to save the baby's third leg. She points to the end of the fenced off area where only a few protestors hold anti-leg signs:\"NORMAL LIFE FOR BABY PEGGY\", \n\"3 LEGS ARE NOT BETTER THAN 2\". \nELIZABETH Those are the anti-leggers. They're all for the amputation. \nMARY I'm just here because my boyfriend is working the story. He's with CNN, the world's news leader, the most trusted name in news, the place where more - \nELIZABETH The pro-leggers have better snacks. \nMARY I'm definitely pro-leg. \nElizabeth smiles, hands Mary a candle. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE -- NIGHT \nMr. and Mrs. Horowitz watch TV and read at the same time. The TV is on mute --- CNN's Baby Peggy coverage. In the corner of the screen, \"amputation countdown - 35 hours\". Shots of the protestors' candlelight vigil appear on the screen. Mrs. Horowitz spots Mary in the crowd, standing next to Elizabeth. She sings and waves her candle around, all the while straining to look for Steve. \nMRS. HOROWITZ There she is! Abe, look! There she is right there. Mr. Horowitz glances up from his book. \nMR. HOROWITZ She's going to set her hair on fire with that candle. \nMARY Of course. I don't want to interfere in his work but I just need to be here for him and - He grabs her, hugs her in so her words are all muffled - and yet she keeps talking. \nHARTMAN Good girl. The SECURITY GUARD walks past, gestures that they should be behind the fence. Hartman holds up his press pass to get rid of the Guard, then lets go of Mary. He points her toward the protestors, starts backing away. \nHARTMAN I'll tell Steve to come find you when we wrap for the day. What side are you on? \nMARY Pro-leg. She shows him her button featuring a cartoon of a very happy three legged baby. Hartman laughs. \nHARTMAN You might want to jump camps. No way they're going let that baby keep the third leg and live like a freak. Trust me. He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp. Mary calls out to him. \nMARY She'd just be like the tree frogs. Hartman turns around. What? \nMARY A trematode parasite causes polymely (that means extra limbs) in tree frogs. It happens all the time. In some ponds there's like a quarter of the tree frogs with extra legs. Totally natural. Hartman looks at her like she's a nutcase. \nEXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT \nAngus is on his phone as Steve rushes to set up his equipment. Hartman arrives back at the van. \nHARTMAN What's going on? Josh rushes to get the mic on Hartman. \nJOSH The parents of the kid got back together. Surgery's cancelled. \nHARTMAN No amputation? \nSTEVE Tell me you weren't talking to Mary. \nHARTMAN Who? \nSTEVE Go to hell, Hughes. scans it Angus hands Hartman the press release. Hartman quickly. \nHARTMAN It's over? The kid keeps the leg. \nANGUS For now. Hartman checks his teeth in a hand mirror. \nHARTMAN 'Til she gets it caught in a car door. \nEXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT \nNews spreads around the pro-leg protestors camp. They all start hollering with joy. The disappointed anti-leg protestors ditch their signs and storm off. \nINT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - NIGHT \nMr. Horowitz is asleep in front of the TV. He wakes up as the amputation countdown clock on the news stops. \nEXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nThe news crews line the hospital entrance once again. \nKOCO REPORTER With mere hours to spare, the Dunlevys reconciled, agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy is old enough to decide for herself. Further down the row of reporters: \nFOX NEWS REPORTER And while dozens of children fight for their lives behind these walls, Baby Peggy won't be one of them. With surgery cancelled, it's time for the Dunlevys to be a family once again. Past a few more news crews, at the end the line, Steve has the camera on Hartman. \nHARTMAN And like the noble tree frog whose extra leg is nothing if not natural, so Baby Peggy begins the rest of her three legged life... This is Hartman Hughes reporting live from Oklahoma City. Hartman pulls out his ear piece. Angus, Josh and Steve all look at him, a bit surprised. \nSTEVE Tree frog? Where do you get this shit? Hartman taps the side of his head -- it's all up here. \nHARTMAN A little thing called astutitude, my friends. Steve and Angus look at each other -- is that even a word? \nEXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT \nMary celebrates with the other protestors. The Protestor and his Protestor Wife cry tears of joy. Mary pulls a tissue out of her bag, hands it over. The husband takes it, turns away and wipes his eyes. \nHARTMAN He was going to go ask you himself but look at the poor bastard. So sick he can't even sit up straight. \nMARY What if it's a viral zoonotic disease? He should see a doctor. \nHARTMAN Exactly what I told him, but the only person he wants touching his infected flesh is you. Mary looks at Steve, worried. \nMARY But wait, what if - up. Hartman grabs her face, squishes her lips to shut her \nHARTMAN Hey now, we need you to be strong for him. Leachinan trial, Santa Fe, can you remember that? Mary nods, unable to speak. \nHARTMAN We'll meet you there, God willing. \nHe lets go of her face. \nMARY Will you take care of him? \nHARTMAN Like he's my own. She backs away from the window. Angus waves to her and starts driving. \nANGUS Nothing wrong with that one. \nJOSH Except for those boots. \nSTEVE You're an asshole, Hughes. Hartman laughs. \nEXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT \nMary watches the van drive away. \nEXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT \nOnly a few protestors remain. Abandoned signs and garbage cover the grass. Elizabeth gets autographs from other protestors like it's the last day of high school. Mary runs up, grabs her bags. \nMARY Elizabeth! I have to meet Steve at his next job, in New Mexico. He's sick, not as in rad, although he is that too, but more like unwell, infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully nothing serious but you never can be too sure and besides, healthy or not, he needs me. \nELIZABETH Sign my book before you go? Elizabeth hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen. \nMARY The trip's not too long, right through all kinds of interesting sites like, for example, El Santuario de Chimayo: The Lourdes of America. Know what that is? A sacred sand pit near a burrito stand. What could be better than that? Mary looks away from Elizabeth, fidgets a bit. \nMARY Want to go? Unless you're busy, I mean. You probably have something better to do. Elizabeth thinks about it. \nELIZABETH Not really. Mary is stunned. She takes a minute to realize it's real, gets excited. From behind her: \nHOWARD (O.S.)

A long line of news crews, views of the hospital's admitting entrance behind them. At one end of the line, a male KOCO (Oklahoma) REPORTER talks to camera. \nKOCO REPORTER Eleven months ago, the child we've come to know as Baby Peggy was born with an extremely rare birth defect, a third leg. Shortly after the birth, her parents Misty and Bill Dunlevy separated. Now with joint custody, one parent wants the baby to keep the third leg, the other wants it gone... A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS REPORTER is on camera. \nFOX NEWS REPORTER After months of legal wrangling, a judge has ordered in favor of the mother. Amputation surgery is scheduled for Wednesday but the father, Bill Dunlevy, isn't about to give up. As his lawyers work to secure an injunction, the devoted father rallies public support for the extra limb. \nAt the end of the long line of news crews, Steve has the camera on Hartman. \nHARTMAN \n(READING) \"God wouldn't have given my child the third leg if he didn't want her to keep it.\" But for now, the fate of that precious child's third leg is the hands of a judge... This is Hartman Hughes reporting, live from Oklahoma City. Steve signals they've cut, lowers his camera. Hartman calls out to Angus. \nHARTMAN What if next time I say Baby Peggy is like the wishbone of her parents' dispute? Hartman acts out a wishbone pull. Steve's disgusted. \nSTEVE Yeah, go ahead and suggest that. Corbitt will love it. Steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off hospital grounds. Dozens of PROTESTORS are camped out - a sorry assortment of oddballs standing at the fence, waving their signs: \"SPARE THE LEG\", and \"HONOR THE FATHER\". Many of them carry drawings of a three legged baby wearing a halo. Steve braces himself and heads for the crowd. Half way across, he spots a loner walking from the parking lot. He's 35, chubby, his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs lower on the left. This is HOWARD. In one hand: a pro-leg sign. In his other hand: a carton of chocolate milk. Howard stops to lick up the chocolate milk spilling all over his arm. Steve catches up with him. \nSTEVE Mind if I ask you a few questions on camera? \nHOWARD Me? \nSTEVE How do you feel about what's going on here? \nSteve shoulders his camera, focuses in on Howard's sign. It's an impressively detailed drawing of a judge yanking a baby's third leg off. \nHOWARD I haven't made up my mind yet. Both parties have valid arguments. \nEXT. 13TH STREET - DAY \nHOSPITAL STAFF, PROTESTORS and the curious PUBLIC approach the hospital grounds. A taxi inches through the crowd.

Somewhere in the middle, she finds what she's hunting for -- Steve. Mary's face lights up and she starts running toward him - in her mind, no doubt in slow motion, with clouds parting to light her way. Steve's attention is drawn away from the interview with Howard. He spots Mary running toward him, arms outstretched. \nSTEVE Please God, no. He looks for a place to hide but she's running ridiculously fast. It's too late. She's only a few feet away. \nMARY Steve! She jumps into his arms but he's only got one arm free and isn't about to use it to catch her. She slides down his leg to the ground but quickly picks herself up. \nMARY I'm here!

I spy with my little \neye... a transition metal She barely has the energy to get the word out. \nMARY Cobalt. Mary points to a steel belted tire on the ground, lays back and shuts her eyes.

Howard watches her drift off. \nHOWARD I went to school for physics but got bored. Now I just make these and sell them on appleheadsrule.com.

Local MEDIA circulates. Hartman kneels at the back of the ambulance, holding the hand of one of the Teachers. Steve gets it on camera, all the while looking around, a bit paranoid. \nHARTMAN And what went through your mind when you realized they were gone? The Teacher just bawls. Hartman turns to the camera. \nHARTMAN Grief too strong for words. That's the best way to describe this tragic, tragic scene. One minute, a merry day at the fair. The next minute, helpless babes savagely sucked into the menacing abyss. The Teacher bawls even harder. Hartman gives her a \"there there\" then continues talking to camera. \nHARTMAN And here's how hopeless the rescue looks at this moment. The earth surrounding hole is far too perilous for anybody to approach on foot. Moving heavy rescue equipment in too close could mean death for the rescuers as well.

SALLY (laughs) Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids. 
SOPHIA He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material. 
SALLY Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin. 
Sally drops out of frame. 
SOPHIA Don't try and change the subject. (sitting, joining Sally) Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable. 
SALLY And Cal's this massive adult? 
SOPHIA Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? 
SALLY You weren't exactly horrified. 
SOPHIA (laughing) I don't have a drug problem. 
SALLY Neither does Joe. 
SOPHIA His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article. 
Sally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide. 
SOPHIA (CONT'D) You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back. 
SALLY (getting up) We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London. 
SOPHIA (following her) Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. 
SALLY Not nice.  Not kind. 
SOPHIA Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel. 
SALLY Why are you doing this? 
SOPHIA His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic. 
SALLY (tearing up) But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic. 
SOPHIA (also tearing up) No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway. 
They hug a bit weepy. 
SOPHIA (CONT'D) He's always one step removed, always looking over his shoulder always looking for something else, something more intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's not ready. (a choked sob, tears well and fall) Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have kids.  You can't stick your head in the oven.  You can't take a handful of Percoden if you want to, or slit your wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids rob you of that option.  Trust me. (a beat) Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really good. 
EXT. POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS 
Joe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance by herself at the far end.  Joe has his hand on Cal's chest. Cal is stroking Joe's hair. 
JOE Isn't Skye amazing? 
CAL She's got great tits. 
JOE She's a constant surprise. 
CAL And you've only just met. 
JOE Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... (taps his head) The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice? 
CAL Absolutely.  And she's got great tits. 
JOE Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her. 
CAL The camera loves her.  A great actress. 
JOE With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. 
He gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by... 
EXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR 
Clair is climbing up the pool steps. 
CLAIR Has anyone seen Mac?

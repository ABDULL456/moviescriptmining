CARTER It sounds impossible -- 
LEE You said -- 
CARTER -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it. 
Carter turns, walks away without looking back. 
CARTER (CONT'D) You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane. 
LEE Why LA? 
CARTER (still not turning) I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one. INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT 
Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of doubt. 
LEE I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor... 
CARTER Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man. 
LEE Follow the Rich White Man? 
CARTER Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word. 
LEE Follow the RichWhiteMan... 
CARTER Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign. 
LEE Who? 
CARTER Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked. 
LEE How do you know he's our man? 
CARTER Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!! 
LEE You sound like that all the time. 
CARTER Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down. 
LEE Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic. 
CARTER Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off. 
LEE Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign. 
CARTER The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. (a tray arrives) Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear. 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL 
CUT TO REVEAL -- 
Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars. 
Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE: 
INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT 
Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack. 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL 
Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the door. 
Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching. 
CARTER Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?

LUKE What's going on? 
HAN Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan! 
LUKE What do you mean? Where is it? 
HAN Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. 
LUKE What? How? 
Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down. 
BEN Destroyed... by the Empire! 
HAN The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... 
A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming. 
HAN There's another ship coming in. 
LUKE Maybe they know what happened. 
BEN It's an Imperial fighter. 
Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window. 
LUKE It followed us! 
BEN No. It's a short range fighter. 
HAN There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? 
EXT. SPACE 
The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT 
LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. 
HAN Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. 
BEN It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. 
HAN Not for long... 
EXT. SPACE 
The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT 
The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca. 
BEN A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. 
LUKE It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. 
HAN Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. 
EXT. SPACE 
The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT 
The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet. 
LUKE Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. 
HAN I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range. 
The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station. 
BEN That's no moon! It's a space station. 
HAN It's too big to be a space station. 
LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this. 
HAN Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. 
The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station. 
LUKE Why are we still moving towards it? 
HAN We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! 
LUKE But there's gotta be something you can do! 
HAN There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! 
Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder. 
BEN You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR 
As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged. 
EXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS 
The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons. 
VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM 
Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field. 
INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037 
The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area.

Saying I'm the daddy! \nCRAIG What? \nDAY-DAY Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing. \nCRAIG Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl? \nDAY-DAY I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life. \nCRAIG Damn, you got a stalker. \nDAY-DAY That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too. \nCRAIG You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D? \nDAY-DAY (very serious) You don't know Baby D. \nHe looks at his watch. \nDAY-DAY (cont'd) I gotta get to Pinky's before I get fired like you. \nDay-Day exits.  Craig is close behind. \nEXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nAs they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye. It's KARLA (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister.

She smiles. \nCraig starts to trot over towards Day-Day.  Day-Day is frantically waving Craig to hurry. \nCRAIG (cont'd) What are you worried about? \nDay-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls. \nDAY-DAY Cheeco! \nCraig turns to see the pit bull \"Cheeco\" running right after him. \nKARLA Cheeco, no! \nCraig runs right towards Day-Day's BMW. \nDAY-DAY Oh shit, jump! \nThey both jump on top of Day-Day's BMW with CHEECO coming up fast.  He's BARKING viciously. \nACROSS STREET \nJoker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street laughing.  Karla is embarrassed. \nON BMW \nCraig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is terrified. \nDAY-DAY (cont'd) Hey, Joker!  Stop playing, man!  Call the dog back! \nThey continue to laugh.  Craig pulls his belt off.  He swings it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the buckle.  The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street. \nThe Jokers aren't laughing anymore.  Joker stares at Craig. Craig stares back.  You can feel the tension.  Joker kicks the dog. \nJOKER Get yo dumb ass in the back. \nCHEECO HOLLERS.  Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the BMW. \nDAY-DAY Look at my roof. \nBig dents in the roof of his BMW. \nDAY-DAY (cont'd) Man, why you do that?  I told you not to talk to that girl. \nCRAIG Why not?  She was cool with it. \nDay-Day gets into the car. \nDAY-DAY So. \nCRAIG What you mean, so? \nDAY-DAY If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that. \nHe slams the door, starts the car and backs up.  Leaving Craig standing there.  He sees Karla walking away.  He looks over at the Jokers.  They're still staring hard.  Craig just looks away and walks into the house. \nINT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nCraig steps into the house. \nUNCLE ELROY Nephew, you got perfect timing... \nUncle Elroy is sitting on the couch.  He has a Phillies' Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other. \nUNCLE ELROY (cont'd) We about to start a little puff, puff give in this mothafucka.  Are you down? \nSuga is sippin' on a glass of wine.  She moves over, making room in the middle. \nSUGA (patting the couch) Come on, Craig.  Sit down right here. \nCraig does.  Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight. Uncle Elroy licks the cigar. \nSUGA Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here. \nSuga takes Elroy's hand. \nUNCLE ELROY Make yourself at home. \nThey both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone.  It's too quiet now.  He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV.  Flicks a few channels.  He picks up the blunt and the lighter. \nON TV \nA public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center. It's SMOKEY! \nSMOKEY (V.O.) Hi, my name is Smokey.  And I'm a bud- head.  But here at the King/Drew Rehab Center, they help you curve your crave for marijuana but still let you get your drank on. \nHe lifts a 22 oz. bottle of Olde English. \nSMOKEY (cont'd) (V.O.) It's too hard to stop everything all at once.  So some days they let you smoke, but not drank.  And other days you can drank, but not smoke.  And if you're really making progress, the nurses will get fucked up wit you.  Helping you kick the habit by smoking up all yo shit.  So come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center and put down the joint, but B.Y.O.B., man! \nBACK ON COUCH \nCraig is high.  He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on his face.  It seems like the walls are shaking.  He looks over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic Park.  Plaster falls from the ceiling.  He listens, it's Uncle Elroy and Suga making love. \nUNCLE ELROY (O.S.) Oh, baby, right there.  Right there...bite the nipple, baby.  Bite it! Bite it!  Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come on, baby, get busy... \nHis eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door. Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move.  The KNOCKING gets LOUDER. \nDELIVERY GUY (O.S.) Delivery! \nCRAIG Hold on. \nCraig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area.  The KNOCKING CONTINUES. \nDELIVERY GUY (O.S.) Delivery! \nCRAIG I said hold on! \nDELIVERY GUY (O.S.) Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here. \nCraig stops what he's doing and swings the door open. \nON PORCH \nThe DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts and a buzz cut, is looking into the house. \nCRAIG Can I help you? \nDELIVERY GUY Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for? \nCRAIG I don't play for no team. \nDELIVERY GUY Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you? \nCRAIG (in his face) Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets? \nDELIVERY GUY Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery. \nHe hands Craig a letter. \nDELIVERY GUY (cont'd) Sign here. \nCraig signs. \nCRAIG What is it? \nDELIVERY GUY Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course. \nHe laughs and walks off singing the \"Good Times\" jingle. \nDELIVERY GUY (cont'd) '...temporary layoffs?  Good Times...hustling and surviving... Good Times...ain't we lucky we got'em...' Oh shit! \nEZAL What urgent message? \nDEBO If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call. \nEZAL That ain't gonna work. \nDebo slaps him in the back of the head. \nDEBO Just do it. \nEZAL I don't know the number. \nSmack!  Debo slaps him again. \nDEBO It's on the outside of the building, now pick the phone up! \nEzal picks up the phone.

Debo opens the back and lets all the dogs out.  They run for it. \nDEBO (cont'd) After I get in, close the door. \nDebo is a hard fit.  Ezal stuffs him in there. \nEZAL You too big. \nDEBO Keep pushing. \nFinally he's in.  Ezal gets in and slams the door shut.  Just then, Mr. Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich in hand. \nMR. JONES Oh my God! \nHe gets in and speeds off. \nEXT.

A few people exit the store with bags. \nDay-Day is scanning inventory.  A bud-head by the name of ROACH is on top of the counter with his skateboard. \nROACH Yo, Day-Day!  Check me out. \nHe tries to jump off the counter and land perfectly on his board.  Wrong!  Off the board and on his ass. \nDAY-DAY Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me? \nROACH I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.

It's got to be Craig. \nAT FRONT DOOR \nThey observe the \"Yes We're Open\" sign. \nD'WANA That white boy said he was in there. \nBABY'D Day-Day, don't make me break this window! \nCraig is peeking out.  He hesitates. \nBACK STORAGE AREA \nDAY-DAY Shit. \nDay-Day makes a run for it.  She spots him ducking out the back door. \nD'WANA He's in there! \nINSIDE STORE \nBaby'D knocks Craig out of the way. \nBABY'D Where is he? \nD'WANA He ran out the door. \nBaby'D gives chase with D'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind. \nEXT.

Baby'D is chasing Day-Day all through the parking lot.  Craig, D'Wana and Roach stop to watch. \nROACH Haul ass, dude.  Don't stop. \n...and he is. \nCRAIG You better stop running from that girl. \nDAY-DAY Fuuuuuuck -- U! \nHe runs back towards his BMW.  The chase continues around his car.  Baby'D is starting to tire. \nDAY-DAY (cont'd) I'mma shoot yo' big ass. \nD'Wana watches from a distance.  Craig and Roach are close. \nROACH (smiling) She moves well for a big girl. \nJust then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying a couple of bags.  She taps Craig on his shoulder.  He turns around. \nKARLA Hello, remember me? \nCRAIG Hell yeah, I remember you. \nKARLA I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes. \nCRAIG It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys. \nKARLA I just wanted to give you this. \nShe hands him a card with her number on it. \nKARLA (cont'd) If my brothers wasn't so over-protective, I'd have you call the house.  But for now just page me when you get a chance. \nCRAIG Most definitely. \nKARLA Better sooner than later. \nShe picks up her shopping bags and walks away.  Over at the chase: Baby'D is winded.  She bends over trying to catch her breath. \nDAY-DAY Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as usual.  So what can we do to end it this time?  What you want?  Another Big Pun CD?  'Cause I gotta get back to work. \nBaby'D looks over at Craig. \nBABY'D Okay, I know what I want this time. \nDAY-DAY Anything you need. \nBABY'D Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up. \nROACH Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day. \nCRAIG Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend. \nROACH That's fuckin' poetic, Craig. \nDay-Day is still sad. \nROACH (cont'd) I know how you feeling.  And if I had my bong right now, I'd let you 'toke 'til you choke.'  Dude, right here.  All out. No lungs.  All I got is this. \nRoach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it. \nCRAIG What's the green stuff poking out? \nROACH That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite? \nCRAIG Naw, I already ate. \nROACH Come on, Day, try it.  For moms. \nDay-Day shakes his head.  Craig reaches into his fifth pocket. \nCRAIG It ain't a bong but, wa-la! \nHe has the joint from this morning. \nROACH Wo! \nRoach snatches it. \nCRAIG Hey. \nCraig snatches it back. \nROACH Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that? \nCRAIG Black magic. \nDay-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth. \nDAY-DAY Give me dat.  I'm the one with the problem. \nRoach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter. \nROACH Weed doesn't solve problems.  It eases the mind, and the soul.  Enjoy. \nHe lights the joint.  Day-Day takes a hit. \nCRAIG I didn't think you smoked bud that much. \nDAY-DAY (letting out the smoke) I don't. \nROACH (taking the joint) I do. \nDAY-DAY Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it. \nROACH (hitting it good) Sorry, dude. \nCRAIG You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out. \nDAY-DAY Ain't no windows in here. \nROACH I got an idea. \nHe hands the joint to Craig.  Gets up and closes the door. Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner. \nROACH (cont'd) This is a little theory of mine... it should work. \nHe plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON.  He puts the nozzle in Day-Day's face. \nPINKY I said shut up!  Now who sent you? \nCRAIG Nobody! \nPINKY If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing! \nPinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets. \nPINKY (cont'd) You ain't got no gun, but where's the weed at?  I smell it. \nCraig says nothing. \nPINKY (cont'd) I'mma tie you ass up! \nPinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard.  The gun goes flying and so does he.  Pinky falls on his ass.  The 9mm lands in front of Craig.  There's a big scramble for the gun. \nBACK STORAGE AREA \nThe mood is serious. \nDAY-DAY I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow. \nROACH You could sell your Beamer. \nDay-Day gives Roach the evil-eye. \nROACH (cont'd) My bad. \nDAY-DAY I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here. \nROACH Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money. \nDAY-DAY Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach. \nROACH I know. \nBACK INSIDE STORE \nPinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun.  The store looks like a tornado hit it.  Twice.  Craig comes up with the pistol.  Pinky jumps on the ground. \nPINKY Don't kill me. \nCraig is exhausted.  He stands over Pinky with the gun. \nCRAIG Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back. \nPINKY Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all. \nJust then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back. \nDAY-DAY Craig, what the hell are you doing? \nCRAIG Nothing. \nPINKY Day-Day, is this your cousin? \nDAY-DAY Yeah. \nPINKY Good.  You fired...and, Roach, your fired too. \nROACH Why me? \nPINKY I smell weed. \nHe looks up at Craig. \nPINKY (cont'd) And you...you lucky.  I was just about to get in yo' ass.  Now give me my pistol back and get the hell out my store. \nCraig looks at Day-Day.  Day-Day looks back at him.  Nobody's high now. \nMICHAEL JORDAN Don't nobody go in the bathroom for about 35, 40 minutes. \nMr. Jones is stunned. \nMR. JONES Hey, you that boy? \nJordan jumps in his car and he's gone.  Mr. Jones is happy he's just seen Michael Jordan. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) (smiling) Ain't that something, Michael Jordan. \nHe walks in the bathroom. \nINSIDE \nReality hits, it stinks up in there.  Mr. Jones fronds. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) Oh, Michael, that boy better check his drawls. \nHe starts to spray. \nEXT.

I can't think with you falling everywhere. \nHis board continues to roll into the street.  At this same time, Joker's low-rider rolls by and breaks his board in two. Roach runs to pick up the pieces. \nROACH My board! \nThe Joker Bros. back their low-rider into the driveway.  They have no sympathy.  Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard. He's happy to see them. \nThey stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with them.  Joker spots our trio looking. \nJOKER What the fuck you looking at? \nDAY-DAY Nothing. \nROACH You ran over my board! \nJOKER So what?

Take it and see what's in it. \nDAY-DAY You make it sound so easy. \nCRAIG It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco.

Baby Joker's pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting it.  They stop when they hear CHEECO BARKING. \nBABY JOKER Want me to take a look? \nJOKER No, keep working. \nIn the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the curtain.  The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye looking in. \nJust then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt off and two half-naked girls on his arms. \nLI'L JOKER Yo, man fuck that shit.

Day-Day holds his stomach. \nDAY-DAY I got the B-G's. \nROACH \n... his meat supply is almost gone.  He tries to think fast. Cheeco starts to look for more meat.  Roach grabs the smashed brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco.  He swallows it in one big gulp.  He's looking for more.  There is no more.  Roach smiles.  CHEECO GROWLS. \nROACH Good boy.  Nice dog. \nCHEECO'S STILL GROWLING.  Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his butt and lets out a slight moan. \nCHEECO'S POV \nCheeco is looking up at Roach.

{"test1_input": "\"Next Friday\" -- by Ice Cube \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - OVERHEAD SHOT - NIGHT \nDEBO is laid out on the grass. \nCRAIG (V.O.) In the movies, when you beat up the neighborhood bully; you suppose to live happily ever after.  But around here; that's when all the drama begins... \nBlue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.  Two sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.  They flash their lights on him. \nCRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) Last Friday; I got fired for the first time.  I got high for the first time.  I got shot at for the first time and I kicked Debo's ass for the first time... \nThey get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.  The sheriffs laugh at him. \nDebo looks dazed and confused.  The sheriffs help him out the bushes and start to cuff him. \nCRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) I was the man that night; and Debo ended up going to jail for a couple of years. But he told Ezal he was getting out next Friday.  He said, when he see me, he was gonna smoke me on the spot... \nThey walk him OUT OF FRAME... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nOVER BLACK: \nCRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) And today is next Friday... \nSOUNDTRACK! \n\"New Line Cinema presents, etc., etc... \nFADE IN: \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING \nOPENING CREDITS.  It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks over the LA skyline.  As the city starts to awake and the credits continue to roll; we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los Angeles.  It seems that they all move to the same beat. \nEXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS \nDebo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.  Still in his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the street.  Everybody clears his path. \nSOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'. \nDebo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way. \nStill walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the sidewalk (losing cool points). \nThree little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking towards them.  They scream and take off in the other direction.  He smiles.  Briefly. \nStill walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on the ground holding his eye. \nDebo continues to ride through the city. \nHe turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's house. \nEXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nMr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house. \nA CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the lawn.  It starts to BARK at Debo.  He looks down at the dog and kicks him in the street.  The DOG YIPES! \nDebo focuses his attention on Craig's house. \nINT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nThe hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's father), storms out of the bedroom.  He struggles to put on his dog catcher's uniform.  He stops at the bathroom door and knocks hard. \nMR. JONES Craig!  Craig!  Off yo' ass and on yo' feet; this ain't the time to beat your meat! \nMr. Jones laughs at himself. \n", "test1_true": "MR. JONES Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way! \nMr. Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat. \nINT. BATHROOM - CLOSE-UP ON HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS \nHands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine.  A pack of Zigzags fall INTO FRAME.  Papers are ripped from the package. \nCLOSE UP ON CRAIG JONES \nthe doctor of this delicate operation. \nCRAIG (V.O.) Soon as my pops found out what Debo said to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my uncle and little cousin in Rancho Cucamonga.  Til' things calm down, or Debo went back to prison.  Whichever comes first. \nHe's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting the finishing touches on his masterpiece.  He licks, rolls and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans. \nCRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) I feel like the biggest punk around here. I wiped Debo's ass.  He should be the one moving. \nHe exits. \nEXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nThe front door opens.  Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling back into the house. \nMR. JONES Craig!  Let's go!  I don't wanna hit that traffic. \nHe steps off the porch backwards and into \"fresh Chihuahua shit.\"  He slips and falls on the grass. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) I be got damn. \nMr. Jones gets up.  He brushes the grass off his uniform.  He looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all over his back and butt. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) Craig!  Craig! \nCraig emerges from the house with his bags in hand. \nCRAIG (irritated) Here I come! \nMR. JONES (still mad) Well bring yo' ass on... \nCraig slams the door and starts towards the truck. \nCRAIG What's the matter? \nMR. JONES I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up! \nMr. Jones gets in the truck.  Craig jumps in.  They back out and pull off. \nINT. DOG TRUCK - MOVING - CLOSE-UP ON CRAIG - CONTINUOUS \nHe's daydreaming about Smokey. \nCRAIG (V.O.) I didn't wanna leave my neighborhood at all.  Especially my homeboy Smokey.  But he went to rehab last week.  I know I'mma miss him... \nOut of nowhere, Debo jumps in front of the truck.  Mr. Jones slams on the BRAKES. \nDEBO Craig!  Get out the car, boy!  This the rematch! \nDebo reaches for his shank.  Craig turns to Mr. Jones! \nCRAIG Daddy, punch it! \nMr. Jones floors it and hits Debo.  He falls over the hood, off the car and in the street.  The yellow truck speeds off. \nDebo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises. \nDEBO You know I'mma find you!  You can run ya' can't hide! \nBACK IN CAR - CONTINUOUS \n", "test1_id": 525, "test2_input": "Craig screams out the window. \nCRAIG You fake ass Suge Knight! \nMr. Jones is a bit shaken up. \nMR. JONES That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now. \nCRAIG (with attitude) Ya'll making me look like a punk. \nMR. JONES It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this... \nCraig smells something in the air. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) My great, great grand daddy on my Momma side; had a saying... 'See a fool -- leave a fool.'  Somebody else a get him. Plus, I don't want that fool shooting at my house trying to hit yo' ass. \nCRAIG What's that smell? \nMr. Jones sniffs. \nMR. JONES Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing. \nCRAIG (holding his nose) I do. \nMR. JONES What it smell like? \nCRAIG Smells like you didn't fall in no mud. \nMr. Jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat.  He starts to spray too much.  Craig's window won't roll down. \nCRAIG (cont'd) What's wrong with the window? \nMR. JONES I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down. \nCRAIG All damn. \nMR. JONES Just hold your breath. \nEXT. CITY OF RANCHO CUCAMONGA - MORNING \nThey exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads, \"Rancho Cucamonga\" (the city away from the city). \nEXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS \nWelcome to the suburbs.  Where the \"Smiley Happy People\" live in peace and quiet. \nThe neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story track homes as far as the eye can see.  The yellow truck drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac.  Mr. Jones BLOWS the HORN. \nMR. JONES Nice neighborhood, huh? \nCRAIG It's alright. \nMR. JONES 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out. \nCRAIG Why they got to have the loudest house on the block! \nUncle Elroy's house is royal blue with gold trim.  All the other houses are painted in earth tones. \nMR. JONES Ah, son, don't be no hater.  You know your uncle ain't got no taste.  Just don't let him rub off on you. \nCraig grabs his bags. \nCRAIG You coming in? \nMR. JONES No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand? \nCRAIG Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more. \nAs craig gets out;  the front door flies open.  It's DAY-DAY (22), Craig's crazy younger cousin.  He yells back into the house. \n", "test2_true": "Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound. \nCRAIG What's crackin'? \nDAY-DAY You.  Hi, Uncle Willie. \nMR. JONES Hey, Day-Day.  Where's yo' big head father? \nDAY-DAY There he is. \nJust then, UNCLE ELROY (42) hits the door.  Dressed in boxers and a T-shirt.  This is Mr. Jones' (very loud) little brother. \nUNCLE ELROY Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'? \nCRAIG Naw, it ain't like that. \nUNCLE ELROY If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson. \nCRAIG Alright, I'll remember that. \nUNCLE ELROY You know me?  I would've shot his big ass. (peeking into the ear) Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day? \nUncle Elroy laughs.  Mr. Jones isn't amused. \nMR. JONES Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy. \nUNCLE ELROY Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew? \nUncle Elroy hugs Craig by the arm. \nMR. JONES Craig, remember what I told you. \nCRAIG I'll remember. \nMr. Jones pulls off.  Uncle Elroy yells out to him. \nUNCLE ELROY Send Betty my love. (to Craig) Boy you looking good. (grabbing his bags) I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you. \nCRAIG Thanks, Unc. \nUncle Elroy starts towards to the house. \nDAY-DAY You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion. \nCRAIG I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat. \nDay-Day laughs. \nDAY-DAY Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun. \nCRAIG I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch. \nDAY-DAY I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen. \nThey do.  It is quiet, except for a few BIRDS SINGING. \nDAY-DAY (cont'd) Shit sound good, huh? \nJust then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up the block.  It's the Jokers: JOKER (28), LI'L JOKER (21) and BABY JOKER (15).  They pull into their driveway. \nDAY-DAY (cont'd) Aw damn. \nIn SLOW MOTION: One by one they get out the car.  They have a dog with them named \"Cheeco.\"  As they get to the front door they all look over at Craig and Day-Day. \nDay-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them.  They disappear inside. \nCRAIG Who is that? \nDAY-DAY Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall. \n", "test2_id": 526, "test3_input": "PINKY I said shut up!  Now who sent you? \nCRAIG Nobody! \nPINKY If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing! \nPinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets. \nPINKY (cont'd) You ain't got no gun, but where's the weed at?  I smell it. \nCraig says nothing. \nPINKY (cont'd) I'mma tie you ass up! \nPinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard.  The gun goes flying and so does he.  Pinky falls on his ass.  The 9mm lands in front of Craig.  There's a big scramble for the gun. \nBACK STORAGE AREA \nThe mood is serious. \nDAY-DAY I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow. \nROACH You could sell your Beamer. \nDay-Day gives Roach the evil-eye. \nROACH (cont'd) My bad. \nDAY-DAY I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here. \nROACH Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money. \nDAY-DAY Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach. \nROACH I know. \nBACK INSIDE STORE \nPinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun.  The store looks like a tornado hit it.  Twice.  Craig comes up with the pistol.  Pinky jumps on the ground. \nPINKY Don't kill me. \nCraig is exhausted.  He stands over Pinky with the gun. \nCRAIG Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back. \nPINKY Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all. \nJust then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back. \nDAY-DAY Craig, what the hell are you doing? \nCRAIG Nothing. \nPINKY Day-Day, is this your cousin? \nDAY-DAY Yeah. \nPINKY Good.  You fired...and, Roach, your fired too. \nROACH Why me? \nPINKY I smell weed. \nHe looks up at Craig. \nPINKY (cont'd) And you...you lucky.  I was just about to get in yo' ass.  Now give me my pistol back and get the hell out my store. \nCraig looks at Day-Day.  Day-Day looks back at him.  Nobody's high now. \n", "test3_true": "Mr. Jones' dog truck is weaving in and out of traffic. \nINT. TRUCK - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - CONTINUOUS \nMr. Jones is driving and eating at the same time.  He finishes off the last few bites of his sandwich. \nMR. JONES Just hold on, Craig.  I'm on my way. \nINT. BACK OF TRUCK - MONTAGE SEQUENCE \nDebo and Ezal are smashed inside the dog cages. \nEZAL Debo!  Debo! \nDEBO What? \nEZAL I can't feel my legs no more. \nDEBO Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga? \nEZAL I don't know. \nEXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - MONTAGE SEQUENCE \nThe Beamer pulls into the driveway.  Our trio get out with very long faces. \nCRAIG (V.O.) In a strange way, I feel responsible for Day-Day getting fired.  If I wouldn't have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the joint, he'd still have a job. \nDay-Day walks into the house while Craig and Roach stay out on the porch. \nINT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MONTAGE SEQUENCE \nUncle Elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a S&M mask and holding a tube of KY jelly.  He removes the mask.  Day-Day hands him the notice.  Uncle Elroy takes it with his greasy hands. \nUNCLE ELROY Ah damn.  Damn. \nDAY-DAY I got fired too. \nUNCLE ELROY What?! \nHe starts to beat Day-Day with a sex toy. \nEXT. FREEWAY - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - AFTERNOON \nThe dog truck exits the freeway.  He pulls into a gas station by the freeway.  He stops near the restrooms and jumps out, air freshner in hand.  When he gets to the door, it's locked. \nMR. JONES Damn. \nHe knocks. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) Say, man, hurry up.  We got an emergency out here. \nNo answer.  Mr. Jones paces nervously. \nMR. JONES (cont'd) I knew I shouldn't have ordered that extra hot sauce. \nEXT. UNCLE ELROY'S PORCH - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - LATE AFTERNOON \nCraig and Day-Day are trying to think.  Roach is practicing skateboard moves.  He's not very good. \nDAY-DAY Man, sit down. \nEXT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - MONTAGE SEQUENCE \nHe knocks again. \nMR. JONES Say, man, what the hell you doing in there?  Open the door. \nJust then the door opens and out walks MICHAEL JORDAN. \n", "test3_id": 527}

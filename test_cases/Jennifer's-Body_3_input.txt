FEMALE COP At least we've already got a confession. NEEDY Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace. She giggles maniacally. Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. It's a soaring rock anthem-- the SAME SONG we heard being piped into solitary confinement. 
Both cops BRIGHTEN when they hear the song. Roman cranks the volume. ROMAN God, I love this song. FEMALE COP I know. And they've done so much for this town. 
ROMAN They're way more than a band, really. They're heroes. FEMALE COP Wait, this is my favorite part... Roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the uplifting, corny song: 
FEMALE COP AND ROMAN (in unison) "Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you, that you are home..." 
Needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over the forest on the horizon. NEEDY V.O. So I killed her. Whatever. It won't undo anything. Three pulses-- three lives-- all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust. It's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) We were our yearbook pictures. Nothing more, nothing less. 
We see a brief montage of black-and-white yearbook stills: JENNIFER executing the splits on a football field, her smile bright. NEEDY inspecting a school newspaper layout, pen in hand, glasses on her nose. And finally, CHIP DOVE, playing a strap-on snare drum at a school pep rally, his head bent in concentration.... 
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) Jesus, Chip.. 
The photo fades into the pep rally itself. CHIP is animated, drumming in full color... 
INT. KETTLE HIGH - DAY CHIP drums on the sidelines of the Devil's Kettle High basketball court. The stands are packed with BORED STUDENTS for a pep rally. Chip is 16, clean cut, and an awful drummer. NEEDY V.O. Chip couldn't drum for shit. He only knew "Land of a Thousand Dances" and the solo from "Wipeout." Lucky for him, the pep band gig wasn't too demanding. 
Sure enough, the band is playing "Land of a Thousand Dances." Nearby, the FLAG TEAM claps with gloved hands, picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt. 
Jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform, breathtakingly beautiful. She hoists her flag aloft, twirling it. Time FREEZES as the flag unfurls. NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) If you can believe it, that's Jennifer. Yeah, the same girl I iced with the box-cutter. Only back then, we were tight. Sisters, practically. People found it hard to believe that a babe like Jennifer would associate with a dork like me. But we'd been the Wonder Twins since we were practically preverbal. Sandbox love never dies. 
Jennifer finishes her maneuver and WAVES to the stands. Needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers, small and owlish with glasses and lank hair. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHASTITY, a similarly geeky-looking girl standing next to Needy, rolls her eyes at this display of affection. CHASTITY You're totally lesbigay. NEEDY What? She's my best friend. The geeky girl mockingly imitates Needy's excited wave. CHASTITY You stare at her like you want to dry hump her. Needy ignores her. CHASTITY (CONT'D) Like, hump her through pants. NEEDY (INTERRUPTING) Are you jealous? 
CHASTITY Of what? That rich bitch? NEEDY She's not rich. 
INT. KETTLE HIGH HALLWAY - AFTER SCHOOL Needy digs through her locker, carefully selecting textbooks to take home. Jennifer skips up to her, smiling. JENNIFER Hey, Monistat. NEEDY What's up, Vagisil? JENNIFER You and me are going out tonight. 
She checks herself out in Needy's locker mirror. NEEDY Tonight? Why? JENNIFER Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JENNIFER (CONT'D) And it's all-ages, for once, which means I won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy. NEEDY What's Soft Shoulder?

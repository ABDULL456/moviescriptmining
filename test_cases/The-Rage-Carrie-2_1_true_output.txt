INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks and a notebook. An all-night study session. His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on one side of his face. Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant. The only light comes from his desk lamp. He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M. 
JESSE (rubs his eyes) Jesus. WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face. The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him. In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING MIDNIGHT: One, two...

On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then scurries under the bed. JESSE is writing, in the MIRROR above h A WOMAN' s FIGURE anding in the French doors, her face hidden up, sees the WOMAN reflected, spins to watch her stop forward into the light. It's RACHEL, in hAk slip dress.

SLAM CUT TO 
INT . DORM ROOM, NOTRE DAME - NIGH a' A LOUD SCREAM as JESSE jerks awake at his desk. His heart FATIM like it's about to explode from his mouth. He looks down at the paper in front of him. Filled only with his study notes. The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been stirred by the scream.

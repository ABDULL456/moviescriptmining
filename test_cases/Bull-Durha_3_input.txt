ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his act. 
P.O.V. A LATIN PLAYER PLAYING PEPPER. 
ANNIE Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he? 
JACKSON (reading the program) Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year. 
ANNIE Three-fourteen? Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson. 
BACK TO MAX PATKIN -- He finishes his routine. 
RECORDING OVER P.A. Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight. 
INT.  PRESS BOX -- NIGHT 
CUT TO: 
A WOMAN ANNOUNCER, MARYLOU, 30, speaks into the P.A. mike. 
ANNOUNCER Let's hear it for Max Patkin -- 
Applause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE.

INT. THE DUGOUT 
CLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black. Smoking a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team, as -- 
EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove. 
EBBY I'm there, Skip, I'm ready.

INT. THE PRESS BOX 
THE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've seen a million minor league players come and go. 
WHITEY Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred grand? I hear he's a quart low? 
TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (covering the mike) He's left handed. Whattya expect? (on the air) The Bulls are off to a slow start having dropped their first three games, but hope to turn it around tonight with the professional debut of the heralded young left hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. (beat) Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox is leadoff hitter Willie Foster

EXT. THE BALLFIELD -- NIGHT 
ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for wisdom and insight. 
ANNIE -- Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble. 
MILLIE I got lured. 
ANNIE You didn't get "lured". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it -- "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". 
MILLIE "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". 
ANNIE That's better. (to Jackson) Got the radar ready? 
JACKSON Ready. 
JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate. 
THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in. 
TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (V.O.) The word on LaLoosh is that the good looking young lefty has a major league fastball but sometimes has problems with his control. 
EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop, and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX.

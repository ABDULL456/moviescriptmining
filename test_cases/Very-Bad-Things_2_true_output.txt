Fisher and Adam power shooting Tequila. 
FISHER The bucks gonna stop right here. (pounds his chest) If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium... I won't stare him down. 
ADAM Don't ever stare him down. 
FISHER I won't do it. 
ADAM Don't eyeball your kids. 
MOORE 
On the coffee table, dances the beasty dance. 
THE BAR 
BOYD The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction. 
MICHAEL They need leadership. 
BOYD That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike -- the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right? 
The DOOR BELL RINGS. 
BALCONY 
ADAM I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather... 
FISHER I know and I'm honored... 
ADAM If anything ever happens to me... 
FISHER I know... 
ADAM Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little... 
Moore is on the balcony. 
MOORE The stripper's here. 
ADAM (bombed) Excellent. 
He and Fisher stagger aside. 
HOTEL SUITE 
Boyd introduces TINA, a devastatingly sexy Asian girl, to all the boys. 
BOYD Gentlemen, this is Tina. 
The guys, wasted, attempt to greet Tina. 
TINA Who's the lucky groom? 
The guys point at Fisher, roaring. Tina presses her lips to Fisher's ear. 
TINA Hi Fisher. 
Boyd dims the lights, cranks up the MUSIC as the guys stumble for position on and around the couch. Tina starts to move, very sexy. 
Michael tokes a joint. 
MICHAEL God, I love women. 
TINA'S DANCE MONTAGE 
SERIES OF SHOTS: 
TINA dances, slowly peeling off her clothes. 
The guys are into it. Michael seems especially turned-on. 
Tina moves in on Fisher, starts a very nasty lap dance... somehow incorporating a rubber hose. 
The guys hoop and holler... 
Michael is mesmerized... 
Tina grinds on Fisher's lap, touching her nipples... 
Michael's going crazy... He tries to touch her, she slaps his hand away...

O Priest lowers his head. The following having been spoken by him all too often. 
PRIEST "You shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit... The words are heavy, each harder than the next. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) -- As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be. World without end." 
(BEAT) Amen. 
IN THE DISTANCE A FIGURE escapes through the dust, lurching towards the Cities,-- It's Black Hat. 
PRIEST sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess, brushing the hair from her face. 
PRIESTESS I wish we could've had more time. 
PRIEST .Me too. She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest. 
PRIESTESS Wherever it is we go -- we go together, right? She smiles weakly... but Priest can see she's scared. He gives her one last kiss, cradling her body, sand circling them as she draws her final breath. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE WASTELAND - DUSK 
The sun setting on the horizon. A nearby PYRE consumes the last of the Priestess' body as Priest saddles up on a vampire bike, the flames rising behind him. Hicks approaches, Lucy huddled in a blanket, shivering. The two men exchange a look, the snap and flash of the fire reflecting in their eyes. 
HICKS When you're finished -- You know where to find me. A tense beat then Priest GUNS the engine. Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes towards the Cities, the sky above the color of hellfire. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CITIES NIGHT 
The sound of a CHOIR. The soaring, ethereal tones carrying us through the forest of BRICK SMOKESTACKS-- finally coming to rest on A GIANT CROSS atop a mosaic BASILLICA, the colored tiles black with ash. We're back in CLERGY CITY. 
INT. CLERGY CATHEDRAL - NIGHT 
Evening mass. The place is packed, every pew filled with 
WORSHIPERS. 
CROSSCUT TO., 
INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - SAME 
Shadows and light. A cabal of MONSIGNORS stand shrouded in white robes, awaiting to be anointed by ORELAS. A private ceremony. 
CROSSCUT TO: 
INT. CATHEDRAL - SAME 
A LINE OF CHILDREN kneel before the altar, the MONSIGNOR raising the Host, offering communion. He suddenly stops, his expression dropping as 
PRIEST Slowly makes his way down the aisle, bruised and bloodied, his very presence a direct affront to this place. A woman GASPS, somebody faints. 
CROSSCUT TO: 
INT. CHAMBER - SAME 
Orelas dips his hand in water, touching a Monsignor's forehead.

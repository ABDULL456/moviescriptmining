{"test1_input": "An owl hoots from the trees behind. She freezes, eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger. \nShe waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more between the edge of the development and the edge of the trees. \nShe's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and form. \nOn one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. On the other, plots and structures of homes to be. \nShe keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees, following the lights in the distance. \nShe hears a loud thudding noise. Stops. Stops breathing. \nEXT. PLANKS IN TARP - EVENING \nAhead, piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view. \nShe braces herself, peers cautiously around, sees nothing. She clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards. \nScene 82Page 46 \nRain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp causing the sound. \nShe breathes a sigh of relief. \nEXT. CEMENT PILES - EVENING \nHeaps of damp shingle and cement cause her to back up and around past them and a cement mixer. She loses sight of the neon mall lights. She panics. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING \nShe runs between the foundations of two houses. \nShe stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming across her path. \nShe ducks down the side of a half finished house. \nSees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck. \nShe keeps going, between the houses, looking for a sign of the mall lights. \nShe stops. \nJust ahead, a flurry of footprints. \nThey're her footprints! \nEXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING \nShe finds herself back where she started, at the same house. \nThe mall lights flicker in the distance as far away as they always were. The Ford's still there ahead. \nAnd then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her. \nDELLA (under her breath) NO! OH NO. \nShe bites back a sob. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING \nDella shrinks backwards between the houses. She ducks into an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead. \nScene 86Page 47 \nShe runs into the house and out through the far side. Skirts a row of plots of land. Then, she hears Chuckie's mocking voice, echoing through the building site. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) DELLA! \nDella recoils. Did she just hallucinate? \nHow the hell do they know her name? \nCan they see her? Or is he just shouting her name randomly into the night? \nHer eyes dart right then left then back again.   Nothing. \nShe runs down a row of house foundations. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Della! \nINT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 2 - EVENING \nDella dives into an unfinished house, hides behind a space where a window will eventually be, looks out across the building site. All is dark outside. And then she sees the light several rows down, weaving between the houses. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -EVENING \nShe creeps out of the house and crosses several rows of houses, then several more, heading towards the neon lights in the distance. \nEXT. FENCE -EVENING \nShe stops dead in her tracks. Straight ahead, a truly chilling sight - her kids stuff from the car : Terri's little anorak, Tammi's socks, mittens, strung along a short stretch of wire fence. \nHer feet start to sink into wet mud. She covers her mouth to stop herself crying out. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -EVENING \nSuddenly the development is illuminated by a huge construction light. \nScene 91Page 48 \nEXT. MUD -EVENING \nDella ducks down, tries to run. The mud cloys at her feet. \nEXT. PLANK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES -EVENING \nShe steps up onto a plank that stretches between the first floors of two houses. She starts to cross when she sees their silhouettes. \nEXT./INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 3 -EVENING \nThey're searching the house next door. \nTOMAS Where'd little red riding hood git to? \nVINH She ain't leaving any bread crumbs that's for sure. \nHUEY When a nigga hungry, Imma wolf. \nEXT. PLANK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES - EVENING \nShe backs up, slips, slides off the plank, falls into the mud, catches herself on some barbed wire. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) What was that? \nThe wire drives through her coat and into her right shoulder. \nShe jerks away but the length of loose barbed wire follows. She bites her lip to prevent a pained response. \nShe's caught in its spiral like a trapped animal. She spins around and physically pulls the wire from her back, tearing her coat. \nShe casts the wire away from her. Winces. \nINT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 (FOUNDATION) -EVENING \nShe crawls into the foundations of a nearby house, underneath the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first floor. She huddles in a dark corner. It's very quiet and cramped. She tries not to move, not to breathe. The smell of the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous. A moment passes. It feels like an infinity. \nScene 95Page 49 \nShe starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see if she can see anything above. Just as she approaches the gap she hears. \nThe sound of footsteps above her. \nShe freezes. \nThe footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks. \nShe silently undoes the catch of the toolbox. Her hands are shaking. She lifts the lid. She rakes around inside for tools, comes across several kids toys instead! In shock, she rakes around some more, trying to find something else, something more dangerous, anything. To her surprise the only tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small crescent wrench. The kids must have borrowed the other tools replacing them with the toys. She gives up, closes over the lid. \nThen suddenly: \nBOOM \nINT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 -EVENING \nThe whole house is illuminated. She looks up to see four faces looking down at her. Chuckie points the gaze of a powerful flashlight directly into her eyes. \nThe beam almost blinds her. She tries to look away but Chuckie focuses it right in her eyes. \nCHUCKIE Peek a boo! \nShe shrinks back towards the wall. Her mouth feels dry, so dry. Tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so they can see her. She's cornered. \nChuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it voyeuristically down across her body. \nThe light lingers on her breasts. Huey whistles appreciatively, picks the game back up from the parking lot. \n", "test1_id": 81, "test2_input": "TOMAS (O.S.) What now, cabron? \nVINH (O.S.) Fell in a frozen ass stream. \nScene 103Page 64 \nChuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them. Della sees Vinh trudging out of the stream, Tomas descending the last few feet of the other side of the gulch and Chuckie midway up. \nVinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his sneakers. \nCHUCKIE Zipperhead! \nVINH Kon'aro Kusotare. \nCHUCKIE You know we don't speak the Chinky. \nVINH What's your game, Chuckie? We left stumbling around in the dark while you hog the flashlight. \nCHUCKIE I stole it. I get to use it. That's how it works. That right Tomas? \nTOMAS Right on, dog. \nChuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins Vinh and Tomas at the edge of the stream. \nVINH What if I steal it from you? \nCHUCKIE There you go, bro. \nHe hands the flashlight over to Vinh. Vinh reaches for it. Chuckie pulls it away. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) April Fool. Naw, wait a minute, it ain't April. Must be Christmas fool. \nTomas smirks. Vinh hangs his head down. They search for more prints, can't find any in the immediate area. Chuckie shines the flashlight at the foot of a big rock. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Her footprints disappear at the big rock. \nScene 103Page 65 \nA beat. Della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand. \nVinh shivers violently. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Head on up and search the slope. I'll guide your way with the flashlight. \nChuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch. Della ducks. \nDella needs to get out of there and fast. \nThey begin to ascend the rocks. Chuckie keeps the flashlight slightly ahead of them. \nDella crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light. \nThe boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees and hands to shreds. \nShe can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin. What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed. \nTOMAS We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch! \nGod please help her make it back into the cover of the trees. \nDella almost vomits. \nHer hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. She pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. Her strength is ebbing but she tries to hoist herself up. The flashlight sweeps by. She lets go of the ledge and ducks. The flashlight sweeps by again. \nShe huddles in behind a rock. Waits a beat. \nTOMAS (CONT'D) You going home in a casket tonight. \nOh shit, they're approaching fast. She tries again to hoist herself up. She's almost up when the flashlight sweeps by again. \nThis time, it catches her. \nCHUCKIE THERE SHE IS, TOP OF THE GULCH! \nScene 103Page 66 \nShe practically throws herself over the ledge. Tomas scurries to the top faster than lightening, catches her leg as she crawls from the edge. \nTHUD. She kicks him in the face. \nDella grabs the toolbox. Makes a run for it. \nTOMAS AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH! \n", "test2_true": "VINH AHHHHHHH! \nChuckie scales the gulch behind them. Vinh rubs his head. Sees something between the trees. Thinks it's Huey. \nVINH (CONT'D) Huey? \nHe starts towards the brush. \nVINH (CONT'D) Is that you, homie? \nChuckie catches up with Vinh, breathless from climbing fast. Vinh points into the brush. \nVINH (CONT'D) I saw Huey, there in the brush. \nCHUCKIE What? \nChuckie looks around, hoping against hope that Vinh may be right, that Huey may just be alive. Vinh becomes perplexed. \nVINH I saw him. \nCHUCKIE Sure you did, bro. \nChuckie puts his arm around Vinh and helps him up the rock side. Vinh is shivering so hard he's almost sobbing. \nJust ahead Tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge. \nScene 104Page 67 \nEXT.   WOODS - EVENING \nTomas catches up with Della, chases her into the trees. Behind him Vinh hoists himself up over the ledge, then Chuckie. \nDella runs. Faster than she's ever run before. Practically flies through the trees. \nHer breath comes hard. His too, just behind her. Their footfalls crash into the foliage. \nIt's dark, so dark. She's running blindly. \nAnd they're right behind her. Tomas swipes at her. He just misses. He swipes again. \nA twisted shape looms ahead, almost blocks her path. \nShe runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment, setting up Thomas who's right behind her. \nTomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk, hits himself at groin level. He doubles over in pain. \nTOMAS CONEJO! AIN'T NUTHIN' CAN SAVE YO ASS NOW. \nDella races on. \nThomas gathers himself together, picks up the chase. \nBut that moment's delay has bought her some time. \nHer adrenaline pumps hard. Eyes darting for a hiding place among the dark shapes and planes of the woods. \nEXT. DEADWOOD PILE - EVENING \nThere it is, a deadwood pile. \nShe throws herself down into its midst. The dried branches jag and tear at her hands and face. She burrows down low, so low she's right in the dirt. She peers between the branches. \nTomas's feet run by and disappear. She hears him circle the area then turn back towards her. \nA moment passes. She picks the next. Rises slowly and softly from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench. \nScene 105Page 68 \nAnd then there he is. Diving out of the trees towards her. \nDella raises the lug wrench. \nIn the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross. \nTomas crashes towards her. \nDella swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at Tomas's face. \nThere is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches him up under the chin. It sends him reeling. \nHe goes down face first. \n", "test2_id": 82, "test3_input": "She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst through the branches above and up into the patch of sky between. \nThe crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus. \nShe looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches along a branch to see better. \nThe light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye line, disorienting her. \nShe hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree. \nHer eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her. She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath. \nThe flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away up the embankment. \nBut Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up through the branches. \nTheir eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie. \nShe LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back. \nVINH (CONT'D) CHUUUCCKKKKIEEE! \nShe silences his yell with a choke hold. Wraps her legs around his torso. He bites her arm but she holds tight. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) Vinh? \nPanic has crept into Chuckie's voice. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) VINH? \nVinh topples to the mud, dragging Della with him. \nThey roll as he desperately tries to disengage her. \nThe flashlight frantically searches the area for them. \nDella frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve. \nShe DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull. \nScene 110Page 79 \nVinh screams. \nShe thrusts and twists the tool. \nAll the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined, intimate as a lover. \nShe drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair. \nVinh's scream becomes a high keening wail. \nThe screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood. \nHis scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins. \nThey roll downstream. \nHis arms are wrapped in a death grip around her. \nThey roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down. \nShe feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her. \nShe's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds the strength to push him off. \nShe crawls out from under his body. \nPushing him away, sets him off rolling again. \nShe tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head hurts so bad it's about to burst. \nThe world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to close it all out almost overwhelms her. \nHer shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark. \nThere's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes, looks around. \nIt's Vinh's body hitting the stream below. \nScene 110Page 80 \nWhere was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be seen now that's for sure. \n", "test3_true": "Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing, reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up. \nPlods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a diagonal through the darkness. \nShe arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like she's reached the eye of a terrible storm. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Della? \nWhen she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her, she almost smiles. \nShe knows he's coming for her and there's nothing she can do about it. \nDella shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead: four huge felled trees wrapped in white plastic. Their sad stumps are only feet away. It's the funeral parlour of the forest. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Delllaaa? \nEXT.   FELLED TREES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC - EVENING \nDella sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped tree. She listens hard, tries to fathom which direction he's coming from. \nHis voice drifts in and out of proximity like he's pacing around in circles. His voice has changed - he's dropped the gangster schtick. \nCHUCKIE There's only you and me, now. \nMaybe, if he wanders into the right position, she can sneak up on him from behind. She rakes about in the dirt looking for a rock or a stick. Then she remembers something, sticks her hand in her pocket, half smiles. \nScene 111Page 81 \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I saw a little trail of your blood back there. You must be hurt. \nDella checks out the bite mark on her arm to find it's still bleeding. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I'm hurting too. I think you busted up my collarbone. \nHis black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I know you can hear me, Della. \nChuckie sniffs. \nCHUCKIE? I can smell your blood, your sweat. I know you're close. \nChuckie's eyes glint in the darkness. \nCHUCKIE After what went down tonight, we got a special bond. \nDella listens, transfixed. \nHis dark shape beckons to her. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) May as well come out now, Della. \nShe doesn't move. \nShe watches him pace around trying to work out where she is. \nHe pulls out a pack of cigarettes, taps one out, lights it. Inhales. Exhales. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I'll save one for you, for when you decide to come out. \nHe inhales again, exhales. \nHe laughs admiringly. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You're one tough bitch. \nScene 111Page 82 \nThe tone of his voice begins to change. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) And that's hot, hell yeah. \nFrustration breaks through his voice. She can see his shadowy form moving through the darkness towards her. He stops. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) And they're really cute. \nChuckie clicks on the flashlight, shines it straight ahead - right in between the plastic wrapped trees. \nDella freezes.   They? \nChuckie's eyes penetrate the darkness. \n", "test3_id": 83}

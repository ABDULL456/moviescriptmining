{"train": "WHILE SHE WAS OUT \nWritten by \nSusan Montford \nBased on a short story by \nEdward Bryant \n5th draft December 20, 2006 \nMAP GRIDS \nFrom the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re- configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of forest and wilderness. \nCloser in on one last map grid which fades into a transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of the suburb. The name of this housing development is \"Pleasant Valley\". The transparency fades out to reveal: \nEXT.   PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING \nFrom a sign reading \"Pleasant Valley Dream Homes\", a picture postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity. \nEach home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an indistinguishable car parked in the driveway. \nAll the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths. \nThe sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer in the lights. \nWe halt outside one house. \nEXT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING \nThis home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting itself in a puddle on the wet lawn. \nSuddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with it's prey into the woods behind. \nCurtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He draws the curtains once again and disappears. \nINT. DELLA'S HOUSE/ KENNETH'S MEDIA ROOM - EVENING \nWe sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer. \nScene 3 Page 2 \nKENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face, pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up abruptly from his chair elated. \nKENNETH Yes! \nSteps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His ebullient mood changes quickly. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Damn! DELLA! \nThe sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening. DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent. She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans. \nShe sees the broken doll. \nDELLA SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll. \nShe walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of beer. \nKENNETH You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean? \nClose up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him, continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives' reading group? \nHe averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look at her once more. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) I got a new one for you. \nHe smiles sardonically. \nScene 3 Page 3 \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Group therapy for women who always have the curse. There's a Tuesday night class at the Pleasant Valley Episcopalian. \nKenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping from her mouth. \nDELLA I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper. \nA trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches Kenneth's eye. \nKENNETH What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this? \nINT. STAIRWAY - EVENING \nDella leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and opens the front door. The TV blares out some action flick from Kenneth's ajar door. \nTITLE     ---   \"WHILE SHE WAS OUT\" \nEXT.    DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING \nDella is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie silence of the suburbs. She closes the door softly behind her and rushes along the path to the driveway where the family's black Ford Explorer is parked. \nShe CHIRPS the remote and quickly climbs in. \nINT.    FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nDella inserts the key and turns it in the lock.    The car sputters in defiance against the cold night. \nDELLA Frick! \nThe car sputters again. \nDELLA (CONT'D) C'MON... \nWith a massive exertion, the car engine turns over and the vehicle starts. She sighs with relief. \nShe turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent, pauses to look at her home through the car window. For a second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of Tammi. \nShe smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the Christmas tree. She notices the fallen star, is about to get out of the car to retrieve it, but decides it's too cold. \nScene 11Page 7 \nA shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into reverse and backs up. \nEXT. PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING \nWe follow her as she backs up, pushes into drive and heads slowly down the boulevard. \nThe road is empty. All the cars are neatly tucked away in their driveways and it looks like no one's out tonight. She makes a right turn onto. \nEXT. PLEASANT VALLEY CRESCENT - EVENING \nShe follows the road as it curves around a long row of endlessly monotonous houses. In the distance, we can see the gates of Pleasant valley gated community. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nShe slows down, rolls down her window and swipes a chub card against the security panel. The gates slowly open. She drives through. The gates close behind her. She rolls the window up and makes a left turn onto. \nEXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING \nThe road is wider and framed on either side by the high walls of gated communities. A Ford Explorer just like hers passes in the opposite direction. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nDella smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment with her free hand. She pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her secret hiding place for: \nA nice pack of Marlboros. She smiles again - the smile of the secret smoker. She presses the cigarette lighter into the dashboard. \nThe lighter pops out. She tips out a cigarette, sees a sticky note attached to the interior foil. Scrawled in messy handwriting are the words - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUITTING DELLA HONEY. XOXO KENNETH. \nDELLA I'll get right on that Kenneth honey. AFTER you stop drinking. \nScene 16Page 8 \nShe rips the note off, stuffs it in her purse, lights the cigarette. \nShe inhales deeply.     We see the pleasure written across her face. \nEXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING \nA few cars pass Della in the night. Their lights are like torches in the suburban wilderness. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER/ EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING \nThere is the familiar ring of a cellular phone. Della has programmed one of those \"oh so cute\" recognizable tunes into it, like the \"William Tell overture\". \nDella holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her purse with the other. She eventually locates the phone. \nDELLA Hello? \nMARY (V.O.) Della, it's Mary Messina. \nDella rolls her eyes.     This is not a welcome call. \nDELLA Oh, hey. \nINT.   FORD EXPLORER - EVENING/ EXT CROSSROADS \nDella picks up the phone and pushes a few keys. She has not dialed enough to make a full phone call when we hear the phone RING on the other side. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Cellular 411 connect. How may I direct your call? \nDELLA The Learning Academy. Spring Street. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Please hold for that number. \nDella slows down for another red light. \nShe's at a wide crossroads where the housing development abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins. \nA billboard for another new housing development announces: \"GREEN STREET DREAM HOMES - Investment Opportunities\". \nWaiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from Della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof. \nDella tries not to look at it. \nA recording breaks into the moment just as the light ahead changes to green. \nScene 20Page 12 \nOPERATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) (recording) Press your pound key now to connect with your request. \nDella presses the pound key and drives straight ahead. \nMEGHAN (V.O.) Learning Academy, this is Meghan. \nDELLA Hi Meghan.     It's Della Myers. \nMEGHAN (V.O.) Oh hey. You calling about Spanish for Beginners? You know that Tom cancelled 'cause of New Year's. \nDELLA Yes I knew. \nMEGHAN (V.O.) Can you hold, I have another call? \nDELLA Okay. \nFrustrated, Della turns on the radio.    It is some innocuous local ad. \nLOCAL AD Pleasant Valley Dream Homes. The lowest crime rate in the US. Call 1- 800-SAFE. \nDella switches stations trying to find something she likes. She gives up and waits for Meghan to return. The car flashes past construction road signs. \nMEGHAN (V.O.) Sorry Della ... \nDELLA Can you leave word for Mike. I'm going to miss tomorrow's Mechanic's class. It's just the one time. \nMEGHAN (V.O.) Everyone misses that class at least once. \nScene 20Page 13 \nDELLA I guess some people find it boring. \nMEGHAN (V.O.) We'll see you the first week in January then? \nDELLA Yes you will...unless I run off and become an outlaw or something. \nMeghan giggles. We hear the familiar beep of another call coming in. \nDELLA (CONT'D) I have to go. \nMEGHAN Merry Christmas \nDELLA You too. \nDella clicks the phone over to the incoming call. \nDELLA (CONT'D) Hello? \nCASSIE (V.O.) Hi Della... it's Cassie. \nCassie's voice is almost lost in the din of her surroundings. \nDELLA Where are you? Grand Central Station? \nCASSIE Hold on, I'll take the phone outside. \nA loud noise appears out of nowhere. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER/EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - EVENING \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nFor a second, Della contemplates turning around and leaving. \nThe guy in the SUV behind her beeps. She steps on the gas. \nDELLA Okay, okay! \nHer car careens slowly down hill to the lot. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT/INT. FORD - EVENING \nThe road spits her out in front of the Mall entrance where revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting. \nDella follows several cars down the first long row of parked cars. \nThe asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall. Puddles gather in its dents and hollows. \nShe passes car after densely parked car. There isn't a space in sight. She reaches the end of the row and indicates left, turns down the next row, ploughs through a rain puddle which splashes up onto a MOTHER who's walking her little GIRL and BOY back to their car. The woman shouts at Della. \nMOTHER Watch where you're going! \nDella rolls down her window. \nScene 24Page 17 \nDELLA Sorry! \nThe Mother's weighed down with shopping bags. She glares at Della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her. \nDella sighs, drives down the second aisle. \nAn Escape midway down the row blocks traffic. It's waiting for a Subaru to pull out so it can take the spot. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nDELLA Lucky son of a ..... \nThe Subaru exits the spot slowly. Della taps her impatient fingers against the steering wheel. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING \nThe Subaru pulls away and the Escape snaps into the empty space. \nDella continues her journey down to the end of the row. There are no spaces. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nIt dawns on her that parking up close to the entrance just isn't going to happen. She takes the last puff from the cigarette burning out in the ashtray. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING \nUsing the side aisle she scoots past row three and four as they all flow one way. \nAt the end of this row a confrontation is brewing. Several cars block each other. Horns blast. An angry DRIVER screams at another. \nANGRY DRIVER If you think you're gonna steal my spot, think again, asshole! \nINT. FORD EXPLORER/EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING \nDella looks on for a moment at the confrontation. She grinds out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray, slams it closed. \nScene 29Page 18 \nDella shakes her head and turns left into row five. Jesus! Are there really this many cars in Pleasant Valley? It's a brand new Mall and the only one around for miles but this is ridiculous. \nDella reaches the end of row five quickly. She guessed there wouldn't be a spot so she's driving faster. \nShe notices a portly middle aged RENT-A-COP directing traffic ahead. She lowers her window. \nDELLA Hello? \nThe Rent-a-Cop stops directing and approaches the car. \nRENT-A-COP Can I help you? \nDELLA Do you know where I can definitely find parking? \nRENT-A-COP There's nothing close by. Even the valet's backed up. You might want to try further out. \nHe points off into the distance through the sea of cars. \nRENT-A-COP (CONT'D) But be willing to walk. \nDella arrives at the fountain. A piddling jet of dirty water gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. She scans the crowd but there's no sign of Cassie. \nDella sits at the edge of the fountain. She checks her watch then checks out the people milling around in front of Victoria's Secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive underwear are propped seductively in the window displays. \nStill no sign of Cassie. She's about to make a wish and throw a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes her \"Save the Children\" tin at her. Della sticks the quarter into the tin instead. \nINT.   VICTORIA'S SECRET - EVENING \nDella wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women examine slim fit underpants and padded bras. \nShe notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills. She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in front of the mirror, tries to imagine herself in it. \nA young SALES ASSISTANT approaches. \nVS SALES ASSISTANT It's pure silk, the last one in our classic black label collection. Would you like me to fix you a changing room? \nDella checks the size tag. It reads 36C, two sizes too big. And the price tag next to it. Ouch! It's expensive for Victoria's Secret. \nDELLA No thanks. Not my size. \nShe gestures to her small boobs, smiles and hands the teddy to the sales assistant. She quickly leaves the shop. \nINT. MALL - EVENING \nDella checks one last time at the fountain for Cassie. She tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a generic coffee shop. Maybe Cassie will be there. \nScene 39Page 22 \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING \nHarried women and a few men, clutching bags full of gifts and impatient children, stand on line for their favorite drug. \nDella squeezes past them to look for Cassie. Every seat at every booth is full but there's no sign of her friend. \nDella joins the line. She finds herself biting at her nails, a bad habit since childhood. \nA woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the pick up area. Della moves up to the counter to where an OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT waits on her. \nDELLA A latte please? \nShe notices some chocolate covered biscotti on the counter. \nDELLA (CONT'D) And a chocolate biscotti. \nShe catches sight of herself in the mirror behind the counter. Kenneth's right about one thing, she looks awful. \nOVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT Bitter or Milk chocolate? \nSeeing herself in the mirror changes her mind about the biscotti. \nDELLA Forget it, just the coffee. \nOVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT Name? \nDELLA Della, two L's. \nOVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT Four dollars and seventy nine cents. \nDella pushes the money towards her and waits for her coffee. When it finally shows up her name is spelled DELA. She sighs and checks the line for Cassie as she leaves the shop. \nScene 40Page 23 \nINT. MALL - EVENING \nShe passes a hair salon and presses her face to the steamy windows. Inside, women are getting their hair styled and their nails manicured at the same time. \nDella looks down at her bitten nails but just can't bring herself to go inside. \nLYNN (O.S.) Della, is that you? \nShe turns around to see LYNN MONROE, a pretty, well groomed redhead about her age. \nDELLA Lynn Monroe! \nLYNN I knew it was you, Della. I haven't seen you since college. You left to marry some handsome jock and we never heard from you again. \nDELLA Something like that. Do you live around here now? \nLYNN David and I just bought this divine house in Pleasant Valley. Do you know it? Great for the kids. \nDella nods but Lynn keeps speaking. Della sips on her latte. \nLYNN (CONT'D) It's the first time I've left the doors unlocked since I was a child growing up in the Midwest. David's been promoted to VP of United Motors so it's all happening for us. But enough of me. How are you? \nChuckie shoots him in the face. \nTHIS MOMENT CHANGES EVERYTHING. \nWe thought Della was in trouble but now we know she is. \nThe bullet hits the Rent-A-Cop in the forehead. Blood spurts from the exit wound. He slumps to the asphalt like a marionette whose strings have just been cut. Bullet smoke hangs in the air where he once stood. Smoke too blackens the bullets entry wound. Blood puddles out from the back of his head. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Fuck! \nIt's clear that Chuckie's been acting harder than he is. The hand that holds the gun is trembling. The color drains from his face. \nAll stand riveted in shock. \nScene 45Page 32 \nA deathly silence follows. The carol singers can be heard in the distance faintly finishing up Silent Night. \nCAROL SINGERS (O.S.) Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace. \nChuckie looks to his friends for support but none is forthcoming. \nThe Rent-A-Cop's body twitches. \nChuckie hesitates then raises the gun. He aims and fires. The shot shatters the top of the Rent-A-Cop's head. Chuckie flinches, closes his own eyes in reflex. \nDella swallows. If she started screaming now, she may never stop. She spins instead and makes for her car door. She's dead if she doesn't get out of here and she knows it. \nVINH She's busting a move! \nChuckie opens his eyes. Vinh points to Della. \nChuckie looks over and sees Della disappear through the door of her Explorer. Agitation overwhelms him. \nCHUCKIE She ain't going nowhere. We got her Ford blocked in, right? \nHe looks at Vinh who nods then at Huey. \nHUEY I don't know nothing. \nChuckie looks back at Vinh then over at Tomas. \nTOMAS (muttering) Dar candela por el culo! \nCHUCKIE I can just put one through her windshield, right? \nNo one answers. Chuckie turns once more to the Rent-a-Cop whose body still twitches in some final death throe. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Will you just DIE ?! \nScene 45Page 33 \nHe raises the gun. \nAnother shot explodes into the night. \nINT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING \nDella flinches but no   bullet tears through the back of her skull. She slams into   the driver's seat and punches the door lock switch. She hits   the four wheel drive button and presses the accelerator pedal   to the metal. \nThe Explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier. The barrier screeches along the underside of the frame. There is a loud SCRAAAAAPE noise as the car heaves over the barrier. Then, the rear wheels bounce and claw over. The car fishtails momentarily. \nDELLA Please God. Don't overcorrect. \nShe releases the pressure on the accelerator. The Explorer straightens. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING \nTomas screams at Chuckie. \nTOMAS Chinga tu madre. She making her getaway. \nAll except Chuckie turn to look as Della accelerates across the unfinished outskirts of the car park behind them. \nVinh tugs at Chuckie's sleeve. \nVINH Chuckie! \nBut Chuckie's staring at the bloody mess he made, with a faraway look in his eyes, like he's disassociating. \nVinh throws down the stub of his cigarette, follows Tomas into the Plymouth. Tomas guns the engine. \nHUEY She on her cell right now calling the pigs. \nThe Plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud. \nEXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING \nShe closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the car, clutching the toolbox and the wrench. She reaches back into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash. Pop. She softly closes the door again. Punches her way through the branches. Slides her fingers under the hood, pries up the lever. It pops up only a few inches. \nDELLA Damn! \nShe tries to manually lift it. But it's heavy with the weight of pine branches. \nVoices drift towards her. \nTOMAS (O.S.) Keep hitting on the gas and you gonna dig them wheels into a dirt grave. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) Save yo talk and get out and push. \nThe sound of car doors opening, feet squishing into the mud and cussing. The boys materialize in the light from the headlights. \nTOMAS Hell, no. \nHUEY Shit! \nScene 77Page 41 \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) What's aggravating you now? \nHUEY Our new sneakers are stuck up in the dirt like they was last years. \nDoors slam and two sets of footsteps join the others. \nCHUCKIE Soon as we taken care o' Mrs. Podunk you and the Spanish dancer can hit the next mall. But first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth. \nVINH Stupid ass car got nowhere else to go. There's nothing but trees up ahead. \nTOMAS Screw the car, Chuckie. Case you forgot we got a witness on the loose! I ain't want to end up in the clink as some chimp's prison pillow. \nCHUCKIE Trust me dog, hoe's going down execution style before we see the other side o' them bars. \nDella drops the hood. It makes a faint squeak but doesn't slam down, seems it's stuck open these last few inches. \nTOMAS Yo talk a real mob threat, Chuckie. But what if she gone already? \nChuckie's eyes scan the housing estate. \nCHUCKIE She ain't gone. \nDella frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the hood. But some larger branches are jammed, wedged by the broken tree. \nWhen she looks back over for the boys she sees the car headlights are off and there's no sign of them. \nScene 77Page 42 \nShe stands stock still, listening, scanning the landscape for a sign of them. \nThe sound of glass shattering breaks the silence. \nDella jumps out of her skin, spins around. Her eyes settle on a light in the distance. \nEXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING \nThe light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving truck. The cabin glows like a box in the darkness. There's a figure inside: it's Chuckie. He's inspecting a powerful construction flashlight. He switches settings from broad light to concentrated beam. He points the beam through the broken glass window onto Tomas, who's standing on a truck tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow. Chuckie leaps down through the broken window, pleased with his find. \nHe switches it to broad beam, whistles. \nCHUCKIE Won't be long before we find her now. This baby could spot a needle in a haystack! \nThe light dances around illuminating each of their faces for seconds at a time. Eerie distorted glimpses. They're traipsing along the rough road, through the mud, towards Della. Their voices grow louder. \nHUEY We caught up in this bitch's life like a soap opera. We could just bail, blast out of town like we was never here. \nCHUCKIE This boy loves weed so much he tried to marry Juana. \nHUEY Ain't no one cares about the Rent-a- Pig. He just collateral damage to the peeps at the mall. \nChuckie pushes Huey half playfully, half annoyed. \nCHUCKIE Listen up skippy: SHE THE ONLY WITNESS. \nScene 78Page 43 \nHUEY But if we hit the road now we'll be five hundred miles away before they find him....we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin' in the Atlantic....just like you promised. \nHuey stares off into space like he's having a vision. \nAn owl hoots from the trees behind. She freezes, eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger. \nShe waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more between the edge of the development and the edge of the trees. \nShe's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and form. \nOn one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. On the other, plots and structures of homes to be. \nShe keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees, following the lights in the distance. \nShe hears a loud thudding noise. Stops. Stops breathing. \nEXT. PLANKS IN TARP - EVENING \nAhead, piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view. \nShe braces herself, peers cautiously around, sees nothing. She clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards. \nScene 82Page 46 \nRain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp causing the sound. \nShe breathes a sigh of relief. \nEXT. CEMENT PILES - EVENING \nHeaps of damp shingle and cement cause her to back up and around past them and a cement mixer. She loses sight of the neon mall lights. She panics. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING \nShe runs between the foundations of two houses. \nShe stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming across her path. \nShe ducks down the side of a half finished house. \nSees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck. \nShe keeps going, between the houses, looking for a sign of the mall lights. \nShe stops. \nJust ahead, a flurry of footprints. \nThey're her footprints! \nEXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING \nShe finds herself back where she started, at the same house. \nThe mall lights flicker in the distance as far away as they always were. The Ford's still there ahead. \nAnd then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her. \nDELLA (under her breath) NO! OH NO. \nShe bites back a sob. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING \nDella shrinks backwards between the houses. She ducks into an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead. \nScene 86Page 47 \nShe runs into the house and out through the far side. Skirts a row of plots of land. Then, she hears Chuckie's mocking voice, echoing through the building site. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) DELLA! \nDella recoils. Did she just hallucinate? \nHow the hell do they know her name? \nCan they see her? Or is he just shouting her name randomly into the night? \nHer eyes dart right then left then back again.   Nothing. \nShe runs down a row of house foundations. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Della! \nINT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 2 - EVENING \nDella dives into an unfinished house, hides behind a space where a window will eventually be, looks out across the building site. All is dark outside. And then she sees the light several rows down, weaving between the houses. \nHUEY Yo left without yo goodbye kiss. \nThe light sweeps past Huey's hips. The sound of a zipper. The light sweeps back up onto Della. \nScene 96Page 50 \nCHUCKIE You a window shopper little brother. You ain't never even done the old in and out before. \nWaves of pain spasm through Della's shoulder. \nThe boys snigger. \nHUEY Imma just a young playa tryin' to put my bid in. \nTomas leans down towards Della. Chuckie moves the flashlight to illuminate them both. Tomas drains the last dregs from a bottle of Bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the foundations. It rolls into the darkness. \nDella shudders. She clutches the lug wrench against her coat behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall. \nTOMAS Don't worry, when we done wit you we send yo back in yo trunk to Mr. Podunk. \nTomas reaches down and pulls Della up to standing by the coat collar. He then yanks the coat down over her shoulder. The white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making the form of her breasts very clear. \nChuckie keeps the light focused right on her. \nTomas slides his index finger down across Della's neck towards her breasts. \nDella claws at Tomas' face with the nails of her free hand. He staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing. Her chewed nails haven't left any dents, but she stunned him. \nThe others laugh. \nShe shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it tight across herself, once again clasping the toolbox close to her side. \nTOMAS (CONT'D) Don't want to play nice? Puta! \nHe moves towards her, face twisted with hate, arm raised. \nScene 96Page 51 \nCHUCKIE Back off five minutes, my Ghetto brother. \nTomas glares at Della, then lowers his arm. Spits on the ground instead. Turns back to the boys. Chuckie moves forwards and focuses on Della's box? \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) What's with the man size crast? \nDella doesn't answer. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You running with the family jewels? \nDella still doesn't answer. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You rob a bank this morning, Della? \nDella remains determinedly mute. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Least yo learned something tonight Della honey? \nVINH Yeah, like how to quit mouthing if you wanna avoid drama. \nCHUCKIE You must be wondering how we come to know your name. \nChuckie giggles. Della shivers. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You screwed up Della Myers. Left your purse in the Ford. \nChuckie holds up her driving licence and examines it. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) What a shitty photo! \nChuckie nods to Vinh. Vinh passes his lighter to Chuckie. Chuckie lights the licence on fire. The plastic burns black and toxic. The flame annihilates Della's name, her date of birth, her face. Pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house. \nScene 96Page 52 \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Guess you won't be needing it no more. \nDella stares defiantly, fighting back the internal nausea caused by this symbolically brutal act. \nChuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back on his own menacing face. Then, back again on her face. She becomes disoriented. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) So what's in the box? \nDella remains mute, looks away from the beam. \nHUEY Yo think she carrying the big notes, maybe some ice? \nTOMAS Jesus hijo de maria el virgene. \nVINH What? \nVinh moves towards Chuckie who is crouched over Huey. \nScene 96Page 55 \nCHUCKIE My little brother. \nTomas approaches. \nHe pushes Chuckie gently out of the way so he can see. \nHe stares down at Huey's bloody meshed face. Tomas staggers backwards and crosses himself. \nTOMAS Mamacita! Madre de Dios! \nChuckie punches Tomas' leg. \nCHUCKIE You tread on my boy's face. YOU KILLED HIM. \nTOMAS I didn't kill him. I didn't kill no one. \nTomas pushes Chuckie backwards. \nTOMAS (CONT'D) She did it. She killed him. \nChuckie and Tomas stare at each other. \nTOMAS (CONT'D) I'm gonna cross that bitch out. \nEXT.   WOODS - EVENING \nDella runs for her life. She makes straight for the cover of the trees. She hesitates for just a moment after the first layer of Pines. It's pitch black beyond. Then she steps in. \nShe follows her breath into the icy blackness. \nBranches and foliage scratch against her face. \nShe grapples about, looking for hiding places between the dark shapes and forms. Steps between tree roots and shrubs. \nHer eyes begin to adjust. She can now make out the difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking back, where the edge of the woods begins. A construction light shines behind like a distant moon. \nScene 97Page 56 \nShe pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees, some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. Only the evergreens still have their foliage. \nLooking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign of the boys. \nFear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together. Where there just may be the right place to hide. \nShe stops for a second to catch her breath. \nThe handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. She changes hands. \nGod, that boy Huey! He really died back there. She heard the sound of it. The horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death. \nIt could have been her. \nThere has to be some way out of this nightmare. \nAhead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path. She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots. \nCHUCKIE DELLA! \nChuckie's voice drifts towards her.   She ducks down among the roots. \nHer eyes scan the darkness. \nNo moving shapes nor forms. No sound. No flashlight. Just shadowy clumps of trees. \nShould she stay put or should she run? \nThen she sees it. The flashlight weaving through the pines ahead. \nShe pushes further in among the roots, tries to make herself invisible. \nThe flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards her. One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage. \nShe holds still, terrified. \nThe flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots. \nDella overhead, looking down on the clearing. \nVinh transfixed by the music. \nTomas stone silent, watching Vinh. \nIt plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of some spiritual rite about to be consummated. \nVinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small tear runs down his stoic face. \nThen CLICK. The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who appears out of the shadows behind it. \nHe stares a beat at Vinh like he can't believe what he's been seeing. \nVinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance. \nCHUCKIE What the fuck you doing? \nVinh doesn't reply. Stares down at the ground, keeps on with his weird dance. Chuckie moves towards him. Tomas grabs Chuckie, tries to stop him from going for Vinh, but Chuckie shrugs him off. \nChuckie reaches out and shakes Vinh. No response. He shakes him again. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I asked you what your deal is, sand dancer? \nThe second shake sort of breaks Vinh out of his trance. He shivers. \nVINH It's a tribute. A gesture. \nCHUCKIE A what? \nScene 101Page 60 \nVinh stares down at the dirt at his feet. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Your brain even smaller than 'em slits for eyes? \nVinh slouches defiantly over to the blaster and presses track 8 replay. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Keep on banging out that ghetto ass shit and you'll alert every cop in Podunk county. \nVINH It's for Huey. Our dead homie. \nThe song starts again. Chuckie looks at him incredulously, shouts above the music. \nCHUCKIE You checked out, right? \nVINH He loved that track. \nVinh snorts back a sob. He hugs himself into a hunch and starts dancing again. \nChuckie loses it. He slaps Vinh. \nCHUCKIE Get a grip, skippy. \nVinh rubs his face. He's getting a grip all right. Chuckie slams off the blaster. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Huey's DEAD. And ain't no requiem gonna resurrect his ass. He down under the ground now with the real men of respect. \nThe three boys stand somberly in silence, each paying internal homage to their dead friend. Chuckie hardens his heart against the tears that threaten to flow. Tomas trembles, mumbles. \nTOMAS I didn't mean it. I didn't do it. I didn't mean to kill him. \nScene 101Page 61 \nThis breaks the moment. Chuckie snaps back. \nCHUCKIE Well he dead. That's it for him. OVER. But we still here. Hell, yeah. Payback's gonna be a real bitch for a real bitch. \nVinh wipes away his tears. \nVINH She probably gone by now. \nCHUCKIE You best hope not, genius. She gone, we gone. \nChuckie paces around the circumference of the clearing. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) DELLA! \nEXT. LEDGE - EVENING \nDella's been watching the scene unfold, a captive audience, attentive and terrified. \nSlowly she tears her eyes away from the boys. She backs away from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old tree. The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she hurt earlier on the barbed wire. \nTOMAS (O.S.) What now, cabron? \nVINH (O.S.) Fell in a frozen ass stream. \nScene 103Page 64 \nChuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them. Della sees Vinh trudging out of the stream, Tomas descending the last few feet of the other side of the gulch and Chuckie midway up. \nVinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his sneakers. \nCHUCKIE Zipperhead! \nVINH Kon'aro Kusotare. \nCHUCKIE You know we don't speak the Chinky. \nVINH What's your game, Chuckie? We left stumbling around in the dark while you hog the flashlight. \nCHUCKIE I stole it. I get to use it. That's how it works. That right Tomas? \nTOMAS Right on, dog. \nChuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins Vinh and Tomas at the edge of the stream. \nVINH What if I steal it from you? \nCHUCKIE There you go, bro. \nHe hands the flashlight over to Vinh. Vinh reaches for it. Chuckie pulls it away. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) April Fool. Naw, wait a minute, it ain't April. Must be Christmas fool. \nTomas smirks. Vinh hangs his head down. They search for more prints, can't find any in the immediate area. Chuckie shines the flashlight at the foot of a big rock. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Her footprints disappear at the big rock. \nScene 103Page 65 \nA beat. Della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand. \nVinh shivers violently. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Head on up and search the slope. I'll guide your way with the flashlight. \nChuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch. Della ducks. \nDella needs to get out of there and fast. \nThey begin to ascend the rocks. Chuckie keeps the flashlight slightly ahead of them. \nDella crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light. \nThe boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees and hands to shreds. \nShe can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin. What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed. \nTOMAS We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch! \nGod please help her make it back into the cover of the trees. \nDella almost vomits. \nHer hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. She pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. Her strength is ebbing but she tries to hoist herself up. The flashlight sweeps by. She lets go of the ledge and ducks. The flashlight sweeps by again. \nShe huddles in behind a rock. Waits a beat. \nTOMAS (CONT'D) You going home in a casket tonight. \nOh shit, they're approaching fast. She tries again to hoist herself up. She's almost up when the flashlight sweeps by again. \nThis time, it catches her. \nCHUCKIE THERE SHE IS, TOP OF THE GULCH! \nScene 103Page 66 \nShe practically throws herself over the ledge. Tomas scurries to the top faster than lightening, catches her leg as she crawls from the edge. \nTHUD. She kicks him in the face. \nDella grabs the toolbox. Makes a run for it. \nTOMAS AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH! \nDella gasps in horror, watches as: \nTomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once more. \nDella swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the head. \nHe spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her AGAIN. \nShe loses it. She swings the lug wrench towards him.    All the years of pent up rage finally find their release. \nThe wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH. It drives the cartilage up and into his face. \nBlood spurts from the wound. He staggers backwards. \nA shocked scream escapes from Della's mouth. \nDELLA Awwwrgh! \nAs she staggers backwards in the opposite direction. \nTomas tries to cry out but can only utter in pain. \nTOMAS Unnh! Unnh! Unnh! \nHe tries to pull the lug wrench out of his face. Spins. Stumbles. \nThe flashlight beam travels past them. \nScene 105Page 69 \nTOMAS (CONT'D) Unnh! \nTomas crashes back into a tree. He loses consciousness. His body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. Blood gushes from where the wrench meets his face. He looks like he's dressed for Halloween. \nDella just stares. Stares at Tomas, at what she did, what she had to do. \nTomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead. \nThe horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della. She starts shaking with shock. \nVinh cries out for Tomas \nVINH (O.S.) TOMAS! \nThe sound of footfalls crashing through the brush follows. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) Curb the squealing. You a gangsta or a boy scout? \nVinhs voice is breathless and jittery. \nVINH (O.S.) Tomas's gone, Chuckie. I can feel it. \nDella tears herself away from Tomas's body and staggers into the deadwood to collect the toolbox. It glints, even in the darkness. \nShe grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree. \nBehind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the flashlight illuminates Vinh and Chuckie as they march through the woods searching for Tomas. \nCHUCKIE Tomas is one hard son of a bitch. He got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it. \nBut Chuckie doesn't look so sure. Vinh charges ahead into the darkness. \nScene 105Page 70 \nDella flashes briefly into shot, running between the trees. The flashlight sweeps by. \nVINH There's something over here. \nChuckie walks towards Vinh. Vinh takes the flashlight from Chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three trees. \nVINH (CONT'D) It looks like a body. \nThey close in on a muddle of shapes, bush and spidery tree trunks. The flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and thick as a body. \nCHUCKIE It's a big old tree trunk, you paranoid gook. \nChuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh won't give it. Chuckie doesn't persist. Vinh keeps going, shivering and blustering. \nVinh senses something. He shines the flashlight behind the tree trunk. Still nothing. Sweeps back. \nDella darts between the evergreens behind them. She conceals herself in between the trunks and branches. Braces herself, waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not looking, to run between the trees. Cognizant enough to know they just want to find Tomas right now. She seems to be on autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on. \nShe watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush. He hits every inch of it with the flashlight. Sighs. Doubles back to follow Chuckie. \nDELLA (CONT'D) Please, I just want to see my babies again. \nHer rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her. \nThis seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She needs to get moving. \nShe sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow water. Her wet coat drags heavily. \nThe stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of the woods. \nShe trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream. \nForging ahead. \nShe now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up. \nShe looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will be dispersed. \nA leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. She makes her way toward it. \nShe lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream. \nMore glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants, smoothing down her coat. \nShe hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox. \nShe plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to the mall lights, closer to home. \nShe swallows another wave of grief. \nScene 106Page 74 \nThe stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She follows it, picks the left fork. \nAnd then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering down into the stream behind her. \nShe doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her life. \nThe glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running. \nVinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster. \nShe leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap behind her. \nShe pushes through the hanging branches of several trees. Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes, right into Vinh's face. \nHe tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries out, covers his eyes. \nVINH Aaaarrhh. \nThis buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her. \nBut the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her. \nDella keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting its direction. \nVinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five feet behind her. \nA SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun. \nAnother shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder, hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever. \nScene 106Page 75 \nThe stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a moment she's invisible to them. She uses it. When she reaches the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of Chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks. \nEXT.   EMBANKMENT - EVENING \nShe creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will allow. \nThe boys stop by the rocks. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her. \nShe tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid leaving prints. Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when she sees the flashlight sweep by. \nIf she can get to the top, she can make another run for it. \nAll of a sudden, it grows dark. The boys must have switched the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. She listens hard for their footfalls. Nothing. \nEXT. PINE TREE - EVENING \nShe sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree. \nShe creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver. She removes it from the box and grasps it tight. \nShe sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst through the branches above and up into the patch of sky between. \nThe crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus. \nShe looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches along a branch to see better. \nThe light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye line, disorienting her. \nShe hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree. \nHer eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her. She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath. \nThe flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away up the embankment. \nBut Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up through the branches. \nTheir eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie. \nShe LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back. \nVINH (CONT'D) CHUUUCCKKKKIEEE! \nShe silences his yell with a choke hold. Wraps her legs around his torso. He bites her arm but she holds tight. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) Vinh? \nPanic has crept into Chuckie's voice. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) VINH? \nVinh topples to the mud, dragging Della with him. \nThey roll as he desperately tries to disengage her. \nThe flashlight frantically searches the area for them. \nDella frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve. \nShe DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull. \nScene 110Page 79 \nVinh screams. \nShe thrusts and twists the tool. \nAll the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined, intimate as a lover. \nShe drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair. \nVinh's scream becomes a high keening wail. \nThe screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood. \nHis scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins. \nThey roll downstream. \nHis arms are wrapped in a death grip around her. \nThey roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down. \nShe feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her. \nShe's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds the strength to push him off. \nShe crawls out from under his body. \nPushing him away, sets him off rolling again. \nShe tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head hurts so bad it's about to burst. \nThe world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to close it all out almost overwhelms her. \nHer shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark. \nThere's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes, looks around. \nIt's Vinh's body hitting the stream below. \nScene 110Page 80 \nWhere was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be seen now that's for sure. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Twins huh?     Terri and Tammi. \nDella doesn't move. Terrified. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I bet you could use that cigarette now Della honey? (he chuckles) A woman's purse can tell her whole life story! \nDella stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in his jacket. He empties the contents out onto the dirt. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Now I know where they are living, I'm thinking I may stop by after and say hello. \nDella wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates. But she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to give him the satisfaction. \nWe move in closer on Chuckie. He's looking right at where she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) They wouldn't know a damn thing about what happened to Mommy while she was out, would they, Della? \nScene 111Page 83 \nWe move in on Della. Her knuckles are blue white and her eyes are blazing. Rage explodes in her. She doesn't even realize that she is shouting till she's done. \nDELLA I'M GOING TO KILL YOU. \nChuckie waltzes towards her hiding place. \nCHUCKIE I figured that would help you find your voice! \nDella crouches further in behind the felled trees. Why the hell did she shout? She could have been hiding anywhere. Now he must know for sure where she is. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Don't worry. I would never touch them. It's wrong to hurt kids! Right, Della? \nShe clamps her mouth closed. Chuckie continues waltzing toward her, stops about twelve feet away. He stares in between the felled trees like he has x-ray vision. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) The game's over. \nChuckie laughs. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You won! \nSadness creeps into his voice. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You took him from me...He was only seventeen years old. And all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean. And he never saw it. No, he never got to go. \nChuckie's grief sits like a stone in his throat. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) They're all gone now. \nChuckie coughs, a dry laboured cough. He hocks long and deeply in his throat. But whatever it is he can't spit it out. He rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly. \nScene 111Page 84 \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You know the movie \"Clockwork Orange\"? \nDella looks puzzled.   Yeah, and? \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Well, they were my droogies, Della. \nChuckie sighs. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) Chances are they would of turned on me anyway, just like in the movie. \nChuckie paces around, deep in thought. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) None of them was real ass outlaw. No, not in the way you are. You're the real deal, lady. \nHe stops. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) I was already thinking about cutting some of em loose, getting a new style posse together. \nDella's head is spinning. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) How's about it, you and me? \nThis can't be real. Has he lost his mind? She utters under her breath. \nDELLA Give me a break. \nChuckie reaches down, retrieves her diary from the dirt. She cringes. \nCHUCKIE Monday night mechanics. Tuesday Pilates. Wednesday Spanish. Thursday, I wish.... \nHe closes the diary. \nScene 111Page 85 \nChuckie smiles, brings his teeth back into a scary, feral grin. \nCHUCKIE I wanted to look you in the eye before I kill you. \nDella doesn't react.    He brings up his hand, gun clutched, pointed and ready. \nDella surprises him and us. \nDELLA That's what I figured. \nShe nods her head, points her chin over his shoulder. \nDELLA (CONT'D) Huey there, going to help? \nScene 111Page 88 \nChuckie is puzzled. \nCHUCKIE Huey?   Huey's .... \nHe glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as he turns his head. It's enough. Della slips the flare out of her pocket and opens it in his face. \nBefore he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all the spring left in her legs. Her fingers close around the wrist with the gun. \nThe flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them. \nShe crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his collar bone is broken. It makes the ugly noise of sinew tearing. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) CHRIST! \nShe tumbles him down to the December ground and wraps her legs tight around him. Tight like a lover. \nShe grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound. \nHe cries out, thrashes about. She keeps her body melded to his, grinding her chin even deeper. \nHe wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even closer, wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone. \nThey roll across the dirt.   He whispers, low and close to her. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You're even better than I thought. \nHe pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin returning to the wound. She tries to pull away but he only presses harder. \nNeither can break away. \nIt's unclear who's got the gun. \nThey roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up. \nBut he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock. \nScene 111Page 89 \nAnd she has the gun. \nThey look at each other. He smiles. \nHe makes for the gun. \nShe fires into his chest, just once, it's enough. \nHis legs release. He slumps back.   Blood darkens his shirt. \nGun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark puddle. \nHis body surrenders to death. \nShe stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal. \nHis dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently. \nAnd she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float away. Somehow she stands up. \nShe looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood. \nShe retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there; tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket closed. \nShe searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway. \nIt's time to go home. \nEXT. WOODS - EVENING \n", "test1_input": "The singers' voices echo faintly through the night. \nCAROL SINGERS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Holy infant so tender and mild. \nShe walks faster, almost at a dash. \nWhere is her car? Even further out than she remembered, that's for sure. \nA car alarm goes off in the distance. \nThe alarm stops at last as Della approaches the outer section of the parking lot. \nCAROL SINGERS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Shepherds quake at the sight. Glories beam from heaven afar. \nShe cuts between some of the cars in row eight. Zigzags across aisle nine. Notices the Plymouth still parked ahead. \nShe stops for a split second. Then approaches. Glances at the windshield. The note is gone. \nScene 43Page 27 \nMaybe it fell off. She checks the ground around the car. No sign of it. She shrugs, who cares anyway? \nShe cuts across the next aisle. It's almost empty. And the one after that. Her Explorer is sandwiched between two cars in this otherwise empty row. \nCAROL SINGERS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Silent Night. Holy Night \nShe chirps the remote twice and pops the trunk, places the bags inside. She slams the trunk closed and hurries to the drivers' side, climbs in, pulling the door closed behind her. \nINT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING \nDella turns the key in the ignition and presses in the lighter. She lights a cigarette and inhales as she lets the car warm up for 30 seconds. \nShe rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the hand brake and slips the gear into reverse. The interior of her car is suddenly flooded with light from another car's headlights. She glances in the rear view mirror. A car is blocking her. \nDELLA Good Lord! What now? \nShe steps on the brake and waits for the car to move. \nBut it doesn't. Its headlights flick to full beam blinding her view in her car mirrors. She honks her horn. The car still doesn't move. \nDella's really angry now. She slips the gearshift into park and steps out of her car. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING \nDella squints in the blinding headlights. The front of the car looks familiar. It's the gold Plymouth! \nTwo unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again. \nThe lights abruptly go out. Della blinks, her eyes try to adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few car lengths away. \nShe uneasily turns back to her car. \nScene 45Page 28 \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) I got a gun. \nIt's a young male voice. The statement stops Della dead in her tracks. \nCHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) How's about I aim it at your pussy first? \nThe words are emphasized by another boy's shrill giggling. Della freezes. This can't be happening! \nHer eyes are adjusting. The glare phantoms drift out to the limit of her peripheral vision and vanish. \nShe sees three boys in front of her, then a fourth, but she doesn't see any gun. \nDELLA What the hell are you playing at? \nHUEY Trust the nigga, we not playin'. \nHUEY is a sweet-faced African-American decked out in a hip hop style. He's small and skinny and can't be more than eighteen. He's playing to CHUCKIE who's twenty-one and looks like a marine gone AWOL. Bracketing them is VINH, a nineteen year old Asian punk and TOMAS, twenty, a Latino runaway in an American Idol T-shirt. \nDella's eyes drift across the group. She suppresses a hysterical giggle but can't resist smarting off. \nDELLA What are you? The world's first homeless United Nations Boy Band? \nHUEY Hell, yeah. We just wanna do shows and bone hoes. \nHuey messes with his zipper. \nHUEY (CONT'D) We got a song fo' yo. It's called \"shut up bitch and eat a dick\". \nHuey and Tomas snigger. Vinh stares at the asphalt. \n", "test1_true": "TOMAS And when yo done eating we gonna staple that bitch mouth closed. \nChuckie nudges Huey and Tomas, steps towards Della. \nCHUCKIE Now, now, my little brothers. \nThe boys fall silent.   Vinh lights a cigarette. Huey shivers. \nHUEY It gitting cold, Chuckie. Game's not worth the dime. \nDELLA (incredulous) Chuckie? At least your parents have a sense of humor. \nCHUCKIE Parents? I ain't got no parents. I named myself. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) (to Huey) Grab my parka from the back seat. \nHe pinches Huey's cheeks. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) And smile, playa. The dopes game and the game's dope. \nChuckie leads Huey a few steps to the Plymouth. Huey ducks into the back seat. Chuckie keeps his eyes fixed on Della. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) You got a beef with us, Mrs. Podunk? \nDella looks defiantly back without answering. Chuckie runs his fingers along the hood of the rusty gold Plymouth. \nCHUCKIE (CONT'D) First you put yo hands on my ride! Now, I don't know how you was raised but, in my world, laying your hands on someone else's shit is crossing their line! Then, you go slipping an incendiary note up under my windscreen wipers. (MORE) \nScene 45Page 30 \nWell, that'd UCKIE(CONT'D) CH be an invitation to war to me and my ghetto soldiers. \nDELLA What? If you hadn't parked like an asshole, we wouldn't be arguing about it right now. \nVinh inhales sharply from his cigarette. \nVINH Whoah Lady! \nTOMAS Keep right on talking that gang a shit, chinga. Yo crimes against the click are digging yo grave deep. \nDella's eyes quickly scan the group for sign of the gun. She can't see one so she gambles they're just mouthing off and makes her move. \nDELLA. Go to hell! \nDella turns towards her car. Huey steps out of the shadows wearing Chuckie's parka hood up covering his face, startles Della. \nHUEY We already in hell. \nDella sidesteps him, reaches the back of her car. \nRENT-A-COP (O.S.) Any trouble here, ma'am? \nEveryone turns to see a Rent-a-Cop, puffed up like a pigeon in his fur trimmed jacket and Russian style cap. It's the same guy Della approached earlier when she was looking for spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across the unsnapped holster flap at his hip. \nDELLA Not if these delinquents move their barge so I can back up. \nRENT-A-COP How about it, boys? \nChuckie smiles and nudges Tomas who starts dancing in a real mocking manner imitating the Rent-a-Cop. \nScene 45Page 31 \nChuckie pulls a gun from deep in his army jacket pocket and points it straight at the Rent-a-Cop's face. \nCHUCKIE Nah. We not in the mood. \nChuckie looks at his friends for approval. Huey laughs again, shrill. Tomas grins. Vinh hunches and looks around. \nThe Rent-a-Cop backs away. \nRENT-A-COP For Jesus' sake. \nTomas takes off a small crucifix from around his neck and dangles it in front of the Rent-a-Cop. \nTOMAS Say yo prayers old man. \nChuckie grins at Della while keeping the gun pointed straight at the Rent-a-Cop. \nCHUCKIE These Rent-a-Pig companies are too lame to give their foot soldiers any ammo. Liability laws and all that. Tough shit! \nThe Rent-a-Cop goes for his pistol anyway. \n", "test1_id": 81, "test2_input": "She reclaims the steering wheel.   Straightens up. Hits the accelerator again. \nEXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING \nThe Plymouth swerves behind on the skid that Della created, corrects itself just before the ditch. \nDella gains speed. The Plymouth lags. \nA stop sign appears ahead. The road's ending. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nRight or left, Della? Make a choice. \nEXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING \nThere is no choice. A barrier blocks the left hand turn. A big sign reads \"LOT FULL\". \nEXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE ROAD - EVENING \nDella swings right instead. \nThe streetlights recede behind her. \nEXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING \nNothing but the darkness of a housing complex under construction ahead. \nBut she seems to have shaken off her pursuers. \nShe speeds down the road, looking intently for any sign of life. But there's nothing but half-built houses, empty houses, houses just like hers. \nEXT. SEVEN ELEVEN MINI MALL - EVENING \nA Seven Eleven sign appears. She slows down. But it may as well be a mirage, it's an unfinished building with only the sign, in an unfinished mini-mall. \nScene 58Page 37 \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nClose to screaming now she speeds up. \nEXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING \nMore empty houses in varying stages of construction. No sign of life. \nEXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING \nThen, what looks like a filling station, one light on in the kiosk. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nHope. She pulls in and dims her lights, drives right up to the kiosk door. \nHope dashed. \nEXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING \nIt's in its final stages of installation but definitely not functioning. And there's no one there. \nEXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING \nBack onto the road and she sees far behind her, car headlights that can only belong to the Plymouth, following her through the darkness. \nShe dims her lights to just the side lights. Hurtles along the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher. Potholes filled with mud and rain water splash against the car. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nHer wipers struggle to cope. She can hardly see through the front window. \nEXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING \nThe potholes yawn deeper. The asphalt ends. Gravel deteriorates to dirt. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nShe steers the Ford blindly. \nScene 67Page 38 \nEXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING \nA wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly ahead. \n", "test2_true": "She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into the barrier. \nThere's a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays around her. \nEXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING \nThe Explorer SLAMS through and VEERS towards a clump of trees. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nDella tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast. \nEXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING \nThe car swings, then CRASHES right into a Pine tree. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nThe Car stalls out. SILENCE. A prolonged moment. \nThen Della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine needles and glass from her hair. She reaches up and hits the light switch. \nPine branches protrude through the broken windshield. \nUsing the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the driver's seat and sits down. \nShe slides the gear into park, turns the key. The engine groans like a dying animal, then gives up. \nShe takes a deep breath. \nShe tries again. The engine groans again, another death rattle. It just won't catch. \nShe switches off the interior light and pushes the driver door open. She steps out of the car. \nScene 73Page 39 \nEXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING \nShe closes the door behind her so's not to trigger the light switch. Finds her legs are giddy. Holds onto the door frame for a moment to steady herself. \nIt looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest. \nThe dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier, into the midst of the forest. Behind her, shrouded in darkness, houses in different stages of development dot the deforested landscape. Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest. \nPatches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light from the moon which hides in an overcast sky. \nJesus! She's driven all the way from the Mall only to find herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths on her tail. \nThis must be some sick joke. \nSpeaking of which, where are these little bastards? Her eyes scan the darkness for a sign. Nothing. That doesn't mean they're not close by. \nShe checks out the damage to the car by feel. The driver's side is scratched and dented. The front is wedged into the tree. \nThe only way out is for her to back up the car. \nShe climbs back in for another try. \nINT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING \nDella turns the key. It barely even groans this time. Just a faint gurgle. Then gone. \nShe rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare, sticks it in her pocket. \nShe leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk. \nEXT.   EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING \nDella runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in the trunk. \nScene 75Page 40 \nShe throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as she searches. Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then a small tool box. \nShe hears the screech of a car's wheels spinning in mud. \nEXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING \nDella turns to see headlights in the distance on the road behind, pointing upwards. \nDELLA Huh! \n", "test2_id": 82, "test3_input": "She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance road blocked off. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nOf course.    How long has it been? That poor security guard. \nShe checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime. \nAnother cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they come for her? She's got to get back to the kids. \nDella adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face looks back. \nDELLA Oh my. \nShe looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood. And her clothes! \nWhile waiting for the traffic to start moving again she fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex. \nShe wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror, some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only slightly better. \nThe line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police cars, steals a cursory glance. \nShe keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon start to disperse in different directions. The Mall disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty road. \nShe can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this. \nScene 125Page 93 \nShe hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to sixty. Runs a light. \nEXT. RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING \nAs long as the roads empty she's gonna own it. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nAt sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on the adjoining road. \nWith one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from her purse. \nShe carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it away. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - EVENING \nShe drives through the crossroads. \nINT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING \nShe applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand. \nGosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes the driver stares at her car. \nShe slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She passes the familiar sign for \"Pleasant Valley Drive\". The road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five. \nThe closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy. \nThe car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife. \nEXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING \nShe waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates of Pleasant valley Dream Homes. \nScene 130Page 94 \nShe rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But she's in. \nShe guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard. \nWhen she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed emotion that it feels like it's made of stone. \nShe pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat. \nShe glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat. \nShe turns off the ignition. \nShe looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the ignition. \nShe glances at the gun. \nShe looks at the house; it all looks normal. \nShe takes a deep breath. \n", "test3_true": "She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She finds her chub card inside. She sighs. \nEXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING \nShe remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of the tree still lying there in the snow. \nThe whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in the front door lock. Pushes open the door. \nINT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING \nKENNETH Where the hell have you been? \nScene 132Page 95 \nKenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice welcome. \nShe doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into the house. \nThere he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) I said.... \nHe's about to begin shouting again when he notices something's not right about her. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Della? \nHe switches the TV volume down using the remote. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Della honey are you all right? \nShe stares back at him coldly. \nDELLA Please don't call me that. Don't ever call me that again. \nKENNETH What? \nShe steps slowly towards him. Sees a violent adventure flick wrapping up behind him on TV. The end credits scroll down the screen. \nDELLA I just wanted to get home to my babies. \nKenneth cannot understand her garbled words. He sees the dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat. \nKENNETH What happened to you? \nShe just stares. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Was there an accident? \nScene 132Page 96 \nShe keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression. She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what to do, so he takes a swig of beer. \nKENNETH (CONT'D) Are you hurt? \nThat swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to stone. \nA beat. \nDELLA Are they okay? \nWithout waiting for an answer. \nINT. STAIRWAY - EVENING \nShe turns and races up the stairs. \nINT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING \nShe opens the door softly. The night light casts a pale glow out low across the carpet. There they are, all tucked up in their quilts, breathing gently, little faces flushed with sleep. \nShe sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the door behind her. \nINT. STAIRWAY - EVENING \nWalks back downstairs. \nINT. KITCHEN - EVENING \nKenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer. \nKENNETH Sound asleep, huh? \n", "test3_id": 83}

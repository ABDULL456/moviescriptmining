TAI LUNG You're bluffing. You're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that. 
PO Nope. I figured it out. 
He flexes his pinky... 
PO (CONT'D) Skadoosh! 
KA-THOOM! 
EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE 
A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the Furious Five and the fleeing villagers. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER 
Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream. 
KG SHAW Look! The Dragon Warrior. 
As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron. 
Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the crowd. 
PO'S DAD That's my boy. That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son! 
PO Thanks, Dad. 
Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest of the Five are with him. Po takes notice. 
PO (CONT'D) Hey, guys. 
TIGRESS Master. 
Tigress bows deeply. The others follow. 
FURIOUS FIVE Master. 
PO (modest) Master? (then, remembering) Master Shifu! 
Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then more steps. 
INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER 
Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his side. 
PO Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay? 
Shifu weakly opens his eyes. 
SHIFU Po! You're alive! (then, darkly) Or we're both dead. 
PO No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung! 
SHIFU You did?! 
Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief. 
SHIFU (CONT'D) Wow. It is as Oogway foretold -- You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace to this Valley. And to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you... 
Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.

{"test1_input": "TJ's FINGERPRINTS are taken. \nTJ and his Dad sit in an interview room. Dad looks confused, dopey and dishevelled. A uniformed police officer enters with a file. He shuts the door and sits. \nCOP OK, so we're gonna have to let you go now. We may very well be calling on you again very soon, but in the meantime, let this be a warning to you. Regardless of what evidence we do or don't find, you've come to our attention today. Our attention isn't good. \nTJ But I didn't do anything. \nCOP You hearing me here? These are very serious crimes we've been presented with. Let's just say someone had been in that car, and they'd burned - to death. We'd be talking about manslaughter, possibly murder. Have you thought about that? You'd be sitting here with detectives from Homicide right now. These are felony offences we're talking about, son. Serious jail-time offences. \nTJ nods, his dad looks on. \nINT. GRANDMA'S CAR - DAY \nTJ's in the passenger seat. His dad drives. They sit in silence for a little while. Then dad speaks- \nDAD Did you do it? \nTJ pauses before answering. \nTJ Not really. \nDAD Not really? \nTJ I didn't do it. \nDAD What does `not really' mean? \nTJ ignores him, stares out the car window. \nDAD (CONT'D) Tell me what `not really' means. \nTJ It means I didn't do it. \nDAD No, it doesn't. Why would you say 'not really'? \nTJ I didn't. \nDAD You did. I heard you. \nTJ I said I didn't do it. \nDAD Yeah, before that. I asked if you did it. You said `not really'. \nTJ I can't remember what I said. \nDAD Why would you do something like that? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDad pulls the car into the driveway and comes to an abrupt stop. Hesher is sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the driveway, sunbathing with his shirt off, drinking beer. He has a farmer's tan. \nTJ jumps out. Dad stares at Hesher from inside the car. \nHESHER Howdy. \nTJ walks past Hesher without looking at him. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTJ enters and slams his door shut. TJ sits on his bed. Hesher enters without warning. \nHESHER So what'd the pigs want? \nTJ What the fuck do you think!? \nHESHER Did they give you a cavity search? \nTJ What? \nHESHER Did any of the cops put their fingers in your butthole? \nTJ Just fuck off, OK. \nHESHER What'd they do? \nTJ They took my fucking finger prints! \nHESHER So what? \nTJ So what!? I can get into serious trouble. \nHESHER Oh, is that right? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ Yeah, that's right! They don't take this shit lightly. \nHESHER Oh, they don't? \n", "test1_true": "Hesher feigns concern. \nHESHER Really? Murder? (BEAT) That's badass shit. \nTJ Please just leave me alone. \nHESHER OK, but first show me your best impression of a dumpling. \nTJ What? \nHESHER You know, a dumpling, the Chinese little thingies you eat - \nHesher holds up his thumb and index finger to show the size of a dumpling. TJ shakes his head, he's not finding this funny. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Come on, like this - \nHesher constricts all the muscles on his face imitating a dumpling, he looks ridiculous. TJ tries to hold back a smile, but Hesher looks so absurd he can't. \nHESHER (CONT'D) OK, your turn. \nTJ shakes his head, fighting a smile. \nTJ No. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHESHER OK. \nAnd Hesher is gone in a flash. \nINT. SUPERMARKET / CANNED GOODS AISLE - DAY \nTJ is hiding, peering down an aisle, watching Nicole working at the check out scanning groceries. A can falls from one of the shelves just in front of him. It startles him. And then another one falls. He steps along the shelf to where the cans fell. He looks through to the next aisle. Nothing. Then a voice from behind him. \nHESHER Do you think she is totally bald or do you think she's more of a landing strip kind of chick or more of a 70's jungle bitch. \nTJ is startled. Hesher stands behind him, also watching Nicole. \nTJ What are doing here? \nHESHER You're stalking that chick, dude. \nTJ No, I'm not. \nHESHER Yeah, you are. I've been stalking you for half an hour. You gonna try to fuck her? \nTJ What? No. \nHESHER Can't fuck her from here, dude. Gotta be way closer. \nTJ Shut up about it. \nHESHER You wanna poke her clam? \nTJ Shut up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ is freaked and embarrassed. He walks away down the aisle. Hesher follows. \nHESHER You wanna poke her clam or what? \nTJ Please stop saying that. \nTJ walks ahead fast. He wants out of this conversation. \nNicole finishes up, turns her light off and hangs a 'Check Stand Closed' sign. She walks off toward the back of the store. TJ stops to be sure to avoid her. \nHESHER You want to poke her clam, dude. Nothing wrong with that. Don't be ashamed about it. Humans have been poking vagina for hundreds of years. Longer even. \nHesher says this a little too loud. Nearby shoppers look over. TJ shakes his head, then exits the store. Hesher follows. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Bro, there's nothing wrong with wanting a little pussy. \nEXT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET / PARKING LOT - DAY \nTJ unlocks his bike from a pole. \nHESHER Where you going? \nTJ Home. \nHESHER I'll give you a ride. \nTJ No thanks. \nHESHER OK, but if you come with me it'll take 5 minutes and if you ride it will take you about 15. \n", "test1_id": 1476, "test2_input": "HESHER This one time I had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and I had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like I had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while I'm trying to eat the other girl out, and I was going crazy man. It was too much. I couldn't work out which chick was which and I'm making one girl cum but then I'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually I was just like 'Fuck this. This is too much' and I just stepped back. I just stepped back. And before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know. They're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and I jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know? \nNicole looks at Hesher like he's crazy. TJ is in the back - he can't believe what's coming out of Hesher's mouth. A moment passes. \nNICOLE Was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me? About how I should just step back and let things work themselves out? \nHESHER A what? \nHe reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob - Metallica's, 'Motorbreath' BLASTS through the speakers. \nAs if he were possessed by the music, Hesher veers dangerously off the road onto a dirt patch. He has a crazed look in his eyes. TJ and Nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto. \nHesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. The van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction. TJ gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground. Dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe. Hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHe turns the knob on the radio to an easy listening station. UB40's 'Red Red Wine' plays. A car honks as an angry driver passes. \nNICOLE What the hell was that? \nHesher looks over at Nicole. \nHESHER I saw a mouse. \nNICOLE What? \nTJ picks himself up off the van's floor, dusting himself off. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (TO TJ) Are you OK? \nTJ I have dirt in my mouth. \nTJ scrapes his tongue with his fingers. Nicole breaks a little smile. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY \nThe black van pulls up curb-side outside a neat suburban home. Hesher gets out and walks, covered in dirt, to the front door of the house. He looks in through the window, knocks, waits. An old man opens the door. They exchange a few words. Hesher heads back to the van and they drive off. Nicole and TJ seem confused. \nNICOLE Who's that guy? \nHesher says nothing. They drive three houses down the street and stop again. Hesher gets out. Again he peers in the window, knocks on the door. This time no answer. He heads back to the van. Nicole and TJ watch him approach from inside. He sticks his head in. \nHESHER We're here. Come on, let's go. \nNICOLE We're where? \nHESHER My uncle's house. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHesher walks off toward the side gate of the house. Nicole and TJ climb out of the van and follow Hesher. Nicole seems cautious. TJ knows he's on an adventure. \nHesher jumps the SIDE GATE, then opens it for the others. \nNICOLE What was that back there? \nHESHER What was what? \nNICOLE That other house? \nHESHER Wrong house. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOME / BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER \nIn the backyard is a swimming pool. \nNicole and TJ stand looking in the pool. It's a nice pool with a diving board. \nHesher walks up behind them and pushes them in. \nNicole comes up for air. \nNICOLE What the fuck!? \nHESHER What? You're dirty. \nNICOLE Yeah, and now I'm wet. \nHesher smiles wide. \nHESHER You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in... \nHe throws his T-shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Now I'm dirty and wet too. \nHe splashes water at her. He dives under the water. Suddenly TJ is pulled under. Nicole can't see them under all the motion. Then TJ and Hesher come bursting up for air. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \n", "test2_true": "HESHER R2! Shut down all the fucken' trash compactors on the detention level! \nHesher dives under the water again. Nicole squirms. Hesher has her leg. He doesn't drag her under. He just tugs her leg. She slaps at the water. He tugs her leg again. Pretty soon she's laughing. Hesher's head appears above water momentarily. \nHESHER (CONT'D) ...All the fucking trash compactors... (underwater, then up again) ...on the detention level!... \nHe dives again. He pulls her leg. She laughs hard. TJ watches feeling a little left out. Hesher jumps up and climbs out of the pool. He goes to a garden table nearby. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Oh, shit. More trash coming in! \nHe heaves the table over and into the pool. He grabs a banana lounge. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Oh shit! \nHe throws it in the pool. Nicole and TJ have to dive out of the way. They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing, while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and anything else in reach into the water. \nTJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs dangling in the water. They're fully clothed and soaking wet. \nHe walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more things to break. \nThere is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole. TJ looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the side of the pool. He manages to get one to crawl onto the his finger. \nNICOLE So, how do you know this guy? \nTJ I don't know, he's sort of moved into my grandma's house with us. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nNICOLE What, like he's renting a room or something? \nTJ No, not really, I don't know, it's kinda a long story. \nTJ flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's climbing up his arm. \nNICOLE Do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard? \nTJ stops mid ant flicking. \nTJ Sorry, I... \nNICOLE Do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ant's gone? Do you think their gonna miss her? \nTJ doesn't know how to answer. \nHesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to the diving board. He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool. \nHesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it with his lighter. The diving board erupts into flames. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Jesus Christ. \nHESHER (SINGING) Jump in the fi-re. \nHesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board. He springs through the flames into the air. He does a messy sideways flip. \nHESHER (CONT'D) FUCK YOU BITCHES!!! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nHe lands in the pool splashing TJ and Nicole. He pulls himself out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog. He looks over at the flaming diving board. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Shit, look at that. \nHesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence. He doesn't look back. \nHESHER (CONT'D) I got a doctor's appointment. \nTJ What? \nHesher hops over the fence. \nHESHER (O.S.) (YELLS) It burns when I urinate... \nHesher disappears over the fence. We hear his van start and peel away. \nThe flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as it crumbles into the pool. \nNICOLE Did he just leave us? I think we should get out of here. \nNicole stands and heads for the gate, TJ tags behind. They jump the side fence and head out into the street, dripping wet. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nTJ & Nicole walk over the crest of a small hill on a tree-lined street eating ice-cream cones. They walk in the middle of the road, still damp. The sun is setting. The light is magical. \nTJ My shoes are so squishy. \nTJ steps hard, squirting water out the sides of his wet shoes. Nicole smiles. \n", "test2_id": 1477, "test3_input": "NICOLE So, what's his name? \nTJ Hesher. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNICOLE Hesher?... Is that a name? \nTJ I don't know. I guess? \nNICOLE Does he have a last name? \nTJ I don't know. \nNICOLE How old is he? \nTJ I don't know. \nNICOLE Do you know anything about him? \nTJ Not really. \nBeat. \nNICOLE That was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car. I was freaking out. I don't really have any insurance right now. I just can't afford it. There's no way I could afford to fix that guy's car. How do people do this stuff? I mean, I have a job. It's kind of a joke though. I've been there for like a year and I'm still only doing like five hours a week. Why aren't they giving me any more hours? Do you think it's because they think I suck? Did you think I sucked when I served you at the checkout? \nTJ (UNSURE) No? \nNICOLE I don't even get paid enough to really cover my rent. I'm gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nTJ licks his ice cream, then reaches into his pocket. \nTJ Here, I got two bucks. \nNICOLE The sad thing is I could actually use it. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nA parking ticket sits under the wiper on Nicole's windshield. TJ and Nicole approach the car, smiling - and then Nicole sees the ticket. Her face sinks immediately. \nNICOLE Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a ticket... \nShe runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from under the wiper. She reads it quick. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Fuck, fuck, fuck it. \nShe paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the car's tire. It hurts her foot. She yelps. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Ah, shit. Fuck it. \nIn a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens the car door. She gets in and slams the door behind her. She sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated. \nTJ stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. He goes to the car and gets in beside her. He sits, still not knowing what to say. She tries to settle herself, but she's still very emotional. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) What have I done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time? Sometimes I wonder if I were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice. \nTJ I would. \nShe lets out a small disbelieving laugh. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNICOLE That's nice of you to say, but I doubt it. \nTJ I would. If you died right now. (BEAT) I'd notice. \nTJ thinks a moment. It's a sweet and sour moment. He wants to cheer Nicole up, but he's remembering his Mom at the same time. \nTJ (CONT'D) Mainly because I'd be sitting in a car with a dead lady. \nNicole sniffs, smiling through her tears. \nNICOLE Please don't call me lady. \nShe smiles warmly at TJ. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Let's get out of here. \nShe puts the key in the ignition and turns it. Nothing. Nicole takes a breath - not wanting to get upset again. She turns to TJ and smiles sadly. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) You wanna steer or push? \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE - NIGHT \nTJ enters the house, he leaves his wet shoes and socks at the door. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \n", "test3_true": "TJ sits. Hesher is smiling. \nGRANDMA Hi TJ. \nTJ Hey Grandma. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHESHER So did you fuck her? \nTJ What?! No?! \nDad enters tying the drawstring on his track pants. He looks messy as ever. \nDAD (TO TJ) Where were you today? \nTJ What? \nDAD Counselling - 3:30, I'm there by myself. \nTJ Oh, sorry. I forgot. \nDAD Yeah, that's real nice. This thing is for you just as much as it is for me. I waited outside school for 45 minutes. \nTJ Yeah, well, I told you I don't want to go. \nDAD Maybe you should let me know before you don't show up next time. \nTJ I did. I told you I didn't want to go. I told you a hundred times. \nDAD No you didn't. \nTJ Yes I did. You're just not listening. \nDAD No you didn't. What you told me was that you didn't want to go. You didn't tell me that you were just not going to show up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nTJ What difference does it make? \nDAD For me a big difference. It means, I'm sitting on a fucking beanbag in a room full of losers by myself. \nGrandma sets more food on the table. \nGRANDMA Boys please, I'm not feeling well. \nGrandma heads back to the kitchen to grab more food. There is silence at the table. \nDAD (TO HESHER) Can you pass me my pills? \nHesher slides dad's pill bottle over. \nHesher puts his finger into the mashed potatoes and wiggles it around. \nHESHER (discreetly, to TJ) Did you finger her twat? \nTJ Shut the fuck up. \nDAD (SWALLOWING PILLS) TJ. \nTJ What? \nHesher licks the potatoes off his finger. \nDAD Language. I don't wanna hear it. \nTJ Did you hear what he just said? \nDAD I don't care. If I hear it again, you're going to your room. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nTJ My room!? You gonna start punishing me now? \nDAD Maybe I need to. If it's not the language, then it's your lack of responsibility... or I'm having to escort you down to the police station. \nTJ Shit, dad. I'm really sorry you had your ass dragged off the couch. I'm sorry you had to put some fucking underpants on for the first time in months. \nDAD TJ. \nTJ What?! \nTJ sits and fumes, nostrils flaring. \nDAD That's enough. \nTJ Oh, what, soon as I'm right, that's enough?! \n", "test3_id": 1478}

{"train": "HESHER \nWritten by \nSpencer Susser & David Michod \nJuly 7th, 2008 EXT. STREET - DAY \nA small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm, rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck towing a badly wrecked red Volvo. \nHe struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows, turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic. \nThe truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up, stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt. \nTJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and continues after the truck. \nTJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - DAY \nTJ arrives at the car lot as the TOW TRUCK DRIVER is lowering the car onto the drive. TJ dumps his bike, out of breath. \nTJ This car has to go back. \nTOW TRUCK DRIVER Huh? \nTJ This car has to go back to where it came from. Put it back on the truck. \nTOW TRUCK DRIVER What are you talking about, kid? \nThe driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck. \nTJ Stop unhooking it. There's been a mistake. \nTOW TRUCK DRIVER I was told to bring it here. That's what it says on my work order. Talk to that guy if you've got a problem. \nThe driver nods in the direction of LARRY TOWERS, who is approaching with 17 year-old DUSTIN HOWARD and another man, TONY, in dirty overalls. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLARRY (to tow truck driver) Hey, Bill. \nLarry shakes the tow truck driver's hand. \nTJ This car has to go back where it came from. \nLARRY I beg your pardon? \nTJ It was brought here by mistake. \nLarry smiles at the little out-of-breath kid. \nLARRY And where was it supposed to go? \nTJ It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It needs to go back where it came from. The guy who sold it to you made a mistake. \nLARRY (TO TONY) What's the deal with this car again, Tony? \nTony flips through a stack of papers he's holding. \nTONY Ah let's see, we bought this car yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney- \nTJ That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell. \nLARRY Well, it's his name on the pink slip, son. And that means it's his to sell if he wants. \nTJ Yeah, but I'm just telling you it was a mistake, OK, so it needs to go back where it came from. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nThe car has now been lowered off the back of the tow truck. Larry moves away from TJ and approaches the driver. \nLARRY Thanks, Bill. (TO TONY) You got that work order there? \nTony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Get out of the car, son. \nTJ ignores him. Larry doesn't have time for this. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Dustin, get him outta there, will ya? \nDustin moves around to the open driver's side window. \nDUSTIN Come on dude, get out of the car. \nTJ turns the key and begins winding the window up. Dustin reaches in trying to unlock the door. \nDUSTIN (CONT'D) C'mon. Open it. \nDespite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and looks depressed. \nEXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nTJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets. \nUp ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road. \nHe jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down. \nA silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ. \nHESHER The fuck you think you're doing!? \nBefore TJ can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his T- shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house. \nINT. HALF-BUILT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nHesher drags TJ into the unfinished front room. He slams TJ against an uncoated drywall. Hesher pulls a pair of garden shears from his back pocket and squeezes TJ's nose between the blades. \nTJ is terrified. He squirms. \nHESHER The fuck you think you're doing!? \nTJ Nothing. \nHESHER You got five seconds or I'm gonna cut your fuckin' nose off. \nTJ I was just, I was just going to school. I, I didn't know anyone was here. \nHesher stares intimidatingly at TJ. TJ looks seriously scared. \nHESHER Bullshit. You're gonna fuckin' - \nHesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to 'shhhh'. \nThe SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens. \nTJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag. \nA car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house. \nHesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom. \nHESHER (CONT'D) You just fucked me. \nHesher snaps into action. With speed and precision he gathers his stuff together. He shoves it all his duffel bag. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSECURITY GUARD (O.S.) Who's in there? \nHesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped in duct tape and throws it through the broken window. He then slips out the back door, leaving TJ face down on the floor freaked out and confused. \nSECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D) What the hell- \nBOOM! Dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the window. TJ cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van starting up. He hears the van screech away. \nSECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey! Get back here! \nTJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the front door. \nEXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CONTINUOUS \nTJ darts for his bike. He picks it up and rides off quickly. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING \nOutside a public high school, kids mill around before class. Lots of noise. \nTJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny 2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack. \nINT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - DAY \nTJ opens his locker. He pulls out a clear zip-lock bag with a rotten apple inside. He looks at it a moment then puts it back in the locker. \nA kid puts his hand on TJ's shoulder. \nKID 1 Hey, TJ. You're back. Welcome back. \nAnother kid comes over, eating a bagel. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nKID 2 Hey, Teej. Welcome back, man. \nTJ nods, despondent, putting books into his backpack. \nKID 2 (CONT'D) How you feeling, man? \nCOUNSELLOR Look, TJ. I know you've been through a lot and it's gonna take time to readjust, but as you know, the school can't tolerate this kind of behavior. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: COUNSELLOR (CONT'D) I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but you can't be starting fights. \nTJ I didn't start anything. He pushed me. \nCOUNSELLOR What he did or didn't do isn't important. What's important is what you do, and how you react. Do you understand? \nTJ Not really. \nCOUNSELLOR Which part don't you understand? \nTJ I don't understand the part about how it's not important that he pushed me and he punched me and he kicked me and he told me to suck his cock and now I'm the bad guy sitting in the office. \nThe counsellor cuts him off. \nCOUNSELLOR Hey, hey, hey. I do not wanna hear that kind of language in my office. \nTJ Yeah, but I didn't - \nCOUNSELLOR Listen, I'm gonna cut you some slack, but you're gonna have to meet me halfway here. \nTJ shakes his head. He gives up on this conversation. He looks out the window. Hesher is out there - smoking and watching. \nTJ is suddenly unnerved. \nCOUNSELLOR (CONT'D) I should really be suspending you, but I won't if you can promise me you'll put in a real effort... (noticing TJ looking ELSEWHERE) Are you listening? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nTJ Yeah, OK. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - LATE AFTERNOON \nIt's after school. TJ walks out to his bike. It's the last one left on the rack. Only a couple of other kids are still on campus. TJ looks around. He jumps on his bike and quickly rides off. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nTJ enters the house, which is quiet except for the sounds of a TV. There are no lights on so it feels dark. \nHe walks past the TV room, the TV is on. Dad is on his back, fast asleep, mouth wide open. He barely seems alive, until he makes a small whimper. His mouth closes, he swallows, then his mouth drops open again. \nTJ picks up the remote control from a mess of empty pill bottles on the coffee table and switches off the TV. \nTJ walks past the kitchen and drops his backpack. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTJ walks past his grandma's bedroom. The door is open. He gently knocks. She's sitting up in bed, reading. \nGRANDMA Hi, pumpkin. \nTJ Hey. \nTJ stands in the doorway. Grandma takes off her glasses. \nGRANDMA How was your day? \nTJ Pretty much sucked. \nGRANDMA Why sweetheart? \nTJ thinks for a moment. \nTJ I don't know. It just sucked. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGrandma looks at TJ with an empathetic nod. \nTJ (CONT'D) Do you want me to turn on the light for you? \nGRANDMA Do I look like I'm sitting in darkness here? \nTJ I don't know, maybe, a little. \nGRANDMA Maybe I need new glasses? \nShe holds her glasses up for closer inspection. \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) Actually, I don't even know if these are mine. \nTJ Whose are they? \nGRANDMA Geez, I don't know. \nTJ Well, can you see better with them? \nGRANDMA Jesus, I don't know. \nTJ I don't know. It feels kinda weird, I can't tell. \nDOCTOR It will feel strange for a few days, but should start to feel normal again soon. Alright, lookin' good. I s'pose I should write you a note for school. \nThe doctor writes the note. While he does so he makes chit chat. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) How's your Dad doing? \nTJ Not great. I don't know. You should probably just ask him yourself. \nINT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / CLASSROOM - DAY \nMrs. Elsberry drones on from the front of the class. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMRS ELSBERRY If we consider that dreams serve a metaphoric function in narrative fiction, as they do in life, what metaphoric function would you suggest the dreams here are serving? \nTJ sits in the back of the class, by the window. \nA little pebble hits TJ's desk. It bounces onto the floor. TJ looks around to find where it came from - and then another one hits him in the head. \nHe looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and long, staring hard at TJ. \nTJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this. \nMRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D) TJ! What are you doing? Please pass that forward. \nTJ passes the marker forward. Mrs. Elsberry sets the marker on her desk. \nMRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D) You can collect this after class. \nShe continues back to the chalkboard. \nMRS ELSBERRY (O.S.) (CONT'D) OK, so for our protagonist, are these dreams premonitions or desires or even nightmares perhaps? \nEXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON \nIt's after school. Kids are leaving campus. TJ wheels his bike across the school yard. \nEXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nTJ rides his bike down the street. Dustin's YELLOW MUSTANG appears beside him. Dustin is boiling. \nDUSTIN You're fuckin' dead. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWe see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis. The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK' have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super market parking lot, attempting to get away. \nDustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him. \nDustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself, cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him. He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process. \nAnd then a WOMAN'S VOICE - \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey! \nDustin ignores the voice. He continues beating TJ. \nVOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey! Leave him alone! \nDustin ignores again. \nVOICE (CONT'D) Hey! I said stop it! \nDustin ignores one last time - a beat passes, then the woman, NICOLE (mid-20s), appears behind Dustin and jumps onto his back, bear hugging his face. \nNICOLE Leave him alone! \nDustin shakes erratically, Nicole has a tight grip on him, but eventually Dustin manages to throw her onto the ground. \nDUSTIN What the fuck are you doing lady? \nNicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists like she's ready to fight. She doesn't look very tough. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nNICOLE What are you doing?! \nNicole stands defiantly between Dustin and TJ. Dustin looks around at the scene he's created in the street. A man steps out of his car. Dustin realizes it's time to go. \nDUSTIN (TO TJ) I'm not finished, you fuck. \nHe gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off. \nNicole watches him go, then helps TJ up. TJ is shirtless, scrawny, dirty and traumatized. \nNICOLE Are you alright? \nTJ enters and sits opposite. \nTJ I want to get the car back. \nLARRY Yeah, I figured that. You made it pretty clear the last time you were here, and I thought I made it pretty clear that I couldn't give it to you. \nTJ What do I need to do to get it back? \nLARRY The car's not for sale. \nTJ I want to get it back, though. How much do you want for it? \nLarry takes a breath. He doesn't want to be having this conversation. He counts the obstacles out on his fingers. \nLARRY I don't know. We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, ADM, or dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd need a driver's license. I'm guessing you don't have one of those. You'd need valid car insurance. I'm guessing you don't have that either. But even if you did have these things, I still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. There's a million reasons why I can't sell it to you. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFor a second it seems Larry feels sympathetic toward TJ. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Look kid, I appreciate your enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't know what to tell you. You can't have the car. End of story. \nTJ churns all this over in his head. Larry thinks he's made himself clear. He motions to the papers on his desk. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Do you mind if I get back to it here? \nEXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY / OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nTJ walks out of Larry's office, forlorn. He walks across the showroom, head down, mumbling angrily to himself. \nHe is stopped by a hand on his chest. It's Dustin. \nDUSTIN You're lucky I'm at work right now. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTJ sits on his bike staring at a Ralph's supermarket. \nINT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER \nNicole is at the checkout, checking grocery items. She finishes with a customer and TJ appears next in line, with an ice cream cone. \nNICOLE Hi Sir, how are you today? Oh, hey. \nTJ Hey. \nNICOLE How's it goin'? \nTJ I got you a replacement ice cream. \nNicole is a little taken aback. \nNICOLE Oh my god. That's so sweet, thanks. \nTJ smiles awkwardly. He hands her the cone. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ I paid for it over there. \nHe points to the ice cream counter on the other side of the store. \nNICOLE Oh, OK. \nShe holds the cone, not quite sure what to do with it, not quite sure how to take this kid. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Thanks. \nTJ (NERVOUS) Sure, OK. See ya. \nTJ walks away. \nNICOLE See ya. \nNicole watches him leave while a line of customers wait to be served. She smiles at the next customer, sharing the moment. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (to next customer) Hi. \nShe starts checking the customer's items, still holding her melting cone. She looks up out the door. She can see TJ outside, shaking his head and mumbling to himself. He feels like an idiot. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING \nTJ enters the house. Dad isn't on the couch. He heads for the kitchen. He stops abruptly in the doorway. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nHesher and Grandma are at the counter. Grandma is baking an apple pie. Hesher is joyfully eating the apple slices she is preparing for the pie. They don't notice TJ. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHesher shoves the money in his pocket, ignoring TJ. He unzips his fly and turns to urinate in the bowl. \nTJ What are you doing here? \nHESHER Pissing. \nTJ What are you doing at my school? \nHESHER I'm putting out a fire. \nTJ notices that he isn't actually urinating in the bowl. He's spraying his pee all over the seat and the lid and the wall and the floor. He finishes and zips up. He turns and shoves past TJ. \nHesher looks at his hair in the mirror, then exits. TJ watches him leave, frustrated. He follows him out. \nINT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - CONTINUOUS \nTJ sees Hesher disappear through the crowd. From behind, TJ is grabbed and dragged back into the bathroom. \nINT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTJ is swung by his backpack across the bathroom. His backpack gets ripped off him and he goes down, sliding across the pissy floor. He looks up. It's Dustin, seriously angry. TJ leaps up and shoves Dustin back. Dustin stumbles backwards and trips over TJ's bag in the middle of the bathroom floor. \nDustin falls and lands on his ass. He flounders embarrassingly. TJ knows he's a dead man. \nDustin jumps up and grabs TJ by the back of his head. He shoves TJ's face down onto the filthy urinal tray. TJ struggles. \nDUSTIN You fucked my car, you little prick. \nDustin holds TJ's head down in the tray. He shoves his face into the little yellow urinal deodorizer cake. \nDUSTIN (CONT'D) Eat the cake. \nTJ goes to lift himself up. Dustin punches him and then stands, putting his foot on TJ's neck, jamming TJ's head into the tray. He pushes the flusher. The urinal flushes all over TJ's face. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDUSTIN (CONT'D) Fuckin' eat it. \nHesher comes back into the bathroom. Dustin turns and looks at him, sensing danger. TJ looks up from the bathroom floor, eyes pleading for help. Hesher walks calmly towards TJ and Dustin. But instead of saving TJ, he walks straight past them and into the stall where he just completed his drug deal. \nHe grabs his cigarette lighter from the top of toilet tank. He lights a cigarette, takes a long drag, blows the smoke in the air and walks back out again. Dustin watches him go. He puts another boot into TJ. \nDUSTIN (CONT'D) It's your birthday. Eat your fuckin' cake. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nTJ waits with his bike in the street outside the school. He's beat up, wet and dirty. School's out. Most kids have already left. Dad pulls up in Grandma's maroon Buick. He gets out and opens the back door for TJ's bike. \nDAD You ready? \nTJ I don't wanna go. \nDAD It'll be good for us, Teej. C'mon. We'll be late. \nDad takes TJ's bike and starts trying to fit it in the backseat. \nTJ I really don't want to go. \nDAD I don't think anyone ever 'wants to go' to these things. It's supposed to be good for us. That's the whole point. \nTJ stands watching his Dad struggle with the bike. \nDAD (CONT'D) C'mon. Give me a hand here. \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY \nTJ and Dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12. Eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them - adults and a few kids. Some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam cups. The tone is sombre. Dad and TJ look unsure of themselves. The chairperson of the meeting is MERYL, a 42 year-old grief counsellor. \nMERYL OK, so welcome everyone to the Transformational Grief Group. My name is Meryl. We should start off by going around the circle and introducing ourselves and briefly explaining why we are here. Hi Miss, would you please start us off? \nA heavy set woman, COLEEN, and her husband, JACK, sit on beanbags looking pale and sad. \nCOLEEN We are the Bolder family. I am Coleen and this is my husband Jack. Our daughter Cynthia was murdered last year. (she chokes a bit) She was the victim of a violent attack that was unfair and sick. \nShe can't go on. Her husband Jack sets his hand on her shoulder. She is able to hold back the tears. \nCOLEEN (CONT'D) We are here because we need help. We lost our baby and we are broken. \nJACK Hi, my name is Jack. As my wife said, we're here hoping for some answers and just some help with the pain. \nMERYL Thank you, Coleen and Jack. Welcome. \nWeird silence. \nMERYL (CONT'D) (to Dad and TJ) Sir. \nDad shuffles in his seat, looks around the group. \nTJ What are we doing? \nHesher gets out of the van and slams the door shut. He goes around the back of the van and opens the back doors. He pulls something out and shuts the doors again. \nThrough the side-view mirror, TJ can see Hesher filling up a big beat-up plastic gas container. He continues to smoke. \nINT. HESHER'S VAN - LATER \nHesher brings the van to a quiet halt across the street from a suburban house. He kills the engine and surveys the area. \nTJ has no idea where they are. \nTJ What are we - \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ catches himself asking questions, but stops himself mid- sentence. He looks out the window and across the street and sees Dustin Howard's YELLOW MUSTANG parked in the drive. \nTJ (CONT'D) (OH SHIT) What are you doing? \nHesher smiles to himself - he's looking forward to this. He opens the van door and climbs out. TJ is in a quiet panic. \nEXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nHesher opens the van's back doors and grabs the container of gasoline. TJ appears beside him, still panicked. \nTJ Hey, seriously. What are you doing? \nHesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the yellow Mustang. \nHe pours gasoline all over the car. He does this with confidence - he's clearly had some practice. \nTJ (CONT'D) (loud whisper - too loud) Come on. This is insane. Let's get out of here. \nHesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas. \nThe porch light comes on. Someone peels open the front window curtains and looks out. TJ and Hesher drop to the ground behind the Mustang. TJ is terrified. He looks over to Hesher who is smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him. \nThe curtains close but the porch light stays on. Unfazed, Hesher hops back up and empties the gas can onto the Mustang. \nHesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from his pocket. \nHe straightens it, then lights it with a match. \nTJ (CONT'D) (QUIETLY FRANTIC) C'mon, man. Let's just go. \nHesher takes one long drag on the cigarette, then calmly flicks the still lit match onto the Mustang. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nInstantly, it erupts in flames. \nHesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van. TJ follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house. \nHesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back. \nTJ goes to the passenger door. \nIt's locked. He wrestles the handle, panicking. \nTJ (CONT'D) Open the door! It's locked! \nHesher starts the van and pulls away, leaving TJ stranded in the street. \nThe front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the porch. Discovering the car in flames, she screams. \nTJ takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on the porch screaming at him. \nWOMAN Hey, get back here! \nEXT. STREETS & BACKYARDS - NIGHT \nTJ runs. He jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses. He's running fast and breathing hard. \nHe finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street. \nHe stops. He has no idea where he is or where to go. \nThen - HEADLIGHTS appear at the end of the street. They bear down on him slowly. TJ stands immobile. He can now see it is Hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing. \nThe van stops about 10 feet from TJ. A moment's stand off. \nThen Hesher sticks his head out the window. \nHESHER Get in. \nTJ You fucking ditched me. \nHESHER Get in the van, dude. \nTJ's FINGERPRINTS are taken. \nTJ and his Dad sit in an interview room. Dad looks confused, dopey and dishevelled. A uniformed police officer enters with a file. He shuts the door and sits. \nCOP OK, so we're gonna have to let you go now. We may very well be calling on you again very soon, but in the meantime, let this be a warning to you. Regardless of what evidence we do or don't find, you've come to our attention today. Our attention isn't good. \nTJ But I didn't do anything. \nCOP You hearing me here? These are very serious crimes we've been presented with. Let's just say someone had been in that car, and they'd burned - to death. We'd be talking about manslaughter, possibly murder. Have you thought about that? You'd be sitting here with detectives from Homicide right now. These are felony offences we're talking about, son. Serious jail-time offences. \nTJ nods, his dad looks on. \nINT. GRANDMA'S CAR - DAY \nTJ's in the passenger seat. His dad drives. They sit in silence for a little while. Then dad speaks- \nDAD Did you do it? \nTJ pauses before answering. \nTJ Not really. \nDAD Not really? \nTJ I didn't do it. \nDAD What does `not really' mean? \nTJ ignores him, stares out the car window. \nDAD (CONT'D) Tell me what `not really' means. \nTJ It means I didn't do it. \nDAD No, it doesn't. Why would you say 'not really'? \nTJ I didn't. \nDAD You did. I heard you. \nTJ I said I didn't do it. \nDAD Yeah, before that. I asked if you did it. You said `not really'. \nTJ I can't remember what I said. \nDAD Why would you do something like that? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDad pulls the car into the driveway and comes to an abrupt stop. Hesher is sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the driveway, sunbathing with his shirt off, drinking beer. He has a farmer's tan. \nTJ jumps out. Dad stares at Hesher from inside the car. \nHESHER Howdy. \nTJ walks past Hesher without looking at him. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTJ enters and slams his door shut. TJ sits on his bed. Hesher enters without warning. \nHESHER So what'd the pigs want? \nTJ What the fuck do you think!? \nHESHER Did they give you a cavity search? \nTJ What? \nHESHER Did any of the cops put their fingers in your butthole? \nTJ Just fuck off, OK. \nHESHER What'd they do? \nTJ They took my fucking finger prints! \nHESHER So what? \nTJ So what!? I can get into serious trouble. \nHESHER Oh, is that right? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ Yeah, that's right! They don't take this shit lightly. \nHESHER Oh, they don't? \nTJ gets onto his bike. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHESHER (CONT'D) Come on dude, don't be silly, let's just car pool. \nTJ clearly doesn't want to ride his bike home, but his is reluctant to go with Hesher. \nTJ Fine, just don't talk to me. \nHESHER I won't say shit. \nEXT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER \nTJ and Hesher load TJ's bike into the back of Hesher's van. Hesher closes the back doors and they get in. \nINT. HESHER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS \nHESHER Look dude, I'm really sorry about the fire the other night - \nHe waits a beat for TJ to respond. TJ is still mad, he says nothing. \nHESHER (CONT'D) That was totally out of control. Foolish and irresponsible actually. \nTJ looks at Hesher, doubting his sincerity. \nHESHER (CONT'D) I want you to have this - \nHesher reaches into the back of the van and picks up a dirty magazine. He flips through some pages and shows TJ a photo. \nTJ pushes the magazine away, disgusted. \nTJ Get that away from me. \nHESHER Dude are you gay? I can't work you out. \nHesher spots Nicole getting into her car. He drops the magazine on TJ's lap and fires up the engine. \nTJ spots Nicole. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ Hey, what are you doing? \nHesher puts the car in gear and begins to follow Nicole's car out of the parking lot. \nTJ (CONT'D) Stop the car, I want to get out. \nHESHER Shush. \nTJ opens the door. Hesher grabs his arm. \nHESHER (CONT'D) You get out of this van, I'll rip your dick off and fuck her for you. \nHesher means business. TJ is silent and back on edge. \nNicole drives through the parking lot. Hesher follows her out of the lot and into the street. \nINT. HESHER'S VAN / STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nHesher bobs his head in time with a heavy metal track that blasts from the stereo. \nTJ is ignoring Hesher, looking straight ahead at Nicole's car. Nicole stops at a red light behind another car. Hesher pulls up behind her and starts playing air drums to the track. \nThe light turns green. Nicole hits the gas, running straight into the back of the car in front which hadn't started moving yet. \nHESHER Whoops. \nTJ's first impulse is to duck. Hesher watches the road. We hear the sounds of an angry DRIVER yelling at Nicole. \nThrough the windscreen we see the guy get out of his car, yelling at Nicole. \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nNicole is flustered and begins to cry. The driver is inspecting the smashed rear end of his car. \nNICOLE I'm sorry. I didn't - \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDRIVER You just messed up the back of my car you stupid idiot. You need to pay attention when you're driving a fucking car - \nHESHER (O.S.) I think I can help here. \nHesher is out of the van approaching on foot, smoking. \nHESHER (CONT'D) I saw the whole thing. The chick here was stopped and you reversed right into her. \nDRIVER What? \nHESHER This one time I had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and I had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like I had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while I'm trying to eat the other girl out, and I was going crazy man. It was too much. I couldn't work out which chick was which and I'm making one girl cum but then I'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually I was just like 'Fuck this. This is too much' and I just stepped back. I just stepped back. And before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know. They're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and I jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know? \nNicole looks at Hesher like he's crazy. TJ is in the back - he can't believe what's coming out of Hesher's mouth. A moment passes. \nNICOLE Was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me? About how I should just step back and let things work themselves out? \nHESHER A what? \nHe reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob - Metallica's, 'Motorbreath' BLASTS through the speakers. \nAs if he were possessed by the music, Hesher veers dangerously off the road onto a dirt patch. He has a crazed look in his eyes. TJ and Nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto. \nHesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. The van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction. TJ gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground. Dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe. Hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHe turns the knob on the radio to an easy listening station. UB40's 'Red Red Wine' plays. A car honks as an angry driver passes. \nNICOLE What the hell was that? \nHesher looks over at Nicole. \nHESHER I saw a mouse. \nNICOLE What? \nTJ picks himself up off the van's floor, dusting himself off. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (TO TJ) Are you OK? \nTJ I have dirt in my mouth. \nTJ scrapes his tongue with his fingers. Nicole breaks a little smile. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY \nThe black van pulls up curb-side outside a neat suburban home. Hesher gets out and walks, covered in dirt, to the front door of the house. He looks in through the window, knocks, waits. An old man opens the door. They exchange a few words. Hesher heads back to the van and they drive off. Nicole and TJ seem confused. \nNICOLE Who's that guy? \nHesher says nothing. They drive three houses down the street and stop again. Hesher gets out. Again he peers in the window, knocks on the door. This time no answer. He heads back to the van. Nicole and TJ watch him approach from inside. He sticks his head in. \nHESHER We're here. Come on, let's go. \nNICOLE We're where? \nHESHER My uncle's house. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHesher walks off toward the side gate of the house. Nicole and TJ climb out of the van and follow Hesher. Nicole seems cautious. TJ knows he's on an adventure. \nHesher jumps the SIDE GATE, then opens it for the others. \nNICOLE What was that back there? \nHESHER What was what? \nNICOLE That other house? \nHESHER Wrong house. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOME / BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER \nIn the backyard is a swimming pool. \nNicole and TJ stand looking in the pool. It's a nice pool with a diving board. \nHesher walks up behind them and pushes them in. \nNicole comes up for air. \nNICOLE What the fuck!? \nHESHER What? You're dirty. \nNICOLE Yeah, and now I'm wet. \nHesher smiles wide. \nHESHER You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in... \nHe throws his T-shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Now I'm dirty and wet too. \nHe splashes water at her. He dives under the water. Suddenly TJ is pulled under. Nicole can't see them under all the motion. Then TJ and Hesher come bursting up for air. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNICOLE So, what's his name? \nTJ Hesher. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNICOLE Hesher?... Is that a name? \nTJ I don't know. I guess? \nNICOLE Does he have a last name? \nTJ I don't know. \nNICOLE How old is he? \nTJ I don't know. \nNICOLE Do you know anything about him? \nTJ Not really. \nBeat. \nNICOLE That was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car. I was freaking out. I don't really have any insurance right now. I just can't afford it. There's no way I could afford to fix that guy's car. How do people do this stuff? I mean, I have a job. It's kind of a joke though. I've been there for like a year and I'm still only doing like five hours a week. Why aren't they giving me any more hours? Do you think it's because they think I suck? Did you think I sucked when I served you at the checkout? \nTJ (UNSURE) No? \nNICOLE I don't even get paid enough to really cover my rent. I'm gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nTJ licks his ice cream, then reaches into his pocket. \nTJ Here, I got two bucks. \nNICOLE The sad thing is I could actually use it. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nA parking ticket sits under the wiper on Nicole's windshield. TJ and Nicole approach the car, smiling - and then Nicole sees the ticket. Her face sinks immediately. \nNICOLE Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a ticket... \nShe runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from under the wiper. She reads it quick. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Fuck, fuck, fuck it. \nShe paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the car's tire. It hurts her foot. She yelps. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Ah, shit. Fuck it. \nIn a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens the car door. She gets in and slams the door behind her. She sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated. \nTJ stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. He goes to the car and gets in beside her. He sits, still not knowing what to say. She tries to settle herself, but she's still very emotional. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) What have I done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time? Sometimes I wonder if I were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice. \nTJ I would. \nShe lets out a small disbelieving laugh. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNICOLE That's nice of you to say, but I doubt it. \nTJ I would. If you died right now. (BEAT) I'd notice. \nTJ thinks a moment. It's a sweet and sour moment. He wants to cheer Nicole up, but he's remembering his Mom at the same time. \nTJ (CONT'D) Mainly because I'd be sitting in a car with a dead lady. \nNicole sniffs, smiling through her tears. \nNICOLE Please don't call me lady. \nShe smiles warmly at TJ. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Let's get out of here. \nShe puts the key in the ignition and turns it. Nothing. Nicole takes a breath - not wanting to get upset again. She turns to TJ and smiles sadly. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) You wanna steer or push? \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE - NIGHT \nTJ enters the house, he leaves his wet shoes and socks at the door. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nGrandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out. \nGRANDMA So is TJ the mouse? \nHESHER Maybe he is. \nGRANDMA Well then, what am I? \nHESHER You're an old lady. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) \nGRANDMA No, I'm a grandmother. \nHESHER Yes you are. And you know what grandmother? I'm gonna go on a walk with you in the morning. \nGRANDMA Oh, that's nice. Where are you going? \nHESHER I'm not going anywhere. I'm going with you. Around the block, I guess. \nGRANDMA Oh, OK, well have a nice time. I'll see you when you get back. \nHESHER No, I'm going with you. \nGRANDMA Ohh, OK, caauuse iii... \nGrandma has fallen asleep, but mumbles like she is continuing the conversation. Hesher smiles to himself, turns off her lamp and exits the room. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nHesher enters. He stands over what's left of the mess on the kitchen floor. He lights up a cigarette off the stove's flame and takes a long, slow drag, as he crouches down and starts picking up pieces of broken plate from the pile. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nDad is asleep on the couch. A single shaft of bright sunlight lands on his face, causing him to stir. \nTJ nimbly reaches down to the table, covered with dirty dishes and pill bottles, and quietly picks up his dad's wallet. He removes an ATM card and places the wallet back where it was. He exits. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS STREET / ATM - MORNING \nClose on an ATM card, sliding into the slot. Fingers type numbers. A small stack of twenty dollar bills pours out. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ puts the money in a dirty envelope, pockets it and rides off on his bike. \nINT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - MORNING \nTJ walks through the showroom to Larry's office. Larry is on the phone. TJ stands and waits. Larry watches him. The kid isn't going anywhere. \nLARRY Yeah, why don't you just have him send them over... Sure... Scott, can you hold on a minute? (TO TJ) What do you want? \nTJ Can I talk to you? \nLARRY I'm on the phone here. Can you see that? \nTJ I need to talk to you. \nLARRY I'm on the phone. Wait outside. I'll be with you in a minute. \nTJ takes a seat outside the office. Larry closes the door. Dustin Howard appears. \nDUSTIN The fuck are you doing here? \nTJ I came to talk to him. \nDUSTIN What about? \nTJ It's none of your business. \nDUSTIN What do you wanna talk to him about? \nTJ ignores him. Dustin taps TJ's leg with his foot. \nDUSTIN (CONT'D) What do you want to talk about? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ Just leave me alone. \nLarry's door opens. Larry emerges from his office. TJ stands. \nLARRY What? \nTJ I got the money. \nLARRY What money? \nTJ The money for the car. \nTJ (CONT'D) Oh, Jesus. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe disappears into the room for a second then emerges again in tears, his hands on his face. He heads back to the living room. \nTJ (CONT'D) What happened? \nDAD I don't know, she just, she just didn't wake up. \nTJ is in shock. He sits on the couch next to dad. They are both lost for words. Hesher stands in the corner with his head shoved between the walls. \nHesher joins TJ and Dad on the couch. They are all raging inside, confused, lost and upset. They sit together in silence for a long beat, in the same boat for the first time. \nHesher breaks the silence. He kicks the table over as he stands. \nHESHER I gotta get the fuck out of here before I hurt someone. \nHe leaves through the front door, leaving it open behind him. \nTJ gets up in a daze and stands at the doorway looking out. It has started to drizzle. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nTJ stands in the doorway working up the nerve to enter. \nHe enters and leans down to Grandma and tries to lift her onto the bed. She is heavy for him, he struggles. \nHe gets her on top of the bed and looks at her for a moment. \nTJ breaks into tears. He leans down onto the bed holding Grandma, crying into her chest. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - DAY \nTJ sits on his bed and looks inside the envelope of cash. He closes it and seals it shut. On the front he writes: 'NICOLE'S PARKING TICKET FUND. LOVE TJ.' \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nClose on a small piece of paper with a hand written number. The numbers are dialed on a phone. TJ waits while the phone rings. Answering machine. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNICOLE (ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back. \nBeep. \nTJ Ah, hi. It's TJ here. I, ah, I'm sorry to bug you, but um, I don't know, I guess I wanted to talk to you right now. I don't know. I have a present for you too, so maybe I'll just come drop it off or something, or ah, yeah... Um, OK. Bye. \nHe hangs up the phone and exits. \nEXT. FORNEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nTJ walks out the front door. Dad is quietly sitting on the front steps wearing a T-shirt in the light rain. TJ goes to his bike. \nTJ What are you doing? \nDAD (SNAPPING TO) I don't know. Getting some fresh air, I guess. \nTJ It's starting to rain. \nDad reaches out his hand and catches a few drops. \nDAD Yeah. \nTJ picks up his bike and rides. We stay with Dad as TJ disappears down the wet street. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nTJ rides his bike. He rounds a corner onto Nicole's street. \nHe jumps off his bike outside her building and wheels it inside the front fence. \nEXT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nTJ climbs the stairs of Nicole's building. As he approaches her apartment door, he hears loud, but muffled music. \nHe knocks on the door. No answer. The music is really loud. \nHe knocks again. No answer. He tries the door handle. It gives. \nHe pushes the door open tentatively. \nINT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nTJ enters the apartment. The music is blasting. He looks around the living area. Clothes are strewn around. He sees Hesher's combat boots, T-shirt, jeans. TJ looks seriously troubled. \nWe can faintly hear heavy breathing/moaning coming from the bedroom. \nTJ walks over to a door. It's an inch ajar. He pushes it open gently. \nIt's raining hard. TJ storms out, just as Hesher is making his way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him. Hesher reaches out his arm to slow TJ. \nHESHER I wanna talk to you. \nTJ pushes Hesher's arm out of the way. \nTJ Get your fucking hands away from me! I told you, I never want to see you again. \nHesher, at a loss, watches TJ grab a brick from the muddy garden and throw it through the passenger side window of his van. \nHesher charges TJ. He throws him into the muddy garden and kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded sweatshirt. \nHESHER I fuckin' told you, leave my van out of this! \nHesher lifts TJ up and slams him back down on the ground, knocking the wind out of him. TJ struggles to get away. \nTJ Let go of me! Fuckin' let go of me. \nDad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off TJ by the back of his shirt. \nDAD What in God's name - \nHesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the nose. Dad goes down hard. \nHESHER Don't fuckin' touch m- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWithout hesitation, TJ jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his face. They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw TJ off. He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Fuck you both! Motherfuckers! \nHesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists clenched. \nHe turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left confused and bleeding in the pouring rain. \nEXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's raining cats and dogs. TJ stands outside Dustin's house, soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden shears in his hand. \nHe walks around the side of the house and looks in the window. \nINT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nFrom TJ's POV outside, we see Dustin in the kitchen preparing a sandwich, one eye on the TV. He takes the sandwich to the couch in front of the TV and lies down. \nEXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nTJ walks around the back of the house. He tries the handle to the back door. It's locked. TJ sees the dog door. He climbs through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. The TV is loud inside. \nINT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nTJ treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears poised. \nHe walks through to the living area. He steps behind the couch out of Dustin's line of sight. Dustin's bare feet hang off the end of the couch. \nTJ ducks down. He opens the shears and carefully brings them down over Dustin's big toe. He squeezes them shut... \nDustin squeals. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ Where's my car? \nDUSTIN What are you doing!? \nTJ Where's my fucking car? \nDUSTIN Are you crazy?! \nTJ You make me ask one more time, your toe's coming off. I swear to God. \nDUSTIN It's gone to the wrecker's. \nTJ What? \nDUSTIN The wrecking yard. \nTJ Bullshit. \nTJ squeezes a little harder. Dustin squeals a little louder. \nDUSTIN Why would I be lying? \nTJ Because you're a fucking asshole. Tell me where it is. \nDUSTIN It's gone to the wrecker's. I swear to God. \nTJ squeezes harder. Dustin squeals. \nHe closes his eyes. \nINT. MIDDLE CLASS HOME - DAY \nFLASHBACK \nA doorbell rings. TJ runs to the door wearing the bottom half a suit. It's the pizza man. \nTJ Hi. (yells into house) Pizza's here, I need money. \nDad, clean shaven, dressed in a suit, comes to the door and pays. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ (CONT'D) (yells into the house) OK, pizza's here. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (YELLING BACK) Alright, let's do it. \nThe woman comes down the stairs with her hair nicely done, wearing a fancy pink dress, it's TJ's MOM. \nMOM Teej, c'mon sweetheart. We have to go. We're going to be late. \nTJ What about the pizza? \nMOM We'll eat it in the car. \nShe begins to do up TJ's tie. \nMOM (CONT'D) (TO DAD) Honey, will you grab the present? \nDad picks up a large box off the side table, it's clearly heavy. \nDAD Holy crap, what is this thing? \nThe three emerge from the house. TJ is wearing a suit and carrying the pizza box, Dad's carrying the heavy present, and Mom's carrying a bouquet of flowers and her purse. Dad stands at the door of a little white car. Clearly the box is too big. \nDAD (CONT'D) Ah, slight problem. \nMom open the back of her red volvo which is parked right next to the white car. \nMOM We'll take my car. \nDad does a heel spins around the white car and heads towards Mom's red volvo, never losing a beat. \nDAD Sure thing. \nINT. RED VOLVO - CONTINUOUS \nFLASHBACK \nDad's driving, eating a slice of pizza. TJ is in the backseat, looking out the window, also eating pizza. Mom does her make-up in the visor mirror. \nDAD I think we should keep the new one and give them our old one. \nMOM That's a great idea. I'll be sure to let them know that our dirty old microwave is a gift from you. \nDAD Good. I'm not even sure they know who I am. \nMOM Honey, they're my friends. Please. \nDAD OK, I just don't understand why they get so many presents. \nMOM A microwave and a bottle of scotch is hardly a lot of presents. \nDAD And flowers. \nMom half-laughs and shakes her head. \nTJ (mouth full of pizza) Mom can you turn on the radio? \nMOM Sure honey. How about some oldies? \nTJ Oldies but goodies. \nMom turns on the oldies station. Dion And The Belmont's, \"A Teenager In Love\" plays. Dad sings along. \nThe car hits a bump. Mom smudges her lipstick. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMOM (TO DAD) Honey? \nShe turns to Dad and we can see her lipstick has gone up onto her cheek. She smiles at Dad. They all smile at this, then - \nFrom out of nowhere, the car is T-BONED on the passenger's side. The impact is massive. The NOISE is deafening. Smashed glass. The car spins into the oncoming traffic and is hit by a delivery truck. The car flips. More deafening noise... \nINT. RED VOLVO / D&S WRECKING YARD - MORNING \nTJ wakes in the wrecked car at the wrecking yard. The loud sound of crunching metal continues. TJ is startled and disoriented. He realizes the car is moving. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE - DAY \nNicole stands at the door. TJ is unimpressed with seeing her. He stands in the doorway looking silly with his tie. \nTJ Hesher's not here. \nNICOLE I came to see you. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ Why? What do you want? \nNICOLE I wanted to tell you something. \nTJ stares at her. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) I didn't know if I should come here or not, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I thought maybe if I came you'd still just be really angry at me and hate me, but then I thought if I didn't you'd think I didn't care and you'd hate me anyway, so I figured I might as well come, just in case, so here I am. \nTJ Yeah, well what do you want? \nNICOLE I want to apologize. I feel bad about what happened. I didn't take your feelings into consideration - \nTJ Yeah, well, whatever. It doesn't really matter. I have to go. \nNICOLE Yes it does. It does to me. I like you, TJ. We're friends. \nTJ looks at her, he doesn't really want to be mad at her. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) I understand if you don't want to be my friend. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Sometimes I just... I don't know. I just wanted to come around and say all that, but maybe you still hate me and so it doesn't matter, but I just came round to say that, but I've said it now, so I should just go. So, OK, bye. \nNicole walks off. She gets half way across the lawn before - \nTJ I'm sorry I broke your lamp. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nNicole turns. \nNICOLE It's OK. \nTJ And I'm sorry I called you a fat prostitute. \nNICOLE It's OK. \nTJ You're not fat. \nNicole smiles at this. \nNICOLE But I'm a prostitute? \nTJ I dunno. Maybe. \nThey smile at one another. She crosses the lawn back toward TJ. She fixes his tie. She smiles again and then she leaves. \nINT. GRANDMA'S CAR / FAIR OAKS STREET - AFTERNOON \nDad and TJ sit in the front seat. They are still angry and not speaking to each other. It is an unpleasant and uncomfortable ride. They both wear a suit and tie. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - AFTERNOON \nDad and TJ drive into the funeral home parking lot in Grandma's car. A few people are milling around. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY \nDad and TJ enter the funeral home foyer. They look like they don't know where they're supposed to go. They are greeted by the funeral director from earlier. He talks in a soft monotone whisper. \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR Excuse me, Mr. Forney, may I have a word? \nHe takes Dad aside. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D) I hate to have to do this here, but there's a couple of things I need to discuss with you quickly, if that's OK. \nDAD Ah, sure. \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR I know that we discussed your preferences for some aspects of today's service, including your choice of the cedar casket which the insurance company had covered. Unfortunately we were out of those and instead we've chosen a mahogany casket. Now there is an extra charge for the mahogany which I need to clear with you before we proceed. Is that OK? \nDad looks confused. He doesn't know how he's supposed to respond. \nDAD Ah, I guess. \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR OK, great, thank you. If you could just sign here. \nThe director hands Dad a fancy pen and holds out a dense order form for him to sign. \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Just at the bottom there. \nDad's pen hovers. He doesn't know where he's signing. \nHESHER Um... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nThe funeral director looks over to Dad, not sure what to do. He lightly puts his hand on Hesher's arm to guide him off stage. \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR I'm sorry, sir- \nHesher pushes the funeral director's arm away hard. \nHESHER You touch me again, I'll rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you. \nThe funeral director backs off, scared and unsure of what to do. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't want me here and I don't want to fucking be here, but I'm not here for me, I'm fuckin' here for her- \nHesher gestures to Grandma's coffin. \nHESHER (CONT'D) - and I'm not fuckin' here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it - this is not how I want to say goodbye to someone I like - in this shit-hole with these- \nHesher points to the funeral director. \nHESHER (CONT'D) - fuckin' assholes. \nTJ's dad stands and interrupts. \nDAD OK, this is enough- \nHESHER Yeah, well why don't you shut up for a second and listen cause I'm going to say what I want to say and then you'll never see me again. Alright?! \nThere is a beat of silence. No one knows what to say or do. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nHESHER (CONT'D) I'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin' break it down. \nHesher takes a long pull from his beer can. \nHESHER (CONT'D) I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that. \nHesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of beer on the floor. \nHESHER (CONT'D) I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit. \nThe tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued. \nHESHER (CONT'D) And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) HESHER (CONT'D) All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too. \nHesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his point. They look back at him stunned. \nHESHER (CONT'D) You lost your mom. You lost your wife. I lost a nut. \nHesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk. This soaks in with the crowd. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Fuck this. \nHesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified. \nThe funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks over from the floor. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Leave her alone. We're not finished yet. \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR (POLITELY) Unfortunately sir, we need to be. \nThey continue to push the coffin away. Hesher lifts himself up and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin. The funeral workers back away. \nHESHER I told Grandma I was going on a walk with her and I'm gonna do it! \nDetermined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the coffin stand. \nDad stands, not exactly sure what to do. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (6) \nWith purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit. He turns to TJ - \nHESHER (CONT'D) You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her. This is your last chance. \nHesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the coffin toward the exit and out through the doors. \nTJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the coffin out into the parking lot. \nTJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does the same. \nAll three are now walking together through the funeral home parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a release. Other mourners watch from the doorway. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS \n", "test1_input": "NICOLE I know, that's the point. I used to hate this crazy sour stuff, I don't know what happened. I just recently acquired a taste for it. I don't even really know what's in it, but I pretty much eat it all the time. And I'm sure it's making me fat. I just don't want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see, you know, the really fat ones? \nTJ doesn't know what to make of her. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) I don't know why I'm telling you this. Anyway, I was secretly hoping that you loved these - \nHolding up the licorice, then taking a bite. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) So you could eat 'em for me. But now I can see you don't like em' and I'm kinda glad cuz it means more for me. I guess I'm sort of a hypocrite in a way. \nShe smiles at that. TJ attempts to smile back, but he's so confused he ends up making a strange face. He awkwardly looks away. \nEXT. FORNEY HOUSE - DAY \nNicole's car pulls up. TJ gets out and notices a dirty black van creeping slowly around the corner toward them. This makes him very nervous. \nTJ OK, thanks for the ride. I really appreciate it. \nHe hurries to the door. \nNICOLE Hey! \nTJ turns. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) You want your bike? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ notices his bike still in Nicole's back seat. \nTJ Shit. \nTJ rushes back. He drags it out of her car. \nTJ (CONT'D) Thanks. \nHe wheels it back towards the house. TJ goes around the side of the house to the back door. He knocks on the back door. Grandma appears at the door. \nGRANDMA Hi, TJ. What you doing around the back? \nGrandma lets TJ in. TJ is nervous. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nTJ I just, I dunno. I was just dumping my bike. \nTJ heads for the living room. \nTJ (CONT'D) (CALLING) Hey, Dad! \nGRANDMA Your Dad's gone to the supermarket, honey. Everything OK? \nTJ Ah, yeah, OK. \nBut TJ isn't listening. He can't stop thinking about that black van. He exits the kitchen. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / FRONT DOOR - DAY \nTJ walks the hall carefully to the front door. He squints through the peephole. \nThe black van is parked directly in front of the house. TJ can't see properly through the hole. \nHe turns, to get a better look through the TV room window. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTJ turns to the living room. There is Hesher standing in the middle of the room with a dirty duffel bag over his shoulder. \nTJ is petrified. They stand looking at each other for a long moment. \nHESHER Where's the laundry room? \nTJ My dad'll be home soon. \nHESHER Where's the laundry room? \nTJ Why? \nHESHER You've got two seconds to tell me where the laundry room is before I tear your fuckin' head off and skull fuck you. \nTJ points to a door off the lounge. \nTJ It's through there. But why? You can't - my dad's gonna be home soon. \nHesher stares at him for a second, then heads for the door. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / LAUNDRY - CONTINUOUS \nHesher empties his sack into the washing machine. TJ steps into the room, wary. Hesher ignores him. \n", "test1_true": "Hesher pours laundry detergent liberally into the machine. \nTJ What are you doing? You can't - \nHesher turns on a dime and grabs TJ by his throat and pins him against the wall. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHESHER I swear to god. I'll cut your face off. \nHe closes the lid. He wrenches the dial around and clicks 'start'. The machine begins a loud cycle. Hesher exits. TJ follows awkwardly. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHesher sits in the middle of the couch and lights a cigarette. \nTJ You can't smoke in here. \nHesher drags deep and blows the smoke out in a long whistle straight into the air above him. \nTJ (CONT'D) You can't smoke. \nHesher flicks his cigarette, ashing on the floor. \nTJ (CONT'D) What are you doing? You can't smoke in here. \nHesher looks at him and ashes on the couch. \nTJ (CONT'D) Will you please put it out? \nHESHER Can I put it out in your mouth? \nTJ What?! Wait. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - DAY \nTJ enters the kitchen. Grandma is crumbing chicken fillets at the counter. She's listening to loud talk radio. TJ goes straight for the cupboards and looks through them. \nGrandma turns, eyebrows raised. She turns the radio down. \nGRANDMA I'm gonna make a cake. Do you remember my cherry cake story? \nTJ gets down on his knees and digs his way through the cupboard while Grandma rambles, continuing her chicken crumbing. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) I used to make a cherry cake all the time and it always came out just wonderful. One time I invited my doctor and his wife and I wanted to make an impression. I asked him to come see your dad in a play and he came and I said, 'would you like to come back to the house?' \nTJ emerges from the cupboard with a bowl. He turns toward the sink and begins to fill it with water. \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) And he said, or his wife said, 'yes they'd like to come back.' So earlier that day I made a cherry cake and I used a - I didn't know it till afterwards, I used a new product - instead of Crisco, I used Fluffo. They never made it again that Fluffo. \nTJ Grandma, can I hear the rest of your story later? I'm kinda busy. \nGRANDMA Oh, of course honey. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTJ enters, carrying the bowl. \nHesher is on the couch, smoking. The TV is now on. He flips channels. \nTJ stands next to Hesher. Hesher looks at him. \nThe front door opens and Dad enters, wearing old sweatpants, a dirty T-shirt, and carrying a plastic grocery bag. \nHe stops when he sees the practically naked, greasy-haired guy smoking on the couch (his 'bed'). It's a strange moment. \nDAD TJ, who's this? \nAfter a long uncomfortable silence, Hesher stands and extends his hand. \nHESHER My name's Hesher. Call me Hesher. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPaul has to rearrange the bags to shake his hand. Hesher sits back down. \nDAD (TO TJ) What's he doing? \nTJ He's doing laundry. \nThey stand looking at each other. TJ is just plain stressed out. \nDAD Why is he smoking in the house? \nTJ I don't know. \n", "test1_id": 1476, "test2_input": "Hesher continues flipping channels. He's not finding anything he wants. \nDAD Did you tell him he can't? \nTJ Yes. \nHESHER How come you only have four channels? \nHesher gets up off the couch and exits the room. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nHesher enters the kitchen. Grandma is still crumbing chicken. \nHe starts going through drawers right next to her. He doesn't acknowledge her. \nGrandma notices him, but not seemingly his cigarette, his state of undress or his complete stranger-ness. \nGRANDMA Hello there. \nHESHER Hello, old lady. \nHis cigarette is done. He flicks it into the sink. It sizzles out. He opens another drawer. \nDad enters with his grocery bag. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDAD (TO HESHER) Can I help you with something? \nHesher shuts the drawer. He's holding a fork. \nHESHER Nope, I'm good. \nHe exits the kitchen. \nEXT. FORNEY HOUSE / BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nHesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear. \nTJ and Dad step out the door and watch him. \nHesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and wrenching at the cable box. \nHe drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls, crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole. \nHESHER Motherfucker. \nTJ and Dad stand staring frozen. \nHesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off and heads back to the house. \nHe walks right past them and back inside. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHesher sits back down on the couch and begins to flip through the newly acquired channels. He finds porn and drops the remote down beside him. He sits back and watches girl-on-girl action. \nTJ and Dad stand just inside the TV room, stunned, watching the newly acquired porn. \nThen a LOUD BUZZ marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from the laundry room. \nHesher gets up off the couch and heads for it. \nA stunned and silent (bar the porn noise) moment later, TJ follows. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDad picks up the remote and switches the TV off. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / LAUNDRY - CONTINUOUS \nHesher loads his wet laundry into the dryer. TJ's nervous. \nTJ So, ah, what are you doing now? \nHesher slams the dryer door shut and wrenches the dial around. The dryer starts up loud. Hesher pretends he can't hear TJ. \nHESHER Huh? \nHe turns and looks into the garage which is right off the laundry room. He points inside. \nHESHER (CONT'D) (LOUD) This your room? \nTJ (huh?) That's the garage. \nHesher walks into the garage with his bag and slams the door leaving TJ standing in the laundry room with the noisy dryer. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / DINING ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "GRANDMA Does your friend want to eat some dinner dear? \nTJ He's not hungry. \nGRANDMA Are you sure? \nTJ Yeah, I'm sure. \nDAD What's he doing in the garage? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ I don't know. I said he could practice his guitar in there. \nGRANDMA That's great honey, it's nice having a bit of music in the house again. Is he a new friend? \nTJ Yeah, sort of. \nGRANDMA You know your grandfather played the harmonica for many years. \nTJ doesn't respond. He eats. Dad looks on perplexed, yet disconnected. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - MORNING \nTJ is dressed for school, wet hair. He brushes his teeth. We can hear the sound of cartoons in the background. TJ stops brushing and listens a second. He hasn't heard cartoons at this hour in a long time. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTJ enters the TV room. Dad is lying on the couch. Hesher sits on an armchair eating a bowl of cereal and watching cartoons. \nTJ stands for a beat and watches them. This is strange. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nTJ enters the kitchen. Grandma pulls a bottle of orange juice out of the fridge. \nGRANDMA (LOUDLY) Hesher, would you like a glass of orange juice. \nHESHER (O.S.) Ah, yeah. Sure. \nGRANDMA Morning, TJ. \nTJ Hi, Grandma. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTJ goes to the counter. He pours cereal into a bowl. He grabs the milk carton. He pours it into the bowl, but the carton's empty. \nGRANDMA Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of milk. I can cook you up some eggs if you like, dear. \nTJ No, thanks. I don't have time. \nTJ leans back and looks into the TV room at Hesher enjoying his milky cereal. \nGRANDMA Would you like to come for a walk with me today? \nTJ I can't, Grandma. I gotta go to school. \nGRANDMA No, I mean later. This afternoon. \nTJ grabs his backpack. \nTJ I don't know. Can you ask me when I get home? \nGRANDMA OK, honey. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / LUNCH YARD - DAY \nThe lunch yard is busy. The crowd clears a moment and we find TJ sitting on a bench in the shade, alone and depressed, hidden away from the other kids. \nHe drinks from a can of soda. \nEXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - DAY \nTJ rides his bike into the car lot. \nTJ stands staring at the crashed red Volvo (from the opening scene) that is parked on the lot. He takes a few deep breaths. \nINT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY / OFFICE - DAY \nTJ walks up to an open office door and knocks. Inside is LARRY TOWERS. He looks up. \nLARRY Yes? \nTJ I need to talk to you. \nLARRY Oh, yeah? What about? \n", "test2_id": 1477, "test3_input": "DAD TJ! I don't want to hear one more word from you! \nTJ Fine. Fuck this. \nTJ sweeps his plate off the table. It goes crashing onto the kitchen floor, food everywhere. Grandma walks back into the room, looking worried. Hesher seems riveted, like he's watching the tennis. \nAnd then Dad sweeps his plate off the table. Crash, food, mess. He glares back at TJ. \nDAD That make you feel better? \nTJ wrenches his chair back and storms off. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nDad sits a moment. With TJ gone, his reproach turns to shame. Grandma and Hesher make eye contact with each other. \nDad gets up and leaves the kitchen. \nHesher shovels some more food into his mouth. Grandma looks concerned. \nGRANDMA Did I miss something? \nHESHER (MOUTH FULL) Not really. Paul came in and said some dumb shit which TJ got angry about and so TJ smashed his plate and then Paul smashed his plate too but I got a feeling he smashed his one cuz he couldn't actually think of anything to say cuz he kinda knew TJ had a point and so now he feels bad about it and so he's gone somewhere. (takes another mouthful) I don't know where. \nGrandma contemplates this. \nGRANDMA Those boys have been through a lot. \nThis makes Grandma very sad. \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) Sometimes I wonder if they're ever gonna smile again \nTears well in Grandma's eyes. Grandma is quietly crying. \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) I just wish there was something more I could do. \nA long beat passes. \nHesher doesn't know what to say. He pours applesauce on his food. Grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess. She shakes her head, takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up. She picks up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink. Hesher watches her. \nHESHER This is delicious. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) \nGRANDMA Thank you, dear. \nHesher holds up a piece of bacon covered in applesauce and licks off the sauce. \nHESHER What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? \nGRANDMA I don't know, dear. \nHESHER What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? \nGRANDMA A worm? I don't know. I'm going to lie down. I'm not feeling well. I'm very nauseated. \nHESHER Oh, OK. \nGrandma exits. Hesher finishes the last few bites of his dinner. He notices Dad's pill bottle. He reaches for them. He unscrews the lid and empties a few into his hand. He swallows the pills. \nINT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM DOORWAY - NIGHT \nGrandma lies in bed on top of her covers. Hesher enters the doorway and knocks lightly. \nHESHER Did you figure it out yet? \nGRANDMA Figure what out, dear? \nHESHER What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? \nGRANDMA No, not yet dear. Can you do me a favor? \nHESHER Sure, what? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGRANDMA Will you please hand me that red tin on the cabinet dear? \nHesher enters the room, grabs the tin from on top of the cabinet and hands it to Grandma on the bed. \nHESHER Kermit the frog's finger. \nGRANDMA What? \nHESHER Think about it... Miss Piggy. \nGrandma opens her red tin and takes out what looks like a rolled cigarette. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Woah, what's that? \n", "test3_true": "HESHER (IMPRESSED) Hang on a second. Can I see that? \nHesher sniffs the \"cigarette\". \nHESHER (CONT'D) No shit. \nHesher sets the \"cigarette\" down. \nHESHER (CONT'D) I'll be right back. \nHesher dashes out of Grandma's room. \nAfter a few moments, he comes back and sits on the edge of the bed. He is holding a glass BONG. The bong has so much resin caked onto the sides, it looks as though a thousand pounds of marijuana have been smoked through it. \nHESHER (CONT'D) May I? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHesher takes one of Grandma's medical joints and breaks it in half and loads the bowl of the pipe. \nGRANDMA What is that? \nHESHER It's a bong. The water filters the smoke. It's probably the most healthy way to smoke weed. \nHesher lights up and takes a HUGE hit from the bong. He explains his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in. \nHESHER (CONT'D) OK, so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in. \nHesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into his lungs. \nHESHER (CONT'D) Then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible, OK bro? \nGRANDMA Umm, OK. \nGrandma takes the bong and has a hit. It's a bit clunky, but she manages to make it work. \nHESHER Ok, lift your finger. \nHesher helps her. The smoke shoots into her lungs. Grandma begins to cough. \nGRANDMA Oh, wow... That was a big one. \nHESHER Yeah, that was good. Hit it again. \nGrandma has another hit. It goes well. She blows out the smoke. \nHesher takes the bong off her and has another HUGE one for himself. He passes the bong back. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nGRANDMA I think I'm OK, dear. \nHesher takes the last hit. He dusts off the bowl and sets the water pipe down. \nThey sit for a moment and let the drug sink in. \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) Honey, how old are you? \nHESHER Who wants to know? \nGRANDMA I don't know. You seem a little older than TJ. \nHESHER Who? \nGRANDMA Oh, stop it. Aren't you a little old to be hanging around TJ all the time? \nHESHER Aren't you? \nGRANDMA No, I'm his grandmother. \nHESHER Yeah, I guess you have a point... OK, well I used to have a mouse. No, wait... hang on a minute. I used to have a snake. And do you know what snakes eat? \nGRANDMA Actually, there's no limit to the food items that you can even think of that a snake might eat. Whatever is available in abundance would become the prey for the snakes. Depending on their growth, their diet - \nHesher cuts her off. \nHESHER Yeah, OK, OK well, actually they eat mice. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nGRANDMA They do eat mice. A lot of times snakes eat other snakes because they're the right shape - \nHESHER Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to have a snake and I fed it mice. But one time I fed this little fuckin' mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough. I dropped that mouse in the snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go near him, and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little, you know... \nHesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are called. \nHESHER (CONT'D) With his little mouse hand. So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse I had to feed him other mice, but every time I dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse. And so eventually the snake starved to death. I had a cage full of mice. \n", "test3_id": 1478}

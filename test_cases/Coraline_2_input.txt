INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS 
Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go. Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest, her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair. The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then sticks it in her bag. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS 
We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline. She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a breath and crawls forward. 
The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall. The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her. 
CAT You know, you're walking right into her trap. 
CORALINE I have to go back. 
With great feeling, she explains: 
CORALINE (CONT'D) They are my parents. 
CAT Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games. 
Coraline thinks about it, remembering. 
CORALINE Hmmm, okay. 
The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline tenses when a voice calls out. 
MOTHER Coraline? 
CORALINE Mom? 
There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue, Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in her shopping clothes, calls. 
MOTHER Coraline, you came back for us! 
CORALINE 
(RELIEVED) 
MOM! 
She runs forward eagerly and-- 
INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
--out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug her real Mom. 
MOTHER Darling! (voice shifting) Why would you run away from me? 
Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow into the TALL OTHER MOTHER. 
The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a fireplace fire. 
Coraline tries her best to be brave. 
CORALINE Where are my parents? 
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Gosh, I have no idea where your "old" parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France? 
Her teeth gleam. 
CORALINE They weren't bored of me.   You stole them! 
Other Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up behind Coraline. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a seat, won't you? 
Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the walking bug chair. 
The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns to it and CLAPS her hands. 
A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel - FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things - carrying the KEY from the real world door. 
The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and - while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she 
SWALLOWS THE KEY. 
CORALINE 
(OFFHAND) Why don't you have your own key? 
OTHER FATHER Only one key. 
The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear, 
SHUTTING HIS MOUTH. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Shhh! 
(SUNNIER) The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin? 
She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags him out. 
OTHER FATHER Squish squash, pumpkin sauce...

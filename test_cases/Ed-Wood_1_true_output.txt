BELA Hey, how'd you do that? 
Ed smiles impishly, then sticks the teeth back in his mouth. 
ED Dentures.  I lost my pearlies in the war. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Ed and Bela run toward us, Bela's cape flapping in the wind. Ed takes a swig from Bela's flask.  They're a bit tipsy. 
ED Are you sure this is okay? 
BELA Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
The moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery.  The wind blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness. 
Ed and Bela reach the locked gates.  They glance at each other, then start to climb over.  Ed helps Bela.  They jump down, and Ed peers nervously. 
ED Now what? 
Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning.  He takes another swig, then starts running giddily. 
He disappears into the cemetery. 
BELA I am DRACULA! 
Bela darts happily through the graves. 
His cape flies behind him. 
BELA I am the BAT!! 
Ed's eyes light up.  He starts chasing after Bela. 
Bela's heart is racing.  He zig-zags past ancient crypts. Gargoyles peer down.  The wind howls through the skeletal trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky. 
Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up. 
Bela flaps his cape up and down.  We almost think he's going to fly. 
Ed races up, then quietly stops.  He eagerly watches Bela, practically expecting him to turn into a bat.  It's a magical, crazed moment. 
BELA I am DRACUlA!  I will LIVE FOREVER!!! 
Bela laughs, then lies down on the grass. 
WIDE 
Ed slowly walks over and lies next to Bela.  They're happy, eyes alert, on top of the world. 
Ed peers in wonder at his new friend. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SCREEN CLASSICS OFFICE - DAY 
Ed sits across from Georgie.  Ed's very excited. 
GEORGIE So what's the big news you couldn't tell me over the phone... again? 
Ed gulps excitedly.  He has a spiel all planned out. 
ED Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful?? 
GEORGIE (he thinks) Tits. 
ED No.  Better than tits -- a star! 
Georgie shakes his head. 
GEORGIE Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap. 
ED Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something! 
GEORGIE Yeah.  Crap with a star. 
ED (impassioned) No!  It would be something better! Something impressive.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had! 
GEORGIE Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about. 
Ed grins. 
ED What if I told you you could have a star for $1000?? 
GEORGIE (skeptical) Who? 
Ed opens his valise and whips out an 8x10 GLOSSY OF BELA. 
GEORGIE Lugosi? 
ED Yeah!  Lugosi! 
GEORGIE Isn't he dead? 
ED (annoyed) No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture. 
GEORGIE OUR picture? 
ED (sheepishly) Uh, yeah.  Our picture. 
Georgie mulls this over.  He's interested. 
GEORGIE Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick? 
ED Because he's my friend. 
Georgie stares carefully at Ed, then finally smiles. 
GEORGIE Alright, fine!  You can direct it. I want a script in three days, and we start shooting a week from Monday. 
ANGLE - ED 
He leaps up euphorically.  He eagerly pumps Georgie's hand. 
ED Thank you!  Bless you, Mr. Weiss! I promise I won't let you down!

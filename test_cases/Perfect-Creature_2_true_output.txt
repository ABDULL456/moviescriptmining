Jones and the Dominic move through an anteroom. Nursing staff and doctors are madly running about. The screaming we heard before punctuates the noisy clutter of medical procedures. 
Jones approaches a door; it has the words "level 4 isolation unit" on it. A large Guard blocks his way. 
Jones shows his ID. A figure brushes past them and enters the door; the figure is fully decked out in something like a spacesuit. 
Jones and Dominic are ushered sideways, to another room. This room has a glass viewing window which looks into the adjacent room. A middle aged Doctor stands there, his thumb nail in his mouth, looking thoughtful. When he turns towards Jones, we can see there is fear in his eyes. Jones shows his ID. Screaming from within the adjacent room draws his attention and that of Jones. 
97 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - CONTINUING                   97 
In the adjacent room two nurses are trying to put in a line to Steph's arms which are restrained by straps. Steph lies on a bed. She looks truly sick; her hair matted, her skin blotchy. Her eyes are also blood red, the tiny blood vessels hemorrhaging. And she is screaming abuse at the nurses and Doctors who work on her. 
Close of Jones, staring at the scene. 
Silus now enters the room. Almost immediately Steph stops screaming. She is staring directly at Silus; even this deranged, she is still in complete awe. 
JONES Will she recover? 
The Doctor turns to Jones; the Doctor looks puzzled. 
DOCTOR No. Containment is the issue now. She is... insane. And we've had more cases, 10 in the last hour. 
The Doctor leaves. 
Jones turns to Silus. 
JONES What is this? What is it? 
SILUS It comes from Edgar. He has shared his blood with them. 
JONES You're telling me that he's out there spreading this around? 
Jones gets close to Silus, intimidating. 
JONES (continuing) He'll give it to Lilly! 
Dominic gets in between. 
DOMINIC Jones! Back off. 
Dominic pushes Jones back and then stares at Silus. 
DOMINIC (continuing) This is spreading. 
Silus doesn't speak, just stares at Steph. 
DOMINIC (continuing) Brother Silus? 
JONES That's it, Lilly's dead. 
SILUS No. He will keep her alive. 
DOMINIC Why? 
SILUS So that I will come for him. That's what he wants. 
Dominic pulls an envelope from his jacket and passes it to Silus, who opens it to discover a beautifully handwritten letter. 
DOMINIC It says, "Everything flows from me. My blood will change the world." What does that mean? 
Silus stares at the two men. Then turns to Steph, her eyes, creepy, still locked on Silus. 
98 OMITTED                                                     98 THRU                                                             THRU 
103A EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM BUILDING, ROOF - NIGHT                  103A 
Jamestown, from above. We drift down so that we see the buildings, see fires breaking out, hear screams echoing through the night. We continue down towards the rooftop of one building in particular. We see one of the infected citizens of Jamestown standing on the roof, screaming out into the night like some crazed animal. 
We continue past the creature, then travel through a ventilation shaft on the roof. We hurtle down this, down, down to the depths of the building and out the shaft into a subterranean basement. We drift through a doorway in the wet stone wall, down a tunnel, to finally enter a room.

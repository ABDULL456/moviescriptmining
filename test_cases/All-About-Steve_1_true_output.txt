LARGE KID Oh my God, how old are you? Still living at home! The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic. 
TEACHER Children! The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary hyperventilating. 
TEACHER Are you okay? Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak. 
MARY Water. 
TEACHER Water. Just hang on. The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary. 
MARY Yep, I live at home... She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it. 
MARY But so do all of you, so there... And sure, I only create one crossword puzzle a week but I have deadlines, I have stress, I have demands on me so huge you would not believe. The newspaper business is hell. I mean it. Hell. Somebody's got to write about all the horrors that go on in this world. 
(MORE) 
MARY (cont'd) And after people read about those horrors, somebody else has to bring them back from the brink of suicide. Who do you think that is? She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than anybody. 
MARY Me! My crossword puzzle is always good news. it enlightens. it r andma's entertains. It keeps your g mind alive so she remembers to send you five bucks on your birthday. Think about that as you lie in bed tonight picking your nose and crying yourself to sleep. I know I will. The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably. 
MARY My job matters, you know. In media circles I am, as the Dutch say, geliefd. That means I have plenty of friends. Hoards, in fact. Scads even. The kids aren't buying it. 
LARGE KID You're a freak. The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated. The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water, hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it runs down her chin. Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile. 
MARY That's a pretty blouse. The Teacher smiles back. Awkward. 
EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY 
The front doors of the school swing open and a visibly shaken Mary walks out. She takes a deep breath and embraces denial. 
MARY Twelve letter phrase for smashing success! She heads down the walkway toward the bus stop. 
MARY As one would say in old Paris... Coup de maitre! A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on talking - now to him. 
MARY It means "master stroke", even though the direct translation is actually "master blow"... Leave it to the French to pass off an unpleasant slave activity as an everyday expression. The Custodian doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Mary continues on to the bus stop. 
INT. CITY BUS -- DAY 
The CITY BUS DRIVER watches as Mary pays her $1.75 one nickel at a time. 
MARY I sometimes suffer from benign positional vertigo. Could you please not drive until I'm - f He ignores her, starts driving. Mary struggles toward the back o f the bus, grabbing g goes. 
MARY Excuse me... pardonnez-moi... begnadiyen sie mich... She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her shoulder on the center pole. Finally settled, she peeks under her sweater at the shoulder damage. 
MARY Hello hematoma. She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her. The lady gives her the "don't talk to me" glare, then stares out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat. 
MARY (V.O.) In crosswords, as in life, some days are harder than others. It's true. In the New York Times, for example, the puzzles get harder as the week goes. So on Monday, a day that traditionally bites the big one, the crossword is super easy. It's comforting to know that although life can be difficult at times, crosswords let you off easy when you need it the most. Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary starts biting her nails. 
EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY 
A frail 80 year old man MR. TAKIHASHI works alongside his wspapers, 40ish granddaughter BETTY selling magazines, ne smokes and Pocky. In the corner of the newsstand, a muted TV features CNN "Breaking News" coverage of a high speed car chase. BUSINESSMEN are glued to the images as they wait in line. Mary grabs a half a dozen different newspapers, yells to Mr. Takihashi like he's deaf. 
MARY 
KONCHA, TAKIHASHI-SAN! He ignores her. Mary hands the papers to Betty. 
MARY Hi Betty. Betty just rings up the papers. 
MARY Did you see the review of "Hairspray" in the Journal yesterday? They used the word "spectacular" -- always a good sign. Maybe you'd like to go see it with rne? I have a coupon for five dollars off. Betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter, points at them, then speaks in barely recognizable English.

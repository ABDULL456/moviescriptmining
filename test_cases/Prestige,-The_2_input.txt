He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten feet across. 
Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier. He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing one. The other cat RACES off. 
Angier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at- 
TOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks its way through them. 
The SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the 
WOODS BEYOND- 
Angier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS. 
EXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY 
The top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier and Alley are watching. 
ANGIER So the machine was working? 
ALLEY I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved. 
TESLA These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science. 
Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another hat. It has the same TEAR. 
TESLA (CONT'D) We'll need a couple of weeks to iron 
OUT THE- (looks at hats) -problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready. 
Angier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door. 
TESLA (CONT'D) Don't forget your hat. Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats. 
ANGIER Which one is mine? 
TESLA They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him. 
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY 
Borden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and tries to hop up into his lap. Laughing, he helps her up. 
JESS Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy? 
BORDEN Daddy's got some business this afternoon. 
JESS But you promised. 
BORDEN Did I? Jess nods at him, solemly. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Then go to the zoo we shall. Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) (gestures to newspaper) Who's that? A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The Professor- England's premiere magician! 
JESS That's you, daddy? Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands. 
BORDEN Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready. 
Borden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her. 
She reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour. Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying. 
SARAH We each have our vices. Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes. 
BORDEN Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated. 
SARAH You mean it today. 
BORDEN Absolutely. 
SARAH That makes it so much harder when you don't. She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves. 
EXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON 
Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for him -- Fallon. Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it. 
BORDEN More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. (looks at his feet) Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon, 
PLEADING) Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please. 
Borden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes off down the path. Fallon sets off in the opposite direction. 
INT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT 
Olivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to Borden. She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss, but he backs away. 
OLIVIA What is it. Freddy? 
BORDEN Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong. 
Olivia looks at him. Cold. 
OLIVIA Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong. 
BORDEN I'm trying, Olivia. Please. 
OLIVIA I'll get dressed. 
Borden watches her move down the hall. 
OLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) I saw Fallon hanging around my house again, after you left. 
Olivia comes back in, half-dressed. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) There's something about him I don't trust.

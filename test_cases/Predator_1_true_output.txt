Schaefer turns, there is a touch of fear in Dillon's eyes. 
SCHAEFER You're catching on, Dillon. 
Schaefer returns to his work on the net and trigger.        *

116     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (LATER)                        116 
Morning passes.  Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle. Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators. 
At the entranceway to the rock outcropping, the net and trigger are hidden beneath the leaves, the framework of the trigger bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to the bent tree. 
At the other end of the corridor, several meters above the jungle floor, Schaefer and his team, heavily camouflaged, nearly invisible, lie hidden, waiting.  The team members, as if hypnotized by the BUZZING din, stare into the jungle, fixated, alert. 
ANNA while waiting at the net: 
ANNA (hushed) When I was little we find a man -- (she struggles for the words) -- like a butcher.  The old ones in the village cross themselves and whisper crazy things.  'Demonio, cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest times of the hottest years...'  Crazy things...This year is grows hot.  And we begin finding our men.  We find them sometimes without their skin. Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador de trofoes...means the demon who takes trophies. 
SLOW RACK TO Schaefer's face.  Ashen.  HOLD.  Suddenly an EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle: 
He whips his face forward.  The silence is SHATTERED by a bird flapping from the brush. 
Schaefer sits back and scratches his head, frustrated and a little chagrined. 
DILLON (o.s.) What'll you try next -- cheese? 
Schaefer glares at him.  Turns to go -- 
He stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the waiting snare.

REVISED - "THE HUNTER" - 1/27/87                      72-A 
116 Cont. 
Behind him, sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels, the others scan the jungle, alert for the slightest sound or movement, covering him. 
Schaefer reaches the trap, carefully skirting the trigger hidden beneath the leaves.  He reaches the end of the corridor, moving out into the jungle.  He moves further away from the others, the silence crushing down on him.  He stops and waits, sweat pouring down his face, his finger tightening on the trigger of his M-203, eyes scanning the jungle. 
He turns his back on the jungle, waiting.  Nothing.  He moves back towards the corridor, reaching the net, again waiting, listening, sensing.  Nothing.  He turns around, looking at the jungle one last time, his face measuring defeat and then, with carefully, measured strides, he walks back to the camp. 
Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement. Nearby, Dillon starts to rise. 
DILLON (low; whispered) Satisfied?  Now let's get the hell out... 
(CONTINUED) 
116     CONTINUED:                                           116 
Suddenly, behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor, with a resounding SWISH and SNAP, the NET explodes off the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks, rocketing upward into the treetops. 
Schaefer spins, the others leaping to their feet as they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops, a large struggling bulge trapped within as a long, unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle. 
Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards the jungle and the bobbing net, their weapons ready. Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks. 
They arrive under the net, raising their weapons to fire...but before they can fire the entire net EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves, twigs, vines, dirt and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON. 
117     EXT. HUNTER'S HAND AND ARM - DAY                     117 
As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates, his arm slashing out, severing a THICK LIMB of the spreading tree capony, entangled in vines. 
118     EXT. THE TEAM - DAY                                  118 
The limb CRASHES down from the trees, Schaefer, Dillon, Billy and Mac Diving for safety.  But Ramirez, following the Hunter's leap, SEES too late the pendular movement of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open, exposing a BLOODY WOUND. 
As Anna runs to Ramirez's side the others, still stunned, look upward, frozen in shock SEEING:  THE HUNTER, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright crimson. 
Dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the ground staring upward. 
DILLON What is God's name...?

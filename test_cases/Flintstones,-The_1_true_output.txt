He puts his arm around Barney, leads him towards the car where Betty is waiting. 
LAVA I'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble. Starting tomorrow. You can catch some rays, maybe invent something... hey, how about Fibrerock, the sequel, part II -- ? BARNEY But -- 
LAVA No, don't try and thank me. 
CUT TO: 
165   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                  165 Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge office buildings beside it, and then a convention center beyond that. 
LAVA ... As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings... for everything. You can't stack a two-bedroom cave this high... but the sky's the limit with Fibrerock! 
SLATE 'Sky's the limit'... 'sky's the limit'... why, these two buildings, they... they practically scrape the sky! We should call them... Slate scrapers! LAVA That's brilliant, Unc... Mister Slate. In fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex... (indicating the convention center) ... I wanna call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____' something Needle... but I just can't... 
SLATE (modestly) How about, 'Slate Needle'? 
LAVA 'Slate Need...' (astonished) ... How do you keep coming up with these? It's uncanny. SLATE (shrugging) It's a gift... LAVA (casually) Oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you... just a few overruns ... minor cost problems... that's it... thank you... 
(CONTINUED) 
165   CONTINUED:                                                   165 Slate's so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly listens to what Lava's saying, just runs his stylus through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile "framing" the model city in his hands. LAVA (heading for the door) ... Oh, Mister Slate, we're going to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh, 'Slate Needle.' Good for public relations -- Lava breaks off.    He's just looked out the window and seen -- 
166   LAVA'S POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW                             166 A small figure appears behind some of the equipment, tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards the assembly line. Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is Barney! 167   LAVA                                                         167 
Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it. 
168   BELOW - PILTDOWN                                             168 Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite in tow. 169   BARNEY                                                       169 
Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the massive bulk of -- 
170   PILTDOWN                                                     170 -- who looks down at him with a big smile, Pyrite at his side. 
PILTDOWN Can we help you... sir? 
(CONTINUED) 
170   CONTINUED:                                                      170 BARNEY (fake crotchety voice) Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian... 
PYRITE Our pleasure. Then they grab Barney with such force that the THERMOS drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. -- 171   SLATE QUARRY - MAIN GATE - DAY                                  171

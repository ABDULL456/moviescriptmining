Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains standing. If he got hit, it isnt clear where. Zep then turns and quickly hobbles further down the hall. 
Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing. 
LAWRENCE No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries loudly.) 
ADAM (Frightened but trying to stay calm for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. There must be a way out of this! (It seems to be a complete role reversal for the two of them from the beginning, where Adam was the one freaking out and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, who has just lost it.) 
LAWRENCE (screaming) I cant be calm! My family needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, still cant get the phone. He quickly turns and sits up, grabbing the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage. Adams hands are up clutching his head, trying to keep his cool but having a very hard time.) 
ADAM (Loudly trying to speak over Lawrences continued loud, primal screams.) Lawrence, I have a family too! I dont see them, thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id like to fix! 
Cut to Zep hobbling down the hall. Tapp is there running after him. Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up. 
TAPP Im gonna kill you you sick asshole! 
Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more. 
ADAM (desperate, losing his attempted calm stance) Lawrence, stop it! 
Lawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too slow, however, so he starts to rip it open. 
ADAM (sobs in his voice) Lawrence, please calm down! Theres a way out of here, theres a way out! 
Lawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely loses it and freaks out, screaming. 
ADAM Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you doing?! 
Lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrences shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming and wincing. 
Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall. 
Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck and shirt. 
Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of twisted glee is upon Tapps face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, trying to take the gun. 
Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward a bit.

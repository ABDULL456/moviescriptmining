EVE (hushed; angry) [Wall-E, what are you doing here?! You can't be here! You're going to get me in trouble!...] 
Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him. Wall-E just stares at her. Smitten. 
WALL-E (swoons) Ee-vah... 
ON THE CAPTAIN 
He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS. 
CAPTAIN (reads aloud) Well, let's open her up. Step One. Voice command, "Confirm Acquisition." 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Confirm Acquisition. 
The bridge suddenly jumps to life. Green lights flash. A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling... ...Scans the entire room... ...Identifies Eve... ...Rides along the ceiling rails... ...Stations itself directly above Eve... ...Arms unfold. Position her... ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face: 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Voice authorization required. 
CAPTAIN ...Uh... 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Accepted. 
A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers. Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve... Her chest lights up. The doors open. The Captain winces... 
...and nothing is inside. 
CAPTAIN Where's the thingie? 
AUTOPILOT Plant. 
CAPTAIN Plant. Right. Right. Where is it? (checks manual) Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you change the text again... 
Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual. Eve is stunned. Searches her chest cavity for the plant. Then she remembers... 
EVE Plant! Wall-E... (turns on him) Wall-E! 
Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger. Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty. Picks him up. Scans the floor. Nothing. 
WALL-E Ee-vah? 
EVE (angry electronics) [Find it!] PLANT! 
Wall-E scared of her. Starts searching. 
CAPTAIN (O.S.) Why don't you scan her to be sure. 
Eve jumps back to attention. Auto slides up to her. Scans her chest cavity. 
AUTOPILOT Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is faulty. 
CAPTAIN So, then...we're NOT going to Earth? 
AUTOPILOT (shakes his wheel) Negative. 
CAPTAIN So, uh, I guess things go back to normal, huh? 
AUTOPILOT Correct, Captain. 
CAPTAIN (privately relieved) Well, false alarm! 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) False alarm. 
Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts. Exits back into the ceiling. The shades rise. Lights go back on. 
CAPTAIN The probe must be defective. Gopher, send her to the Repair Ward.

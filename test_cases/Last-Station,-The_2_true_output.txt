TOLSTOY I say lots of things. What do you say? What do you think? 
VALENTIN I...I don´t know. 
Leo Nikoleyevich smiles. 
TOLSTOY I don´t know, either. 
He inhales deeply. 
TOLSTOY Smell that... 
VALENTIN Lilac? 
He looks up as he hears Sasha off screen. "Papa. Papa." 
TOLSTOY Precisely. It's lilac. The smell's stronger when the sun goes down. 
He presses Valentin's hand. 
SASHA Papa! 
TOLSTOY I've enjoyed myself, my boy. (shouting for Sasha) WE'RE HERE. 
As he starts in the direction of her voice. Sasha appears in the clearing, telegram in hand. 
SASHA He's free. He's free...He's coming back

Chertkov climbs down from his droshky. Suddenly, Tolstoy is there. Valentin watches them embrace.

Andrey and Sofya stand together at the window, watching the joyful reunion. 
SOFYA To give the copyright as "a gift to humanity."...the reptile. 
ANDREY Papa's not in his right mind. He can't defend himself against these thieves. (beat) My tooth is killing me. 
SOFYA You're a fine son, darling. None of this make believe chastity and made up religion. I wish all my children had turned out like you. 
Andrey's finger in his mouth, massages the offending molar. 
ANDREY A man'th responthibility ith to hith family. 
From her POV, we see the two men walk away together arm in arm, talking animatedly. 
SOFYA Chertkov's notions of virtuous behavior are calculated to destroy me.

SOFYA There is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats. 
She walks out of the room.

SOFYA Vladimir Grigorevich, what a surprise.

MILADY Beauty, danger. They are the same. And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory comb... 
111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111 He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he cannot deny. D'ARTAGNAN I'm sorry -- D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out- stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger, stunned with fear and surprise: 
D'ARTAGNAN What're you doing?! Have you lost your mind?! 
MILADY You came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England. 
D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh, reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess. Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago. 
D'ARTAGNAN My God... (CONTINUED) 
111   CONTINUED:                                                      111 MILADY (crying out) Parker!! The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo- Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un- fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps forward to meet him. 
Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows. The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet, dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions. Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair, and commands: MILADY Kill him. Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And d'Artagnan thinks fast. D'ARTAGNAN You can kill me. But a surprise waits for you in England. That even Buckingham can't prevent. MILADY (stops Henri with a gesture) What... surprise? D'ARTAGNAN That's one thing I'll never tell you. MILADY D'Artagnan. You are young, vain, and foolish. But I do not know if you are clever. 
D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping. Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes her mind. 
MILADY We'll take him with us. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
111   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            111 MILADY (CONT'D) (to d'Artagnan, with a nod at Parker) Parker will devise ways to convince you to share your final secret with me. It is a long voyage. Milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty. 
CUT TO: 
112   INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN                112 
Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife against d'Artagnan's side. HENRI The bodyguards are waiting outside. 
Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws back with surprise. 
113   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV                          113 The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night- shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the collar. 
D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience, and just a hint of fear. Milady commands: MILADY The back stairs. Hurry! They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below. 
CUT TO: 114   EXT. INN - NIGHT                                             114 
Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds away in the direction of the harbor. In the driver's seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward. Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback. 
CUT TO: 
115   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                     115 D'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady. Her face betrays faint doubt,  apprehension. Emotions she is not used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around her. D'Artagnan sees   his opening... and speaks: D'ARTAGNAN The man at the inn... what did he want? MILADY (hollow laugh) Justice. Honor. Revenge. D'ARTAGNAN Why? 
MILADY He is the brother of my late husband, Lord de Winter. He blames me for de Winter's death. He thinks I murdered him. D'ARTAGNAN Did you murder your husband, Milady? MILADY What do you think? 
A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face. Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss. D'ARTAGNAN I think he's not the first husband you killed. (off her look) I once knew a man, one of the Counts of Berry. He told me a story... of beauty and danger. He was the bravest man I've ever known. And the saddest. 
MILADY I know... 
The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has reminded her of the one thing in the world that still touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage window.

{"train": "THE LINCOLN LAWYER \nWritten by \nJohn Romano \nBased on the novel by \nMichael Connelly \nJuly 8, 2006 \nBANG IN FROM BLACK, FACE OF A MAN MICKEY HALLER, 40, lawyer-- TIGHT on him, as morning light flies across his features. He's fresh-shaved, neat suit, gazes out with a stark/steady focus from the back seat of-- \nINT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR (MOVING) IN A HARD RAIN-- \nGRADUALLY FADE IN, under the SOUND of rain & freeway, his DRIVER, black, 20s, low patter to which Mick barely listens-- \nEARL I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty- Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs... (then, realizing) You gettin' any of this, Mr. Haller? Not this morning. Mick watches the rain without seeing it. \nMICK Just keep your speed up, Earl. Earl kicks it, passes cars... Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him. Also laptop, cell- phone rack: His back seat is his rolling office. Opens the file. Top sheet: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA v. LOUIS ROULET. Tight on Mick. His eyes see back to the be innin CUT TO, \nEXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - BRIGHT SUN - ANOTHER MORNING \nThe town car sails along, bright glint off the surface streets-- We HEAR HARD RAP, TUPAC SHAKUR-- CELL PHONE RINGS-- \nINT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - SAME TIME \nMICK Earl-- buds. A command. Earl puts in earbuds, Rap cuts out. Into cell-- \nMICK (CONT'D) This is Haller. \nMAN'S VOICE OVER CELL Where are you this morning? \nThis time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers, open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee... \nMICK On my way to Lancaster for a calendar call. Why, have you got something? \nMAN'S VOICE (VAL) I got a franchise player is what. Reaction Mick: He's heard it before... \nVAL'S VOICE I mean it, this guy could be money. But he goes before the judge at eleven. \nMICK Van Nuys by eleven could be hard-- \nVAL'S VOICE But this client, listen Mick, his mother's lawyer just waltzed in \nHERE-- \nMICK He's already got a lawyer?-- \nVAL'S VOICE Strictly real-estate, doesn't know his ass about criminal. Will you listen? \nMICK \nGO AHEAD-- \nVAL'S VOICE Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the family's beach house in Malibu against the million in bail... \nMICK A million? What'd they book him on? \nVAL'S VOICE He picked up a girl last night-- Whatever went down she ended up pretty bad. Cops want Aggravated Assault with G.B.I.-- \nMICK Has the D.A. filed yet? \nVAL'S VOICE No. See? I'm giving you ground floor. So make it work for me, Mick. Don't let him use the house, get him to go for my bond-- Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse, there are cars, people-- a traffic jam. To Earl-- \nMICK Bring me around to the employee's gate, I'll talk my way in. (into cell, writes) I'm at the courthouse. Give me the name. \nVAL'S VOICE That would be Louis Roulet... \n(PRONOUNCED ROO-LAY) R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel. \nMICK That's not how you spell the wheel but I got it, thanks. \nVAL'S VOICE Remember: I steered him to you. \nMICK You're on my Christmas list, Val. Lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate. \"EMPLOYEES.\" \nLORNA A couple of DUI's, I quoted them the house number. That's it, you're free after Roulet. \nMICK Good. Then I can go to County lock- up. Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road... while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated... \nLORNA You're going to see Gloria. Why do you waste time on her, Mickey? Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES, HARLEYS, IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS... They pull up alongside: gang jackets, black leather vests... Big guys... \nEARL Want me to do somethin' about this? 'Cause I can. \nMICK Ignore them, you're doing fine. FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re \"Gloria\": \nMICK (CONT'D) What can I say, Lorn, I've got a soft spot for redheads. Why do you think I married you? \nLORNA The divorce papers called it temporary insanity. \nMICK Lucky for you there was a cure. When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now-- \nEARL Mr. Haller? Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN FRONT. The leader signals Earl to pull off. Mick sees they're surrounded. Shit. \nEXT. OFF-RAMP FOR VASQUEZ ROCKS STATE PARK - CONTINUOUS \nThe Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot at the crest of the exit. Jagged rocks, craggy peaks. The leader gets off his bike. EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs. Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo. The \"Road Saints.\" Mick lowers a window. \nEDDIE Counsellor, how's it hanging? \nMICK Fine, Eddie, how's it with you? \nEDDIE \n(CASUAL) Hard Case called me from the pen, he said I might catch up to you. Said you're stalling his case til you see more green, is that right? \nMICK If you want me to work you've gat to pay me. \nEDDIE We paid you. Five thousand. \nMICK That's long gone. I could tell you half went to the aerial-photo expert. He's going to blow the state's case by showing that the DEA violated the air space over Harold's farm by flying too low... but you don't need to know that. All you need to know is, we had a deal. Time to refill the tank. Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln. \nEDDIE Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I heard you got three more. What's one man need with four Lincolns? \nMICK \nEDDIE-- \nEDDIE What? You want another five grand? \nMICK Ten. I'm flying the guy in from Kodak in New York, he wants business class... \nEDDIE And I want Harold back on the farm. He's the best farmer we got, if you know what I mean... \nMICK I don't. And I don't want to. Either pay me my money or go with the Public Defender the judge finds you. Of course he won't know much about air space, but-- \nEDDIE Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We want you. He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope. Mick takes it. Starts to count, and realizes: \nMICK You had the whole ten ready. What if you'd backed me down to five? \nEDDIE This vest got lots of pocket. Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing. \nINT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELL - DAY \nCAMERA MOVING ON: EIGHT MEN, prisoners in grey jumpers. Six are black. Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky JUNKIE, 40s. The OTHER is a tall young man, somehow polished even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here-- \nMICK Louis Roulet? LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared. \nMICK (CONT'D) My name is Michael Haller. I had a call. \nLOUIS Yes-- Mr. Haller-- Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell. Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk. Louis approaches, \nFREAKED-- \nLOUIS (CONT'D) I-- called you because I need \nSOMEONE-- \nMICK You want me to represent you for your first appearance. I get twenty- five hundred for that. We can work out what comes next. \nLOUIS Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr. Haller-- I made a mistake with that woman, she was setting me up-- \nMICK Keep your voice down. And don't say anything about the case, not til I've got you out on bail. Okay? Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm. Louis nods. \n(YIELDS) Alright I'll go quietly. But after today's hearing, if you don't object. \nMICK Depends. You going for no-bail? \nMAGGIE That won't change with the prosecutor. Not with what your guy did. With which she shows him the photo: gruesome. \nMICK If he did it. \nMAGGIE Sure. \"If.\" They only picked him up in her home with blood all over him, but it's a valid question... \nMICK I love it when you're sarcastic. Can I at least see the arrest report? \nMAGGIE Get it from whoever takes over. No favors on this one. \nMick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion. \nMICK How's Hayley? A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting away the things on her desk... \nMAGGIE She's good. She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself... \nMICK How about this weekend? This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it. \nMAGGIE Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight. Only Mick-- don't cancel on her. \nCUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - LATER \nA TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he tries avoiding it... while MICK AND MAGGIE are ARGUING IN \nFRONT OF THE JUDGE... \nMICK Judge, there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight \nRISK-- \nMAGGIE With resources like this man has, it's always a risk-- let alone the fact that the victim was brutally \nASSAULTED-- \nJUDGE Ms. McPherson, the extent of her injuries are not the point. I'm setting bail at a million dollars... Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances-- \nWE'RE-- INT. DOORS TO THE COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMick bangs out, always moving. Getting the door for him is his friend, bail bondsman \"VAL\" VALENZUELA, excited-- \nVAL What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us a franchise... \nMICK We'll see, Val... \nVAL There's the lawyer-guy, you get him to go for the cash-bond... MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting. \nMICK Cecil Dobbs? \nDOBBS Mr. Haller. (They shake hands.) It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call... \nMICK Boy? \nDOBBS I've represented the family so long I think of Louis that way. \nMICK He did look a little frail. My advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take \"the boy\" home. \nDOBBS A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was thinking of putting up property... \nMICK No good. Assessing it will take days. By then Louis might be carrying somebody's child. (before Dobbs can argue) So just tap Val for the bond, spring Louis, and take him to your office. We'll meet there at Four. And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to... \nEXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, DAY - MICK AND DOBBS \nSunlight. Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV CAMERAMAN coming out with camera. Off Dobbs's reaction-- \nMICK Yep. Media's already picked us up. \nDOBBS Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the press... Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes-- \nMICK I saw you in there filming. What's your name? \nCAMERAMAN Rob Gillen. They call me \"Sticks.\" \nMICK You freelancing on this, Sticks? \nMICK (writes, likes this--) Did you screen him? \nGLORIA Don't I screen 'em all? \nMICK off what, his driver's license? \nGLORIA No, his passport. I think his name was, Hector, or-- \nMICK Hector what? Last name. Think. \nINT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING, L.A. - D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY \nMICK Moya. Hector \"Arrande\" Moya is what you get if you run a trace. He's Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand Jury indictment down in Florida. The DEA wants him for drug trafficking. The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless. \nMICK (CONT'D) Leslie? They want him a lot. \nLESLIE FAIRE And your girl's looking to trade? \nMICK She'll give you his motel and room number. \nLESLIE FAIRE She'll also have to testify on the coke. \nMICK That's a No. Location only. Your guys take it from there. My investigator says Hector hasn't checked out yet. \nLESLIE FAIRE (as she weighs it) What's she want in exchange? \nMICK You drop charges, and all she does is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation. The facility at USC-Med would be nice. (when she hesitates) Or do I take this straight to the Feds? Which, though veiled, is a threat. Leslie hates this. \nINT. DOBBS'S CENTURY CITY LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nHIGH FLOOR, TALL WINDOWS. DOBBS, ON THE CUT, lets in MICK. Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way to the Pacific, as the OTHERS enter behind him: MARY WINDSOR (distinguished, 60), LOUIS (suit, silk t-shirt, Ray-bans.) Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side. \nMICK Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin. Mr. Levin's my investigator. Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long, blonde-wood conference table. Mick can't help run his hand over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the- fly office... Dobbs, to Mrs. Windsor... \nDOBBS Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr. Haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning. Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased. \nMARY WINDSOR I have a check for you, Mr. Haller. And slides it towards him in an envelope. Mick, tries not to seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside-- ANGLE, we glimpse the amount, the zeroes... $100,000... BUT: \nMICK I'm going to need that to come from your son, Mrs. Windsor. (slides it back to her) You can give him the money so he can write the check. But I want the check to come from Louis. He's my client and that's got to be clear from the start. No offense. \nShe is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS. He takes out a checkbook, writes. Mick continues to Mary-- \nMICK (CONT'D) Thank you. I'll expect you to support your son through this in other ways. If you're willing. \nMARY WINDSOR Don't be silly. I'll back my son come hell or high water. These ridiculous charges. That ridiculous woman. \nMICK It's good to know you'll be there when we need you. \nMARY WINDSOR But not now, is that it? \nMICK We'll be going over the case. The D.A. could make you testify about what you hear. Attorney privilege doesn't cover you. Mary Windsor's motionless a moment. Rather than respond, she simply rises. To Louis-- \nMARY WINDSOR I will see you at dinner. And goes. Dobbs gets the door for her. When she's gone: \nLOUIS My mother built a good business. From the ground up. \nMICK I've got no trouble believing that. (after a beat) I say we get started. All agree, they sit, Mick starts up-- \nMICK (CONT'D) Our first choice is whether we waive our right to a speedy trial. \nLOUIS No. I want this behind me. \nMICK You sure? You can stretch things out, enjoy your freedom. Most clients... \nLOUIS Guilty clients, you mean. I want this over. Mick's struck by how firm. \nMICK Fine. We go to trial right away. Puts more pressure on the D.A. \nDOBBS Or maybe the case never even goes to trial. (They look at him.) Our firm's clout is considerable. Pressure can be brought to bear-- \nMI C K Don't kid yourself, Cecil. (to Dobbs and Louis) No way the state is dropping these charges. In fact, they've already upped them-- to improve their negotiating position. \nLOUIS There won't be any negotiating. (before Mick can speak) No plea bargain, no nothing. I'm not going to jail for something I didn't do. \nMICK It might not be jail. \nLOUIS Even if I walk. I'm innocent and if there's a trial I want to get on the stand and tell the jury I'm innocent. If that's a problem we can part company right now. Mick looks at the young man. Evaluating. Then... \nConference table's silent. All looking at Louis. \nMICK Okay then. What do you remember next? \nLOUIS Waking up with two guys sitting on me. Holding me down. \nQUICK CUT TO, REGGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM... TWO GUYS straddle Louis who is face down on the floor. LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd) Couple of faggots from next door. \nBACK TO, LAW OFFICE \nRAUL Police report has them, homosexual couple from down the hall... \nLOUIS Like I said. Faggots. To which Raul says nothing. After a beat-- \nMICK Go on, Louis. \nLOUIS I was still foggy when the cops came... \nBACK TO, LIVING ROOM... Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind him, COP looms over... LOUIS (V.O.) (cont'd) She was on the couch telling all these lies... PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE COP (MAXWELL), through sobs, still frightened-- \nREGGIE .he was like an animal! He said he'd rape me and kill me... then rape me again when I was dead... Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody. \nLOUIS (V.O. ) That's when I saw she'd set it up. \nBACK TO, LAW OFFICE. \nMICK Set it up how? \nLOUIS Put blood on my hand. My left hand. But I'm right-handed, I'd use my right if I was going to... punch someone. Which is crazy. Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air. Inept. \nDOBBS Louis never hit anyone in his life. \nRAUL What she did made sense. It's the right side of her face that was hit, she had to bloody your left. \nMICK Louis: You said she opened the door a crack. Did you see her face? \nLOUIS Not all of it... \nCUT TO, DOOR OF REGGIE'S APARTMENT... OPENING AGAIN... It open a crack. Enough for her look out, half her face... \nLOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd) Mainly her eye. Her left eye. \nRAUL (V.0.) That's it!... BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. Raul... mimes the opening of the door... \nRAUL (CONT'D) She already had the injuries, on the right. She was hiding it from him when he steps in... \nMICK And then she clocks him? \nLOUIS Yes. \nMICK So our case is, she beat herself up? Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE... \nMICK (CONT'D) We're saying, she pounded her face into hamburger meat, or had her boyfriend do it, hoping some far- off day a jury would give her a big fat reward? \nLOUIS She must have. \nDOBBS Of course. She saw his Porsche, his Rolex, it's known the family has money... I'll wager she's already filed in civil court. Mick. Thinks. Then, to Raul-- \nMICK Okay, the police report. Let's hear how Reggie tells it. \nCUT TO, INT. DOORWAY TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe's opened a crack, peering out... Raul reads... \nRAUL (V. 0. ) \"According to the victim, she was at home alone when the suspect presented himself at the door as someone she knew...\" Louis is there, talks MOS. Reggie opens the rest of the way. RAUL (V.0.) (cont'd) \"Upon letting him in, she was immediately struck...\" WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face, bloodying her, but it's too fast & jumbled for details... \nMICK (V.0.) Does it say he knocked her down? She falls... Louis flies down on top of her... \nRAUL (V.0.) Yeah, then straddled her. \"Held the victim by the neck until she agreed to cooperate...\" Louis does as described, strangle-hold... Eventually lets her up, turning her toward the bedroom. And... RAUL (V.O.) (cont'd) \"The suspect maintained a position behind her, holding a knife against the left side of her throat...\" \nCLOSE, HAND-HELD, KNIFE-POINT TO NECK, SLIGHT CUT, BLOOD... \nRESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE. \nRaul takes something new from the file: PHOTO OF A BLOODY KNIFE. Sharpened to a point. Louis looks at it. Seethes. \nLOUIS This isn't my knife. \nMAGGIE Hasn't he worked your fee off yet? \nMICK A while ago. But he likes driving, keeps him out of trouble... He's taking courses, too, in music. \nMAGGIE You can't tell by this stuff. She snaps the rap OFF. \nMICK You get used to it. Besides, Tupac, he helps me understand my clients. Most of them go to school on his \nLYRICS-- \nMAGGIE Not Roulet. \nMICK Not Louis, no. Louis is my franchise player, he pays for all the rest... After a beat... Office gossip... \nMAGGIE I heard Smithson assigned Ted Minton to your case. \nMICK Never heard of him. \nMAGGIE He's brand new. Bright, though. Smithson's protegee. Naturally. Georgetown, buys his suits at Brooks, above all he's a guy... Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms... Moonlight lines her profile. Made self-conscious by his watching her, she moves her hair from her face. Beyond pretty: Beautiful. \nMICK Lorna made me my schedule. Saturday's fine to take Hayley. \nMAGGIE Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob movie... \nMICK I'm all over it. How's she doing? \nMAGGIE I'll know when I drop you and get home to relieve the sitter... (catches him looking) What? \nMICK Moonlight becomes you. \nMAGGIE \n(GLANCES) That's not doing me any good, Haller. \nEXT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE, LAUREL CANYON - DARK - NIGHT \nThe Lincoln pulls up. Mick gets out but stands there. \nMICK Thanks. She nods You're welcome. And pulls away. Mick's smile fades as he looks up at his dark lonely house. \nINT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - ON: \nAN ANSWERING MACHINE, he's just hit Play. BEEP. \nVOICE OF A CHILD (HAYLEY) Daddy, Mommy said I could call and say G'night. Sorry you're not there. G'night, Daddy. \nMICK Me too, baby. Then Mick hits \"Play\" again. BEEP. \nVOICE OF HAYLEY Daddy, Mommy said I could call... \nOff a FRAMED PHOTO: HAYLEY, B, curls, Irish eyes... \nEXT. LATER - NIGHT - VIEW FROM MICK'S PORCH \nMick's got a drink in his hand. Below: L.A. is spread out: Wide, white scattering of lights. Above: Stars. \nINT. COURTROOM, COMPTON COURTHOUSE - MORNING - ON: \nJUDGE FLYNN, 60 (put-on Irish brogue) Top o' the mornin', Mr. McGinley! You know what day it is? Mick's client, DARIUS McGINLEY, black, 2B: In chains. Mick is beside him, as he answers, confused-- \nDARIUS The day I get my sentence? \nJUDGE FLYNN That too. But it's also St. Patrick's Day. A day to revel in your Irish heritage. Darius doesn't get Flynn's joke. Mick cautions Darius, low-- \nMI CK He's an asshole but just be cool. Darius scowls... under which Mick notices that RAUL has showed up, is trying to get his attention... while... \nJUDGE FLYNN Do you know the origin of your name, Mr. McGinley? \nDARIUS Slave-holder, I 'spect. Why do I care who that motherfucka be? \nMICK Darius I told you-- \nDARIUS The man's dissin' me! \nJUDGE FLYNN \n(GLARES) Alright: If you don't care about your name, then I don't. \nINT. WINDSOR ESTATES, OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nBehind the reception desk is ROBIN, tan/sexy blonde, hair hanging straight over one eye like a scythe... \nMICK Mickey Haller. Here to see Louis. \nROBIN Mr. Roulet is with someone. He can't be disturbed. It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to -- THE DOOR TO LOUIS ROULET'S OFFICE- Mick ENTERS, finds Louis with his loafers off, on the couch with his cell-phone cradled to his ear. Robin chases behind... \nROBIN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Mr. Roulet, this man just came back here-- \nLOUIS It's okay, Robin. You can go. Robin exits. Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and rings off. Looks annoyed at Mick. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) I was setting up a showing. \nMICK There won't be any showings in Pelican Bay. \nLOUIS Where's that? \nMICK It's a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders. You'll fit in real good in your loafers. \nLOUIS What's the matter? \nMICK You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to go and see the new prosecutor, who's doing everything he can to put you away, and now I find out you've been lying. (before Louis can deny) Tell me about Reggie Campo. \nLOUIS What about her? I've told you-- \nMICK You didn't tell me. That you were going to pay her for sex. (off Louis's surprise) You think it's hard to find out somebody's not Snow White? \nLOUIS Alright yes, I was going to pay. She wrote down a price on the napkin, four hundred dollars... \nMICK Why didn't you tell me this in Cecil's office? \nLOUIS I didn't want my mother to know. Cecil tells her everything. And can we keep it down? Her office is on the other side of that door... Mick looks at Louis's concern. Believes it. Easing up... \nMICK This changes things. You see that, don't you? \nLOUIS I'm not a lawyer. Explain it to me. \nMICK Alright I will. You know that guy on the Venice boardwalk? The one who has all those plates spinning on sticks? \nLOUIS What does this have to do with-- \nMICK Just listen. A bunch of spinning plates: that's the state's case. In the middle is a big one. It's a fucking platter. And if that falls it takes the others down with it. (He gets closer to Louis) The big plate is the victim. The only witness against you. I knock her down, the act is over and the crowd goes home. No trial. Mick has Louis' attention now. \nLOUIS You can make this trial go away? \nMICK We've lost time. You concealed from me the fact that could do it. It comes down to why. \nLOUIS Why what? \nMICK Why would a guy with a Porsche and a Rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway? The answer is, he wouldn't. And when you see that you see the set- up, the trap. And suddenly it's the defendant who looks like the victim. Louis gets it. Penitent. \nLOUIS You're going to the prosecutor now? \nMICK Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted Minton. He wants to give me the discovery file. Poor guy doesn't know that Raul already got it. He's new to felonies but he's no dope. When he hears his vic's a hooker he'll know we've knocked all his plates down. \nLOUIS Then it'll be over? \nMICK No promises, Louis. Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised to see Haller. \nMRS. WINDSOR I didn't know you were here. Is there news? \nLOUIS There will be, Mother. And puts out a hand to Mick. Grateful. Hesitating half a beat, Mick shakes it and goes... Louis and his Mother. Regard each other. Face to face. \nINT. VAN NUYS CIVIC CENTER - D.A.'S OFFICE, RECEPTION - DAY \nMick in a chair. Impatient. Legal secretaries, prosecutors, etc., come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, DETECTIVE KURLEN, fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers-- \nSECRETARY Are these for A.D.A. Knight? \nKURLEN Yeah, and they're my only copies. I'll wait while you copy them. \nSECRETARY I'll have to ask her... But, he holds them back. Stares. She yields... \nSECRETARY (CONT'D) I'll run them for you now. \nKURLEN Just what I wanted to hear. She goes. Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late-- \nMICK The fun's watching her. Maggie likes this. Touch glasses. After a quiet moment... \nMAGGIE You didn't know Minton had Corliss til I blabbed, did you. \nMICK He was hiding something, I thought it might be a jailhouse snitch... \nMAGGIE You got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know. Except I was already drunk. Good point, right? He feels something. ANGLE, her hand on his knee... \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Hayley's probably asleep. I gotta go relieve the sitter-- (makes a face) Only I don't think I can drive myself home. \nMICK one good turn. I'll drive you. \nMAGGIE And will you take me back to get my car in the morning? A loaded proposition. Covers her hand with his own. CUT TO, \nINT. MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - THE BED - MORNING \nANGLE HAYLEY, sleeping between her two parents. Mick opens his eyes: Maggie's awake and staring at him. Grim. \nMAGGIE This is not fair to her. \n(MICK STIRS--) Waking up and finding you here. She'll get her hopes up. \nMICK How'd she get in here? \nMAGGIE She comes in here when she has nightmares. She has nightmares. \nMICK So she sleeps in here a lot? \nMAGGIE Don't start. You have no idea what it's like raising a child alone. He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM DOWN THE HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nHe's dressing-- she enters to him in a robe-- \nMICK Look-- I'll leave-- then come back in an hour. We'll go together to get your car then I can take her to \nSCHOOL-- \nMAGGIE Just like that? You're gonna start taking her to school? \nMICK Don't you remember what we talked about last night? \nMAGGIE I thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case-- or get me into bed-- \nMICK (getting angry now) I can't win with you-- \nMAGGIE Not when you're being a defense lawyer! Do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it? Me trying to get dirtbags off the street, you keeping them there-- \nMICK \nALRIGHT MAGGIE-- \nMAGGIE Just go! \nINT. DINER (DUPAR'S) - MORNING - MICK AT THE COUNTER: \nUnshaven. Edward Hopper drabness. To lose himself in work, looks down at his files: An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE. WAITRESS, 50s, pours coffee. Recoils as she glimpses the picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see. \nMICK Sorry. It's work. \nWAITRESS I just hope you catch the bastard who did it to her. And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway. Leaving half her face exposed. The good half. Something about this... He picks it up again, folds it... \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nLeaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against the mirror, the unhurt left side showing. Creates a full image of a face. He stares a long time. Then, to himself: \nMICK Martha Renteria. \nINT. ANGLE ON A WAREHOUSE-GARAGE DOOR RISING - FROM WITHIN \nMick, enters. THREE LINCOLNS LINED UP along a wall. Mick's \"fleet.\" California plates: NT GLTY 1, NT GLTY 3, NT GLTY 4.. Walks past... to some battered file cabinets. He turns on a single-bulb lamp... DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET... Mick's fingers fly through the tabs of old files, stops at: MARTINEZ. Cut to, MARTINEZ FILES ON DESK, MOMENTS LATER: Mick examines them: Police reports, printouts. Until he finds... Autopsy report. Name: RENTERIA, MARIA. Takes out... Bx10 PHOTO: WOMAN DEAD ON A BED, NAKED. Dark bloodstains. NEXT PHOTO - TIGHTER: Knife-wounds. And bruises. NEXT PHOTO - HER FACE: BEATEN: Injuries to the left side (opposite of Reggie's.) Dark-haired, large brown eyes. MICK. Folds this one in half. Takes the folded shot of Reggie, fits them together, crease to crease: So alike, they form what could be the face of one woman. Mick. Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head: \nMICK'S VOICE I wish you'd called me before you talked to the cops, Jesus... \nGO TO, INT. VAN NUYS JAIL, ATTORNEY/PRISONER ROOM - DAY \nFLASHBACK OF MICK WITH MARTINEZ, who's stalking around, in a panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news... \nGET BACK FROM THE GLASS. OR THE \nINTERVIEW WILL BE TERMINATED. Frustrated, Mick complies-- but calls-- \nMICK Guard! Long beat. Guard enters. Clean-Marine. Mick shows the stack. \nMICK (CONT'D) I need him to look at these. \nGUARD You can't give him anything. \nMICK But if you won't let him close to the glass, how can he see them? \nGUARD That's not my problem. \nMICK All right, but can you stay a minute? If he IDs one of these mug- shots I need you to witness it. \nGUARD Don't drag me into your bullshit. And goes. \nMICK Godammit. (then, to Martinez) Try. See if one is the guy. Mick holds up one after another. Martinez shakes his head no-- Then the booking photo of Louis Roulet. \nMick holds it up. Off Jesus, as his eyes narrow... \nEXT. AIRLINER LANDING, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY \nPRE-LAP the YELPING/SNARLING of a small /fierce dog... We're: \nINT. RAUL LEVIN'S BUNGALOW, GLENDALE - EVENING \nRaul in shorts, lets Mick in over the barks of his Shih-Tzu. \nRAUL Cool it, Ahab... C'mon in, Mick... Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog-- Mick cools his heels. Takes in: Cubs pennant, Raul's old peaked policeman's cap, mounted... finally pours himself a vodka. Notes the photo of a YOUNGER GUY, its frame hung with the \"Fight Aids\" ribbon. Raul re-enters. \nMICK (re the drink) I helped myself. \nRAUL It's okay. I owe you, the way I let you down on that discovery file-- \nMICK It wasn't you. The cops set you up. Who was it slipped you the file, anyway? \nRAUL Some guy in vice I play cards with. Lonnie Fry. You don't know him. \nMICK You're right, I don't. But I know who his partner was, when he was in homicide. Kurlen. \nRAUL That prick. I'll make him sorry. \nMICK Don't bother. We've got bigger problems. The way Mick says it. Raul sits, asks-- \nRAUL Like what? Where were you today anyway? You were hard to reach... \nMICK Cell phones don't work too well where I was. Raul waits. Knows this is why Mick came here. \nMICK (CONT'D) I came to tell you a story. About Jesus Martinez. \nRAUL You were at San Quentin. \nMICK It's about what happened after he left Martha Renteria's apartment. \nRAUL After he killed her? \nMICK He never killed her. He went there, had sex, flushed the condom-- \nRAUL Wiped his prick on the pink towel-- \nMICK And then went home. The story starts after he left. \nRAUL \n(GETS IT) The real killer. \nMICK The real killer. She lets him in. \nCUT TO, INT. MARTHA RENTERIA' S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMICK Maybe he fakes like it's still Martinez and he forgot something. Or maybe it was an appointment... We see the door open but we don't see who enters... \nRAUL (V.O.) The other guy from the club? The one Jesus said he bid against? \nNICK (V.0.) Right. He comes in, punches her a few times to soften her up... Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun... NICK (V.0.) (cont'd) Then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom... We SEE the knife-tip against her throat... MICK (V.0.) (cont'd) Only she isn't lucky like Reggie Campo will be. He climbs on top, puts on a condom, rapes her... CUT TO, BEDROOM, as Mick gives us the action... MICK (V.0.) (cont'd) And when he's done he stabs her over and over, fifty-two times, while he works out something in his sick fucking mind. We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then-- \nMAGGIE'S VOICE No you weren't. You don't go to San Francisco, you go to San Quentin. Must have been seeing a client... \nMICK You always were too smart for me. Is Hayley okay? \nMAGGIE'S VOICE She's good. Look, she's playing soccer tomorrow, and she wants you to come to the match. You've started something, Mickey... \nMICK Fine, I look forward to it. \nMAGGIE'S VOICE You'll need to pick her up at noon. But, under this, he sees, DOWN THE HALLWAY, light from a room. Sudden chill. Angling to see, keeping a normal voice... \nMICK Noon, I'll do that. See you then. And hangs up before she can say goodbye.. And Stops. Freezes. Eyes on the LIGHT at the end of the hall. Carefully, Mick begins to move down the hall... Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark... Kicks it-- Nothing. starts walking again, when: there's a SOUND. Then silence. What was it?... Mick continues-- to-- The LIT ROOM: SIDE ANGLE, we see it's the den-- Mick braces-- And BURSTS IN SUDDENLY: \nINT. DEN - LOUIS IS THERE... \nSitting in Mick's chair, leg up on the desk... \nMICK What the hell are you doing here? \nLOUIS Funny thing is I've been here before. I was offered the house to show, never gave back the key-- \nMICK (over,doesn't give a shit) Get out of my house! Now! \nLOUIS (rising, but) \nEASY MICK-- But, sees Mick noticing-- the ELECTRONIC ANKLET on his leg-- \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Your friend Valenzuela put this on. A tracer. As if I were going anywhere. \nMICK I said Get up! Get up and get out of this house! Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes-- \nEXT. FRONT DOOR, PORCH - MOMENT LATER, AS THEY COME OUT... \nLOUIS (turns to him, to \n\"EXPLAIN\") I couldn't reach you! I'm on trial for my life, Mick, and I get nervous when I can't reach yout And you were away all day. Like you told \"Maggie.\" Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white. \nMICK You don't come near this house again, do you understand me? We aren't friends, we aren't partners, you're my client, eriod-- \nLOUIS Just what I wanted to remind you of. I'm your client. Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then: \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Besides, I like it in your house, Mick... Pretty pictures of your kid, Hayley... \nMICK Fucken don't. \nLOUIS Don't what, don't say she's pretty? But I saw her, the other day at the club... At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick, solid. \nHis lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just as suddenly, he steels himself. Glares coldly at Mick. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Okay. Okay I'm going. But-- And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) --first I think I should give you back your key. It isn't right that I have it. Now that we can trust each other. Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the fucking steps. \nSUDDEN CUT TO,, EXT. ON HAYLEY: SOCCER MATCH IN PROGRESS \nHayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another girl, a forward, dribbling towards her... ANGLE MICK, on the sideline... among other parents... \nMICK That's it, Hayley, get in her way! Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her, goes in for the score. Hayley looks despondently at Mick-- \nMICK (CONT'D) It's okay, honey! When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it-- \nMICK (CONT'D) This is Haller... He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even from the field, Hayley sees this... \nCUT TO, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - DAY \nMOVING ON THE CUT, WITH MICK, as he ENTERS... It's a CRIME SCENE, swarms with cops, forensics, technicians... Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water. DETECTIVES are leading him: LANKFORD, 38, clean-marine-- and HEIDI SOBEL, 30. They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves... \nLANKFORD Levin was back in his office... \nSOBEL We wouldn't have found him if a neighbor hadn't brought the dog back. It was running loose. \nLANKFORD (shows a desk calendar) Your name's all over this. Were you the only guy he worked for? \nMICK No, but I've got a big trial next month, attempted rape and murder. He was helping me. \nSOBEL Is that the Roulet case? \nMICK How did you know? \nMICK Where'd you get the money for an eight thousand dollar TV, Val? \nVAL That's bullshit! I didn't do that! How dare you say that to me-- I'm inocente, man-- Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at him from the ground. \nVAL (CONT'D) Get outa here; Get out of here, Mick, and get outa my life! Mick's already backing off-- towards the car-- \nVAL (CONT'D) Keep going, man! Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car-- CUT TO, \nINT. FOUR GREEN FIELDS - NIGHT - MICK AT THE BAR... \nDrinking, CAMERA moves on him, he taps the glass for another. Bartender comes over like he's going to pour one. Mick's keys are on the bar-- Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys. Mick looks at him, uncomprehending. \nBARTENDER That's it. You're done here, pal. And you're not driving either. (shows keys, keeps them) Call yourself a cab or something. Off Mick, \nINT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMAGGIE, lugs him into his room, he's a mess... \nMAGGIE Being married to you sucked but it beat being a car service... \nMICK That's the idea, y'know. Car service, with the Lincolns-- Drive the illustrious turds of our city back and forth to LAX-- \nMAGGIE I'll be your first customer. First dollar. And rolls him onto the bed. He looks at her. Drunk as he is: \nMICK Lemme ask you something. Corliss. The name Corliss. You didn't just give me that just because you'd been drinking. You wanted me to have it. She doesn't confirm or deny. Just gets him into bed-- says \nPOINTEDLY-- \nMAGGGIE I'm not staying. He knows, but-- one thing more-- \nMICK Maggie-- Raul. Did I get him killed? Moved, she shakes her head no. Straightens his pillow. \nMAGGIE How do you do it, Haller? You're a sleazy defense lawyer with two ex- wives and a daughter, and we all still love you. We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes. To no one: \nMICK I can't do this anymore. \nINT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nHe's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom. Stares at the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch. Finds: THERE'S A DOLLAR TAPED TO THE GLASS. (From Maggie.) Also: the MESSAGE LIGHT ON HIS PHONE is ON. MOMENTS LATER: He's pressed the button, listens to... \nMACHINE VOICE Message received: YESTERDAY, ELEVEN- \nSEVEN A.M. \nRAUL'S VOICE Mick, it's me. Guess I missed you. Wanted to go over a few things, so I wouldn't interrupt your day with Hayley. Anyway... Presses STOP. Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal. But pulls the pencil & pad near him, and presses START again... RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) First, that witness name you gave me. Corliss? Turns out he's this hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss, sometimes goes by \"DJ.\" When you run it that way you find out he's played the courtroom snitch a lot, mostly in Arizona. But here's the thing: One time down there? It blew up on him. I'm working on it, it can be good for us... Don't know how we get to him, though. They put him in USC lock-up, just to make it harder... Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS... ARIZONA... then USC, circles this last... RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Other thing is, you asked me to dig deep-on Roulet? Mick, I found something. I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q. When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING... and a DOOR BELL... RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Uh, that's somebody at the door... Look, have a good time with your kid. Gotta go, boss. And MESSAGE goes OFF. Mick thinks a moment. Tries to clear his head. Then pulls out a card and dials a number... \nTNTERCUT/ INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION, GLENDALE: SOBEL AT HER DESK \nSOBEL \n(ANSWERS) Detective Sobel. \nMICK \n(INTO PHONE) It's me. Haller. \n(MORE) \nMICK (CONT'D) Look, I-- just checked my phone messages. It turns out Raul called me. Just before he was killed. I didn't know. \n(SHE REACTS) The message came at Eleven-oh- seven. He said, \"I think I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q.\" \nSOBEL \n(WRITING) Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a former client of yours-- \nMICK In San Quentin. Right. \nSOBEL Did he say anything else? Looks down at his notes. At \"Corliss.\" \"USC.\" A beat. As he tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket... \nMICK No-- No, that's it. Then the dog barked, somebody was at the door. He hung up. (before she can ask more) Look, maybe you can tell me if there's any progress on the case. (when she hesitates) He was my friend. Sobel, makes a decision... \nSOBEL Well, we did catch a break. We found a bullet casing in the room, from a 22. It turns out Levin owned a .22, but when we checked it out it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun that killed him... To which, Mick reacts... as she goes on... \nSOBEL (CONT'D) The other thing is we can't find his cell-phone... (noticing Mick is silent) Are you still there? \nMICK Yeah... just, I'll let you know if I think of anything. About his cell- phone, I mean. Thanks. And hangs up. Too sudden. Leaves Sobel wondering... \nMICK I know. My father represented him. He got him off for using it in self- defense, so Cohen made him a present of it. Sobel, careful, opens it... It's empty. Like Mick said. \nSOBEL Why didn't you report it stolen? \nMICK Because I knew who took it. (They look at him.) A client. He told me, so I couldn't turn him in without breaking a trust. They do that. \nLANKFORD (doesn't buy this) Still and all, mind if I look around? Just in case you haven't had time to toss it off a pier? \nMICK Go crazy. You've got the warrant. Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel-- \nLANKFORD Heidi-- bag the box. He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why. \nMICK You can't do ballistics on a box. She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains. \nSOBEL That old Mickey Cohen shooting? It's kind of famous. It turns out the county still has the evidence in storage. The bullet. \nMICK You can match casings to a slug that's fifty years old? \nSOBEL It'd be easier with the gun, but yeah. She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with-- \nMICK Detective? How long will ballistics take? \nSOBEL Careful. You'll make me think you're worried what we'll find. \nMICK I'm in the middle of a trial. \nSOBEL A day. Maybe forty-eight hours. She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear. \nINT. COURTROOM - NEXT MORNING - ARRIVING... \nMick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front... \nTED Morning, Haller. Word is, you had interesting visitors last night... \nMICK Worry about yourself, Ted. You're dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you don't even know it. They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits for him. Before Louis can speak: Low-- \nMICK (CONT'D) Listen, you little shit: This gun- scheme of yours is about to blow up, and I'm not going down for it. If I have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life. Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled. \nINT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED RISES... \nTED One last witness, your honor. The prosecution calls Regina Campo. \nINT. COURTROOM, LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND... \nDiminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty face-- none of the aggressive sexiness. Hesitant but frank. \nREGGIE It's true that I lied. I knew him when he came to the door. \nTED In fact, you'd arranged his coming Miss Campo: why did you lie? \nREGGIE I was scared. I wasn't sure the police would believe me and I wanted to make sure they arrested him... because he's an animal... She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she looks away. Louis is blank. Mick takes it in. Ted follows up-- \nTED Do you regret that decision now? \nREGGIE Yes. If it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else. \nMICK Your honor, prejudicial-- \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Sustained. But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done. Reggie's moved them. \nTED I have no further questions for Regina, your honor. Ted sits. \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Your witness, Mr. Haller. Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand. Low-voiced---- \nLOUIS I want to remind you of your words. You were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea. \nMICK That's it, keep acting like you pull the strings. \nLOUIS I do. \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Haller. Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched by Louis. Then all at once, to surprise her-- \nMICK Ms. Campo have you engaged an attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the events of March Sixth? \nREGGIE (recovers, No I haven't. \nMICK But have you talked to an attorney? \nThe BAR TAPE, blown-up projection, SHOWS REGGIE PASSES LOUIS \nSITTING AT THE BAR, LEANS HER BODY INTO HIM SEXILY... ANGLE COURTROOM, ON REGGIE watching the tape. Also JURORS, reacting, enthralled, and Mick watching them... \nRESUME ANGLE SCREEN, REGGIE HANDS LOUIS A NAPKIN, PASSES BY. RESUME COURT, Mick signals the TECHNICIAN. It goes OFF. \nMICK What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo? \nREGGIE My name and address... \nMICK And your price? \nREGGIE Yes. Four hundred dollars. \nMICK (after a beat) It's a hard line of work... \nREGGIE And dangerous. \nMICK In fact, haven't you told friends you were looking for a way out? \nREGGIE Yes. I'm not proud of what I do-- \nMICK And so, isn't it true-- nothing would be easier to understand-- that you saw Louis Roulet and his money as a way out? \nREGGIE No! That's not what this is about! That man hit me and tried to kill me. \nMICK Yes, we've heard you say that-- \n(TO FULLBRIGHT) Judge may I ask the witness to stand up? \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT (surprised, but) The witness will stand. I hope you're going somewhere with this, Mr. Haller. Reggie stands. \nMICK Now if you please, walk over to my client. She goes, stands before Louis. Who rises on cue from Mick. \nMICK (CONT'D) This is the man you broke free from, overpowered, knocked out? \nREGGIE Yes-- You can do amazing things when you're afraid-- \nMICK How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo? Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN- DOT-COM says one hundred three... \nREGGIE That's right. A beat. Louis sits. Reggie stands there... suddenly cries. \nMICK I've got no further questions for the witness, your honor. Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table. Where we pick up TED MINTON. Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of damage as best he can... He's startled when: \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton? Do you have another witness for us? Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises... WHILE, ASIDE, Louis to Mick, re Ted... \nLOUIS He looks worried. Mick watching Ted, waits, tense... \nTED The state rests, your honor. Mick's disappointed: No Corliss. \nMICK Not worried enough. \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT (raises a gavel...) Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch. And the gavel comes down. \nINT. COURTROOM, AFTER THE BREAK - MICK, ON DIRECT, HAS... \nMARY WINDSOR Yes, I recognize this knife. (holding an evidence bag) It's the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years. Almost exactly. \nMICK Why would he need protection? \nMARY WINDSOR Because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt... Even raped or murdered. \nMICK But has Louis ever been the subject of such a crime? \nMARY WINDSOR No. But he knew someone who... (hesitates...) \nMICK Go on, please. \nMARY WINDSOR She was raped and robbed by a man. Louis found her. It was terrible. The first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry, at all times. (looks at Ted Minton) March Sixth would have been no different. \nINT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED HAS MARY WINDSOR ON CROSS... \nTED Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty exact, about when your son started carrying around this, this weapon, a five-inch folding knife... \nMARY WINDSOR I am. The incident took place on June ninth, two-thousand-one. Mick watches Ted, carefully... Cat and mouse... \nTED Was it in the newspapers? \nMICK Yes you did. \nLORNA Yes I did. Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved-- \nMICK Now go, and be ready for my call. Lorna starts to go-- then pauses. \nLORNA I'm crazy about the power suit. Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching. \nINT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNo sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document. \nKURLEN What shit is this, Haller? I got nothing to do with your case! Mick, \"innocent,\" inspects the papers. With surprise-- \nMICK Subpoena to appear as a witness? You'll just have to wait and see. It's a legal document, Detective. Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick with the \"legal document.\" He tucks it away-- And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table. OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP: \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.) Mr. Minton-- \nINT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - COURT'S IN SESSION... \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Does the state have any rebuttal? \nTED (rises, ready) The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness. \nMICK Judge? Who is this witness? Why wasn't I told before now? \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT A fair question. Mr. Minton? \nTED Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody, following his arrest. \nLOUIS (shouts, suddenly--) Bullshit! I didn't to talk to-- \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller, control your client! Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce-- \nMICK That was good. Now leave it to me. (to the court) I do share my client's outrage, your honor. I'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony... \nTED Mr. Corliss did not come forward until yesterday. \nMICK \n(OUTRAGED) This is incredible... \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Do you want to go back and talk to him? Given the timing I'd allow it. \nMICK No, Judge, we all know what this is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and anything he'd say would be a lie-- \nTED That's groundless, your honor-- \nMICK --I just want my objection noted. \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then I'm going to rule he can \nTESTIFY-- \nMICK Can I ask one indulgence? Can I step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator? For whatever good it will do at this late date. \nINT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM \nMick already dialling-- Lorna answering-- \nLORNA'S VOICE Yep, here. \nMICK Put your watch at quarter of. At ten fifteen you enter the room. \nLORNA'S VOICE Got it. \nMICK With the printouts. \nLORNA'S VOICE Mickey, I know the moves! He snaps shut his cell-phone. \nINT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - DWAYNE CORLISS ON THE STAND \nPrison jumpsuit. We recognize him: the holding-cell junky. \nTED Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated at this time? \nCORLISS Um, no, now I'm just in the courtroom. Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething... \nTED You said he was bragging. How? \nCORLISS Well, like, he told me the details. About the other one, that he killed. \n(MORE) \nCORLISS (CONT'D) He called her a snake dancer. She danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit. ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this... SAME TIME, REACTION at the defense table: Mick, \"alarmed,\" low to Louis-- \nMICK How does he know this? \nLOUIS Do you think I know? \nMICK If you didn't tell him this shit somebody did. Who? Start thinking! RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss-- \nTED Is there anything else he told you? \nCORLISS No, that snake-girl stuff was it. \nTED (after a beat) Then no further questions, your honor. Ted sits. The look he gives Mick in passing is one of abounding confidence. Mick stews... Swivels around... Covert glance, MICK'S POV, looks to see if Kurlen is where he was, against the wall. He's not. He's gone. So is Lankford. And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've just left... While IN FRONT: \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Any re-cross from the defense? Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see Lorna enter and approach down the aisle. \nMICK A moment with my staff, Judge? \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Be quick. He meets Lorna at the gate. Brings his head close to hers-- \nLORNA This is where I whisper in your ear, tell you stuff... \nMICK (takes a file from her) It's all here, right? You go now, I don't want anyone talking to you. \nLORNA Damn. She goes, he returns to the table. Before Louis can speak: \nMICK I don't know what's going on here, but it won't matter if it's two murders or a hundred if I can show he's a liar-- \nLOUIS If you set me up I swear I'll-- \nMICK Just tell me if there's anything else he knows. Anything else I have to stay away from. \nLOUIS I don't know because I never talked to him. I'm not that stupid. \nMICK It doesn't matter. If I destroy him none of it counts... \nLOUIS (from his gut) Then destroy him. A command. Mick nods. Returns to the witness Corliss-- \nMICK Dwayne, if I can call you that-- \nCORLISS It's what people call me-- \nMICK Don't they also call you D.J.? For example, down in Phoenix, right? \nCORLISS Maybe. He's a bit wary. Mick looks through the file Lorna brought-- \nMICK Because you know, my assistant, she was just reading on the internet about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges-- Hometown of Mesa, Arizona? \nCORLISS Yeah, that'd be me. But-- \nMICK You remember Fred Bentley, right? Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick-- \nTED I object, your honor, where is the defense going with this? \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller. But the witness can answer. \nCORLISS I don't remember any Bentley-- \nMICK Sure you do. You testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with-- rape of a ten-year- old girl-- even though he denied his guilt in court. Am .I ringing any bells, D.J.? \nCORLISS Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot, there's not much I recall-- \nMICK Then I'd like you to read this to us, D.J. It's a printout of a news story from the Arizona Star, 1997, that's eight years after he was convicted. I ask that it be admitted into evidence-- \nTED Your honor? A news report? \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Let's see where it takes us. The state can object later. Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss. \nMICK I've marked the paragraph. \nCORLISS I ain't too good at reading... (clears his throat) \"A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly convicted of rape, was released Saturday after con-- \n.tearful at the news, grips Mick's hand... she and Dobbs... \nMARY WINDSOR Mr. Haller, thank you for my son... \nDOBBS You were splendid-- And Louis. Private, a few feet away. Smiles... \nLOUIS I knew I wasn't wrong about you... \nMICK I want the gun. \nLOUIS Of course you do. No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick-- \nMARY WINDSOR Mr. Haller, this time I insist you come to Orso for a celebration-- \nMICK I don't think so. Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL. Mick freezes, expects the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON: \nKURLEN Louis Roulet, you are under arrest. Turn around and place your hands behind your back. \nLOUIS (as Kurlen cuffs him) Mick? This shouldn't be happening. Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back-- \nMARY WINDSOR No! Take your hands off my son! \nLOUIS Mother. Louis' voice controls her. Stricken, Mary gives up. Then-- \nDOBBS What are you arresting him for? \nKURLEN (starting to take Louis) Suspicion of murder. The murder of Martha Renteria. \nDOBBS That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you crazy? Everything that man Corliss said was a lie! Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed. \nKURLEN If it was all lies, how'd you know I meant the snake dancer? Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis-- \nMICK A moment with my client, Detective? Kurlen nods, why not. Mick leads Louis a few steps away. \nMICK (CONT'D) This is it, Louis. I got you off. Now get yourself a new lawyer. \nLOUIS You're forgetting I have the gun... \nMICK Yeah, and you'll have to explain how you got it. But you know what? I've stopped giving a shit. You're going down, and Martinez is getting out, and that's all I care about. \n(MORE) \nMICK (CONT'D) When they stick that needle in your arm, that will be me. \nLOUIS And what if I don't go down? But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Because I don't think they have enough to hold me. I could be out by tomorrow... You've got women, you've got a daughter... At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) You can't protect everybody. Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow... Mick's already moving to the elevators... watched by SOBEL. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - STEPS - MINUTES LATER - DAY - STILL RAINING \nSOBEL catches up as MICK reaches the Lincoln. Stops him. They move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry. \nMICK Please tell me you've got enough on Louis for the murder of Renteria. \nSOBEL We will. We have the ticket. \nMICK What ticket? \nSOBEL The parking ticket, that Raul found. That was the phone message he left you... (Sees Mick doesn't know) Raul checked. Louis got one at a meter outside the victim's place, same time she was murdered. \nMICK What about Raul's murder? Do you have him for that? \nSOBEL No. We still don't know how he could have slipped the tracer anklet. (before Mick can ask more) Haller? Leave it alone. He hesitates-- but goes. Into the rain. Gets into-- \nINT. LINCOLN (PARKED) - CONTINUOUS \nHe watches Sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain. When: \nEARL Mr. Haller? Got that thing you asked for. And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel: A GUN. Mick, puts it away, in the armrest. A bit regretful, because: \nMICK I said I'd never do this. Ask you to violate your parole. \nEARL It's called, lookin' out for your blood. Mick sits back. Earl pops in a RAP CD, TUPAC. \nTUPAC \"To be a man in this wicked land...\" \nVAL He's movin'... on Sunset... \nMICK Is he coming to my house? \nVAL \n(STUDIES) Could be, yeah, he's going west, heading up Laurel Canyon... Mick, nods... glance toward his gun... Then... PHONE BEEPS in his ear, Call Waiting-- \nMICK Stay there, Val-- (switch/into phone) Maggie? \nMAGGIE'S VOICE I reached the sitter, she'll keep Hayley at the bus-stop... \nMICK Good. As soon as you've got her, take her somewhere safe. And call me. (shifts calls/to Val--) Where is he, Val? \nVAL I see him but I don't know where he's goin'... \nMICK What? \nVAL He's not goin' to your house. Sonofabitch sailed right past the turn... SCREEN, CURSOR travelling... \nMICK So where's he going? \nVAL He's heading for the Valley. \nMICK Fuck, he's going to Maggie's. Keep track of him. Hangs up again. Looks around-- as if looking for an idea-- then, frantic, looks up a number-- can't find it, finds it-- dials-- it rings-- Cold sweat til somebody answers-- \nMICK (CONT'D) Eddie? Eddie Vogel?

The guidelines put him at seven years, maybe he'll do four. Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time... \nMICK .What am I missing here?... Ted stays innocent-looking. Blank. \nEXT. GRIFFITH PARK - KID'S AREA, PONY RIDES - SATURDAY \nMICK with his daughter, HAYLEY, 8. Mick's ON A BENCH near where Hayley waits on line for the next pony... EARL approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream for Hayley and one for himself. Kids playing everywhere, a MINIATURE TRAIN chugs past... but Mick's lost in thought, his beat-up briefcase open, he's working. \nEARL Got you the good stuff, Hayley... \nHAYLEY Thank you, Earl. Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds it for Hayley. \nEARL Man's got your ride ready... \nMICK Go on, I'll hold your ice cream. Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring... Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the ice cream, returns to his files-- \nMICK (CONT'D) There's something right in front of me and I'm not seeing it. On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the blue-covered one Raul gave him. The white-covered from Ted. Mick starts turning pages, compares... The same, the same... When he turns the next one over: It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE, the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office. Turns to the matching page from Ted's file. Reaction Mick... \nHARD CUT TO, EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER \nIn the parking lot, pulls up. Louis is in front of the club, golf-clothes, waiting. Comes out to meet the Lincoln... \nINT. LINCOLN, BACK SEAT - SAME TIME \nHAYLEY You said we',re going to the movies! You promised me last week! \nMICK Daddy's got to talk to somebody. You stay with Earl. Mick gets out, Hayley stays... \nEXT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS \nLouis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in order not to be seen or heard-- eager-- \nLOUIS What's happened? Is it over? You said it would be over by now-- \nMICK That was before I found out you were still lying to me. He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE, but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before. \nMICK (CONT'D) You know what that is? It's a picture of your knife. The one you had on you when you went to Reggie Campos. The one the cops have. Look at the blood on the blade. Look at the initials. Louis is stuck for an answer-- \nMICK (CONT'D) That's why Ted Minton didn't care when I told him Reggie's a prostitute. What's it matter, when he's got a knife with her blood and your initials on it? \nLOUIS This wasn't the knife in the file-- \nMICK (scowls, sore) That's right. The file Raul got us was a loaded deck. The cops must have been on to him, because they used it to set us up. So we'd think they had nothing, when in fact they had enough to put your Hugo Boss, golf-playing ass away for twenty years! Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off. He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis. Mick sees him looking her way... Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm. \nMICK (CONT'D) Explain to me why you lied about the knife. \nLOUIS I didn't lie. I said the one in the picture wasn't mine. Mick frowns/grins at the answer... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) I said it twice! Nobody listened! \nMICK \n(MOCKING) What are you now, a lawyer? A clever, third-rate fucking lawyer with smart-ass technicalities? \"You said it wasn't yours\"-- What you should have said was, \"I had a knife but this isn't it!\" What did you think, it would just go away? (closing in on him) You brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute, Louis! How am I supposed to make that look like she set you up? \nLOUIS 1. Did. Not. Do this. Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look. Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time-- \nMICK Then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom-made knife, serrated tip, with \"LR\" engraved on the blade? \nLOUIS I always carry it. For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes. \nMICK You always carry it. \nLOUIS Yes. In real estate we show homes, to people we don't know. This one time... He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) My mother. She was showing a place. It was in Bel-Air, so she thought it was okay to go alone, even though there was a man at the time who had raped some women that way. He was there. \nMICK Who was there? \nLOUIS The man. He raped her. When she didn't come back, I went to the house and found her. Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) That's when she stopped showing property. I do the selling now. And I started carrying a knife. Always. Mick turns it over. Finally... \nMICK That's quite a story, Louis. \n(BEAT) Your mother will have to testify. \nLOUIS We don't want that. \n", "test1_true": "(COLD) I don't give a damn what you think we want. From now on you do what I tell you while I try this case. Do I make myself clear? Louis is silent. Mick looks off. Towards Hayley, in the car. \nINT. DOOR OPENING TO: MAGGIE'S HOUSE, STUDIO CITY - NIGHT \nON THE CUT she OPENS TO MICK CARRYING HAYLEY IN HIS ARMSi fast asleep but still clutching a carton of movie popcorn... \nINT. KITCHEN \nMaggie leads Mick-with-Hayley through, Hayley snuggles further in her father's arms. As they continue... \nMICK If she wasn't so darn heavy I'd carry her all night, I swear. \nMAGGIE Defense lawyers will swear to anything... \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LATER - MICK AND MAGGIE \nHe's at the door about to go. Maggie delays him with, \nMAGGIE You look like you're in a daze. \nMICK It turned into a rough week. Being with Hayley was the only high. She can't find anything to say. As he heads out again... \nMAGGIE Nobody's seen you at Four Green Fields lately. \nMICK I stopped going. Too much of a scene. \nMAGGIE Yeah well. If you start going again. Now she has his attention. \nMICK If I start again, what? She's awkward. Smiles, shrugs to cover-- \nMAGGIE Bunch of us from the office are there. Tuesdays, after work. An invitation. S-zrprising him. \nMICK I'll keep it in mind. \nMAGGIE Okay. \nMICK Okay. After more awkwardness, goes. She closes the door. CUT TO, \nINT.'FOUR GREEN FIELDS' (LAWYERS' BAR) - MONDAY - EVENING \nNoisy, drinking CROWD of legal types-- We're MOVING through it-- Don't realize it at first but it's-- MICK'S POV-- he's trying to shoulder his way through towards-- A BOOTH OF WOMEN from Maggie's office-- Maggie sees him, lights up a little-- \nMAGGIE Haller! Let him in, girls! Buy you a beer? \nMICK You won't make it to the bar... \nMAGGIE Then let's share this. They fight to a table for two, edge of the crowd. When he balks at sipping from her glass-- \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) We've had a taste of each other before. He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few. He drinks. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Feeling a little better tonight? Or did Ted Minton sandbag you? \nMICK (How'd she know?) Yeah, that's exactly what-- \nMAGGIE With that guy Corliss, right? I told them using that dirtbag was a bullshit play. But you'll take the the guy's head off on the stand... Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) (catches herself, giggles) Whoops, I shouldn't say that... \nMICK (to keep it alive) So Ted talked to you about Corliss? \nMAGGIE Huh? It was me who sent him to Ted. Corliss thought it was my case because I handled first appearance. (sees Mick is too eager) I'm telling you too much. \nMICK Nah, nothing I don't know, they always use a professional snitch... (when she doesn't bite) I mean Corliss has done this before, right? \nMAGGIE (clams up, with:) Can't we just forget work and have a friendly Guiness? \nMICK How about we go somewhere to eat? (before she objects) So we can talk about our daughter. \nMAGGIE \n(WEAKENS) Let me tell my friends I'm leaving. She goes. And Mick, quick, writes the name CORLISS on napkin. \nINT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT - AT A TABLE: \nMAGGIE I'll bet you didn't know Sponge-Bob movies could be so much fun. \n", "test2_input": "MICK (CONT'D) My name's Michael Haller, and I'm representing Louis Roulet. (glances at Ted) Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the word prostitute for the woman who's supposed to be Louis's victim. He needn't worry, this case isn't about how she makes her money... But it is about her actions. How she saw a young man with signs of wealth, and chose to target him... (closes in on the jury...) What she didn't count on, was you. The fact that you'd put two and two together, and let your common sense tell you who was the real predator. \nCUT TO, INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER \nAs Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break. Low-voiced-- \nLORNA You had a message from Gloria. She thinks she can do what you asked. \nMICK Thinks? \nLORNA Corliss has the same meal time. She can try. \nMICK \n(DISCOURAGED) Let her try. But it may not matter. \nLORNA What do you mean? \nMICK I mean, Corliss isn't on the witness list. It could be Ted Minton is holding him back. He won't use him until he has to. Until I screw up his case so bad he has no choice. \nLORNA Mickey? Can you do that? Off Mick, tries for a confident smile... \nCUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON THE STAND: \nFEMALE COP (MAXWELL) I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got there as... hurt and frightened... \nTED Frightened? \nOFFICER MAXWELL She kept asking us if she was safe, even after Roulet was taken away. \nINT. COURTROOM, LATER \nMick has Maxwell on cross... Clerk hands her pages... \nMICK Officer, would you read from your arrest report where it's marked? \nOFFICER MAXWELL \"The victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked.\" \nMICK Why did you write that she didn't know him? \nOFFICER MAXWELL Because that's what she said. \nMICK So, she just opened the door at ten o'clock to a stranger? \nOFFICER MAXWELL She didn't put it like that... \nMICK Was there blood on his right hand? \nOFFICER MAXWELL (confused by the shift) No, his left. Or we would have bagged his right one, too. \nINT. CAMERA TRAILS THE JURY... \nAs a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness... \nTED Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss Campo on the night of March Sixth? CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video. Blurred tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair. \nTALBOT Yep. Had a date with her at Morgan's. Then from there we went to her place and had another date, if you know what I mean. \nB5. Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored. \nTED Had you known Miss Campo before? \nTALBOT Nope. Just called her up. \nTED How did you know to call her? \nTALBOT From her website. She's got a real good website. Jury laughs a little. Fascinated but repulsed by this guy... but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone... \nTED Did you have sexual relations? \nTALBOT Four hundred bucks worth. And she earned every cent. Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval. Mick catches his reaction, likes it. Ted goes on... \nTED And what time did you leave? \nTALBOT About five minutes before ten. \nTED She say she had another engagement? \n", "test2_true": "MICK Objection, I don't think Mr. Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms. Campo's thinking or plans... \nTALBOT I just mean she acted satisfied... \nFULLBRIGHT \n(OFFENDED--) Sustained! Go on, Mr. Minton. \nTED When you left, what condition was she in? Was she hurt? \nTALBOT No, she was fit as a fiddle. I know because I'd just played her. (before Fullbright bursts) Sorry, your honor. She was fine. Minton goes, lifts a sheet over an easel, REVEALS the blown- up PHOTOS of the Reggie's battered face. \nTED She didn't look like this? \nTALBOT Man. What kind of bastard does something like that? \nFULLBRIGHT Answer the question. \nTALBOT No. We made consensual and pleasurable love. Which is what life is all about. Then I paid her. \nCUT TO, MICK HAS TALBOT ON CROSS... \nMICK Mr. Talbot, are you right or left- handed? \nTALBOT Left. \nMICK Left. And isn't it true that before you left Regina Campo asked you to strike her repeatedly in the face? \nTED \n(OBJECTING) Your honor, there's no basis for this sort of questioning. Mr. Haller is just muddying the waters with outrageous statements. Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply. Mick half-shrugs... \nMICK Part of the defense theory, Judge. \nFULLBRIGHT The witness can answer. \nTALBOT I never hit her or any other woman. \nMICK Do you know a prostitute named... (checks his sheet) Shaquille Barton? \"Shaquilla Shakels\" is her work name. \nTALBOT Okay, yeah. I seen her one time... \nMICK And if I brought her here and she said you had struck her with your left hand... \nTALBOT She'd be lying. I tried Shaquilla, that rough stuff's not for me. I'm a missionary man. \nMICK With a strong left. Thank you. And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last, and a pleased one from Louis. CUT TO, \nINT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nWhere Mick, as he exits the courtroom for the day, is \nSURPRISED TO FIND: DETECTIVES LANKFORD AND SOBEL WAITING FOR HIM. Sobel holds documents.

Lankford drives. \nMICK This warrant is bullshit-- \nLANKFORD Good enough to search your house. For a Woodsman registered to you. \nBB. \nSOBEL We need to run ballistics on it. She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt: \nSOBEL (CONT'D) It would have been better if you'd told me that you had a Woodsman. \nMICK I don't anymore. It was stolen. The worst yet. Lankford laughs: \"How convenient...\" \nINT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - LATER - ON: \nThe BOX FOR THE WOODSMAN: Sobel in gloves, examines, while-- \nLANKFORD We got the history on the piece.

I don't know for how long. \nMICK That was all? \nLOUIS Then when I woke up these guys were on me, telling me not to move. I couldn't anyway. I was too scared. Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws... \nMICK But, there was blood on your jacket and your left hand... \nLOUIS Someone put it there because I didn't. \nMICK Are you left-handed? \nLOUIS No. \nMICK You didn't strike Ms. Campo with your left fist? \nLOUIS No! \nMICK Threaten to rape her, or kill her?-- \nLOUIS No! \nMICK You're angry. Why? \nLOUIS (passionate but simple--) Do you know what it's like to be accused of something like this? To listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful? I, I understand I had to be quiet and wait my chance and not say anything-- but if guilty people have rights, what about innocent people? I am innocent! Mick. Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect. \nMICK Nothing further, Judge. Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat-- \nTED According to you, Ms. Campo punched herself or had a man she never met before punch her lights out as part of a set-up? \nLOUIS All I know is that I didn't. \nTED And this knife you always carry, how did she know she'd find it on you as part of the set-up? \nLOUIS \n(\"HONEST\") She couldn't, could she? I mean, I never took it out or showed it to anybody-- so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money I had that I was going to pay her with, right?-- \nM. \nTED I'd really prefer it if I ask the questions, and you answer them! (then calming himself) Would you look at this, please-- Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face. \nTED (CONT'D) Please tell us again if you think Regina Campo would or could have done this to herself. \nLOUIS I don't know who did it, but it wasn't me. Nobody deserves that to happen... \nTED (seizes on this) What do you mean by \"deserves?\" Do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she \"deserves?\" \nLOUIS (right back at him) I mean no matter what she does for a living or who she is-- No woman deserves that. Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there. \nTED I have no more questions. At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION-- Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat, passing Mick as Mick rises-- Louis gives Mick a \"How'd I do?\" look, Mick nods, unmistakably, \"You did fine...\"-- Mick's look finds Ted-- Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a kind of smile, Ted grim-- As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted-- RESUME NORMAL SPEED for Mick's confident, fateful words: \nMICK Your honor, the defense rests. \nTed hears this, sets his jaw. Fullbright turns to him. \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton? Ted is uncertain... \nTED Your honor... (She waits.) The state needs the night to decide, your honor... \nJUDGE FULLBRIGHT To decide what? \nTED Frankly I wasn't anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses. I-- I'd like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness. \nMICK (reacts, \"objects--\") Your honor, first we've heard of \nTHIS-- \nTED I said `-consider.\" I need to find out if the witness is even \nAVAILABLE-- \nMICK The state still has an obligation to disclose the identity-- \nTED Not if I decide not to use him.

EARL approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream for Hayley and one for himself. Kids playing everywhere, a MINIATURE TRAIN chugs past... but Mick's lost in thought, his beat-up briefcase open, he's working. \nEARL Got you the good stuff, Hayley... \nHAYLEY Thank you, Earl. Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds it for Hayley. \nEARL Man's got your ride ready... \nMICK Go on, I'll hold your ice cream. Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring... Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the ice cream, returns to his files-- \nMICK (CONT'D) There's something right in front of me and I'm not seeing it. On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the blue-covered one Raul gave him. The white-covered from Ted. Mick starts turning pages, compares... The same, the same... When he turns the next one over: It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE, the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office. Turns to the matching page from Ted's file.

You said it would be over by now-- \nMICK That was before I found out you were still lying to me. He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE, but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before. \nMICK (CONT'D) You know what that is? It's a picture of your knife. The one you had on you when you went to Reggie Campos. The one the cops have. Look at the blood on the blade. Look at the initials. Louis is stuck for an answer-- \nMICK (CONT'D) That's why Ted Minton didn't care when I told him Reggie's a prostitute. What's it matter, when he's got a knife with her blood and your initials on it? \nLOUIS This wasn't the knife in the file-- \nMICK (scowls, sore) That's right. The file Raul got us was a loaded deck. The cops must have been on to him, because they used it to set us up. So we'd think they had nothing, when in fact they had enough to put your Hugo Boss, golf-playing ass away for twenty years! Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off. He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis. Mick sees him looking her way... Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm. \nMICK (CONT'D) Explain to me why you lied about the knife. \nLOUIS I didn't lie. I said the one in the picture wasn't mine. Mick frowns/grins at the answer... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) I said it twice! Nobody listened! \nMICK \n(MOCKING) What are you now, a lawyer? A clever, third-rate fucking lawyer with smart-ass technicalities? \"You said it wasn't yours\"-- What you should have said was, \"I had a knife but this isn't it!\" What did you think, it would just go away? (closing in on him) You brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute, Louis! How am I supposed to make that look like she set you up? \nLOUIS 1. Did. Not. Do this. Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look. Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time-- \nMICK Then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom-made knife, serrated tip, with \"LR\" engraved on the blade? \nLOUIS I always carry it. For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes. \nMICK You always carry it. \nLOUIS Yes. In real estate we show homes, to people we don't know. This one time... He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) My mother. She was showing a place. It was in Bel-Air, so she thought it was okay to go alone, even though there was a man at the time who had raped some women that way. He was there. \nMICK Who was there? \nLOUIS The man. He raped her. When she didn't come back, I went to the house and found her. Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility... \nLOUIS (CONT'D) That's when she stopped showing property. I do the selling now. And I started carrying a knife. Always. Mick turns it over.

Being with Hayley was the only high. She can't find anything to say. As he heads out again... \nMAGGIE Nobody's seen you at Four Green Fields lately. \nMICK I stopped going. Too much of a scene. \nMAGGIE Yeah well. If you start going again. Now she has his attention. \nMICK If I start again, what? She's awkward. Smiles, shrugs to cover-- \nMAGGIE Bunch of us from the office are there. Tuesdays, after work. An invitation. S-zrprising him. \nMICK I'll keep it in mind. \nMAGGIE Okay. \nMICK Okay.

When he balks at sipping from her glass-- \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) We've had a taste of each other before. He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few. He drinks. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Feeling a little better tonight? Or did Ted Minton sandbag you? \nMICK (How'd she know?) Yeah, that's exactly what-- \nMAGGIE With that guy Corliss, right? I told them using that dirtbag was a bullshit play. But you'll take the the guy's head off on the stand... Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) (catches herself, giggles) Whoops, I shouldn't say that... \nMICK (to keep it alive) So Ted talked to you about Corliss? \nMAGGIE Huh? It was me who sent him to Ted. Corliss thought it was my case because I handled first appearance. (sees Mick is too eager) I'm telling you too much. \nMICK Nah, nothing I don't know, they always use a professional snitch... (when she doesn't bite) I mean Corliss has done this before, right? \nMAGGIE (clams up, with:) Can't we just forget work and have a friendly Guiness? \nMICK How about we go somewhere to eat? (before she objects) So we can talk about our daughter. \nMAGGIE \n(WEAKENS) Let me tell my friends I'm leaving. She goes. And Mick, quick, writes the name CORLISS on napkin. \nINT.

I mean, I never took it out or showed it to anybody-- so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money I had that I was going to pay her with, right?-- \nM. \nTED I'd really prefer it if I ask the questions, and you answer them!

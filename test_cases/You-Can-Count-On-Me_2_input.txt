She throws the sheets at him and storms away. Terry walks through the living room and OUT the front door, SLAMMING it behind him. 
INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy sits by the phone in her bathrobe. She picks it up and DIALS. 
INTERCUT: BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM. NANCY, watching TV on the sofa with Brian, picks up the RINGING PHONE. 
NANCY (Into the phone) Hello? 
SAMMY HANGS UP. She gets up, walks around, sits down again. Picks up the phone and DIALS. It RINGS. 
INTERCUT: BOB'S KITCHENETTE. Bob, making a sandwich for himself, picks up the phone. 
BOB (Into the phone) Hello? 
SAMMY HANGS UP. Pause. She sweeps the TELEPHONE and ANSWERING MACHINE OFF the nightstand. Pause. She calms down and puts them back. The ancient answering machine is CLICKING convulsively. She WHACKS IT and it stops. 
EXT. CHURCH. DAY 
The congregation is coming out of the church and milling around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying good-bye to some neighbors. She watches pregnant NANCY and BRIAN go down the steps. 
POV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly. 
REVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a look from the distance. 
EXT. RECTORY. DAY 
Services are over. Everyone has gone home. 
INT. RON'S OFFICE. LATER 
Sammy sits with Ron. 
SAMMY Anyway... I don't know what the church's position is on adultery and fornication these days, but I felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so... What is the official position on that stuff these days? 
RON Well... it's a sin. 
SAMMY Good: I think it should be. 
RON ...but we don't tend to focus on that aspect of it, right off the bat -- 
SAMMY Why not? 
RON Well -- 
SAMMY I think you should. 
RON Well -- 
SAMMY Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. Maybe it'd be better if you told me how I'm endangering my immortal soul, and if I don't quit I'm going to burn in hell. Don't you ever think that? 
RON Um... No. 
SAMMY Well, it's a lot better than all this "Why do you think you're in this situation" psychological bullshit you hear all the time. 
RON Well... Why do you think you're in this situation? 
SAMMY With which one? 
RON All of them. 
Pause. 
SAMMY I feel sorry for them. (Pause) Isn't that ridiculous? 
Ron shrugs: i.e., "not necessarily." 
EXT. STREAM -- BRIDGE. DAY 
Terry and Rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a wide running stream, fishing. The sunlight slants through the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous and peaceful. 
RUDY I've never been so bored in my life.

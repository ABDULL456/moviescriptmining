Sebastian enters the apartment. Checks his reflection in the mirror -- a new addition. The clock reads: 4:57am. 
C90   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN 
Sebastian gets into bed, careful not to wake Mia. 
D90   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Mia crosses through to the kitchen to get herself breakfast, careful not to wake Sebastian. The clock: 7:02am. 
E90   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING 
Sebastian in bed, fast asleep. And WE RETURN TO... 
F90   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
...Mia and Sebastian at the piano, before this latest journey began, finishing their song. The last lyrics resonating as they look into one another's eyes: 
SEBASTIAN                        MIA City of stars...              You've never shined so brightly. Revision                           50. 
On that -- this image of love, Sebastian playing out the final chords on his piano -- WE GO DARK. 
All sound fades out. And then, we hear -- 
-- a CROWD CHEERING. [START A FIRE] 
We see -- a white spotlight. It reveals Sebastian. We're -- 
91   INT. THE ECHO - NIGHT 
Sebastian is on-stage. He's the only musician we can see. The floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people. 
Among them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. Sebastian sees her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. Mia grins right back, heart swelling... 
A SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. Mia bobs her head. It's just Keith and Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune... 
And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and -- 
BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full- fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track. 
Mia is taken aback. But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the crowd around her GOES CRAZY... 
Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth sounds. We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been transformed beyond recognition. Not a hint of jazz... 
Keith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS are revealed stage-left. The band surges into the song's bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily- clad. 
And then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through the dark. The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists... 
Mia looks at Sebastian. He's not fighting any of this. He sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her expression... 
She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits. She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growing more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolonged SOLO... Revision                          51. 
Mia looks back at him, takes it all in: Is this really him...? 
As the mass of people swells and moves, Mia finds herself PUSHED TO THE SIDE, bit by bit, away from the center... 
She tries to hold her ground, but is edged FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY. Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice. Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail. She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights and into shadow... 
The final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. We linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY -- ending the song just as we SMASH CUT TO A TITLE CARD OVER BLACK: 
FALL 
Silence. 
We take a moment to collect ourselves before --

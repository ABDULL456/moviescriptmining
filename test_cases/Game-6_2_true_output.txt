INT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE MAIN ROOM - LATER People cluster around TV sets. 
Raucous noise. 
A waiter with a tray of food standing transfixed, watching the game. 
Nicky is now sitting next to Matthew and they are watching the game. 
MATTHEW What's it like to shoot somebody? 
NICKY I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions. 
TOYOTA Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once. 
NICKY It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work. 
TV audio: derisive shouts from the stadium crowd directed at A Red Sox players. 
Action on the field. 
TV VOICES Dew-eeey! Rog-errr! 
The bar crowd picks up the chant. 
TV images. The Red Sox have scored and lead 2-0. 
INT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - THE TABLE Nicky stands to see the action better. His jacket swings open and Toyota sees the revolver tucked into his waistband. 
INT. THE BARRYMORE eople seating themselves in the orchestra. 
Noise from the tavern TV continues to be heard from the subjective viewpoint of a man in the theater who has a miniature TV and earphones. 
Steven Schwimmer in an aisle seat in the orchestra. He sees Paisley sitting in the theatre some distance away. 
House lights go down. 
Two figures hurrying down the aisle. An usher leading a young woman. The woman is Laurel Rogan, Nicky's daughter, wearing her headset antennas. 
Laurel squeezes past some people and takes her seat, and Steven, sitting three rows back, watches her with interest. 
The curtain comes open. 
INT. MANION'S OLD TIMER TAVERN - LATER Cheering from the bar crowd. 
Nicky is a little disheveled. He has finished his dinner and is eating from Toyota's plate finishing and watching the game. 
TOYOTA You're a family man, Frankie? 
NICKY Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. (MORE) 
NICKY(cont'd) He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it? 
TOYOTA An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do? 
NICKY I don't know Toyota. What does he do?

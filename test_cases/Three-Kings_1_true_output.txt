ARCHIE GATES 4 tons. 
General Horn picks up a gold brick. 
GENERAL HORN Where's it at? 
TROY Get them over first. 
ARCHIE GATES They helped us get it, Ron. I made a deal, and that's soldier's honor. You can't fuck them now. 
General Horn looks at Archie. 
ARCHIE GATES You can return this gold, be a big hero, get another star maybe. 
Everyone stares at General Horn. After a pause, the General fires his pistol into the air. 
Iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the Shiites. 
GENERAL HORN Let's go, Doug. 
Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk 40 yards to the frozen Iraqi soldiers and the terrified Shiites. 
Archie, Troy, Doc in handcuffs with MPS, watch. 
Walter and the other U.S. Soldiers watch from afar as Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk into the midst of Iraqi soldiers. 
GENERAL HORN Who's in charge here? 
An OLDER IRAQI GENERAL steps forward and salutes. 
GENERAL HORN We have to talk about this situation. 
Archie, Troy, Doc, U.S. soldiers watch from a distance. 
ARCHIE'S POV FROM AFAR 
General Horn talks to the Iraqi general. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
U.S. Soldiers watch. 
TROY'S POV FROM AFAR 
General Horn and Captain Van Meter walk back toward them. 
It is QUIET. No one says anything. 
Pan across Paco taping. 
BILL SMITHSON In a morbid tableau these men have recovered some of the gold bullion stolen from Kuwait -- 
CATHY DAITCH --in violation of American policy, saved over a hundred Shiite refugees while recovering stolen Kuwaiti gold -- 
GENERAL HORN Turn that damn camera off. 
He walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, Van Meter pushes Cathy's camera down. 
BILL SMITHSON That's a 75 thousand dollar camera -- 
GENERAL HORN What the fuck are they doing here? 
SARGEANT I thought they were authorized -- 
GENERAL HORN They are not fucking authorized, for Christ's sake -- 
MPs take the tapes from the cameras. 
GENERAL HORN Haven't I taken care of you, dammit? 
He signals the choppers to start up. 
THE CHOPPER ENGINES SLOWLY WHINE into gear. 
CATHY DAITCH I'm gonna get that tape back. 
General Horn walks over to Troy, Archie, and Doc. 
GENERAL HORN You are under arrest. You are going to be court-martialed. And you will show us where the bullion is right now. 
He walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed. 
PAN TO Troy, Archie, Doc turn to the border and watch. Walter, the handcuffed Drivers, the MPS and other U.S. Soldiers also watch. 
The Shiites are released by the Iraqis. They collect themselves and gather in a group. The group walks over the border and is received by the relief workers. 
Troy, Archie, Doc watch. A U.S. Soldier WHISTLES through the loud choppers. 
SOLDIER #10 Yeah. 
Then another Soldier joins in, WHISTLING and CLAPPING. 
Then another soldier, until all twenty U.S. Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy, Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb. 
50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side, about to get into a Red Crescent bus. 
Imam and his daughter wave. 
Archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; Troy and Doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave. 
Freeze frame.

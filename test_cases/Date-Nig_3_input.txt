FADE IN: 
INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in. In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap. 
PHIL Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long, slow kiss. 
PHIL (CONT ' D ) Minty fresh. 
CLARA That was nice. 
PHIL It was nice. 
CLARA Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out? 
PHIL 
(CHUCKLES) Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's over! 
CLARA Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil. 
PHIL (reaches into picture pile) Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean that woman can't contain her 'Love! 
ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle deep in a manure bin. 
CLARA 
(LAUGHS) She just takes a while to warm up. You guys are gonna be best buddies. You picked a favorite of us yet? 
Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara. 
CLARA (CONT'D) That's exactly the one I picked! 
Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed. It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front of them. 
PHIL Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture. He notices. 
PHIL (CONT'D) 
WHAT IS 
CLARA I just... when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each other. Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze. 
CLARA (CONT'D) Let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us. No matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids- 
PHIL We're having kids? With an "S"? 
(CLARA LAUGHS) OK fine. But I promise you it's never gonna happen to us. 
CLARA Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when I'm long in the tooth. 
PHIL You'll be even hotter long toothed. Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy. 
CZ 
(GIGGLES Oh really? As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat. 
CLARA (CONT'D) Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures. 
PHIL wasn't the pictures. 
CLARA You know how long that took?

Sarah enters. 
SARAH 
(re the depo) You done with that yet? Elle hands the deposition over. 
ELLE 
Take it. I've read it twenty times. She grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading. Sarah lingers. 
SARAH 
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique. 
ELLE 
Too bad you and I are the only ones. 
SARAH 
I ' m still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi. Elle looks up, defensive. 
ELLE 
It's not my alibi to tell -- 
SARAH 
(interrupting) I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.          . 
ELLE 
(surprised) Really? Thanks. Sarah starts to go, then stops. 
(CONTINUED) 
SARAH 
y                   Have you ever noticed that Donovan never asks Warner to bring him coffee? He's asked me at least a dozen times. Elle shrugs. 
ELLE 
Men are helpless.     You know that. Sarah lingers, leaning on the edge of the couch. 
SARAH 
Warner can't even do his own laundry. 
ELLE 
I know.     He has it sent out. 
SARAH 
Did you know he got wait-listed when he appli ed? His father had to make a call. 
ELLE 
(stunned) You're kidding! A KNOCK sounds on the open door and Margot and Serena poke their heads in. 
MARGOT AND SERENA 
Surprise! 
ELLE 
Oh, my God!                       ' -. Sarah watches as Elle jumps up to hug the girls, who each have a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in their hands. 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(continuing) What're you doing here?! 
SERENA 
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night. 
MARGOT 
(tempting her) We have a limo downstairs and lots more of these. She wiggles her champagne bottle. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial. 
SERENA 
Where's Warner? 
SARAH 
(confused) At the office ~ Margot and Serena look over at her. 
MARGOT 
Oh, how sweet!        You made friends with a nerdy girl. 
ELLE 
Margot! 
SERENA 
Bring her, too. (to Sarah) C'mon. You can wear one of Elle's outfits. 
SARAH 
T ha t ' s okay -- 
MARGOT 
(to Elle) Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K-Mart. 
ELLE 
(torn) I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I --      promise. I really want to do a good job. Margot and Serena stare at her, realizing she means it. 
SERENA 
Okay. . . Call us if you change your mind. They start to head out. Margot hands Sa-rah the bottle of champagne. 
MARGOT 
Here. 
(CONTINUED) 
She spots The Rock on Sarah's finger and grabs her hand. 
MARGOT (CONT'D)

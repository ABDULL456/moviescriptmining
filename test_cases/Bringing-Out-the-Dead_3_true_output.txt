Walls escorts Cut Wrists into the back of the bus, pulls a plastic electric patch off the EKG monitor. Frank joins them. 
WALLS (CONT'D) Sir, I am going to give you some medicine that is still very experimental. It's from NASA, and although the astronauts have been using it for years, we are the first service to try it. I will put this patch on your forehead like this, and in about a minute you will have to relax. (places patch) You will forget all your suicidal feelings. It's very important that you wear this for a least twenty- four hours and keep checking the mirror. If the patch turns green you have to see the doctor immediately. The side effects could be fatal. 
Cut Wrists nods. 
FRANK This is the worst suicide attempt I've ever seen. You feel the pulse? Here. That's where you cut, and it's not across, it's down like so. (takes out his knife) Here take it. 
CUT WRISTS (shaking) I can't. 
FRANK With all the poor people of this city who wanted only to live and were viciously murdered, you have the nerve to sit here waiting to die and not go through with it. You make me sick. Take it. 
Cut Wrists bolts out of the back of the bus, trips as he hits the ground, runs down the street, turning the corner still holding the patch to his forehead. 
WALLS We cured him, Frank. When we work together there's nothing we can't fix.

CUT TO: 
INT. EL TORO DE ORO--NIGHT 
Frank smoking at a formica table, his walkie-talkie upright next to an ashtray. Walls returns with two espressos as the Dispatcher rattles on. 
WALLS (sits) Sounds like they're trying to clean up the bus terminal tonight, 
Frank doesn't answer. Tom shines his mini-flashlight in Frank's eyes: 
WALLS (CONT'D) Hello, hello. Major Tom to Frank, time to come home. 
Frank watches a hooker on the sidewalk. Two street punks dripping gold and attitude head the opposite direction: one turns his head, looks at Frank--it's Rose. The Rose face. 
Frank getting up, grabbing his walkie and coffee, heading out. 
WALLS (CONT'D) Where you going? 
FRANK C'mon, Tom. The city's burning. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOUSTON--NIGHT 
Frank at the wheel, driving high speed: radio full volume. 
WALLS Whatja doing? 
FRANK I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself. 
WALLS The brakes are shot. 
FRANK I've taken that into consideration. 
WALLS You okay? 
FRANK I never felt better in my life. 
DISPATCHER Sixteen XRay, XRay. 
FRANK (keys radio) X.

MAX (O.S.) And again. 
CLAY NO! 
MIG PILOT (O.S.) ...Fox Two. The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK proper. Burning, spinning... FALLING. Clay and Cougar, screaming by the time they reach the wreck... 
OMAR'S TEDDY BEAR, BLACKENING to a crisp. Clay tries to dive into the flames, but COUGAR DRAGS HIM BACK. No use, anyway... 
Nothing's alive inside. 
SLAM TO: 
INT. PAKISTAN - KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- DAY 
A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler: FENNEL What are you talking about "MAX?" 
CLAY He set up the Operation- 
FENNEL There was no operation! You were never radioed orders! 
CLAY I talked to him! 
FENNEL You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "MAX?" (PAUSE) Wait - are you saying you're Max? 
CLAY What? 
FENNEL Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue agent or operation- 
CLAY What are you talking- 
LARGE MAN (O.S.) There is no specific Max. 
The LARGE MAN finally steps out of the shadows. Special Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him. 
WADE "Max" is catch-all for exactly what you've been accused of. Terminology's been around since the 50's. 
Silence as the guys take this in. 
CLAY We didn't kill those kids, Wade. Wade studies him. Finally: 
WADE I believe you. 
Fennel sighs. 
FENNEL Stay here. We'll be back. 
They watch Wade and Fennel leave. Now alone. SILENCE. After a bit, Pooch looks down. Under a little table... 
POOCH Wade left his suitcase. 
It hits them all at the same time. 
ROQUE Ah, shit... 
They BOLT for the door. LOCKED. Run to the window. THREE FLOORS UP and it has BARS ON IT. 
CLAY (nodding to the case) Jensen? 
JENSEN I'm not good with bombs, man- 
CLAY I don't care--Roque, Pooch, get those bars off! 
Roque and Pooch - SWISS ARMY KNIVES OUT. PHILLIPS HEAD attachments, slotting them into the SCREWS that hold the barred WINDOW FRAME in place... 
Jensen POPS OPEN the briefcase. Wires and dials aplenty... 
JENSEN Oh, shit. Oh, shit... 
CLAY Time? 
First set of screws out, moving onto the second... 
JENSEN It's a remote detonator--enough for them to get clear, maybe ten MORE SECONDS- 
CLAY CAN YOU- 
JENSEN I told you, I'm not good with bombs! How are those bars coming? 
Second set out, moving onto the third and final.... 
POOCH Hurry...

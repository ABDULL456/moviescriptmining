APPLAUSE follows the song.  Phil gets up. 
PHIL Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make an announcement. 
FULL SHOT - CROWD 
Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement. 
PHIL It is my pleasure to identify the man who has been doing the chasing. I am him! - Or he! - Or it!  Anyway, Judy has caught me.  What I'm trying to say is, we're engaged. 
He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her.  He hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations. 
MED. SHOT - BOB 
He is flabbergasted. 
MED. SHOT - GROUP 
Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators. 
Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm. 
BETTY I hope you realize that you're getting he most wonderful girl in the world. 
Bob sees her emotion through the speech.  Betty notices Judy upset, shaking off the people around her and running through the doorway to the kitchen. 
Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE. 
MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN 
Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters. 
BETTY Darling, don't cry. 
JUDY (Turning to her) I didn't know he was going to make that announcement, I swear I didn't. 
Betty puts one arm around her. 
BETTY I know you didn't. 
JUDY He had no right to do that. 
BETTY You do love him, don't you? 
JUDY That doesn't matter. 
BETTY Nothing else matters. 
JUDY We're not going to break up our act. 
Phil enters the kitchen. 
PHIL I've been looking for you, Judy. 
BETTY Excuse me. 
She goes through the corridor toward the living room. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY 
In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few tears.  Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the corridor from the living room.

SHOOTING DRAFT 
INT. SUNNYVALE - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2002 
EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain. 
FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand. 
EVAN (as he writes) If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan didn't work and I'm already dead... 
He takes a deep breath. 
EVAN But if I can just go back to the beginning of all this, I still might be able to save her. 
Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - 1989 
In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. 
Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work. 
ANDREA Okay, okay... what now? 
Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench from the toolbox. 
EVAN We're gonna be late again. 
ANDREA When did you ever care about getting to school on time? 
EVAN We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night. 
Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt. 
EVAN Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy. 
ANDREA Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time. 
The carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with the wrench. 
ANDREA (re: carb) Darn it! 
EVAN Um... can dad come this time? 
ANDREA (getting impatient) You know the answer to that. 
EVAN Can't he come out for one day? 
ANDREA We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him. 
EVAN But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...

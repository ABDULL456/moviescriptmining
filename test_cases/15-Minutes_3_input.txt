LEON (CONT'D) Yeah? 
HAWKINS Paulie, you've got kids, right? 
PAULIE My kids don't talk to me anymore but they were great when they were young. 
LEON (into the phone) Sure it's him?  Great! (collapses the phone) Unique's home. 
They all rise from the table. 
EDDIE Paulie, I need the cure. 
PAULIE Step into my office. 
Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave. 
HAWKINS So you got your kids listening to Opera? You still singing in the church on the weekends? 
INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY 
Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg. 
SECONDARY OFFICER Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that. (to Emil) And what kind of work do you do? 
EMIL I am butcher. 
SECONDARY OFFICER You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for? 
EMIL You stuff sausage in it. 
SECONDARY OFFICER And what do you do with the bones? 
EMIL Dog food. 
Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport Control for their detainment. 
SECONDARY OFFICER Are you married? 
EMIL No.  Are you proposing? 
ANGLE UP 
through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us... 
INT. MENS ROOM 
Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror. 
EDDIE Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday? 
Leon enters.  Eddie turns. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I'm gonna propose. 
LEON When? 
EDDIE Tomorrow.  At lunch. 
LEON You ready? 
Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns. 
EDDIE The thrill of the hunt.  I love it. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY 
Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop action.  Each stands with an old suitcase. 
OLEG (in Russian) Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies! 
EMIL (in Czech) Don't speak Russian! 
OLEG (in Russian) Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? 
EMIL (in Czech) Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out! 
Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A videocamera's pointed out in the street. 
OLEG Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.

{"test1_input": "We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and menace. There's something odd about the way he moves, something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of true... \nThe Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level. \nHe senses something and turns to find Roach behind him. Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand. \nIn his palm, a MARBLE. \nLATER: \nRoach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium. \nRoach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks... \nThe Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard, perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to spread. It's BLOOD. \n67   EXT. LONDON - OFF LICENSE - DAY                              67 \nThrough the window we see Smiley buying a bottle. \n68   INT.

CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                   69 \nA large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden. \nSmiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over- grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked \"SACHS.\" \nGlancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking round the house. \nSMILEY'S P.O.V. \nA group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming to the song `Don't' by Doris. \nAn older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks into a charming smile. \nON SMILEY'S EXPRESSION \nThis is not a social call. Connie can't keep the disappointment from her face. \n70   INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    70 \nSmiley sits in the cluttered drawing room, a plate of scones in front of him. Connie appears carrying a tray of tea. \nSMILEY (Of the tea) Oh, I brought... \nHe takes the bottle of Scotch from his briefcase. \nCONNIE SACHS (eyeing it hungrily) Not supposed to. Doctor's orders. \nSmiley feigns surprise. Connie gives a little girl laugh. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) Wicked, wicked George. \nShe takes the teacup he pours with crooked arthritic fingers and drinks. They sit, both staring at the students in the garden, caught up in memories of their youth. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I miss it all so much. All my lovely boys. \nSmiley hesitates. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I don't know about you, George but I feel seriously under- fucked. \nThey look at each other a moment. Connie's smile fades. She looks at him almost sorrowfully. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) She doesn't deserve you, George. Not one hair on your head, never did... \n71   INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    71 \nSmiley and Connie sit in a dirty, disordered room, Connie on her way to being drunk. As she finishes her glass Smiley fills it. \nSMILEY You left the Circus shortly after I retired... \nCONNIE SACHS I didn't leave. I was dismissed. Chucked out on the rubbish heap. (Beat) Like you. \nSMILEY (Ignoring this) Why? \nShe shrugs, petulant, takes a drink. \nCONNIE SACHS \"Lost my sense of proportion.\" That's what that personnel cow said. Wouldn't let go of a bone. \nSMILEY Which bone? \nCONNIE SACHS Polyakov. \nSmiley nods, a look of boredom settling on his face - A SURE SIGN OF INTEREST. \n", "test1_true": "CONNIE SACHS Cultural Attach\u00e9 Polyakov. \nSMILEY Stationed where? \nCONNIE SACHS Here.

And that was that. \nSMILEY But you disagreed? \nCONNIE SACHS Pretty Polly? Very military bearing for someone who's never supposed to have been in the army. But, he was good. Went to Embassy functions, lectures. I love a man who lives his cover. Never put a foot wrong. \nSMILEY (Beat) Never? \nShe can't help but smile. \nCONNIE SACHS (As if summoning him) Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly... \n72   INT. CIRCUS - RESEARCH - EVENING - PAST                    72 \nConnie is working late. She sits in front of a Steenbeck flatbed editing table, she's chain-smoking, unkempt, but completely focused on the moving images on the screen. \nCONNIE SACHS (V.O.) ... the busiest culture vulture that Embassy ever had. \nOn the walls around her are framed STILLS from the footage she is watching: Russian Officials at ceremonies - each picture gridded, each official labelled as Connie manages to identify them. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) For years we'd been hearing rumours that Karla was building a private army of his own, outside Moscow Centre. We knew he had agents scattered round the globe. I started spending time with the Moscow gazers combing Soviet bulletins and any material I could get. \nON SCREEN - Ancient SOVIET VETERANS stand in rows displaying the medals on their chests. \nCONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Late one night in Research, I was trawling through some footage of May Day in Berlin, 1969. I saw something, George. \nConnie slows the images down, concentrating... OFFICIALS in suits are walking into their designated places. We see POLYAKOV amongst them. \nOne of the old SOVIET VETERANS, in dress uniform, a chest full of medals, possibly a touch senile, LOOKS at him. Just before he is obscured by another official we see what the old veteran does. \nHe salutes Polyakov. \nConnie's smile of triumph is reflected on the screen. She lights a cigarette. \nCONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D) I saw it, George. \nConnie rewinds the tape and we see the salute - backwards. And again - forwards. \nCONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Why would a distinguished soldier, four medals for gallantry, salute our cultural attache Polly? Unless Polly was a war veteran himself? And if he was, why hide the fact? \nFROM DOORWAY - Connie sits smoking her celebratory cigarette, at the centre of her obsession. \n72A   INT. CIRCUS - RESEARCH - EVENING                            72A \nConnie is showing the footage to Alleline and Esterhase. \nSMILEY (V.O.) What did you do? \nCONNIE SACHS (V.O.) I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline. I said - \"Polyakov is a Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw one. And if he's here it's because he's running a mole.\" \nSMILEY (V.O.) What did they say? \nAlleline switches off the image. \nPERCY ALLELINE (Hard) You're to leave Polyakov alone. You're becoming obsessed with him. \nHe glances at Esterhase and then back to Connie, eyes cold. \nPERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D) You're losing your sense of proportion, Connie. Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world. \n73    OMITTED                                                     73 \n74    OMITTED                                                     74 \n75    INT.

Old Circus is gone anyway, apart from Bill Haydon. Better off out of it. (Beat)I know you never liked him. \nSMILEY (Sharply) What nonsense. What on earth makes you say that? \nCONNIE SACHS (Surprised) I don't know. \nShe turns to the shoe box beside her, takes out a PHOTOGRAPH. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) Here we are.

She's teary and also a little excited that men are fighting over her. \nBELINDA Stop it! Stop it! \nKASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight escalating as others join in the struggle. \nKASPAR Keep your bloody hands off her! \nHe kicks at Guillam, who falls. Belinda gives a shriek of alarm. \nSCALPHUNTER Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt! \nGuillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face, turned to us, registers only relief.

Too much of this stuff. \nHe points to a drink on the table before him. \nJERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) (An old joke between them) Too much wampum not good for braves. How. \nSMILEY (Obliging) How. (Beat) I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you? \nWesterby looks at them both. \nJERRY WESTERBY Yes.

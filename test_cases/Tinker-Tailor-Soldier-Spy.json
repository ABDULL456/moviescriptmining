{"train": "TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY \nWritten by \nBridget O'Connor & Peter Straughan \n1   EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1 \nBudapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building. From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters, cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian. \n2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2 \nLATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX. \nACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket? \nA car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame. Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks over, shakes hands. \nNow we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked shirt, neither paying any attention to each other. \nJust as we are wondering if there is any connection, the two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction... \n3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3 \nShooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and head towards... \n4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4 \nA formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The ordinary world. \nWe find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the tables. \nMAGYAR (Hungarian, subtitled) And porkolts. You know porkolts? \nJIM PRIDEAUX (Hungarian, subtitled) Yes, I've had it. \nMAGYAR It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now. \nJIM PRIDEAUX Why's that? \nMAGYAR All the pigs have gone to Moscow. \nHe gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables around them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them. \nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the Waiter's face, drips onto the table top. \nThe Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile - \"nice service.\" Jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him. \nJIM PRIDEAUX When do I get to meet your friend? \nThe Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is ignoring his. \nMAGYAR I'll take you to him. Not eating? \nPrideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another man. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low - checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade. \nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears. \nPrideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in surprise. \nJIM PRIDEAUX Would you excuse me a moment? \nHe starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling. \nThe WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing in the cavernous space. \nThe shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in Russian. \nKGB MAN No firing! \nAhead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit. He looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out - this one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending him flying out of   frame. \nFrom around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB - strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian. \nKGB MAN (CONT'D) Who told you to fire? Who told you to fucking fire? \nTHE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything. \nIn the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight. \nHER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below. As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of blood. Then he's still. \nBELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to beat him. \nKGB MAN (CONT'D) Fucking Hungarian amateur! We wanted him alive! \nBehind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed. \nThrough the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He lights a cigarette. \n11   EXT. CIRCUS - DAY                                            11 \nCONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands. Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see that he is pained by this. \nControl puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd. \nTITLES OVER A MONTAGE \n12   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - AUTUMN DAY                             12 \nTHE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy. \nA MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through his retirement. \nHe takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through the water. \n13   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - DAY                                    13 \nSmiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than trembling bones. \nIs this his world now? \n14   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                              14 \nA MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and whiskey - engaged in the business of the world. \nShe pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination. \n15   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - WINTER DAY                             15 \nSmiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen. \n16   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    16 \nSmiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of Grimmelshausen. He turns a page, examines the illustration of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying to focus on it. \n16A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      16A \nSmiley lies in the double bed, a conspicuous empty space next to him. He leans over and turns the light out. \n17    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - ALLELINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT        17 \nA HAND removes files from the LARGE SAFE. \nON A BRIEFCASE - as the files - marked TOP SECRET - are slipped inside. \n18    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - EVENING                          18 \nP.O.V. MYSTERY MAN \n... TRACKING through the near-empty offices. All the drawers of the desks are OPEN. BINS on the tables. A few mothers working late, illuminated by their desk lamps. One of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving. She doesn't react as we track by. \n19    EXT. OPTICIANS - SPRING DAY                                  19 \nWe are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD. \nSmiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles. \n20    INT. OPTICIANS - DAY                                         20 \nSmiley is selecting frames from a display. He tries on a pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the pedantic ways of the retired. \n21    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - EVENING                   21 \nTRACKING with the BRIEFCASE as the mystery man walks towards the main entrance. The ELDERLY PORTER- BRYANT - nods respectfully. \n22    INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - EVENING                            22 \nA packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath the city. We track low level until we find our MYSTERY MAN, the BRIEFCASE clutched in his hand. \n23   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - EVENING                                   23 \nTracking with the BRIEFCASE as it is carried towards the house... \n24   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      24 \nAn elderly lady - MRS McCRAIG - stands at the sink. Through the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps towards the front door. Calmly she dries her hands as the doorbell rings and her DOG begins to bark furiously. \n25   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      25 \nMrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the stairs... \n26   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    26 \nSmiley adds a LETTER to a pile on the mantelpiece. We see the letters are all addressed to ANN SMILEY. \nHe straightens up, finds himself staring at a PAINTING on the wall - a muddy abstract. \n27   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      27 \nSmiley in his NEW GLASSES, towel rolled under his arm, walking down the street. He stops for a moment, feeling himself watched. \n36    EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                36 \nSmiley on the steps to his home, stops, examines the door, removing a WEDGE from the top of the door frame. \n37    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                37 \nSmiley walks into the hallway, stopping to pick up post. \n38    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                38 \nSmiley places the wedge and the letters on the mantelpiece, where a BUNDLE of LETTERS already sits, addressed to ANN SMILEY. Unopened. \n38A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING                     38A \nSmiley frying an egg. \nThere's a knock at the door. \n38B   INT./EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                          38B \nSmiley opens the door to PETER GUILLAM. \nSMILEY (Surprised) Hello, Peter. \nThey stare at each other. Smiley takes in his expression - this is not a social call. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) Have I time to change? \nGuillam nods, following Smiley into the house. He glances at a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened letters. \n39    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                39 \nGuillam enters the kitchen, notes the single place set for dinner. It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's privacy. \nSmiley appears in a coat behind him, taking in Guillam's awkwardness. He gives a thin smile. \nSMILEY Are we going far? \n39A   INT. GUILLAM'S CAR - EVENING                               39A \nSmiley and Guillam sit in silence, as Guillam drives through London. It's a Citroen DS, all sleek leather and mahogany interior. \n40    OMITTED                                                      40 \n40A   INT. LACON'S HOUSE - EVENING                               40A \nCLOSE UP ON: \nA half eaten bacon SANDWICH, sitting on a table. \nWe pan up and through the open window see an anxious Lacon is leading Guillam towards the house. Smiley follows, talking to Lacon's daughter. \nLACON How's your mother? \nPETER GUILLAM Very well. (referring to the window) Is this where he got out? \nLACON Mmm, I came back in and it was wide open. (beat) Do send her my love. Apologies for singling you out, but... very sensitive matter... \nHe gives an uncomfortable bark of laughter. \nLACON (CONT'D) If one can't trust one's own nephew... You know who he was? \nPETER GUILLAM Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention. \nLACON Why is he on the wanted list? \nPETER GUILLAM (beat) He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since then. \nIf possible, Lacon looks even more shaken. \nLACON My God. In my own home... my family... The bloody animals you people employ! \n41   INT. LACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 41 \nPULLING OLIVER LACON as he leads Smiley and Guillam down the hall, gesturing for his WIFE to take Jackie away. He attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained. \nLACON And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies? \nSMILEY Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you. \nThey reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano framed by vast glass windows. A tall, well built young man - FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the terrace beyond. \nBehind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the room and slips behind the sofa. \nLACON Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on. \nSMILEY Very well. (Beat) Very bonny... \n47   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - DAY                                       47 \nA shabby rooming house, near Paddington station. \n48   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       48 \nA large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. TWO single beds, a large leather CHAIR, a WIRELESS. \nSmiley's new landlady MRS POPE GRAHAM is supervising a gormless teenager - NORMAN - who is struggling into the room with a rickety card table. Mendel and Guillam take it from him and set it into the room. From the next room comes the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex. \nMRS POPE GRAHAM (re the table) It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend it to you but since Mister Mendel recommends you... \nShe gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a little to drown out the excesses from the room next door. \nMRS POPE GRAHAM (CONT'D) You will love it for me won't you? It belonged to Mister Pope- Graham. \nShe glances at Smiley who has his back to her looking out into the London street. \nSMILEY'S P.O.V. \n... looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents sign which reads THE WIDE WORLD. \nMENDEL (O.S.) My friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope- Graham, no disturbances. \nMRS POPE GRAHAM And that's what he shall have. You want anything you can ask Norman, can't he, Norman? \nAnd they leave. A small silence... \nMENDEL Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of class. \nGuillam gives a grunt of amusement. \nMENDEL (CONT'D) Best informant I ever had. \nLATER: \nSmiley has turned his attention to the bed. He examines the stained sheets with distaste. As he speaks he strips off the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his bag. \nSMILEY Control lived with his sister didn't he? \nHe straightens up from the bed, smooths the pristine sheet. \nMendel flips his notebook back. He's already there. \nMENDEL Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West London. \nGUILLAM We should... \nMendel flicks another page. \nMENDEL ... Webb and Bryson are the letting agents. Properties in half of the west end judging by this list... \nLATER: \nGuillam is lying on the bed. Smiley stands at the window, Mendel slumped in an armchair. \nSMILEY We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year. \nMENDEL (Reading from the list) A Miss Hilliard. L. Cavaleri? D Weaver, M Crowley, M Cushing. F. Farling. G. Hiaasen. (MORE) \nMENDEL (CONT'D) A Mrs Hawcombe. R. Kee. M. Kass. H Staunton... \nCLOSE on Smiley as his eyes flickers at the name. \nMENDEL (CONT'D) K. Menzies... \nSMILEY How long was H. Staunton a tenant? \nMENDEL (Consulting the list) Still is. Been renting for a few years now. Something? \nSMILEY (Musing) Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy- four. \n49   EXT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   49 \nGuillam and Smiley approach outside a red-brick mansion block of flats in West London. \n50   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - HALLWAY - DAY                         50 \nSmiley and Guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the building. Smiley studies the door. He runs his fingers over the door-frame and there it is - a little WEDGE at the top. \n51   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   51 \nGuillam, followed by Smiley, pushes in against a mound of dead mail. \nThey advance cautiously into the dirty flat, the windows fogged out with Windowlene. \nTHEIR P.O.V. - TRACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR \nGuillam has reached the DOOR and disappears into the room beyond... \nWe're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and menace. There's something odd about the way he moves, something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of true... \nThe Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level. \nHe senses something and turns to find Roach behind him. Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand. \nIn his palm, a MARBLE. \nLATER: \nRoach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium. \nRoach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks... \nThe Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard, perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to spread. It's BLOOD. \n67   EXT. LONDON - OFF LICENSE - DAY                              67 \nThrough the window we see Smiley buying a bottle. \n68   INT. LONDON - PADDINGTON TRAIN STATION - DAY                68 \nSmiley stands at a ticket kiosk. \nSMILEY Return to Oxford please. \n69   EXT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                   69 \nA large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden. \nSmiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over- grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked \"SACHS.\" \nGlancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking round the house. \nSMILEY'S P.O.V. \nA group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming to the song `Don't' by Doris. \nAn older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks into a charming smile. \nON SMILEY'S EXPRESSION \nThis is not a social call. Connie can't keep the disappointment from her face. \n70   INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    70 \nSmiley sits in the cluttered drawing room, a plate of scones in front of him. Connie appears carrying a tray of tea. \nSMILEY (Of the tea) Oh, I brought... \nHe takes the bottle of Scotch from his briefcase. \nCONNIE SACHS (eyeing it hungrily) Not supposed to. Doctor's orders. \nSmiley feigns surprise. Connie gives a little girl laugh. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) Wicked, wicked George. \nShe takes the teacup he pours with crooked arthritic fingers and drinks. They sit, both staring at the students in the garden, caught up in memories of their youth. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I miss it all so much. All my lovely boys. \nSmiley hesitates. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I don't know about you, George but I feel seriously under- fucked. \nThey look at each other a moment. Connie's smile fades. She looks at him almost sorrowfully. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) She doesn't deserve you, George. Not one hair on your head, never did... \n71   INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    71 \nSmiley and Connie sit in a dirty, disordered room, Connie on her way to being drunk. As she finishes her glass Smiley fills it. \nSMILEY You left the Circus shortly after I retired... \nCONNIE SACHS I didn't leave. I was dismissed. Chucked out on the rubbish heap. (Beat) Like you. \nSMILEY (Ignoring this) Why? \nShe shrugs, petulant, takes a drink. \nCONNIE SACHS \"Lost my sense of proportion.\" That's what that personnel cow said. Wouldn't let go of a bone. \nSMILEY Which bone? \nCONNIE SACHS Polyakov. \nSmiley nods, a look of boredom settling on his face - A SURE SIGN OF INTEREST. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) There's Control himself, you behind him, as usual... \nA younger bespectacled Smiley, lost amongst his more glamorous colleagues. She traces other faces with a crooked finger. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) (Fondly) Jim Prideaux... and Bill Haydon. Together of course. The Inseparables. All my boys. That was a good time, George. \nSMILEY (Chiding) It was the war, Connie. \nCONNIE SACHS A real war. Englishmen could be proud then. \nShe stares at the photograph with a sad smile. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I was right, then? About Polyakov. There's a mole? \nSmiley doesn't answer, stands up to go. \nCONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were. \n76   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                      76 \nThe house we saw in the title sequence. The air duct opens on the front of the house, spilling out its star-shape of light. \nAfter a moment Polyakov walks up to the door and knocks. We hear the dog barking... \n77   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       77 \nMrs McCraig opens the door for him and he passes her with a smile, heading upstairs. \nWe TRACK with Mrs McCraig as she walks back to her pantry, opens a cupboard to reveal a huge reel to reel TAPE RECORDER. With ancient fingers she presses down the clunky record button and the spools begin to revolve. \nPOLYAKOV (O.S.) (In Russian) ... The Priest is surprised to see General Secretary Krushchev... \n78   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                       78 \nAs we saw it in the titles. The Mystery Man sits at the table holding up pages of a document for Polyakov who is photographing them as he talks, the camera giving a satisfying CLICK and WHIR with each shot. \nPOLYAKOV ... He says \"Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls.\" The Priest says \"That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary...\" \nHIGH ANGLE - the dusty candelabra above their heads, and the tint MICROPHONE, nestled beside one of the bulbs. \nPOLYAKOV (CONT'D) \"... why are you telling me?\" \n79   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       79 \n... spools churning silently. \nPOLYAKOV (O.S.) ... Krushchev says \"I'm seventy- seven, I'm telling everyone.\" \nWe hear his chuckle and the continued CLICK WHIR of the camera. \n80   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     80 \nSmiley sits at his desk staring at the CHESS SET laid out before him. One of the pieces has had the photograph of POLYAKOV added to it. \nHe begins to register the faint noises around him... Pigeons on the ledge outside the window, the television mast creaking on the roof above him... \nHe hears footsteps approaching down the corridor and stop outside his room. He crosses to the door and opens it and finds CONTROL waiting for him. \nCONTROL Step into my lair. \nAnd in an instant we are in... \n81   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - PAST                  81 \nControl is at the HEAD OF THE TABLE. Ranged against him are PERCY ALLELINE, ROY BLAND and TOBY ESTERHASE- all a little nervous. BILL HAYDON sits to the side, feet up. Smiley joins them without his spectacles. Control throws him a FILE. \nCONTROL (To Smiley) Sit down and take a look at this nonsense. \nSmiley sits down and begins to read. \nCONTROL (CONT'D) Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on. \nSMILEY (Engrossed) Where did you get it? \nCONTROL I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it. \nTOBY ESTERHASE (Protesting \"cabal\") Control... \nCONTROL Shut up, Esterhase. \nControl waves him down. Smiley considers the report dispassionately. \nSMILEY If it's genuine it's gold-dust. (Beat) But its topicality makes it suspect. \nControl turns to Alleline, with a mocking smile. \nCONTROL Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake. \nSMILEY Where does it come from? What's the access? \nHe takes another sip of tea, gazes at Mendel thoughtfully. \n84   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELDS - DAY                 84 \nPrideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One - SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others. \n85   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      85 \nA fire burns in the little grate. \nROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again. \nPrideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy - SPIKELY. \nPRIDEAUX Hand those out. \nHe crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL... \nBehind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk like a HUNCHBACK. \nThe class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn, continues writing. \nThen from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound. A little soot falls... \nThe sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the fire... what is that noise? \nThen, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird swoops towards his face. \nThen... \n... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself, NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it. \nThe boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE. \n86   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             86 \nRoach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker. \nPRIDEAUX (After a moment) Come down here. \nFrightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him. Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a little. \nPRIDEAUX (CONT'D) (Identifying him) Boy with the marble. \nROACH Yes sir. \nPRIDEAUX Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name? \nBILL ROACH Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new boy. \nPRIDEAUX New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story? \nRoach hesitates. \nBILL ROACH (Blushing) My mother and father... my father's left, so... \nHe doesn't know how to explain his misery any further. Prideaux pretends not to notice. \nPRIDEAUX Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that? \nBILL ROACH No sir. \nPRIDEAUX Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at? \nRoach tries desperately to think of something. \nBILL ROACH Nothing sir. \nThe boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down, busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt. \nPRIDEAUX You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right? \nBILL ROACH (Gratefully) Yes sir. \nPrideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach. \nPRIDEAUX Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here. \nRoach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to him, rubbing his aching shoulder. \n87   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    87 \nSmiley walks up to the steps of his home, stops, examining the door, his absent-minded air hardening into something more ALERT. He scans the step and stoops to pick something up. A WEDGE. \n88   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    88 \nSmiley walks into the hallway senses alert. He pads towards the drawing room, wipes sweat from his hands on his trousers, steels himself. Is it finally Them, come for him? He walks in and finds... \n89   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    89 \nHER P.O.V. - \nRICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look. \nA moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else, anger at her humiliation being observed. \n94    EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        94 \nRICKI TARR'S P.O.V. \nAs Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed. \n94A   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                      94A \nRICKI'S P.O.V. \nRicki watches the street below as Boris, Sergei and Ivan exit the hotel, head for a night out. \nTarr pulls on his own jacket, grabs his knife. \n95    OMITTED                                                      95 \n96    EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT                                        96 \nIRINA'S P.O.V. - Her husband and the Minders are heading for a row of gaudy nightclubs. And someway behind him, Ricki Tarr, trailing. \nShe exhales a breath on the glass. \n96A   EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                         96A \nTarr approaches the night club, glancing around quickly before slipping inside. \n97    INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                           97 \nRicki Tarr enters. He scans the room for Boris, spotting Tufty Thesinger at a table. He crosses towards him, watching as Boris and the two minders are entertained by the clubs hostesses. \nBoris calls for more drinks, clutching a bundle of currency. \nTUFTY THESINGER (grinning) This is going to be a long night. \nRICKI TARR You baby-sit this one. \nRicki walks towards us. \n98    INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        98 \nIrina answers the door and finds Ricki Tarr outside. \nRICKI TARR Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. (Beat) Just wanted to check you were alright. \nShe stares at him. \nRICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was something about her. \n99    OMITTED                                                      99 \n100   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY - PRESENT                         100 \nTarr exhales smoke. Smiley studies him. \nSMILEY You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London? \nRICKI TARR Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her. \nSMILEY Sense what? \nRICKI TARR A secret. \n101   INT. ISTANBUL - GARAGE - DAY - PAST                         101 \nRicki Tarr is talking to a man. A sports car lies under a sheet. The deal concluded, the man pulls back the sheet to reveal the car. \n102   EXT. ISTANBUL - DOCKS - DAY                                 102 \nIrina is driving, exhilarated, free. Ricki Tarr is on the back seat, sleeping. \n103    INT. ISTANBUL - WORKERS CANTEEN - DAY                       103 \nA workers canteen on the Bosphorus. Tarr and Irina sit drinking wine, talking. \nRICKI TARR (V.O.) I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it... \nTarr gently traces a bruise on Irina's arm. \nRICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D) But second date she made this open play... \nWe see a growing attraction between them. \nIrina and Tarr laughing, flirting. They move closer to one another. \nSMILEY And what did your message say, Ricki? \nRICKI TARR Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect. \nSMILEY What else? \nTarr looks at him. For the first time there's something else behind his smile. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something. \nRICKI TARR I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself. \nSMILEY Yes. I quite see that. \nRICKI TARR I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus. \nSMILEY (O.S) And what else? \nRICKI TARR That she had information concerning a Double Agent. \nHe colours. \nRICKI TARR (CONT'D) I was just trying to... to get the proper attention. (Beat) And I told them to tell Mister Guillam that this was the reason I hadn't come home, not because I'd defected or anything. \nSMILEY What happened next Ricki? \nRICKI TARR I waited for a reply. \n112   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - NIGHT - PAST         112 \nA tense Tarr sits waiting for a reply. It's dark outside. Thesinger is asleep at his desk. The TICKER MACHINE begins to rattle into life. Tarr jumps to it. \nTarr begins to decode the in-coming message on a one-time pad. \nINSERT - \"We read you\" \nRICKI TARR (V.O.) I waited hours but that was all they sent. It didn't make sense. Like they were stalling. \n113   EXT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                    113 \nTarr stands staring across at Irina's hotel balcony with binoculars. \n114   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                       114 \nBORIS stands looking straight at him. The hint of a mocking smile. Behind him we can just see SERGEI and IVAN sitting in the room. \n115   INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                       115 \nBoris turns from the balcony, exhaling smoke from a cigarette, the faint smile still on his lips. He looks up, his expression CHANGING. \n116   EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEYWAY - DAWN                             116 \nTarr bolts down an alleyway. \n117   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY                  117 \nThe door is ajar... a radio is playing LOUD POP MUSIC. Tarr pauses on the threshold, senses alert. He takes out his KNIFE. \n118   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY                  118 \nA fan stirs the dusty air. Tarr walks in and stops. Tufty lies on the floor, in a pool of blood. He's been tortured, one eye gouged out. The other manages to convey a rather touching amazement at the violence worked on him. His throat has been slit wide open. Tarr absorbs this, looks at the knife in his own hand, turns and runs. \n119   INT. ISTANBUL - WORKERS CANTEEN - DAY                       119 \nA desperate Tarr hurries towards a phone. \n120   INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - DAY                         120 \nP.O.V. - BATHROOM THROUGH THE HALF-OPEN DOOR - \nIrina enters the hotel room. She stops a moment, afraid. Then she looks towards us. \nBATHROOM \nIrina is backing out of the room. We catch a glimpse of the BUTCHERED REMAINS of BORIS hanging from the shower rail, a garroting wire around his neck. He's been tortured, the shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood. \nShe BACKS AWAY across the room to the door, leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the pale carpet. \nShe turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE. \nHer P.O.V. - two men, TINY DISTORTED FIGURES walking down the corridor towards her. \nThe phone starts to RING. Irina glances at it, knowing it's too late for her. \nSPY-HOLE - The TWO FIGURES loom closer. \n121   INT. ISTANBUL - PORT AUTHORITY - DAY                        121 \nP.O.V. - Crowds of people throng the busy port. \nJANITOR ALWYN Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, I think, regarding your car. \nGuillam walks over to the counter, the stolen file hugged to his chest. \nA LOCKED BOX on a trolley is wheeled towards him and is opened to reveal the OUTSIDE LINE TELEPHONE. \nPETER GUILLAM (into the phone) Hello? (Beat) Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair? \n138   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           138 \nMendel is using the office phone, an ELDERLY GERMAN MECHANIC, stands outside guarding the office door. In the background a POP TUNE is playing on the radio. \nMENDEL Can't be done sir, you're going to need a new gear box. \n139   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          139 \nOn Guillam... \nPETER GUILLAM At least get on to the main dealers first... \n140   INT. CIRCUS - MONITOR ROOM - DAY                          140 \nOne of the Mothers is listening routinely in on the call, TAPE SPOOLS revolving, recording the conversation. The POP TUNE plays, insidiously working its way into her head. She idly taps her pen along to the tune. \nPETER GUILLAM (O.S.) Have you got the number? \n141   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          141 \nPETER GUILLAM Well, hold on... \nHe cups his hand over the mouthpiece... \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) ... Alwyn? Chuck me the bag a minute, will you? \nAlwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him. \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) Thanks. \nAlwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it with the one against his chest. He takes an address book from the bag and finds a number. \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) (Into phone) 946-0335. OK? Thanks. \nHe hangs up, hands the bag back to Alwyn and steps back into... \n142   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          142 \nGuillam retraces his steps, placing his dummy file in the pink stack, replacing the one he placed there in its original shelf, remembering to take the green slip from the bracket. It's done. \nGuillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs it and puts it on its spike. Guillam turns. \nTOBY ESTERHASE is standing in front of him. Unfriendly eyes. \nTOBY ESTERHASE Could we see you Peter? \nFor a second Guillam can't speak. \nTOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D) Percy would like quite an urgent word with you. Can you come now to the fifth floor? That would be so kind. \nPETER GUILLAM Of course. \nEsterhase turns and Guillam, mind whirring, follows him back out through the counter. \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) (to Alwyn, inspired) You might just throw that into the lift for me, mark it for the second floor, save me filling out more bloody chits? \nJANITOR ALWYN Will do sir. \n143   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - OUTSIDE ALLELINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Mothers sit over their typewriters as Guillam and Esterhase walk through into the anteroom. \nPERCY ALLELINE (O.S.) (shouting from the other room) Esterhase, I'll have no phone calls, tell them... \nTOBY ESTERHASE The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies... \nMOTHER (Muttering) We can hear. \nToby holds the door open for Guillam. \nTOBY ESTERHASE We are having a conference. \n144   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         144 \nAlleline sits in the baronial chair, Bland at his left. Haydon on his right. Esterhase trots over to his seat. Guillam takes in the REPORT they all seem to have spread out in front of them. \nPERCY ALLELINE (Reading) Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally? \nGuillam, affecting ease, leans against the wall. \nPERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D) What are you getting up to down there these days, apart from chasing our virgins... \nPETER GUILLAM (To Smiley) He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds! \nHe pulls the LOG BOOK out of his file. \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) (To Tarr) I stole that, because of you! I spied on my own. Do you know how that makes me feel? \nSmiley holds out his hand for the log book. \nSMILEY As you did take the trouble to steal it... \nGuillam hands him the book and Smiley leafs through the pages. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information? \nTarr sits up, wiping blood from his mouth. \nRICKI TARR (Sullenly) S'right. \nSMILEY What was the date? \nTarr hesitates, considering. \nPETER GUILLAM He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing... \nRICKI TARR November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening. \nSmiley has found the right month. He flicks through the dated pages - 18th November, 19th November... \nHe holds up the book - the next page has been cut out. \nSMILEY November 20th is missing. (Beat) Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence? \nGuillam looks thrown. \nPETER GUILLAM What about the money? \nSMILEY Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him. \nGuillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some writing on the next page. \nPETER GUILLAM (Reading) \"Enquiries to the fifth floor.\" \nSmiley takes the book again, examines the note. \nSMILEY You recognize that handwriting? (Beat) That's Toby Esterhase. \n149   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - EVENING                                  149 \nSmiley and Guillam pull up in front of the hotel. They sit, in weary silence, staring up at the unprepossessing building. \nPETER GUILLAM Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr? \nSmiley looks at him. Guillam reads the look correctly. \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) In case I didn't make it out of the Circus... \nSMILEY Secrecy is a habit. \nGuillam rubs his eyes. \nPETER GUILLAM I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done. \nSmiley nods. Doesn't move. \n150   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                    150 \nThe two men are finishing off a bottle of Scotch. Unusually, Smiley is drunk - a result of the alcohol and the lack of sleep. \nGuillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the PHOTOGRAPHS of the four suspects Smiley has pinned on his chessmen. \nPETER GUILLAM I'm sorry. \nSMILEY What for? \nPETER GUILLAM I wanted to believe Tarr was lying. (Beat) All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it. \nSmiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this is affecting him. \nSMILEY (Beat) I met him once. Karla. (MORE) \nSMILEY (CONT'D) In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them. \nGuillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die. \nSmiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of the Delhi cell onto their present surroundings. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there... \nPRIDEAUX (Quietly) Got your specs on Jumbo? \nROACH Yes, sir. \nPRIDEAUX Who's the fellow down there? \nRoach stares at the stranger eagerly. \nROACH (Disappointed) Don't know sir. \nPRIDEAUX Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way? (MORE) \nPRIDEAUX (CONT'D) Wouldn't you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field? Doesn't he like boys? Anyone sees him again, let me know. Don't hold with odd bods hanging about. Might steal the Alvis, which is...? \nCLASS (By rote) Best car in England! \nThey dissolve into laughter, but Roach is still anxiously watching Prideaux, noting how his expression has darkened. \n153   OMITTED                                                     153 \n154   INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - POOL TABLE - DAY               154 \nBelinda, the deb we met earlier, is doing up her blouse. She's teary and also a little excited that men are fighting over her. \nBELINDA Stop it! Stop it! \nKASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight escalating as others join in the struggle. \nKASPAR Keep your bloody hands off her! \nHe kicks at Guillam, who falls. Belinda gives a shriek of alarm. \nSCALPHUNTER Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt! \nGuillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face, turned to us, registers only relief. Job done. \n155   EXT. CASINO - DAY                                           155 \nBright morning sunshine. Smiley and Guillam walk up concrete steps of a casino building - very modern, imposing. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Haven't seen many of the boys and girls for a while, matter of fact. \n156   INT. CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - DAY                           156 \nSmiley, Guillam and the genial JERRY WESTERBY are sat at a blackjack table. The casino is empty, a cleaner vacuums in the background. \nJERRY WESTERBY But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff. \nHe points to a drink on the table before him. \nJERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) (An old joke between them) Too much wampum not good for braves. How. \nSMILEY (Obliging) How. (Beat) I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you? \nWesterby looks at them both. \nJERRY WESTERBY Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only him. \n157   INT. CIRCUS - EVENING - PAST                               157 \nWesterby walks down the corridor. We pass OFFICES - drawers pulled open, waste paper bins standing on desks - the end of day ritual. \n158   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                   158 \nWesterby is following a horse race on the radio. A dirty plate in front of him. He drinks from a can of beer. \n159   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                    159 \nWesterby is asleep. The Circus is deathly quiet, nothing stirring. Then... \nA PHONE BEGINS TO RING. \n160   INT. CIRCUS - CONTROL'S OFFICE - NIGHT                      160 \nControl sits surrounded by files. A dim green lamp on his desk the only illumination. He looks ill, tense with waiting. Cigarette stubs piled in the ashtray. \nHe listens to the solitary PHONE below him in the building. Then it is joined by a SECOND. Then a THIRD... \nControl listens, nerves stretched to their limit. From just outside - the sound of someone running up the wooden staircase. A knock. \nJERRY WESTERBY (Entering) Been a bit of a panic, sir. \nControl raises his head. \nJERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) From the FO resident clerk... A Hungarian news bulletin, sir. (Reading) British spy, work-name Ellis, travelling with false Hungarian papers, has attempted to kidnap an unnamed Hungarian general in Budapest. He's been shot, other arrests imminent... \nControl stares at him, stands unsteadily, begins to put on his coat. \nJERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) Can I have a brief, please? Sir? Do you want me to deny it? \nSmiley is distant... \nSMILEY The Saville. \nPETER GUILLAM At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running. \nGuillam sits, mind racing. \nPETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) So how did he know? Oh Jesus, George... \nSMILEY Peter... \nPETER GUILLAM Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known? \nSMILEY It's not him, Peter. \nPETER GUILLAM Then how did he know? \nSMILEY (gently) Because he was at my house that night. With Ann. \nGuillam doesn't know what to say. They sit in a hideously awkward silence. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) (of the Hamburger) I quite like this. \n167A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST            167A \nThe phone on the nightstand starts to ring. A woman's hand reaches into frame and picks it up. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello? (beat) Oh hello Jerry. No I'm afraid George isn't back yet. \nIn the bed beside her we see Bill Haydon. \n168    EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                 168 \nA black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other, chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to move. \nAn impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of passenger outrage. \nWe see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead. \nWe follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street, driving towards the house where we met Polyakov. \n169    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  169 \nSmiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the surface, dips in, breaks the surface... \n170    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  170 \nSmiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings to the edge of the platform for a moment. \nOLD MAN Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are... \nHe swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley, watched and alone. \n171   OMITTED                                                     171 \n172   OMITTED                                                     172 \n173   OMITTED                                                     173 \n174   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   174 \nSmiley walks into his hallway, picks up the MAIL piled on the floor. He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at the mail. \nThe door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love- making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel. \nSmiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to look up. \nHe pushes open the door and moves into... \n175   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   175 \n... which is EMPTY. He sits in an armchair, starts opening some letters. \nA FIGURE walks past Smiley abruptly. Smiley doesn't look up. \nBILL HAYDON (O.S.) Good flight? \nSmiley looks up. \nBILL HAYDON sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and trousers, SOCKS, NO SHOES. He sips a cup of tea. No sense of having been caught in an act of adultery. \n176   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY - PAST                            176 \nBACK ON SMILEY \n... who is now wearing a raincoat and we realise we are in fractured memories of... \nTHE PAST \nSomething in his manner alerts Prideaux. \nPRIDEAUX What else? \nCONTROL (Beat) Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus. \nPrideaux's face doesn't change, but he's wondering if the rumours could be true and Control really has gone mad. \nCONTROL (CONT'D) There's a rotten apple Jim and we have to find it. \nLaboriously he leans forward to the CHESS SET. \nCONTROL (CONT'D) I'm   so close I can almost feel his   heart beating. I know it's one   of five men. All I want from you   is one word. \nHe points to the PHOTOGRAPH of PERCY ALLELINE. \nCONTROL (CONT'D) Alleline - Tinker. (Points at the next photo) Haydon - Tailor. Bland - Soldier. We drop Sailor, it's too close to Tailor. (Pointing at next photo) Esterhase - Poorman. \n182   INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - NIGHT - PRESENT                      182 \nPrideaux sits with his visitor - Smiley -      recalling the meeting. He's drinking vodka. \nSMILEY Which means I was...? \nPRIDEAUX You were Beggarman. \nSmiley nods. Just a flicker of the eyes shows us that this is painful for him to hear. \nSMILEY What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory? \nPRIDEAUX (Stiff) I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor... madness. \nSmiley is watching him intently - sure he's hiding something. \nSMILEY But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why? \nPrideaux doesn't answer. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be? \nPrideaux shoots him a dangerous look. \nPRIDEAUX (Hard) I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty. \n183   INT. BUDAPEST - TRAIN STATION - DAY - PAST                  183 \nPrideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform towards us. He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing - BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES. \nPrideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg. \n184   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                               184 \nThe scene from the opening of the film. The Waiter puts down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor around him... \nHIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the surveillance agents don't have time to change. \nPrideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO: \nThe SHOT - \n... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as we CUT TO: \nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. \nThose shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is crying, an ambulance siren is wailing. \nHands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting ambulance. \n185   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                               185 \nWe are slid into the back of the ambulance as though into the drawers of a morgue. And snap to BLACK. \n186   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - DAY                           186 \nWe are looking at the back of Prideaux's head, hair damp with sweat, shoulders trembling. \nWe PULL OUT and find Prideaux, a filthy dressing covering the wound on his back. The cell he is in has filthy, heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone. Lights blaze down... \nSMILEY (V.O.) What did you tell them? \n187   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAY                       187 \nPrideaux, in too much pain to walk, is being dragged down a brightly lit corridor towards an INTERROGATION ROOM at the far end. \nHe is taken inside, the door closed behind him. \nPRIDEAUX (V.O.) Everything. \n188   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT         188 \nEsterhase leaving the Circus, Bryant politely wishing him good night. \n208    EXT.

Click.... \nTOBY ESTERHASE And Roy... \n212   EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                  212 \nEsterhase can't tear his eyes away from the propeller plane descending onto the runway ahead of them. \nTOBY ESTERHASE Things aren't always what they seem. You know that George. Moscow thinks Polyakov's working for them, so, every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them, just chicken-feed, keep his bosses happy. But Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big operation... \nSMILEY Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know. \nEsterhase stops, turns to look at Smiley. \nTOBY ESTERHASE Why are we here? Why are we...? \nGuillam gives him a sudden VIOLENT SHOVE in the back. Esterhase straightens himself, runs a palm through his hair, real fear on his face now. \nTOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D) I don't... I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this George! \nSMILEY Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor? \nTOBY ESTERHASE Bland! \nSMILEY To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby? \nTOBY ESTERHASE Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who. \nSMILEY You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft? \nEsterhase flinches again. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is.(Beat) He's Karla. \nEsterhase turns to look at them in horror. Guillam pushes him again. The plane has taxied to a halt ahead of them. Unmarked. Something sinister about it. \n213   OMITTED                                                     213 \n214   INT.

SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DAY                        215 \nPolyakov is photographing... nothing. The table in front of him is empty, the shooting just a pantomime for the microphone above. As he continues to shoot we see the Mystery man sitting across the table from him. He takes out a canister of developed film and passes it to Polyakov. \nSMILEY (V.O.) One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels. \n216   EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                     216 \n... standing on the airfield. \nTOBY ESTERHASE I didn't know.

LONDON - TAILOR'S SHOP NEAR CIRCUS - NIGHT            225 \nA dark workroom. WE TRACK through a crowd of TAILORS DUMMIES. \nSome of the dummies are draped in clothes, some just shapes in the darkness. As though we are moving through A ROOM FULL OF SPIES. \nBy a great domed window, occasionally washed with yellow from the traffic outside, we find MENDEL, his back to us staring out. \nMENDEL'S P.O.V. - THE CIRCUS ACROSS THE ROAD. \nA taxi pulls up a few yards away from the circus doors. We see a man clamber out. It's Percy Alleline. \nMENDEL (into phone) Tinker... \n226   INT. SAFE HOUSE - LISTENING ROOM - NIGHT                    226 \nSmiley sits on an armchair, lit by a harsh over-head light. \nSMILEY (into phone) How's he look? \nMENDEL (O.S.) Busy. \nSmiley puts the receiver on the arm of the chair, takes off his shoes and in his stocking feet crosses the room. As he does so he spools out a WASHING LINE, tying it to the far door knob. \n227   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                          227 \nGuillam, waits on the tow-path looking back at the house. \nSomeone, presumably Smiley, is moving through the house, turning the lights off until it is in complete darkness. \nMENDEL (O.S.) Tailor... \nA torch light flashes once from a downstairs window. \nMENDEL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Here comes Soldier... \n228   INT.

PARIS - CYPHER ROOM - NIGHT                            229 \nThe three men stand over the silent cypher machine. Tarr's gun rammed into his belt. Tarr is almost glittering with nerves. Then the machine clatters into life. \nRICKI TARR Read it aloud. \nBen starts to read, his high, rather imperious schoolboy voice carries over the next few shots... \nBEN Personal for Tarr from Alleline... \n230   INT.

Don't trust a fucking one of them. \n233   INT.

Mister Smiley... \nSmiley walks towards one of the huts, stops as Alleline walks out. Alleline, a broken man, can barely look at him. With a nod he walks on. \n244   EXT. SARRATT - NISSAN HUT - DAY                            244 \nAn unshaven, exhausted Haydon stands outside the Sarratt building in a small fenced enclosure. We see Smiley walking towards him. He's brought a box of cigarettes. \n245   INT. SARRATT - DAY                                         245 \nHaydon is weeping quietly but without emotion. Smiley offers Haydon the box of Cigarettes. \nSMILEY I was assured there would be no coercion. \nHaydon waves it away. Smiley hands him a clean handkerchief. \nBILL HAYDON It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow. \nHe weeps again. \nBILL HAYDON (CONT'D) I rather hoped you would do a little light house-keeping for me. \nSMILEY If I can. \nBILL HAYDON There's a girl...Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here. \nSMILEY Of course. \nBILL HAYDON There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund. \nSMILEY I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux. \nBILL HAYDON Damn it! I got him back, didn't I? \nSMILEY Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. (Beat) I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you? \nNo response. Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission? \nBILL HAYDON Yes, as a matter of fact he did. \nSMILEY To say what? \nHaydon stares at him. For the first time the tears seem real. Guilt and grief. He looks down. A long pause. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) (almost to himself) To warn you. Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along. \nBILL HAYDON So did you. \nHaydon stares out, lost in thought. \nBILL HAYDON (CONT'D) I had to pick a side George. It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has grown so very ugly, don't you think? \nSmiley doesn't answer. A moment of silence. \nSMILEY Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus? \nFor a moment Haydon looks rattled. \nBILL HAYDON I'm not his bloody office boy. \nSMILEY What are you then? \nHaydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur. \nBILL HAYDON I'm someone who made his mark. \nSmiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his eyes. Haydon lights a cigarette. \nSMILEY (Quietly) Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann? \nFor a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled. \nBILL HAYDON Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot. (MORE) \nBILL HAYDON (CONT'D) He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover you wouldn't be able to see me straight. And he was right, up to a point. \nSMILEY Up to a point. \n246   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   246 \nThe flat is now empty, cleared of Control's possessions. Smiley looks around, places a CHESS PIECE on the piano. We see the piece bears the name HAYDON. \nSMILEY (Quietly) \"Tailor.\" \nHe walks away. \n247   EXT.

He works his way around the desk, finds Guillam crouched down, his back to him. \nKASPAR (Suspicious) Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing... whatever you were doing...? \nGuillam straightens up to reveal his hand oozing blood from a cut. \nPETER GUILLAM Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you? \nKaspar busies himself with the first-aid. Eyes hard. \n60   INT. CIRCUS - LIFTS - DAY                                   60 \nGuillam has just stepped into the lift. Roy Bland appears suddenly and steps in beside him. \nSilence for a moment as they descend... \nROY BLAND (without looking at him) Heard you had an accident. \nGuillam makes a mental note against Kaspar. \nPETER GUILLAM Cut it on a drawer handle. (Beat) When are we going to get some new furniture round here? \nROY BLAND I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor. \nThey arrive on the ground floor. Bland walks out ahead. Guillam exhales with relief. Then... \nROY BLAND (CONT'D) (as he walks away) Where are you off to? \nPETER GUILLAM Lunch. \nROY BLAND Want some company? \n61   INT.

Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time. \nPETER GUILLAM What does? \nROY BLAND Loyalty. \nHe takes a pull of his pint. \nROY BLAND (CONT'D) If it was up to me, I'd replace them all with those `naice' girls from registry. Like to hear a few high heels about the place. \nHe reaches suddenly for Guillam's coat, lying on the seat - his hand heading for the pocket that holds the SUBMINIATURE CAMERA. \nROY BLAND (CONT'D) Scrounge a fag? \nPETER GUILLAM (Quickly) Here. \nHe pushes his cigarettes into Bland's hand before he can fish in the coat. Bland smokes for a moment. \nROY BLAND (Suddenly) What do you think of Datsuns? \nPETER GUILLAM What? \nROY BLAND Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself \"Who's that old fucker?\" \nHe stares at Guillam with faint smile, but his eyes are cold and watchful. \nROY BLAND (CONT'D) What are you driving? \nPETER GUILLAM Citroen. \nROY BLAND French? Ooh la la... \nHe continues to stare at Guillam with the faint smile, and Guillam feels a sickening wave of paranoia. \nROY BLAND (CONT'D) Drink up and I'll drop you back. You've probably got some girl waiting... \n62    INT. GUILLAM'S FLAT - NIGHT                                  62 \nGuillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper. After a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The two sit in domestic contentment, reading. \n62A   EXT.

That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out. \nSmiley considers this, turns back to the CHESS SET.

Lacon's wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost offended at the role he finds himself playing. \nSMILEY I know that car. \nLACON On our way to La Boh\u00e8me. The Minister wondered if there was anything to report? \nSMILEY Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs.

Perhaps that's what we have to become? A little paranoid? \nHe turns back to the chess board. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) (To Lacon) Your \"clean sweep.\" What if the Mole was actually behind that sweep? What if each of us, whether we knew it or not, represented a threat to the Mole? \nLacon looks at a pile of files, distractedly picks one up. He starts to leaf through one... \nLACON (Unconvinced) Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest... that poor chap...? \nHe looks to Guillam for the name. \nPETER GUILLAM Jim Prideaux. \nSmiley nods thoughtfully. \nSMILEY Yes. Yes, he did. \nHe writes PRIDEAUX on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess piece. Lacon picks up another file, Something catches his eye: a letter head of FLAMES. He looks up shocked. \nLACON How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material. \nHe grabs the piece of paper, stuffing it in his pocket. \nSmiley looks at him.

HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                    63A \nLacon stalks out of the hotel. \nSMILEY (V.O.) ... Alleline's \"special source.\" \nLACON (V.O.) There is no connection. \nHe climbs into the waiting car. We catch a glimpse of the MINISTER in the back. \nSMILEY (V.O.) Everything is connected. \nThe car drives away. \n64    INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      64 \nA third-rate English preparatory school. The string orchestra practice - rows of twelve-year old boys sawing away at their instruments. A teacher winces as he hacks at the air above their heads with a ruler. \nNear the back of the class we find BILL ROACH. He's plump, asthmatic, the last to be chosen for everything. He looks out of the window. \n65   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - DAY                                  65 \nRoach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the window pane. As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the window - driving past. \nRoach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL. \n66   EXT.

She puts a CROWN- SHAPED party hat from the cracker onto Alleline's head. He brushes it off, anxious not to appear the fool. \nPERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D) (Muttering) For God's sake Mary... \nBILL HAYDON, wearing a crown from the cracker at a rakish angle, appears in the nick of time, leads Alleline's wife out for a dance, teasing the sullenness from her. They're good dancers. Alleline relieved, crisis averted. \n129A   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT                    129A \nWe find Smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly drunk deb. Control raises his arm above the melee. He's still at the punch bowl. \nCONTROL Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it out. \nSMILEY (grateful to get away from the deb) I'll go find her. \nSmiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - \"The Second Worst Spy in the World.\" They link Smiley to them for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segues into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily, many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing with vigour. \nSmiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced by the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier. \nHis P.O.V. - \n- One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter, pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopelessly outweighed, but competitive to the finish. \n- ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty debs as she dances by. A mother takes Smiley by the hand and leads him briefly into the dance. Smiley takes a turn with her, and extricates himself. Still smiling... \n130    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - CORRIDOR - NIGHT          130 \n... he walks down a dark corridor, the noise of the party fading away behind him. \nHe stops seeing something in the shadows of an office. For a moment he doesn't understand what he's seen. \nREVERSE \nTwo shapes locked in an embrace. \nSmiley stands, nakedly absorbing the body blow. Then he turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party. \n131   EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY - PRESENT                        131 \nSmiley and Guillam sit on a bench. Smiley has his towel, hair wet from his swim. \nPETER GUILLAM You look tired. \nSmiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but an instinct for secrecy wins out. \nSMILEY Yes. I didn't sleep well. (Beat) I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. (Beat) If you have the slightest reservation... \nPETER GUILLAM Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation? \nSMILEY If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone. \nGuillam nods. He gets up and walks quickly away. After a moment a MAN rises from a nearby bench and saunters over. It's Mendel. \nMENDEL You're clean. Nothing on your back. Nothing on your conscience. \n132   EXT. CIRCUS - MORNING                                       132 \nA LORRY roars past, wiping frame and revealing Guillam arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. He springs up the four steps. \n133   INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                      133 \nGuillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby. The security guard, Bryant, steps from his box. Beyond him is the row of lifts. \nBRYANT Mister Guillam? How's the family? \nPETER GUILLAM Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry today. \nBRYANT Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag sir. \nBryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling open the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the bag. \nGuillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly slowly. As Bryant's head disappears... \nPETER GUILLAM Time you oiled this thing, isn't it? \nBRYANT (O.S.) We keep asking... \nGuillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the first time we realize how NERVOUS he is. \nPolished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR. \nGuillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he stops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms. \nPETER GUILLAM You're kidding? \nJANITOR PETE New rules. \n", "test2_true": "PETER GUILLAM Mind the jewels. \nJANITOR PETE Pen and watch sir. \nHe holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen and watch. \nThe search over Guillam sets off down the corridor, unnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind. \nBILL HAYDON (O.S.) What the hell are you doing up here? \nGuillam freezes. Then he turns. It's Bill Haydon standing in a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles. A moment. \nPETER GUILLAM You don't look pleased to see me, Bill? \nBILL HAYDON Why would I be? You bloody pariah. \nThen Bill grins, the grin transforming his face. Guillam smiles back, relief mixing with real warmth. \nBILL HAYDON (CONT'D) We like the Scalp-hunters to know their place. On the second floor. \nPETER GUILLAM Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse. \nBILL HAYDON Heard it was quiet down there. \nPETER GUILLAM As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do? \nBILL HAYDON Haven't you heard? Technology's the future. No need for you apes anymore. I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing. \nPETER GUILLAM Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse. \nThey've reached the end of the corridor. Haydon peels away, a hand raised in farewell. \n134   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                           134 \nGuillam arrives at a counter which serves to block entry to the vast archive of files beyond. A Janitor appears in the entrance. He pushes a book towards Guillam to sign. \nJANITOR ALWYN (re: Guillam's bag) Want me to look after that for you, Mister Guillam? \nPETER GUILLAM Thanks... \nJANITOR ALWYN Gotta give you a chit. The Dolphin'll kill me if I don't. New Rules. \nPETER GUILLAM So, chit me. \nThe Janitor grins, slaps a chit on the bag, raises the counter and Guillam enters. \n135   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                            135 \nA few researchers sit amongst stacks of files. Guillam is filling out requisition slips. Behind the desk, a woman - SAL - watches him. \nSAL What you up to this weekend? \nPETER GUILLAM (rakish) Visiting aunts. \nSAL I'll bet. \nShe takes the flimsy's from the back of the slips and posts them into her desk. \nSAL (CONT'D) Corridor D. \nShe hands him back the top copies. \nSAL (CONT'D) The two-eights are halfway on your right, the three-ones are next alcove down. \n136   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           136 \nMendel sits in his car, watching the garage fore-court. He looks at his watch. \n137   INT. CIRCUS - ARCHIVE - DAY                                 137 \nThe LIFT CAGE we saw earlier is being raised from the floor by a Janitor at the winch. Another janitor is removing files from it. \nRadiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files that make up the reading room. \nWe find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the fluorescent number cards. He takes a file out, leaving his green slip in the brackets provided by each file. Guillam looks across at his real objective... \nA row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the archived DUTY OFFICER'S LOG-BOOKS, spines bearing the year and month they cover. \nAnd in his way - a GIRL perched on a ladder, a MAN mending a radiator. The Man turns round and stares straight at Guillam. Suddenly he POINTS STRAIGHT AT HIM. For a moment Guillam freezes, unnerved. Then he glances over his shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another WORKMAN behind him. \nAbruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it, keeping the title close to his chest. He goes back to his desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead. \nHe sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting... From somewhere nearby comes the sound of a PHONE RINGING, then being answered. Moments later... \nJANITOR ALWYN (To Guillam) Telephone sir. \nPETER GUILLAM (as though distracted) Oh to hell, who is it? \n", "test3_input": "193   EXT.

An unfortunate... \nREVERSE - we see Guillam and Smiley are sitting in the parked car in the rain. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor. \nPETER GUILLAM Who? \nSMILEY Toby Esterhase. \n194   EXT. SARRATT - DAY - PAST                                  194 \n... Prideaux stands watching a small, dapper figure crossing the grounds towards him - TOBY ESTERHASE. A man who's come up in the world. \n195   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - GUILLAM'S CAR - NIGHT - PRESENT         195 \nSMILEY He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it. \nGuillam stares at him, ALERT. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about \"Tinker, Tailor?\" \n196   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                   196 \nSmiley gets out of the car, into the rain. Looks around him, uneasy. \nPETER GUILLAM You alright? \nSMILEY Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had. \nPETER GUILLAM Yes, George. I'll watch. \nGuillam watches as Smiley heads off into the gloom. \n197   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                   197 \nSmiley stares at the CHESS BOARD - a complex pattern of related figures. \nHe turns back to the tape-deck, puts the headphones on, presses play: \nSMILEY (O.S.) (Over headphones) What exactly did Irina say? \nRICKI TARR (Over headphones) She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla. \nSmiley presses STOP. He presses RE-WIND, watches the tape spool BACKWARDS. He goes too far, presses FAST-FORWARD, watches the tape REVERSE DIRECTION. And, at this moment, we can tell from his expression, a piece of the jig-saw falls into place. \n198   OMITTED                                                  198 \n199   INT. MINISTERIAL MEETING ROOM - DAY                      199 \nLacon and Smiley are meeting with the MINISTER. \nMINISTER This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear? \nSMILEY Perfectly, Minister. (Beat) There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house. \nMINISTER I don't know what you're talking about. \nSmiley stares at him. \nMINISTER (CONT'D (CONT'D) I don't know the address. And I fail to see the... I thought Lacon had made it clear to you, keep your nose bloody-well out of Witchcraft's business! \nSMILEY (Calmly) It's Lacon's advice I'm following. (To Lacon) You told me to follow in Control's footsteps. \nMINISTER (Snapping) Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race. \nSMILEY I'm glad you take some of the credit. \nLacon glances sharply at Smiley - there's something different about him, his tone... \nSMILEY (CONT'D) The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla. \nHe has the Minister's full attention now. A long silence. \nMINISTER That's... that's not possible. \nSMILEY Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that. \nMINISTER (Appalled) Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold! \nSMILEY Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in. \n", "test3_true": "MINISTER Oh God... We can't be made to look like fucking fools again! Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this? \nLACON Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a threat... \nMINISTER Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their fuck-ups! \nIn their panic, both men are addressing each other, momentarily forgetting Smiley. \nSMILEY (Suddenly) We are not the prize. We're the bait. \nThey turn to him. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the \"gold\" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that? \nLacon and the Minister stare at Smiley. \nMINISTER What can we do? \nSMILEY We have one thing the Mole wants. \n200   OMITTED                                               200 \n201   INT.

I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you lot... \nHe looks at Smiley, then he gives Guillam a knowing look, as though deliberately provoking him. \nGuillam absorbs the slur but his eyes are hard. \nRICKI TARR (CONT'D) We're gonna live in Paris out of your hair. You'll get her back? \nAgain a flash of the coldness in Smiley. \nSMILEY (Beat) I'll do my utmost, Ricki. \n202   INT./EXT.

LONDON STREETS - GUILLAM'S CAR - DAY                   203 \nGuillam is driving. The radio is on. The car pulls up on the roadside and two people climb in the back. It's Smiley and Fawn. Guillam speeds off. \nNobody speaks. Esterhase sits stiff, mind-whirring, uncomfortably aware of Fawn's unsettling presence behind him. \n204   EXT.

Toby starts to turn, but... \nSMILEY (O.S.) Keep walking please. \nToby stumbles on. \nSMILEY (CONT'D) I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master? \nFaintly we hear the low drone of an approaching engine. Esterhase scans the horizon, locks on the black speck in the sky - an aircraft flying towards them. Esterhase watches the approach with mounting anxiety. \nTOBY ESTERHASE What... what's this about George? \nSMILEY It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby. \n205   INT.

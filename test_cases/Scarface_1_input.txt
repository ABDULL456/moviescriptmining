Bey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira! He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in the flick of an eye. 
TONY ...the fuck was #at? 
You didn't see it?   You weren't looking.  Hey you gotta watch for it. Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head peeking out of a nest iin his teeth, then it's gone. TONY What the hell's that for -- eating bugs?  That's disgustin'. 
You think so hunh? Well you don't When know shit 'bout chicks Chico. they see this, they know. They go crazy.   They don't resist me. Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window. 
(doing it again) Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it.... TONY Oooh...cono!   How 'bout that one? Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue. 
No problem.

MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY                                                               27-B Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking .out his arm and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit. TONY Come     on? Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a car screeching to a halt in front of him. 
TONY (points) Okay Rober Retfor,               strut your stuff. The    blonde    has     paused    to     look    in   a    shop    window. 
Manny stops alongside, pretends to                          look.    When he catches her eyes, he flicks his tongue. 
She looks at him, confused, then back into the window. Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

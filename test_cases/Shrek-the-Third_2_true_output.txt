FIONA Yes Daddy? 
KING HAROLD I know I've made many mistakes with you. 
FIONA It's okay. 
KING HAROLD But your love for Shrek has taught me so much. 
Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek. 
KING HAROLD My dear boy, I am proud to call you my son. 
SHREK And I'm proud to call you my Frog... King Dad in-law. 
Shrek smiles. 
KING HAROLD Now, there is a matter of business to attend tooo... 
The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops. They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat. 
PUSS The Frog King is dead. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 16. 
Fiona starts crying. The King suddenly wakes up, coughing. 
DONKEY (TO PUSS) Put your hat back on, fool. 
KING HAROLD Shrek, please come hither. 
Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King. 
SHREK Yeah, Dad? 
KING HAROLD This Kingdom needs a new king. You and Fiona are next in line for the throne. 
SHREK Ooo. Next in line. Now you see Dad, that's why people love you. Even on your deathbed you're still making jokes. 
The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in closer. 
SHREK Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King? I don't think that's such a good idea. There's got to be somebody else. Anybody? 
KING HAROLD Aside from you there is only one remaining heir. 
Shrek brightens. 
SHREK Really!? Who is he, Dad? 
KING HAROLD His name is... is... is... 
SHREK What's his name? What's his name? 
KING HAROLD ...is ... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 17. 
Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate. 
FIONA Daddy! 
The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies away. 
Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame. A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on. 
KING HAROLD (chewing the fly) His name is Arthur. 
SHREK Arthur? 
KING HAROLD (COUGH) I know you'll do what's... (EXHALING) riiiight... 
He succumbs. The King really is dead now. 
QUEEN Harold!? 
SHREK Dad? Dad? Dad? 
Donkey bows his head. 
DONKEY Do your thing, man. 
Puss takes his hat off. 
Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock. 
We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey to let the King's passing sink in.

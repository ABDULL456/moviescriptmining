Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13). 
SIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD 
--jumps on stage. 
pg. 15 
POLE This play has been declared seditious and illegal by Lord William Cecil! 
The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil. 
POLE (CONT'D) All are herewith ordered to disperse immediately! 
A GROUNDLING Why don't you disperse William Cecil's arse! 
POLE Arrest that man! 
IN OXFORD'S BOX 
SOUTHAMPTON Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's then? 
He gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in the real drama below as everyone hurries from the theater. 
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Edward? 
Oxford turns to him, distracted, and nods. 
ON STAGE 
Jonson pushes his way on stage. 
JONSON (to Pole) Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy for god's sake! There's nothing seditious about-- 
POLE Oi, is that right, is it?    And you know this because? 
JONSON Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And- 
POLE Arrest him as well! 
Jonson is grabbed by guards. 
pg. 16 
17   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        17 
Jonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind him. 
JONSON (to the door) A pox on you! (beat) And your carbuncled father! 
Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen or so other prisoners. 
ESSEX (O.S.) People taxed to the point of starvation, Spain running the New World, open revolt in Ireland, Catholic plots everywhere you turn... 
CUT TO: 
18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18 
Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will learn, very ambitious. 
ESSEX ...and how do the Cecils spend their time and energy? Shutting a theater! A theater, for god's sake? It's madness! No wonder the mob hates them so! 
The court is inside, and slightly different from today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat like racquet-ball. 
Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot, but it goes-- 
OXFORD Out! 
Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton prepares to serve. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) (to Southampton) Henry, how many people were at that play? 
pg. 17 
Southampton pauses before serving. 
SOUTHAMPTON Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand, maybe more. 
Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated rally begins. 
OXFORD And how many performances are there of a play like that? 
SOUTHAMPTON Five or six I suppose. 
He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it. 
ESSEX By the--! 
OXFORD (to Essex) So! Ten thousand souls. All listening to the writings of one man-- the ideas of one man. That's power, Robert. And if there is one thing the Cecils understand, it's power. 
ESSEX (snorts) And when did words ever win a kingdom? I think I'll keep my sword, thank you very much. 
Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naivet√©. 
19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19 
Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two valets. 
ESSEX (to the valets) Leave us. (they exit) Henry... Some of my men have... intercepted... some of William Cecil's recent correspondence with King James of Scotland... 
pg. 18 
Southampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is serious. 
ESSEX (CONT'D) Cecil's all but promising him the throne... 
SOUTHAMPTON To James?   Elizabeth would never agree to- 
ESSEX Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even recognize me. And yet, still she refuses to name an heir. 
SOUTHAMPTON But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne?

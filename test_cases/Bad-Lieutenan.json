{"test1_input": "LT What's going on? \nFIRST COP They raped a nun and tore up the church -- they even took a crap on the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem. \nSECOND COP She was only seventeen... \nA COP opens his TRUNK -- he has a BAR inside. The COPS, including LT, respond enthusiastically. DRINK UP. \nFIRST COP Who the fuck could do this?! \nOLD IRISH COP The young nun's just a kid from Ireland. Imagine having to come here to have that happen! \nSECOND COP Jesus... What's she gonna tell her mother? \nOLD IRISH COP I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers. \nThe COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or beside the CARS. \nLT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the motto: \"He who defines himself, confines himself.\" \nTHIRD COP The Church already put up a $50,000 reward! \nFIRST COP Well, one of us is gonna get it. I mean -- get them. \nThe FIRST COP raises a TOAST. \nFIRST COP Here's to payback for the nuns! \nThe COPS all whoop and cheer. \nSECOND COP Anyone got any leads, at all? \nFIRST COP We got shit to go on. Only that list of inventory -- what they stole from the church. \nTHIRD COP Y'know they actually stole those wacky purple robes? And they took the chalice -- with the Host still inside! \nSECOND COP What did they want with the Host? \nTHIRD COP They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't want to hock the Host, they wanted to hock that golden chalice. \nCOPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one shares information, each after the reward for himself. \nLT bursts out, swings into high gear. \nLT Leave it to the Catholic Church, man. Girls get raped everyday, and now they're gonna pay 50 G just because these chicks wore penguin suits! \nSome of the COPS laugh, others are offended. \n", "test1_true": "LT The Church is a racket. \nOLD IRISH COP So what. Are you a Catholic? \nLT Sure! \nOLD IRISH COP Do you believe in God? \nLT doesn't reply. He's thinking. \nThe BET COP and a couple of OTHER, FAMILIAR GAMBLER COPS move in. They've got nothing on their minds but the World Series. \nBET COP (to LT) To Hell with this God stuff. How's that Strawberry? He does what ever you want him to, huh Lieutenant? Even strike out! (beat) I bet you won a shitload on Oakland. How much, huh? \nLT comes down off the CAR HOOD. Now he has to feign pride in his supposed big bet on OAKLAND. \nLT has to convince the COPS to keep betting -- he can't afford to pay them all off. Unfortunately, the COPS all think LT just scored big, himself. \nLT More than you did. \nGAMBLER COP TWO Well, let's see some green! \nLT If you know what's good for you, you'll keep staying on Oakland! \nBET COP Oakland? Is that how you're going? \nLT nods \"yes.\" An outright lie. \nLT Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The series has gotta last seven games. The last two did, didn't they? It's a racket. Do you have any idea how much money they make selling television-time for commercials during the series? Especially if it's a New York team? They won't close the gold mine after only four games. It'll last a full seven. Too many people wanna milk it for what it's worth. You'll see! \nBET COP All right... I'm in. After all, you're the expert. Ain't that right, LT? \nSEVERAL COPS, including some of the COPS who have been hanging out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND. LT takes their BET MONEY -- $900. \nOne COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays him off. \nLT You'll be sorry, man. But if you wanna be a sissy, here's your bread. \nLT sits back on top of his CAR, DRINKING heavily. He toasts STRAWBERRY. The others are uneasy. Why toast STRAWBERRY? \nCOP ONE Strawberry? I thought we were going with Oakland. \nLT We are, man! That's the point! If the Mets win, it's thanks to Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it's thanks to Strawberry. Nothing can happen out there on the field that don't gotta do with Strawberry. So here's to Strawberry! \nThe others join in the TOAST, but are uneasy. \n", "test1_id": 2247, "test2_input": "LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION -- what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head. \nThe NUN does penance.

His FACE is visible, floating above the writhing crowd. \nLT pursues him. Finally catches him. \nThey mime the deal.

Julio and Paolo brought it in, (beat) You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?

(beat) Have you ever had days like that? Yeah, you have, so now you understand where I'm coming from. (beat) Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ? \nThe STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all it was about? No problem. \nSTREET DEALER They were at that abandoned building last night. Second floor. They're probably still there now. It's next to the old Convent. Downtown a ways.

The whole city has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person in the street. \nWorst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are definitely LOSING. \nLT drags himself onward. \nCUT TO: \nEXT INT: EVENING - THE CRACKHOUSE \nLT busts in. Fires shots, collars the KIDS.

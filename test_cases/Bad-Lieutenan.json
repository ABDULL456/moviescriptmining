{"train": "LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of COPS greet him; LT keeps walking. \nThe BET COP digs his attitude. \nBET COP But hey -- we make the best of it, man, don't we? Huh? How about them Mets! \nFOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays parked for the duration of their meeting. \nCUT TO: \nINT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR (PARKED) - QUEENS \nNow that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is exchanged. \nNow LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to bet against the Mets. \nLT No fucking way they're gonna do it in four games straight. \nCOP ONE You serious, man? I wanna go Mets all the way! \nLT Go ahead, man.If you've got shit for brains. But if you wanna win the bucks, go with Oakland. \nCOP TWO I thought Strawberry was gonna -- \nLT I know that nigger like he's my brother. He ain't gonna let us off so easy. He'll make us sweat first. This game's going to Oakland. Not a doubt in my mind, man. \nSilence. The COPS think about it for a moment. \nBET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks to LT, his fawning posture is obvious. \nBET COP I'm in. Here. \nCOP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND. \nThe COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care of a lot of action and has these guy's faith. \nLT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP and the OTHER COPS remain inside. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET & 3RD AVENUE \nLT pulls up alone beside a PHONE BOOTH and phones in the COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend -- and a hustler just like himself. \nLT shouts into the PHONE and holds it close to his ear. The TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and irritating. \nLT (into the phone) I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the \nLT What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you? \nJC The rich kind. (shakes his head) Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide. \nLT Fuck you. (takes a deep hit) Just give me back a little something for the road. \nLT takes a handful of the COKE and puts it in a DOLLAR BILL; pockets it. \nJC See you in a coupla days. Have the cash ready. \nJC splits, runs up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \nINT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM \nReligious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy apartment. \nHowever, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 that ARIANE quotes as her rent. \nARIANE is LT's mistress. \nBOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's around a lot. \nBOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES. \nARIANE Got something good for us? \nLT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY sloppily partakes. \nBefore LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching. \nARIANE I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant! \nLT Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! \nARIANE It's nothing. This is New York, man... (beat) Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money! \nANGLE - BOWTAY on the COUCH. It's obvious that she's going nowhere. And fast. \nARIANE We've been rehearsing a new monologue. From Shad's Saint Joan, you know? Bowtay does it wonderfully well. \nLT breaks out more COKE and some GRASS. \nLT All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff. \nARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It happens to be appropriate for the scene. \nEXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI \nLT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET COKES. \nA display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the sidewalk. \nLT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT picks up his pace. \nCloser now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. \nA SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET. \nLT gets an idea. He takes command. \nLT (to Cop) What's going on? \nThe UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie. \nCOP Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner says they stole cash from the register. He was chasing them down the block when I caught up with them. \nThe KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same time -- \nThe TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy. \nYOUNG BLACK KID We didn't do nothing, man ! \nLT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KID'S FACE. It's shockingly loud. \nLT Shut the fuck up! \nLT turns to the UNIFORMED COP. \nLT (to Cop) Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And make sure it's fucking cold. (indicates the situation at hand) I'll straighten this out. \nThe UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes. \nLT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. \nLT turns to the OWNER. \nLT How much did they take? \nKOREAN OWNER Five hundred dollars cash. \nThe TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence. \nYOUNG BLACK KID We didn't -- \nCUT TO: \nINT: DAWN - ARIANE'S APARTMENT \nBOWTAY is curled up on the floor, asleep. \nARIANE is busy with a GOBLET, some TIN FOIL and other esoteric stuff. \nLT comes through the door with the SIX-PACK of DIET COKES and the SIX-PACK of BUDWEISER. \nHe puts them down, takes a BEER for himself. ARIANE doesn't turn around. She's busy preparing drugs. \nARIANE I got you a present. Better shit then you got, cop! \nLT comes and looks over her shoulder. He sees -- \nA PILE of BROWN HEROIN on a TIN FOIL SHEET. ARIANE is preparing the implements for \"chasing the dragon.\" \nBOWTAY rolls over, sprawls on the floor in an even sexier position. \nOn her face, an expression of utter bliss. \nLT abandons the BEER. \nLT Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in -- \nARIANE Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant... \nARIANE helps LT with the thin, TIN FOIL PIPE. She burns the SMACK on the TIN FOIL SHEET for him so that he can manage to inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time. \nHe gets a nice, deep hit. \nARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own. \nThey are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT. \nARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit. \nThis time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT drinks it. \nLT is very high now. A meditative, hallucinatory state. \nARIANE takes a DIET COKE and lies down on the BED. \nShe slowly sips soda through a straw. Her eyes are closed. \nLT sits in an EASY CHAIR by the WINDOW. \nTWINS (shrug - in unison) It's 7-0: Oakland. (single Twin) That nigger could have let it drop and gone home. \nLT curses and stomps around. The TWINS mimic his every move. All three are pissed. The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind. \nCUT TO: \nINT: EVENING - LT'S CAR \nLT is furious. He COKES UP. DRINKS heavily. \nTired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911. There is a call for an uptown MURDER SCENE. \nHARD CUT TO: \nEXT: NIGHT - 153RD/MARTIN LUTHER KING - CRIME SCENE \nCU - A YOUNG BLACK DEALER, eyes open, shot dead. \nLT drives up, sizes up the scene. It's fresh territory. He'll milk it for what it's worth. \nLT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE. He knows some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines. \nHe heads straight for them. \nLT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall TRANSVESTITE. He takes her aside. \nLT Hey, Veronica baby, looking good! What's going down? \nLT slips a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL into VERONICA'S well-filled BRA. \nVERONICA (confidentially - to LT) Willie got shot by one of his boys. (giggles) But there's a ki under the back seat. \nLT I'll put it in my trunk. \nLT saunters up to the MURDER CAR, DEAD WILLIE still in the front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he can't show it. LT susses out the situation. \nAround him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no apparent avail. \nLT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR and begin his own investigation. \nTIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are distracted. \nLT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges from the MURDER CAR. \nOutside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he -- DROPS the BAG of COKE! \nLT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS. \nLT What's going on? \nFIRST COP They raped a nun and tore up the church -- they even took a crap on the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem. \nSECOND COP She was only seventeen... \nA COP opens his TRUNK -- he has a BAR inside. The COPS, including LT, respond enthusiastically. DRINK UP. \nFIRST COP Who the fuck could do this?! \nOLD IRISH COP The young nun's just a kid from Ireland. Imagine having to come here to have that happen! \nSECOND COP Jesus... What's she gonna tell her mother? \nOLD IRISH COP I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers. \nThe COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or beside the CARS. \nLT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the motto: \"He who defines himself, confines himself.\" \nTHIRD COP The Church already put up a $50,000 reward! \nFIRST COP Well, one of us is gonna get it. I mean -- get them. \nThe FIRST COP raises a TOAST. \nFIRST COP Here's to payback for the nuns! \nThe COPS all whoop and cheer. \nSECOND COP Anyone got any leads, at all? \nFIRST COP We got shit to go on. Only that list of inventory -- what they stole from the church. \nTHIRD COP Y'know they actually stole those wacky purple robes? And they took the chalice -- with the Host still inside! \nSECOND COP What did they want with the Host? \nTHIRD COP They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't want to hock the Host, they wanted to hock that golden chalice. \nCOPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one shares information, each after the reward for himself. \nLT bursts out, swings into high gear. \nLT Leave it to the Catholic Church, man. Girls get raped everyday, and now they're gonna pay 50 G just because these chicks wore penguin suits! \nSome of the COPS laugh, others are offended. \nCUT TO: \nINT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR THE NUN \nThe HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges; shows his BADGE to the GUARDS. \nHe wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN. \nA sexy NURSE stops him. \nNURSE Can I help you? \nLT can't help but check her out and flirt. \nLT I'm in charge of the investigation. Just checking security. \nNURSE (Suspicious) Security? \nLT Do you want those guys coming back? For the nun? Or for you? \nThe NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the CORRIDOR. \nLT continues his hunt. \nHe comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with \"QUARANTINE\" SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside. \nHe has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk, but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack. \nHe's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without being seen. \nCUT TO: \nINT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM \nFrom just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on a table, her legs spread wide apart. \nThe DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos to the scene. \nAnd the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak. Looks like a Pieta. \nA DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed pad. As if it's a parking ticket. \nThe moving contrast between the words and the image seems to be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone. \nDOCTOR (to Female Cop) They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters into her vaginal aperture, breaking the hymen membrane. Then they pursued the same course with their natural organs of sexual penetration. They used a sharp object, probably a hunting knife with a curved blade, to carve a cross between her shoulder blades, entering the flesh an average of nearly one centimeter throughout the area of the wound. They -- \nFinally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes. \nARIANE Do you believe in God? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?. \nLT hesitates. \nARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer. \nShe starts giving him head. \nBefore he can answer The Question, he is saved by the bell. The PHONE RINGS. LT picks up immediately. It's LITE. \nAs LT speaks to LITE, ARIANE continues to give him head. \nLT (to LITE; over the phone) Yeah, I know, I know all about it. Enough already about the fucking nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the bet. Don't give me any hassles, man. Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah. And I got $900 from the cops on Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's gonna knock em dead. Of course he is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have faith, man! OK. Right. \nLT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question. \nARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic continues throughout the scene. \nARIANE Do you believe in God? \nLT thinks about it, even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter. \nLT The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. \nARIANE I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God? \nLT What's to believe? \nARIANE That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins. \nLT can't respond. He's distracted by his own pleasure. \nARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain. \nLT cries out. Snaps to attention. Looks at ARIANE. \nARIANE Your sins, Lieutenant! (beat) And look around you! Where do you think all this shit came from? \nARIANE gives him head again. LT is more excited now than before she hurt him. \nLT People. \nARIANE You believe that man is the be-all and end-all? \nLT Yeah. \nARIANE OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God? \nCUT TO: \nINT: AFTERNOON \u0097 \"WHITE\" CHURCH \u0097 HIS DAUGHTER'S FIRST COMMUNION \nCU \u0097 LT'S EIGHT YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER takes the WAFER for the first time. \nLT is dressed to kill. Looks like a corpse. \nHe watches his DAUGHTER'S First Communion and is truly moved. \nRemembers his own past. \nWhile the rest of the attendant EXTENDED FAMILY, FRIENDS, and SOME COPS enter the COMMUNION PARADE, LT stands alone at the back of the CHURCH like an usher. He holds the COLLECTION BASKET and quietly watches the whole scene. \nLT, his betting friend who is not a cop comes up beside him. \nLITE OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do? \nLT I wanna go double or nothing on the next game. \nLITE Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind? \nLT I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money \nLITE Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it! \nLT (stoic) There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out. \nLITE looks his friend up and down as if he's lost his mind. \nLITE Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! \nLT That's my problem. Just put in my bet. \nLITE gestures assent, but is not happy. He waits a moment, looks around. \nPOV LITE - LT'S FRIENDS and FAMILY. LT'S DAUGHTER in her COMMUNION DRESS. \nFrom the pristine interior of the \"WHITE CHURCH\" we -- \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT: AFTERNOON \u0097 THE CHURCH/CONVENT \nThe interior of the CHURCH/CONVENT is still desecrated. In stark contrast to the \"White Church\" (above, Scene 22). \nPOLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of the CHURCH. In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT- WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up. \nLT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION -- what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head. \nThe NUN does penance. LT watches her, still hidden, and transfixed. \nCut from THE NUN to -- \nCUT TO: \nINT: EVENING - ARIANE'S APARTMENT \nCU - LT fucking a NUN. \nIts ARIANE. \nThis time LT doesn't rebel against the religious import of these last days. Rather, he incorporates it into their sex. He has dressed ARIANE as a NUN. Now it is silent pantomime that expresses both decadence and awe. \nCUT TO: \nINT: LATE NIGHT \u0097 LT'S HOME \u0097 QUEENS \nFOLLOW LT as he walks through his home late at night. Each room has several FAMILY MEMBERS in it, all asleep. Even the TWINS sleep in tandem, on matching BUNK BEDS. \nLT sits down in the KITCHEN. All is silent, peaceful. \nA moment passes. \nLT stands up and goes over to the REFRIGERATOR. He takes out a CARTON OF MILK. \nSits back down. DRINKS the MILK. \nLT calmly looks at what's on the KITCHEN TABLE. \nA PILE OF BILLS, note attached from his WIFE: \"Pay These.\" \nA GROUP OF PHOTOS from the COMMUNION, already quickie developed. They are spread out all over the TABLE. \nA MORNING TABLOID NEWSPAPER, STRAWBERRY featured on the COVER. \nLT finishes looking at the various artifacts of his life. He sighs, leans back, appears to be -- dare we say it -- at peace. \nFADE TO BLACK; \nHARD CUT TO: \nDAY FOUR: \nGAME SIX: LT LOSES $60,000 \nWhen the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods respectfully at the habitual patron. \nCUT TO: \nINT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM \nLT arrives. \nThe V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and more interesting. \nPARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM, drug use is hardly concealed. \nLT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused. \nLT orders a VODKA. \nLITE Do you have the money? \nLT (giggles) What money? \nLITE Don't bullshit me. \nLT keeps doing COKE off hs wrist, even as ne speaks to LITE. LT can't seem to wipe the smile off his face. \nLT I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. \nLITE This psycho can. \nLT Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. \nLITE (laughs in his face) You're a fucking joke, you know that? (turns grim) He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that! \nLT Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in. \nA COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the VODKA in one shot. \nLITE You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids -- \nLT Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and -- \nLITE He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? \nLT I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic. \nThis breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment. \nLT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it down. \nLT gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers out of the V.I.P. ROOM. \nCUT TO: \nINT: NIGHT - THE LIMELIGHT CLUB \nLT is in the throng again. The MUSIC blasts, the PARTIERS push and shove... \nLT elbows his way through the crowd. \nHe makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR, he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER. \nLT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's shit-scared. \nEXT. LT leaves the CLUB for the STREET, looking over his shoulder all the way. \nCUT TO: \nINT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING \nLT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister staircase. \nSTRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE. \nLT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn. \nOn one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH. \nOn another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT down with him. \nOn another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE. It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking. \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT \nA cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the STAIRWELL, above. \nA large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at the table. \nRELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound. \nA CODED KNOCK on the DOOR. \nJC jumps up to answer it. \nIt's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.) \nPOV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that create the mescarole canyon of the STREET. \nLT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own terror. \nSuddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears -- \nA BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness. \nIt is almost as loud as the \"SHOT\". \nBRASH FEMALE VOICE (OC) Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire up the ass! \nLT can't believe that there is no \"SNIPER\", there was never any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE! \nANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly. \nEvidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED. \nBRASH FEMALE VOICE (OC) Fuck you. \nLT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He cannot be relieved. The terror is with him. \nCUT TO: \nINT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT \nLT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately pulls the DRAPES. \nLT Someone just took a shot at me... \nAriane laughs. \nARIANE Sure, baby Sure And you don't do cocaine, either. \nLT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him. \nLT It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. (beat) You gotta believe me! \nARIANE (shrugs) Why? \nARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT. \nLT Just kick back, baby. Make yourself at home. (suddenly pissed) But of course it won't be nobody's home, if you don't come through with the fucking rent! \nLT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY under it. \nLT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky Mob joint answers. \nARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next. \nThey do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic connotations. \nWhen LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds, sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there. \nThen he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES. Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters. \nThen he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic. \nARIANE LAUGHS at his antics. \nFinally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this -- \nThe PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes who it may be. He slowly answers the phone. \nLT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from another world syllable by syllable. \nLT (into the phone) Large? \nLARGE (OC) All right, cop. I want my money. \nLT It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game. \nLARGE (OC) What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game? \nLT Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet. \nLARGE (OC) Let me think about it. \nLT There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing. \nBIG SILENCE on the PHONE. \nLARGE (CO -- lethal) Oh, really? \nLT Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop! \nLARGE (OC) OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it? \nLT absorbs this, then bursts out. \nLT Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about Strawberry! Is the bet down? \nLARGE takes a moment. \nLARGE (OC) Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. \nGAME SEVEN: LT GETS DOUBLE OR NOTHING: $120,000 \nINT: DAWN THROUGH HIGH NOON \u0097 CHURCH/CONVENT \nCU - The ALABASTER NUN. She is lying cross -- probably has been all night. \nVARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its enduring glory. Shafts of blood-red dawn-light. The NUN. \nTIME PASSES. \nVARIOUS ANGLES. Mid-morning; The NUN is still lying cross. \nTIME PASSES. \nVARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross. \nSuddenly -- \nLT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a distance. \nThe NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him. \nLT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR BOX. \nLT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar. \nANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing. \nThey are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY BEADS. \nLT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer of \"help\". \nLT Listen to me, Sister, listen to me good. The other cops'll just put the guys through the system. They're juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But I'll beat the system and do justice. Real justice. For you. \nThe NUN turns to run. \nNUN I have already forgiven them. \nLT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her. \nLT Come on lady! They put out cigarettes on your tits, man! Get with the program! Don't you want them behind bars? Or away from the world for good? How could you forgive these motherfu -- excuse me. These guys. How could you? Deep down, don't you want them to pay for what they did to you? Don't you want the crime avenged? \nNUN I have forgiven them. \nLT Nun! These boys still have their weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if they do it to other nuns? Other virgins? Old women who die from the shock? Do you have the rights let these boys go free? Can you bear the burden. Sister? \nThe NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple. \nJESUS I forgive you. \nLT Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I -- \nLT averts his eyes. When he looks up again -- \nJESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet -- \nLT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant. \nHe collapses in a corner. \nLT Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. \nJESUS I forgive you. \nEPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH! \nIn the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a hunched, ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN carrying something toward the ALTAR. \nHe staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the CHALICE! \nLT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let go. \nLT The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to you! Tell me where the fuck you got it! Take me there! Now! \nAt first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea. Then breaks into TEARS. \nShe speaks at last. \nELDERLY BLACK WOMAN I can't tell you. \nGun in hand, LT gets down on his knees. \nLT In the name of God, you must. \nELDERLY BLACK WOMAN My husband will give me Hell, Mister. \nLT We've already got Hell, Sister. \nShe meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly, she tells him what he needs to know. \nELDERLY BLACK WOMAN It's very hard. He's a -- you're not a cop, are you? \nLT No. Not a cop. \nELDERLY BLACK WOMAN My husband is a fence. He got this chalice from a couple of kids. Just yesterday, I think. I stole it out of his shop so as to return it to where it ought to be. It's a holy thing, you know. A holy thing. \nLT speaks up suddenly. \nLT They both hold stuff you eat. \nAfter a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins in. \nFENCE (to LT) So what are you doing here? \nELDERLY BLACK WOMAN He wants to know who brought in the chalice. \nFENCE That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in, (beat) You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand? (beat -- shakes his head) No. How could you understand. \nThe FENCE seems to study LT. \nPOV FENCE - LT. Wretched. \nThe FENCE thinks again. \nFENCE Well -- maybe you do. But I don't know where those boys are at right now. You'll have to ask around. Those boys on the corner'll know. You'll have to get it out of them. But they know. \nPOV LT - Through the WINDOW of the FENCE'S SHOP, a busy DRUG CORNER is visible. \nLT (spaced) Thank you. And I'll make sure the chalice gets back where it belongs. \nLT leaves. CHALICE in hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE \nLT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about \"JULIO and PAOLO\". No one knows anything. LT stops people at random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE, asks them if they've seen it before. No one has. \nLT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now, he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere. \nThe GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing. \nFinally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops. The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes down in mime. \nNow, LT speaks and wants to be heard. \nLT Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio around? \nThe STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting \"deafness\" to excuse his total lack of response. \nLT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout. \nThe STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from his ears but doesn't take it off. \n", "test1_input": "\"BAD LIEUTENANT\" \nby \nAbel Ferrara and Zoe Lund \nFIRST DRAFT \nThis story takes place during a World Series between the Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry is still with New York. \nDAY ONE: \nGAME THREE: LT WINS \nEXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS \nThis typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES. \nThe MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside LT'S HOUSE. \nLT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY. \nLT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung- over. \nLT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES, puts them on. \nLT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy. The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS. Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip them up. \nLT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP and the LAWN. \nAs the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical. They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS pile into LT'S CAR. \nCUT TO: \nINT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL \nThe CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS, BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the interior. \nAn impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats. \nAn old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD. \nAs the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit detritus. \nTo little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations; they have evidently seen it all before. \nAs LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough- house. \n", "test1_true": "LT How many times are you gonna miss the bus? Huh? All the other kids can get up in the morning, but you guys wanna be driven around like the fucking President. I'm your goddamn chauffeur! \nTWINS (each taking alternate, overlapping lines) Shit, man. It wasn't our fault! -- You think Sis is so perfect, well, if she hadn't hogged the fucking bathroom, maybe we -- I thought Aunt Lu was dead! She was in there so long... \nLT Shut up! Listen! \nON RADIO: Chatter about Mets winning last night's game. It was the THIRD GAME straight that they've won so far. One more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will sweep the World Series. All listen. \nTWIN They're gonna win the Series in four! \nLT All the way with Strawberry! \nTWINS (in unison) Strawberry! \nThe TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own -- favorite player. \nThey pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade. \nLT Shit, man -- there's your fucking bus I oughtta make you late! Make the nuns whack the shit outa ya both. \nLT and the TWINS banter back and forth, poke each other and box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN. LT joins in. \nANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD, the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL comes into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside. SEVERAL NUNS turn the CROWD into two neat rows, and usher the KIDS inside. \nPOV LT - THE NUNS \nLT Get going. \nThe TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the SCHOOL. \nThe instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding. \nLT steers with his knees as he drives off toward the City. \nCUT TO: \nEXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE \nANGLE - A CAR WINDSHIELD. Blood-spattered and shot up. The DEAD BODIES of TWO GIRLS are in the front seat. \nLT gets out of his CAR and makes his way through the COPS and GAWKERS. \nThe BET COP comes up to LT. \nBET COP Two Black kids came up out of nowhere and shot those chicks. Then they laughed as they walked away. The Press is gonna call it the \"Giggling Man Murders.\" I'll tell ya. What a world. \n", "test2_input": "LT grins. He takes out his own ROLLING PAPER, starts to ROLL a JOINT with their POT. \nLT Well, I'm sure we could arrange something... Unless you fancy a few days in jail... \nHe blackmails them into humiliating sex scenes. On a side street off Eleventh Avenue, LT plays it out until dawn. \nCUT TO: \nDAY THREE: \nGAME FIVE: LT LOSES $30,000 \nEXT INT: DAWN - THE CHURCH/CONVENT \nLT drives up erratically and parks his CAR in front of the CHURCH/CONVENT. \nLT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's blind drunk. \nThe enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him. \nHe collapses immediately into a PEW. Sleeps. \nTIME PASSES \nCUT TO: \nINT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT \nLT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first, LT can't even see them. \nThe ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved crosses on her. \nIn the background, the questioning has already begun. The interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a certain constipated \"respect\" in their attitude -- the COPS are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it. \nLT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the ring. \nLT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the COPS interrogate both NUNS. \nCOP 1 Can't you tell us anything? Sisters? Anything at all? \nThe ELDERLY NUN speaks up. \nELDERLY NUN They broke my glasses. I didn't see anything, but I did hear them. They were young. And there were two of them. They spoke Spanish. One of them was named Julio. \nLT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his commentary \nLT (to Older Cop) Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics named \"Julio\". \n", "test2_true": "ELDERLY NUN I would tell you more if I could. I am so sorry, Officers. \nNow the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN. She does not appear to need GLASSES. Evidently, she could give the COPS what they want. \nCOP 2 What about you, Sister? Won't you tell us anything? \nLT watches the YOUNG NUN as -- \nPOV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile. \nCOP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it. \nLT has observed their interaction. Though he would have loved to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her defiance gives him even more pleasure. \nThe MONSIGNOR comes forward to \"translate\" the NUNS' stubborn silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition -- this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he pontificates. \nMONSIGNOR Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years old. I'm not from this Church, of course, but I assume they'll be getting her a new pair of glasses. Apparently she's legally blind without them. The Sister who suffered a rape is just 17. She arrived from Ireland only a couple of months ago. This -- event -- is just too much for them to take! \nThe MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a dicitous tone. \nMONSIGNOR Listen. The Church would like to know who did it just as much as the NYPD. These arrant criminals broke the laws of man, and the laws of God. The Church wants nothing more than to see them behind bars. That's why we're offering the $50,000 reward to whomever brings them in. I'm sure our hero will be one of New York's Finest. \nThe YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look. \nIt appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact with LT. But he can't be sure. \nLT leaves the crowd, disappears out the DOOR. \nCUT TO: \nINT: LATE AFTERNOON - RUSH HOUR - LT'S CAR - 54TH STREET AT FIFTH AVENUE \nLT is driving through HEAVY TRAFFIC while listening to GAME FIVE on the RADIO. He COKES UP. He mumbles to himself. \nGAME FIVE is close, and features STRAWBERRY. As LT listens, he reacts physically to the changing status of the game. \nHe drives crazy through the streets, pounds the ceiling. \nHe's so COKED, he's bouncing out of his skin. LT drinks VODKA out of a PINT BOTTLE in his COAT. \nSTRAWBERRY overthrows a sacrifice fly from Canseco and the A's WIN. \nLT shoots out the CAR RADIO. LT LOSES! He's $30,000 down. \nCovering himself, he puts the LIGHTS on top of his CAR. Turns the SIREN on. Screaming CURSES, he drives through the streets, careening like a madman. PEDESTRIANS run away in terror. \n", "test3_input": "LT Shut up. Let's watch the game. \nLT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED. \nLT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds his GUN. \nThe KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment. \nAll three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game. \nLT Strawberry... \nPAOLO Yeah... \nAfter a moment, LT gets up. The KIDS understand that they must do the same. \nLT Give me the robes. \nThe KIDS hand over the PURPLE ROBES and LT puts them on. \nJULIO You're not a cop are you? \nLT No. \nLT exits. Taking the KIDS along. He carries the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. \nCUT TO: \nEXT INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR AND STREETS EN ROUTE TO RENDEZ- VOUS \nVARIOUS ANGLES - LT drives toward the fatal rendez-vous with the BOOKIE. He is wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the CHURCH/CONVENT and has the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. \nLT has the KIDS handcuffed in the back seat. (The Scene mirrors Scene 2. in which LT drove his own TWINS to school.) \nThe FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but also not listening. \nLT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window, then at the KIDS, again. \nLT Jesus died for your sins, you motherfuckers! Not me. No. I didn't die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus went and did it. (beat) So why did you do what you did? If you want to live, tell me now, motherfuckers! Tell me now! \nLT turns around and looks at JULIO and PAOLO, both of them HANDCUFFED in the back seat. \nPOV LT - CU - JULIO and PAOLO both have TEARS running down their cheeks. Silently. \nLT I forgive you. \nLT starts CRYING too, at the same time CURSING at the TRAFFIC. \n", "test3_true": "The Mets are coming up from behind -- but it is a long shot. LT doesn't seem to care. He stares into space. \nCUT TO: \nEXT:/INT: EVENING - LTS CAR - THE PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL \nLT stops his CAR -- next to a BUS in an underground tunnel. \nLT Get out. \nThe KIDS do. LT follows fast. \nAT THE BUS: He makes them board at GUN POINT. \nLT If you think you're not getting on this bus, you're dead wrong. No fucking way are you gonna miss this bus, man! You were probably the kind of kids who had your father drive you to school cause you couldn't catch the fucking bus. But no more, man. You're getting on this bus and you're taking it to the last fucking stop. So get on the fucking bus, man, 'cause you're life ain't worth shit in this town. \nLT uncuffs them and the KIDS get on the BUS, dumbstruck. \nLT hands JULIO the CIGAR BOX. His \"salvation.\" \nThe KIDS don't even know what is inside. They take it. \nLT gets back into his CAR, takes off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT/INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR - AT 33RD STREET & 8TH AVENUE - AT THE RENDEZ-VOUS WITH THE BOOKIE \nEXT: LT PULLS UP AT THE APPOINTED SPOT. HE AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOOKIE. \nINT: STRAWBERRY is up. The GAME can go either way. Suspense. \nBut not on the face of LT. He is dressed in the PURPLE ROBES, the CHALICE beside him in the CAR. \nThe BOOKIE pulls up and -- without getting out of his CAR -- He SHOOTS LT in the head. \nThe BOOKIE speeds off. (We never saw him behind the dark windows,} LT is dead in his CAR. \nOn the RADIO, the GAME is ending. STRAWBERRY hits a HOME RUN and the -- Mets win, the CROWD ROARS. \nEND CREDITS. \nFIN \nBad Lieutenant Writers : \u00a0\u00a0Abel Ferrara\u00a0\u00a0Zoe Lund Genres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama User Comments \n"}

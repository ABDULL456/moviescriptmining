{"train": "MONEYBALL \nWritten by \nSteven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin \nIN BLACK: \nThere will always be people who are ahead of the curve, and people who are behind the curve. But knowledge moves the curve. - Bill James \n1 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1 \nStatic shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers. Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV. LEGEND: October 15, 2001 \nWe begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the faint voice of an announcer - \nBRENNAMAN V/O ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who has just three at bats in the series, and none of them hits - as he settles back in \n2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2 \nAt the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on. \nBRENNAMAN V/O - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has it, the pitch, Saenz swings and - \nThe announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on: \nSTEVE LYONS V/O - a ground out to second, Thom, is not what the A's were looking for from Saenz - down by two in the ninth - \nThe lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the radio back on - \nBRENNAMAN V/O Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout to bat for Menechino - \nHe turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits. Switches the radio back on - \nBRENNAMAN V/O - the A's are down to their last strike and this Yankee crowd is on its feet - Rivera squints for the sign, he has it, delivers and - Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits just a few moments. Turns the radio back on - \nBRENNAMAN V/O It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees - down two games to none - have come back to win three, and the Division Series. \nThe outcome of the series seems to have no effect on Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward an exit, the voice of one of the announcers - \nSTEVE LYONS V/O This is an exceptional feat not only for New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though not the kind you can be proud of: Only once before has a team lost a Division Series after winning the first two games - \n3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3 \nIt's coming from a small television a night security guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching, he quickly shuts it off. \nBILLY It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on. It's no big deal. \nSECURITY GUARD No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it. \nThe guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently turns in his hands - \nBILLY How's Meg? \nSECURITY GUARD She's good, thanks. \n- and the glass window of the bar behind him - \nBILLY And the boys? \nSECURITY GUARD They're good. Everybody's good. \nBILLY That's good. The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass, but it doesn't happen. \nBILLY Night. \nSECURITY GUARD Night, Billy. It was a great season. \n4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4 \nA lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the Coliseum. We HEAR- \nTARA V/O They had three times your payroll, Billy. \nBILLY Yeah... \nTARA V/O You're not watching them celebrate, right? Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone. \nBILLY No. That would be, uh-- \nTARA V/O Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic? \nBILLY Are you asking me to pick one? \nTARA V/O What you should be doing is thinking about what an amazing job you did and how great you are. \nBILLY I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not thinking about either of those things. \nTARA V/O You take a team with that payroll to the playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth game? I'm not even sure the better team won. \nBILLY They were down two-love and then beat us three in a row. Trust me, the better team won. \nBILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit with sound of sports talk radio-- \nCALLER V/O --while embarrassing the entire city and making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick of this. \nTARA V/O Let's go away. \nBILLY That sounds good. \nCUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME - Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen. \nTARA V/O Someplace they don't have a baseball team. \nBILLY How about Oakland? \nTARA V/O Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You can do anything you want but you can't give any quotes to the press, go on the internet or hurt my car, we have a deal? \nBILLY Yeah. \nTARA V/O They had three times your payroll, Billy. From the radio we've been hearing shards of \"--an unprecedented choke--\", \"--get rid of Billy Beane--\", \"-- Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--\". \nBILLY Yeah. \nTARA V/O How about Hawaii? I'll make a reservation someplace. The place with the turtles. \nBilly gets out of the car. \nBILLY Great. I'm on my way. \nBilly chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts it in gear. HARD CUT TO -- \n5 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 5 \nBlur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of travelers to a Hawaiian Airlines counter where Billy and Tara check luggage. Billy's got a cell phone to his ear. \nBILLY Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston? What are they offering? \nBORAS (ON PHONE) What does it matter to you? \nBILLY What?! \nBORAS (V.O.) We have a deal. If it's eight million. \nBILLY Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance, Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a quarter million short? \nBORAS (V.O.) I'm just doing my job for my client. That's all I'm doing. \nBILLY No, you played me. And you're playing me now. Congratulations, asshole. You win. Billy hangs up on him. \nCUT TO: \n12-14 OMITTED 12-14 \n15 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SCOUTING ROOM - PRESENT DAY 15 \nBilly and his scouting department - ten men older than him - all former players and tobacco chewers still, each with his own can of Copenhagen and wastebasket - sitting around a large underground cinder block \"war room\" whose most extravagant appointment is a Mr. Coffee. \nTwo large white-boards dominate a wall, covered with magnetic strips with players' names on them. \nOn the left board - every player in the A's organization. On the other, even larger board - every player that may be of interest to them from the other organizations. \nIt's the most complex chess board you will ever see. But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in the A's team - the star players they are about to lose - their names set apart from the positions they're vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (CF), Jason Isringhausen (RP). \nGRADY Alright, guys... we had a great year. We won 102 games and we only came a buck short in New York. Now the bad news... we've got three big holes to fill. \n(THEN) Let's start with who we like for Giambi. We'll go around the room. Who you like, Matty? \nKEOUGH I like Geronimo. (approval from the \nOTHER SCOUTS) Guy's an athlete. This guy is big, fast and talented. \nGEORGE Six foot four. \nPITTARO Top of my list. \nPOTE Clean cut, good face. \nARTIE Good jaw. He's the real deal. \nGEORGE Five tools, good lookin'. \nBILLY Can he hit? \nKEOUGH He's a tools guy. \nBILLY Can he hit? \nKEOUGH He's got a great swing. Natural swing. \nBILLY So you're saying he can't hit. \nKEOUGH He can hit. \nBARRY The ball explodes off his bat. \nARTIE It's exciting. When he hits it sounds like he's droppin' a firecracker at his feet. \nPITTARO Down in the pisser you can hear that sound. \nBARRY Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron... \nBILLY That's not what I asked. I asked can he hit. \nKEOUGH He's a good hitter. \nBILLY If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit good? \nKEOUGH He needs a little work. He'll be able to hit. He could be a great hitter. \nBILLY Right... we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he'll be able to hit. \nGrady moves on -- \nGRADY Artie, who do we like? \nBilly backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on -- \nARTIE I like Perez. He swings like a man. \nKEOUGH He swings like a man who swings at too much. \nARTIE There's some work needs to be done. I admit it. He needs to be reworked a little. But he's noticeable. \nGRADY He's notable? \nARTIE No, he's noticeable. You notice him. \nKEOGH He's got an ugly girlfriend. \nBARRY What's that mean? \nKEOGH Ugly girlfriend means no confidence. \nBARRY Alright. That's true. \nPITTARO I agree with Art. I like the way he walks into a room. Kid's so confident his dick gets there two minutes before he does. \nGEORGE Passes the eye candy test. He's got the looks, he's ready to play the part. He just needs some playing time. \nKEOUGH I'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6. \nBARRY Billy, if you want to talk about another Giambi, this guy could be it. Enough. Billy raises a book above the table, drops it with a dull THUD... STOPPING TRAFFIC. \nGRADY Is that a suggestion, Billy? \nBILLY Guys, stop. You're talking like this is business as usual. It's not. \nGRADY We're trying to solve the problem. \nBILLY Not like this. You're not even looking at the problem. \nGRADY We not only have a very clear understanding of the problem we now face, but everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before. \nBILLY Good. What's the problem? \nGRADY The problem is that we've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace. \nBILLY Uh-uh. What's the problem? \nPITTARO The problem is the same as it always is; we've got to put a team together with what we've got. \nBILLY Uh-uh. What's the problem? \nBARRY We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120 rbi's, 47 doubles... \nBILLY Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game. There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us. And now we've been gutted. We're organ donors to the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart. And now I'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio. Is there another first baseman like Giambi? \n(BEAT) Is there? Everyone mumbles \"no.\" \nBILLY Then stop looking for one because what we'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi. \nGRADY Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em through player development, teach `em how to play Oakland A baseball. This is no time to push the panic button. This is the way we've been doing it for 150 years. Let us do our job. \nSABATINI I'd like to introduce you to Tom Martinez. \nMARTINEZ Very impressive performance today. In my job as the national cross-checker for the New York Mets, I see the top 200 players in the United States. It's been a while since I've seen a five tools guy, the complete package. Your throwing ability, your fielding skills... Ed told me you had power but I had no idea it was of the light tower variety. I hope you're as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft. \nBILLY Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something I want to do full time. I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford. \nMARTINEZ Well, Billy, we're certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well. And we believe in college, but that's something you can do in the winter months. You need to know the sky's the limit with your ability. You could be a superstar before you've even graduated. But to get to that level, you need to work with our people. Pro-ball is where you need to be to develop the skills God gave you. \nCUT TO: \n16 INT. RECEPTION - INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 16 \nUnlike the A's, this is a franchise that can spend actual money on players, and on nice lobby furniture, which is where Billy sits, staring at a classic baseball photo that hangs in the lobby. \nASSISTANT Mr. Beane? Mark's ready to see you now. \n17 OMITTED 17 \n18 INT. MARK SHAPIRO'S OFFICE - CLEVELAND - DAY 18 \nBilly's counterpart in Cleveland--Indians General Manager MARK SHAPIRO--35 and about three weeks into the job--sits behind his desk in a tie and shirt sleeves like Billy. Joining them in the room are FOUR OTHERS, including PETER \nBRAND. \nSHAPIRO So Billy, what are you looking for? \nBILLY 50 million in additional payroll. \nSHAPIRO Try Giambi. \nBILLY Ouch. \nSHAPIRO 120 million. \nBILLY I should've been a hitter. \nSHAPIRO Where's Steve in all this? \nBILLY Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the team. \nSHAPIRO Bonds is available. \nBILLY Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the field? \nSHAPIRO So what are you looking for? I want to help out. \nBILLY I guess you've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is \nOFFERING YOU-- \nSHAPIRO \nBILLY-- \nBILLY I need a lefty reliever and I want Ricardo Rincon. \nSHAPIRO Not going to happen. \nBILLY Not even a discussion? \nSHAPIRO Come on Billy, even if you could afford him we're not about to let him go. \nBILLY Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you're bringing up. \nSHAPIRO We dished him to Detroit. Keep up. \nBILLY Well there goes my other idea. \nSHAPIRO What else you thinking Billy? \nBILLY You have any outfielders I should be looking at? \nSHAPIRO To replace Damon? \nBILLY Yeah. \nSHAPIRO That's a tough one Billy. \nBILLY Yeah. Who do you got? \nSHAPIRO The guys you might be able to afford? Hollins, Garcia... Coste. \nBILLY Tell me about Garcia. \nSHAPIRO To replace Damon?! \nBILLY Is he healthy? \nSHAPIRO He had a back thing, some minor surgery, but he's okay. Petey? \nPETEY He'll be good by Spring Training. \nBILLY He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash. \nSHAPIRO Mark Guthrie? \nAs Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices Peter whispering to the guy next to him. Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't object. \nSHAPIRO How much are you thinking? \nBILLY \n200 K. \nBRUCE approaches Shapiro and whispers and steps away. \nSHAPIRO Sorry about that. So... Garcia is going to be a no. What else are you thinking about? \nBILLY Let's make it work, I'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker. \nShapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word 'no'. Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark. \nSHAPIRO Sorry Billy, who else you interested in? \n19 INT. INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 19 \nPeter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until he notices Billy hovering over him. \nBILLY Hey. \nPETER Hi. \nBILLY Who are you? \nPETER My name is Peter Brand. \nBILLY What do you do? \nPETER I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro. \nBILLY So what do you do? (pointing at co- \nThe elevator door closes. \n21 INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 21 \nBilly's in coach, staring at the night through the window, lost in thought. \n22 INT. HOUSE - SAN DIEGO - DAY - 1980 22 \nBilly's mother and father escort Martinez and Mets Head Scout Roger Jongewaard into the kitchen. \nMOTHER Billy? They're here. \nJONGEWAARD Billy... Good to see you again. Obviously you're a very special player. We'd like to compliment you on your high school career, and we're looking forward to you being a part of the Mets family. Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to Billy's parents than Billy himself -- \nJONGEWAARD There's good -- and there's premium. Your son is premium. He has it all -- power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and I'm never wrong about that. Which is why this is a premium number. He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top- sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence. Then -- \nMOTHER Billy's been offered a scholarship to Stanford. \nJONGEWAARD I know. And that's a great accomplishment. I'm sure you're very proud of him. \nMOTHER So he can accept that, go there, and then - \nJongewaard is already shaking his head no. \nJONGEWAARD I understand how important college is. I do. But what I can't do is burn a second first-round draft pick on someone who can't play for four years -- no matter how good he is. Four years is ample time for someone to get hurt. It happens all the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to be one or the other. To postpone four years is four years he could be in big leagues. The sooner he gets there the sooner he can reap the benefits. \nStanford or The Money. Young Billy regards the check, and then his parents. He really doesn't know what to do. \nJONGEWAARD We're going to give him a different kind of education. This won't be his life's career, it'll be his first career. He's going to be a young guy in the business world when his baseball career is done. He'll still have his whole life ahead of him. \nFATHER It's your decision, Billy. Whatever you decide is fine with us. \n23 INT. BILLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 23 \nBILLY's looking out his window while holding his cordless phone. He's dialed the numbers in and just has to hit the green button. \nAnd now he does. \nINTERCUT WITH \n24 INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME 24 \nPETER's ringing cell phone wakes him up and he answers it. \nPETER Hello? \nBILLY It's Billy Beane. \nPETER What time is it? \nBILLY I don't care. Would you have drafted me in the first round? \nPETER What? \nBILLY After I left you ran me through your computer, right? Would you have drafted me in the first round? \nPETER You were a good baseball player. \nBILLY Would you have drafted me in the first round? \nPETER \n(PAUSE) I'd have drafted you in the ninth round. No signing bonus. You'd have passed and gone to Stanford. \nBILLY Pack your suitcases. \nPETER Why? \nBILLY I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians. \nBILLY hangs up the phone. He sits all alone for a moment. \n25 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - MORNING 25 \nMONTAGE: Peter pulls into the parking lot for his first day of work, takes in the sight of the colossal, concrete relic that is the Oakland Coliseum. He's just in time to see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe down the middle of Jason Giambi's giant portrait. \nCUT TO: \n26 INT. PETER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 26 \nPETER's completely converted the place. The dry erase boards are covered with undecipherable equations, algorithms and numbers and PETER, who's pretty tired now after not a lot of sleep, is in the middle of this. This is what BILLY sees when he walks into the doorway, where he slows down, stops and looks around blankly. \nBILLY Good evening. \nPETER Good evening. \nBILLY I asked you to do three. \nPETER Yes. \nBILLY To evaluate three available players. \nPETER Yeah. \nBILLY And how many did you do? \nPETER \nBILLY \nOKAY-- \nPETER 51, I don't know why I lied just then. \nBILLY Talk me through the wall. PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase boards. \nPETER This is the American League West. This year we're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season. Here's the number of runs we'll need to score in order to win those games and here's the number of runs we can allow. \nBILLY Let's make sure we're on the same page. \nPETER Okay. \nBILLY We're going to re-think baseball. \nPETER Yes. \nBILLY Look for an inefficiencies in statistics. \nPETER Examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented. \nBILLY Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs. \nPETER Unspectacular runs are more valuable. \nBILLY Why? \nPETER/BILLY \n(SIMULTANEOUSLY) Because they cost less. \nBILLY We believe there's a river that hasn't been fished. \nBILLY It was cold. \nThe news bothers no one. \nGRADY Let's get after our relief pitching problem. \nBILLY We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander. \nFew, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin leafing through their printouts and notes. \nGRADY Submariner? \nBILLY That's the one. Technically an underhander. \nGRADY What's his velocity? \nBILLY Unimpressive. \nARTIE About 85. \nGRADY Does he have a good breaking ball? \nBILLY Doesn't have one. \nGRADY Why do you like this guy? \nBILLY Well, he gets people out. \nARTIE The left-hander hitters get a really good look at him. \nGRADY He's down there. He's down there real low, too. \nBILLY Let's move on. \nThe scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing. \nEVENTUALLY - \nGRADY Well, we, I think, have fared better. We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi. \nBILLY Knock me down. \nGRADY We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A big heart in the last year his contract. Tend to play hard. We usually get a pretty good year out of them. Make up for some of the offense we lost. (puts more names up) Or the other option. Just a thought. We go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy that's a little difficult but talented. A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not like Milton. Milton himself. Which do you want to talk about first? \nBILLY None of them. Grady looks like a man who can't take much more. \nBILLY You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way. \nBARRY We got some trades here. \nBILLY We can't do it. What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate. \nGRADY The (what) - \nBILLY Giambi's on-base percentage was .477. Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was .291. Add that up and you get - He points to Peter. \nPETER You want me to speak? \nBILLY When I point at you, yes. \nPETER Ten-ninety-two. \nBILLY Divided by three - \nPETER Three-sixty-four. \nBILLY That's what we're looking for. And that's what we'll find. Three players whose average OBP is - \nPETER Three-sixty-four. \nARTIE That doesn't come out right. \nBILLY You gotta carry the one. \nARTIE Still don't look right. \nBILLY It's right. The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room. \nGRADY Billy? \nBILLY Yes. \nGRADY Who's that? \nBILLY That's Peter. And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter. \nGRADY I don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here? \nBILLY Yes. \nPOLONI What's with this on base percentage obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit? \nBILLY You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all I care. \nBilly takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on strips, and approaches the board. \nBILLY So here's who we want. One. \nHe puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI. \nBILLY Jason's little brother Jeremy. \nBARRY He never comes home from the games. \nPOLONI Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on the field -- not to mention his problems off the field -- not to mention he's getting a little thick around the middle -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's at strip joints... \nGRADY This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake. \nBILLY His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year. \nGEORGE He can't catch a ball in the outfield. I've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight. Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE. \nBILLY David Justice. \nGRADY Ten years ago he was a big name. He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year. But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight. \nPITTARO He's 36! \nARTIE His legs are gone. He's a defensive liability. I question whether the bat speed is still there. \nBARRY Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline he's willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him. \nBILLY That's good. \nHOPKINS He's a fossil. With all due respect, bringing these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire. \nGRADY And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract? \nBilly points at PETER -- \nPETER He gets on base. \n(FUCK IT) I can't throw at all. \nBILLY Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown your last baseball from behind the plate. I want you at first. SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT \"This wasn't my idea.\" \nSCOTT I've only ever played catcher. \nBILLY You're not a catcher anymore. If you were, then mine wouldn't have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight. \nSCOTT I appreciate it but-- \nBILLY You're welcome. \nSCOTT \nYOU SEE-- \nBILLY You don't know how to play first base. \nSCOTT That's right. \nBILLY It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash. \nWASHINGTON It's incredibly hard! \nBILLY Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna teach you. \nSCOTT Wait a minute, what about-- \nBILLY Jason's gone, Scott. \nSCOTT I'm taking Giambi's spot at first? What about the fans? \nWASHINGTON Yeah, maybe I can teach one of them. \nBILLY The fans don't run-- \n(TO WASHINGTON) \n--GOOD ONE-- (back to SCOTT) --the fans don't run my ball club. \nSCOTT They're gonna hate me. \nWASHINGTON (motioning to BILLY) No, they're gonna hate him. \nBILLY The fans love me. \nWASHINGTON Okay. \nHATTEBERG's YOUNG DAUGHTER comes down the staircase in her pajamas, having just woken up in the middle of the night. \nBILLY Hello. \nHATTEBERG'S DAUGHTER Hi. \nSCOTT That's our youngest daughter. \nBILLY Great. \nSCOTT Do you have kids? \nBILLY doesn't like to share personal lives with the players but he covers well-- \nBILLY --yeah, I have a daughter. \nBILLY takes a contract out of his windbreaker and sets it on the table next to the cookies. \nBILLY This is a contract for you to play baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's on its way to your agent. Discuss it with your wife and let us know. (They get up and Billy calls off) Thanks for the cookies, ma'am. We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then go back to the living room-- \nELIZABETH (O.S.) You're welcome. \nBILLY (on his way out) Merry Christmas. \n35 EXT./INT. SAN DIEGO - PRESENT DAY 35 \nThe door of a suburban house opens, revealing a WOMAN. \nBILLY Hi. \nSHARON Hi, Billy. \nShe pulls the door open so he can come in. As he does - \nBILLY She home? \nSHARON She's out, but she'll be home soon. \n36 INT. SAN DIEGO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 36 \nAs Billy enters his ex-wife Sharon's house, her husband ALAN walks in, talking on the phone. \nALAN \n(ON PHONE) Yeah, no, don't worry about it sweetie. Here's mom. \nAlan hands Sharon the phone. \nBILLY Hey Alan. \nALAN Come on in have a seat. Want some coconut water? It's really refreshing. \nBILLY I'm all set, thanks. \nALAN What are you benching now? \nBILLY I don't keep count. \nALAN Well, whatever it is, it's working. You look good. \nThey sit on the couch next to a Christmas tree. \nALAN I haven't got to see you since the playoffs in New York. That was heartbreaking, Billy. We were rooting for you. \nBILLY \n(BEAT) Yep. \nALAN You know what I say? \nBILLY Fuck `em. \n(BEAT) I'm sorry Alan, what do you say? \nALAN No, I just wanted to say that a lot of teams don't get that far, and to make it that far is a really big accomplishment. \nSharon gets off the phone and joins them. \nBILLY \n(TO SHARON) So how is she? \nSHARON She's great. Be here in a minute. How's the team shaping up? \nLEGEND: 1986 \nBILLY playing for minor League Toledo. He swings and pops up lamely to the PITCHER, throwing his bat down in frustration as he jogs hopelessly to first and we \nANNOUNCER V/O ...Billy Beane, who's quickly establishing a new record for breaking bats, bat racks and water coolers, was actually a much-touted first round pick of the New York Mets in 1980 but the majors have not been kind to him with only 18 plate appearances in two years and this won't doing anything to help him as... \n43 EXT.

PORTLAND 44 \nLEGEND: 1987 \nBILLY playing for minor league Portland and a water cooler goes flying across the dugout and \nCUT TO: \nA45 EXT. MINNESOTA A45 \nLEGEND: 1987 \nANNOUNCER V/O ...one of two first round picks in 1980 along with Daryl Strawberry, Beane was brought up last year and sent back down after 8 at-bats so here's a second chance as Smith delivers... BILLY playing for the Minnesota Twins. He swings hard at a pitch and strikes out and we \nCUT TO: \n45 EXT. DETROIT 45 \nLEGEND: 1988 \nBILLY playing for the Detroit Tigers and the bat rack gets heaved across the field and \nCUT TO: \n46 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT 46 \nLEGEND: 1989 \nANNOUNCER V/O ...If you're a real baseball fan with a good memory you might remember that Billy Beane was taken in the first round of the amateur draft back in 1980, separated from All-Star outfielder Daryl Strawberry by only 14 picks, so it just goes to show... \nBILLY in an A's uniform. He stands and watches a called third strike sail past him. \nUMPIRE Strike! \nBilly breaks the bat over his thigh and drops the pieces on the plate. He begins to walk off. \nUMPIRE Hey Billy, clean up after yourself. \nBilly hears him but continues to walk off. \nTO BE WRITTEN: THE UMP TOSSES BILLY FROM THE GAME. \nBILLY looks up at SHARON in the seats behind the dugout but the two can't quite meet each other's eyes. \n47 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 47 \nIn the subterranean video room - an even less elegant place than the rest of the stadium - someone has put up a scraggly Christmas tree. There, Peter watches a tape of a minor leaguer on the Lowell Spinners, a Single-A Boston affiliate. Billy comes in. \nPETER How'd it go? \nBILLY How'd what go? \nPETER Hatteberg. \nBILLY He can barely hold a baseball. But he's our guy now. Billy sits. \nBILLY Who's that? \nPETER That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world. \nBilly watches the guy on the screen. He's an overweight right-handed batter with a peculiar stance. \nPETER He can't run, throw or field. But he walks more than anyone in baseball except Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek God of Walks. \nOn the TV, the batter takes another pitch just off the edge of the strike zone. \nPETER I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last June. He said he waddled like a duck. Boston took him. Boston won't let him go yet. They're going to wait and see. \nThey watch him lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike zone. Peter gives Billy a look that says, You see that? \nPETER You all right, Billy? \nGRADY O/S Billy? Grady has appeared behind them at the door. \nGRADY Can we talk a minute? \nBILLY Yeah. \n(TO PETER) Yeah. \n48 INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 48 \nGrady closes the video room door for privacy. The only other person in sight is manager Art Howe, in his office in street clothes. He shuts his windowed door so Grady and Billy can talk in confidence. \nGRADY Your boy and I had a talk while you were in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I heard. \nBILLY No? \nGRADY No. You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you're listening to the wrong one. \nBILLY I don't listen to anyone, you know that. \nGRADY This isn't a joke. \nBILLY I'm not joking. \nGRADY This isn't how you run a ball club, with a computer. You know that. You're a baseball man. There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that you're not going to pick up with just numbers, with someone who doesn't play the game, who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer. \nBILLY That's what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing. \nGRADY If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body... a computer wouldn't do that. They would have had him sitting up in the stands. \nBILLY A computer doesn't romanticize the sport. Leave that for the fans. \nGRADY Well, romance and the fans, it's called a love affair with the game and it's been going on for one hundred and fifty years. \nBILLY I don't want to hurt you love affair with the game. Just because we've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesn't mean we've been doing it right. You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth? To your eyes it looks like that's what's happening. \nGRADY You're saying everybody's been wrong? Everybody? Beat. \nGRADY Are you saying everybody's been wrong? \nBILLY Yes. Maybe. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nBILLY (CONT'D) Yes, and I've thought so my whole life. And now we're gonna see if I'm-- \nIndicate the arrival of opening day. INCLUDING: foul lines are painted, broadcast trucks plug in, the network control room fires up, ANNOUNCERS do their prep, Steve Schott lands in his helicopter. LEGEND: April 1, 2002 - OPENING DAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM: Players prepare. Magnante puts on his knee braces. \nMAGNANTE Yeah... been doing it for way too long. \nHATTEBERG How long does it take? \nMAGNANTE When I first started these things? It was like a half hour process. Now I can knock these suckers out in 30 seconds, no problem. \n52 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY 52 \nJeremy Giambi's boombox is on again as he and his 24 teammates suit up. 36-year-old David Justice wanders past to a soda machine. Presses a button, but nothing comes out. Tries again. \nTEJADA Is a dollar, mang. \nJUSTICE What? \nTEJADA Always been like that here. \nJUSTICE You're kidding me, right? \nTEJADA Welcome to Oakland. \nBILLY and PETER walk through. He walks past CHAD BRADFORD's locker... \nCHAD Excuse me, Mr. Beane. \nBILLY Hey Chad. \nCHAD I hope I'm not disturbing you. \nBILLY You're not, what's up? \nCHAD I wanted to say thanks for the opportunity. \nBILLY It's gonna work out well for both of us. \nCHAD Nobody in the major league ever took me seriously. \nBILLY \n(PAUSE) Nobody? \nCHAD Just you, sir. \nBILLY Okay. \n(BEAT) It's a big day, you won't forget it. \nCHAD I'm going to pray for you and your family. \nPETER follows BILLY out of the locker room. \n53 OMITTED 53 \nA54 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH - DAY A54 \nSHOTS OF THE GAME ANNOUNCERS. KEN KORACH, GREG PAPA and GLEN KUIPER welcome the fans to opening day, discuss the A's lineup and the problems they face this season. \n54 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY 54 \nMONTAGE: \nIt's fifteen minutes before the game as some executives have their picture taken on the field with BILLY. \nBILLY Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming out. Got a good box? You want a picture? Sure, let me step in there. Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know what I like about opening day? Everyone's even. Thank you. You all enjoy the game. \nBILLY gets his picture taken with KIDS from an area Little League team. He's laughing and being a good host. \nBILLY Hey, how you guys doing. So you won? That's great. What position are you? How's your fastball? 92? Alright, should we get a pic? \nBilly and the Little League team pose with a giant donation check. The announcer then directs everyone's attention to a trophy ceremony in progress. As Chavez receives his Golden Glove award and smiles for the fans... \nCUT TO: \n55 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL SEATS - DAY 55 \nBILLY greeting some VIP's in their field-level seats. Throughout this we'll hear bits of talk radio. \nHOST #1 (FROM RADIO) With the departure of head scout Grady Fuson and a roster that I'll describe as unusual, if not eccentric, you have to wonder what Billy Beane is thinking. BILLY catches a glance of ELIZABETH HATTEBERG taking her seat nearby. \nIn the family area, Elizabeth introduces herself to Tara. \nELIZABETH Hi, I'm Elizabeth. \nTARA Hi. Tara. Which is yours? \nELIZABETH Scott Hatteberg. Catcher - actually first base - actually we don't know. Yours? \nTARA \nGM. \nELIZABETH \n(EXCITEDLY) Mr. Beane? Tara nods. \nELIZABETH He's a saint. \nTARA Really? \nCUT TO: \nA56 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY A56 \nArt is talking to a JOURNALIST. \nJOURNALIST Are they picking up your option for next year? \nA beat. \nART I brought it up to them during the off- season, and I still do not have my option. \nJOURNALIST Are you frustrated? \nART I think it's fair to say that. \n56 OMITTED 56 \n57 OMITTED (INCORPORATED INTO 54) 57 \nA58 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - LATER A58 \nArt Howe stands mid-field as the starting lineup is announced. One by one, players join him on the field. The honor guard presents the flag as everyone stands for the National Anthem. Afterward, the players scatter to warm up for the game. \n58 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 58 \nThe CROWD CHEERS as the A's take the field. Billy and Peter are at the edge of the tunnel, watching. \nBILLY Okay, good. \n(BEAT) I'm heading in. \nPETER No. \nBILLY I'm a player, cut me from the roster. \nPETER No. \nBILLY Do it. \nPETER This is stupid. \nBILLY Man-up, Yale. \nPETER Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a moment, I need to talk to you. \nBILLY I'm already sitting. \nPETER I was pretending you weren't sitting. \nBILLY But I am. Keep going. \nPETER This is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball. \nBILLY You got that from Bull Durham? \nPETER Yeah. \nBILLY Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead. \nPETER You've been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team, I'm sure you can understand that. \nBILLY You're cutting me? \nPETER I'm really sorry. \nBILLY I just bought a house here. \nPETER \n(BEAT) Well... \nBILLY Well? That's all you have to say? My kids just started at a new school, they made friends. \nPETER That's--I'd leave them in school, you don't want to take them out in the middle \nOF THE-- \nBILLY What the hell are you doing? \nPETER Are you you or the player? \nBILLY I'm me. You're talking about kids and schools and you should've been out of the room three minutes ago. \nPETER Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always be a part of the A's family? \nBILLY That makes me feel so good I'm thinking of burning your house down with you in it. These are professional baseball players. You just do it. \"Peter, I need to let you go. Jack's office'll handle the paperwork.\" \nPETER That's it? \nBILLY Would you rather get one bullet in the head or five in the chest and bleed to death? \nPETER Those are my only choices? \nBILLY Go on the road with the team. \nCUT TO: \n67 INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT 67 \nJeremy Giambi discreetly mixes a highball from a cache of hotel minibar liquor bottles as he watches his favorite movie on a portable DVD player, The Natural. DAVID JUSTICE is sitting next to PETER, who scrolls down stats on his laptop. \nDAVID How come your boss doesn't travel with the team? \nPETER He doesn't like to mingle with the players. \nDAVID Makes us easier to cut? \nPETER doesn't say anything... \nDAVID He's gonna make some moves if we keep losing. PETER gives a small \"Yeah\" shrug... \nDAVID How come soda costs a dollar in the clubhouse? \nPETER Billy likes to keep the money on the field. \nDAVID Soda money? \nPETER doesn't say anything... \nDAVID Where on the field is the dollar I pay for soda? \nPETER \n(BEAT) It's hard to see. \nDAVID (shaking his head) Alright. \n68 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 68 \nBilly watches the T.V. \nON TV - PENA taking his place at first. \nTV ANNOUNCER V/O The A's begin their first road trip of the season having dropped 7 of their first 11 games at home and their schedule doesn't get any easier from here. If there's a bright spot it's rookie first baseman Carlos Pena. \nBilly turns off the T.V., gets beeper updates as he works out. \n69 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - DAY 69 \nBilly drives. \nVOICES V/O With the A's getting off to a miserable start/13 of their last 20/17 of their last 25/etc... \n70 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT - DAY 70 \nBILLY's waiting for someone. HE'S WATCHING THE A'S GAME BY THE GATE. A PASSENGER, also watching the game, recognizes Billy. \nPASSENGER Hey, aren't you Billy Beane? \nBILLY Yeah. \nPASSENGER Shouldn't you be at the game? \nBILLY Nope. \nCASEY emerges from the gate, sees her father before he sees her and runs to him. They hug. \nCASEY Hey, Dad. \nBILLY Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you. \nCUT TO: \nCASEY Sorry. \nBILLY Do I look like I'm worried? \nCASEY Yeah. \nBILLY `Cause you're getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time. Will you please stop worrying about your father? You're a kid, I can't have it. \nCASEY Okay. Can I worry about the airplane now though? \nBILLY Absolutely. \nA FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches -- \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT We're all set. \nBILLY Great. \nThere's a slightly awkward moment and CASEY isn't sure whether she's supposed to hug her father again and so they do a sort of half-hug. \nBILLY I love you. BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like it was an unsatisfying visit. \nHe looks at his blackberry-- 3-2. Magnante in. \nBILLY \n(SHOUTING) No! WHY IS HE IN THERE?! \nEVERYONE in the area stops to look at the madman. \nBILLY (to the people looking at him) No no. I'm alright. \n78 EXT. TRACK - MORNING 78 \nBilly runs the warning track with a small radio that he turns on long enough to follow what's happening, and switches it off again. \nOver the following, we hear a cacophony of radio and TV VOICES tumbling into each other-- \n79 THE STANDINGS ON PETER'S COMPUTER: 79 \nThe A's have fallen to 19-25. \n80 EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - NIGHT 80 \nMAGNATE giving up a save-blowing hit while BRADFORD sits in the bullpen... \n81 EXT.

OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT A82 \nThe parking lot is a vast, empty black sea with just two pin-points of moving light. Headlights. Billy drives around the lot like a downhill skier with nothing in his way -- his daughter's mix-tape playing. \n82 EXT. EDISON FIELD - ANAHEIM, CA - NIGHT 82 \nJeremy lines a single to right, but is so slow he's almost thrown out at first. Art Howe glances at his bench coach, Ken Macha. \nANNOUNCER Art Howe is the only manager in baseball who has to think about pinch running his leadoff hitter. Down in the Visitors' pen, Chad sits with Mike Magnante. \nMAGNANTE Why do you do it? \nCHAD I can't not do it. \nMAGNANTE How do you do it? Every ball park's different. \nCHAD I take that into account and adjust the distance of my steps. \nMAGNANTE Exactly seventy-four, from the pen to the mound. \n(MORE) \nMAGNANTE (CONT'D) \n(BRADFORD NODS) You should get that looked at, man. \nCUT TO: \n83 EXT.

Now, having dropped 13 of 16, the A's are a game away from being swept at home by the AL East last place Baltimore Orioles. \nCUT TO: \n86 AERIAL SHOT 86 \nas we follow Billy's truck from Oakland over the Bay Bridge into San Francisco. \nCUT TO: \n87 INT. SCHOTT'S OFFICE - DAY 87 \nBILLY Steve. \nSCHOTT Billy. \nBILLY You remember Peter. \nSCHOTT Peter. Guys, give me some idea of what's going on out there. \nBILLY Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and we're gonna need 162 games to tell that tale in a nascent form. It's phase one, we're evolving and we feel confident where we're heading. \nSCHOTT \nBILLY - \nBILLY We're not scared. \nSCHOTT 3 out of 17 games. 3. We're getting crucified in the press. What makes you think this is gonna turn around? \nBILLY Because I believe in what we're doing. I believe the numbers. I believe the record doesn't accurately reflect the team and where we're going to be at the end of the season. Peter and I feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan, and you can tell your partners to start booking their tickets to the playoffs. \nSCHOTT Billy, look, you've got guys who are nearly crippled, who couldn't get hired as an usher in a ballpark now playing on the team. Give me something I can go back to these guys with and feel like I have the confidence that you're gonna turn these things around. \nBilly lets himself out and walks down the hall to the locker room - regards Jeremy Giambi - \nJEREMY Yeah! \nHe's not even aware of Billy. It's just like any other night as far as Jeremy Giambi is concerned. He dances to a CD of funk music as he dresses, until he becomes aware of Billy standing there, and smiling, he kills the music. \nJEREMY \n(NERVOUS LAUGH) What? \nBILLY Getting swept by the Red Sox at home. Having Long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one-run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out, is that fun? \nJEREMY No. \nBILLY Then what the fuck are you having fun for?! \n(CALMLY) This is what losing sounds like. He heads out. \n94 OMITTED 94 \n95 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - NIGHT 95 \nPETER V/O ...point 3-5 below the AL average field which isn't bad. \n(BEAT) Billy? \nBILLY Yeah? \nCUT TO: \n96 PETER IN THE VIDEO ROOM - SAME TIME 96 \nPeter rattles off player stats. \nPETER Cruz -- .283, .347, .476.

CAR - MOVING - NIGHT - 1989 B97 \nBilly and his wife drive home from a game in silence, their infant daughter Casey asleep in a car seat in back. Sharon regards Billy's hands, clutched too tightly to the steering wheel. \nSHARON Have you thought about what you might do if baseball doesn't work out? \nBILLY \n(PAUSE) What? \nSHARON That was too abrupt. \nBILLY No. \n(PAUSE) What? \nSHARON \n(BEAT) If baseball doesn't work out. Have you thought about what you might do? \nBILLY \n(BEAT) The game's only been over for three hours, I haven't had that much time to think about it. \nSHARON Sure. \n(BEAT) Maybe real estate. \nBILLY I'll be honest, if I don't make it in baseball I don't think I'm going to be able to afford much real estate. \nSHARON \nI MEANT-- \nBILLY I know what you meant. \nSHARON \n(PAUSE) It's just a slump, right? \nBILLY \n(BEAT) No. \nSHARON You're saying every scout was wrong? \nBILLY You're kind of saying it too. \nSHARON \nBILLY-- \nBILLY Honey...don't you think you should divorce me now while you're young? \nSHARON looks at him... then her eyes go to the window. \nCOMMENTATOR (PRELAP) When a science experiment fails in a lab, things blow up. \n97 OMITTED 97 \nIN BLACK: \nProblems are the price you pay for progress. - Branch Rickey \n98 INT.

Am I telling him, too. \nBILLY No. I'll do that. \nB99 INT. LOCKER ROOM B99 \nPeter walks into the locker room. Sees Pena talking to a couple of other players. He approaches Pena. \nPETER Hey, Carlos. \nPENA Yeah. \nPETER Can I get a moment with you? \nPENA Sure. \nPETER Okay, maybe we can talk over here. \nThey walk awkwardly to the players' lounge. \nPETER Have a seat. They sit. \nPETER So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer, their travel secretary. He's expecting your call. He'll help you arrange travel to Detroit. \nPena sits and stares at him. It's excruciating for Peter, awkward, until -- \nPENA Is that all? \nPETER Yeah. \nPENA Cool. \nPena just takes it. Picks up the number and leaves. \n99 INT. ART'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY 99 \nBilly knocks and lets himself in. \nBILLY Mind if I have a seat. \nART Please. \nBILLY You can't start Pena at first tonight, you'll have to start Hatteberg. \nART I don't want to go 15 rounds, Billy, the line-up card is mine and that's all. \nBILLY The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first. \nART I am starting Pena at first. \nBILLY I don't think so, he plays for the Detroit Tigers now. \nART \n(PAUSE) You traded Pena?! \nBILLY Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi. \nART You are outside your fucking mind. \nArt stares at him in a silence broken by Jeremy Giambi knocking on the open door. \nBILLY Jeremy, come on in. \nBilly jots a phone number on an A's Post-It and hands it to him. \nBILLY This is Ed Wade's number. You know him? \nArt looks sick. \nJEREMY No. \nBILLY Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy. Give him a call - he's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you. \nJEREMY The what? \nBILLY The flight. To Philadelphia. Billy gets up and shakes his hand. \nBILLY It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I mean that. You're a great ballplayer and great guy. \nJeremy, not sure he heard right, looks at the Post-It in his hand as Billy escorts him to the door. \nBILLY We're going to miss you. \nJeremy leaves. Billy looks at Art from the door. \nBILLY Adkins is gone, too. \nART You're killing this team. \nBILLY Art? I can do this all day long. \nHe leaves. Art notices Peter, who had been lurking by the door, eavesdropping. \nART What are you looking at? \nPETER I'm not looking at anything. \nART You went along with this? You agree with this bullshit? \nPETER \n(BEAT) A hundred percent. \nA100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY A100 \nPena cleans out his locker. Several players stop by to say goodbye. Tejada -- \nTEJADA Keep your head up, okay? It's part of the business. You're gonna be a great player, okay? \nPENA Thank you, man. \nTEJADA Don't let this bother you at all. \nChad Bradford -- \nCHAD Nice to meet you, brother. Take care and... God bless you, man. \nPENA Thank you. \nScott Hatteberg -- \nHATTEBERG You're the best first baseman here. It's not right, Carlos. \nPENA Thank you, Hattie. \nHATTEBERG Yeah. \n100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100 \nBILLY and PETER stride through as the team is getting dressed for batting practice. The place quiets down as BILLY comes in. They've all heard the news and they've never experienced a move like this in their careers. \nBILLY I'm screwin' with you, Haddie. \nHATTEBERG So we just don't steal? \nBILLY That's right. \nLONG That's what I do. That's what you pay me to do. \nBILLY No, I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second. \nLONG I don't get thrown out much. \nBILLY I don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table, but if I did, the odds would be the same. \nPETER You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season. \nLONG I get 11 of 17. That's not bad. \nBILLY You just handed them an out. Protect your outs like they're your children. There's no clock on this game. Until the third out, anything can happen. Get on base and let the next guy move you up. Pass the torch, pass the torch. We're like a machine. A run making machine. \nA104 INT. LOCKER ROOM - KITCHEN - DAY A104 \nAs JUSTICE and HATTEBERG prepare food -- \nJUSTICE What's your biggest fear? \nSCOTT A baseball being hit in my general direction. \nJUSTICE That's funny. \n(THEN) No, seriously. \nSCOTT Seriously. \n104 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM BATTING CAGE - DAY 104 \nBILLY Hey, Dave. I've been thinking... I want you to -- \nJUSTICE You gonna teach me something? \nBILLY Excuse me? \nJUSTICE I've never seen a GM talk to players. \nBILLY You've never seen a GM who was a player. \nJUSTICE Huh. \nBILLY Is there a problem? \nJUSTICE It's okay, man. I know your routine. It's a patter, it's rap, it's for effect. That's okay. But it's for them, it's not for me. \nBILLY You're special? \nJUSTICE You're paying me 7 million bucks so I guess I am a little. \nBILLY As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7 million bucks, David. The Yankees are paying half your salary. That's what the New York Yankees think of you. \n(MORE) \nBILLY (CONT'D) They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them. \nIf this is news to Justice, he doesn't show it. \nJUSTICE Where are you going with this, Billy? \nBILLY You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as me. Let's be honest with each other about what we each want. I want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you, and you want to stay in the show. So let's do that. I'm not paying you to be the player you used to be, I'm paying you to be the player you are now. You're smart, you know what's going on here. I need you to set an example for the younger guys. Take a leadership role. \nJustice just studies him ... then nods. \nBILLY We're cool? \nJUSTICE We're cool. \nBILLY All right. Billy starts to leave, but has one last thought for him -- \nBILLY You know -- the Yankees are coming to town. If it were me -- I'd want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass. But I'm a competitor. \nBilly exits. Justice calls after him -- \nJUSTICE You know, I got a couple World Series rings. I think I'm a pretty good competitor, too. \nBILLY \n(CALLING BACK) You want another one? \nCUT TO: \n105 EXT.

He wants to steal it bad. \nANNOUNCER (VO) Tejada taking a big lead off first, eyeing the steal-- \n107 INT. CLUBHOUSE MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 107 \nBILLY watches with two or three TEAM EMPLOYEES. \nBILLY Don't do it, Migs. \n108 EXT.

BILLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 111 \nThe TV is on as BILLY and PETER work, seeming more and more like mad scientists who are getting closer and closer to splitting the atom. \nGREG PAPA OR RAY FOSSE (TV) What is happening in Oakland?!! The A's have won seven in a row and 15 of their last 19. You got to hand it to Art Howe. He's managing this unorthodox team in an unorthodox way. They are not bunting. They are not stealing. They are just winning. And Art Howe is the reason. \nPETER Did you hear that? \nBILLY I heard 7 in a row. Billy clicks off the TV and it's very quiet. Billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the A's relief pitching. \nThe game plays on TV as BILLY bench presses. The A's are up by three runs in the ninth inning but the Indians have a runner on first. \nThrough the tunnel, BILLY can hear the crack of the bat and a collective groan from the stands. \nBILLY holds the barbell in the air--frozen--as he simply looks at the T.V. and sees the silent images. \n114 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 114 \nART HOWE walking to the mound, tapping his left hand. \nMAGNANTE heading to the mound. \n115 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 115 \nWe think BILLY's going to trash the weights, but he simply returns the barbell to the bracket, sits up and watches the silent images. \n116 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 116 \nMAGNANTE mops his brow, squints for the sign, winds up and makes his pitch. It misses low for ball four and PEDRO walks to first. \n117 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 117 \nBilly lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the T.V. and we hear - \nANNOUNCER (FROM TV) Magnante has quickly let two on base for Lee Stevens who's the go ahead run for the Indians in a game that Oakland appeared to have put away. And then - BILLY sits calmly...waits for it...and-- \nCRACK! \n--BILLY nods his head at the inevitable. \nANNOUNCER (FROM TV) That ball is deep....way back...three run homer for Lee Stevens to put Cleveland ahead in the ninth inning... BILLY can hear 40,000 people booing their lungs out. He takes a moment, then grabs his jacket. \n118 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 118 \nThe FANS are booing as ART makes his way to the mound to take MAGNANTE out. BRADFORD makes his way from the bullpen and takes the ball from ART. ART turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees a strange sight: BILLY is standing at the dugout rail. \nThe plate UMPIRE notices and follows Art's line of sight. He sees BILLY and walks over there ahead of Art. \nUMPIRE You can't be in there, Billy. \nBILLY doesn't move. He just watches ART as he comes into the dugout. \nUMPIRE Billy? \nThe PLAYERS are watching to see what's going to happen. BILLY puts his hand on ART's shoulder a second as he says- \nBILLY Just nod a little bit--not too much--like I'm assuring you you didn't just make a calamitous vocational decision. \nUMPIRE Players and coaches only, Billy. \nBILLY (ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to \nART) Remember that in about four seconds-- BILLY sees one of the nearby TV cameras pivot over to catch this conversation-- \nBILLY --yeah there it is. We're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief. First of all, that was an awfully costly fuck-you, wouldn't you say? \nART \nLOOK-- \nBILLY Second of all, genius, those boos? They're for you. Drink up. \nUMPIRE Come on, Billy. \nBILLY Get me this game back. \nAs BILLY passes MAGNANTE he pats his back before we-- \nCUT TO: \n119 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - NIGHT 119 \nThe radio is on and the ANNOUNCER is telling us-- \nANNOUNCER (FROM RADIO) ...after giving up the lead on a three run homer off Magnante, the A's came right back to win it in the bottom of the ninth with another three run homer by Miguel Tejada. And the A's have won eight in a row! \nAA120 OMITTED AA120 \nA120 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY A120 \nAs the early-bird fanatics arrive - players arrive at the players' entrance - \nB120 INT.

LOCKER ROOMS - COLISEUM - SAME TIME - DAY D120 \nBilly, standing at the door, surveys the room, his eyes moving from player to player as they're hanging up their street clothes. The team's equipment manager, pouring himself a cup of coffee, glances over - \nVOOS You want one, Billy? \nBILLY I'm good, Voos. Thanks. \nVoos wanders off. Billy keeps looking at the players ... \nLEGEND: July 31 - TRADE DEADLINE \nE120 INT. SCOUTS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY E120 \nBilly comes in sticking some tobacco under his lip and, like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving, doesn't through the entire scene -- \nBILLY Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone. \nPETER Are you thinking Rincon? \nBILLY Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I think he's gonna dump him. \nPETER Hardcore. \nThey wait as Suzanne dials the Indians' GM, staring at the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the middle of the conference table. \nSUZANNE Shapiro on two. \nBILLY Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs. \nSHAPIRO V/O Are you referring to Rincon? \nBILLY He's a luxury you can't afford. \nSHAPIRO V/O And you can? There's half a million on his contract and at least one other suitor. \nBILLY By at least one, you mean one? Who is it? \nSHAPIRO V/O I'd rather not say. \nPETER \n(WHISPERS) San Francisco. \n(MUTE) I'm on with Steve. \n(UNMUTE) Not his fault. We misused him. \nPETER Steve Schott. \nBILLY Tell him to hold. (to Steve Phillips) Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm being straight with you. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done. \nPHILLIPS V/O I heard the Giants -- \nBILLY No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told them they can have him for Michaelson... \nPETER \nANDERSON -- \nBILLY -- but I'd rather deal with you. Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants can't. Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask. As they listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call -- \nPETER Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep you holding. \nPHILLIPS V/O I'll think about it. \nBILLY Of course. Think. But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro. He hangs up. Looks for the blinking light that belongs to his owner. \nPETER He hung up. \nSilence. Then -- \nBILLY If you could have the power of flight or invisibility, which would you choose? \nPETER What? \nBILLY Invisibility or flight? \nPETER \n(THINKS) Invisibility. \nBILLY That's what Casey said. Why? \nPETER You'd have total access. Besides, everyone else would choose flight. \nQuiet. \nBILLY Why isn't anybody calling? The phone rings. \nSUZANNE Shapiro's on two. \nBilly picks up. Listens. Fist pump. \nBILLY Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you right back. \n(THEN) Get Steve. \nPETER Phillips or Schott? \nBILLY Why would I call Phillips back? Schott. Tell him I'm on the other line. \nPETER Right. \nPeter dials. Billy can't sit. \nPETER Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I left you on hold. Billy asked me to call you back. He's on another line. \nBILLY Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon. \nPETER Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon. Please? \n(THEN) Yes, I added the please. (listens; to Billy) No. Billy thinks intensely. Finally -- \nBILLY Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him next year for twice that, I keep the money. \nPETER Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself, sell him next year, and keep the profit. \nPeter listens to whatever Steve Schott is saying, then -- \nPETER Okay. Thank you. \n(HANGS UP) He says he'll pay for Rincon. High five. \nBILLY Great! Shit. What are we forgetting? \n(CALLING OUT) Get me Shapiro! \n-- as he grabs his cell phone and hits speed dial. \nBILLY Wait, never mind! (beat, then into \nPHONE) Mark. Yeah, it's Billy. Here's the deal. I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight. Tell him to change his clothes. I got you the money and I accept your gratitude. It's done. He hangs up. Fist bump. \nBILLY We gotta let someone go. It's Mags. It's gotta be Mags. \nPETER I call not it. \nBilly dials an extension. \nBILLY Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse. The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's last night. \nART V/O No. \nBILLY What do you mean, no. \nART V/O No, as in no. I'm not doing it. You do it. You did it, so you do it. Art hangs up. Billy slams the speakerphone. \nPETER It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne, we're gonna need a new speakerphone. \nBILLY We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes over. \nHe leaves. \nF120 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER F120 \nBilly comes through the clubhouse past his team suiting up to where Magnante is adjusting his knee braces next to his locker, and sits with him. \nBILLY \nMIKE -- \nMAGNANTE Hey, Billy. I know I've been struggling lately. But we're coming into the home stretch, and I promise I'm gonna turn it \nAROUND -- \nBILLY -- I need you to stop getting dressed. Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells him he did. Eventually - \nMAGNANTE Traded? \nBilly shakes his head, no. \nBILLY I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it hurts. \n(THEN) Mike. I can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse. Magnante nods. \nBILLY That's a problem right there. Terrance jogging to first. \n(THEN) Mr. Justice. That's what we pay you for. \n(THEN) Chad Bradford, you deceptive son of a bitch, I love you. \n(THEN) He's a pain in the ass, but that Giambi gets on base. \nAnother train of thought -- \nPETER Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at bats. \nBILLY My whole career I only had eighteen walks. \nPETER Actually... 11. \nBILLY Shut up. \nAnd now we have QUICK SCENES OF BILLY TAKING PLAYERS \nASIDE -- \n122 LOCKER ROOM--BILLY AND TEJADA - DAY 122 \nBILLY Migs, let's make a deal. I'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field, but you've gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull. \nTejada immediately starts thinking about it. \n123 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 123 \nTERRANCE LONG is working out. Billy pokes his head in. \nBILLY Hey, T. Did your car get egged? \nLONG Yeah. \nBILLY I think I just got an e-mail from the culprit. He said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases. \nLONG What the hell does that have to do with anything? \nBILLY I don't know, man. Don't worry about it. \nBilly exits. Long calls after -- \nLONG Who brings eggs to the ballpark anyway?! \nA124 INT. CLUBHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY A124 \nBilly and Mecir walk down the hall with the smelly stain. \nBILLY Man, you're not fooling anyone but yourself out there. You're falling further and further behind. In your mind, what's the problem? Mecir mumbles something. \nBILLY I can't understand you with your hand over your mouth. \nMECIR Sorry, Billy. It's just, the smell... \nBILLY Right? \n(INDICATES STAIN) It's that. And it's growing. \nThey stare at the stain in silence. Finally -- \nMECIR I'm gonna grab a shower. \nBILLY Yup. \n124 OMITTED 124 \n125 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM CLUB HOUSE - DAY 125 \nHatteberg in the clubhouse. Billy enters. \nBILLY Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind? \nHATTEBERG I feel like I'm hurting the team. At first base I'm making a lot of errors. I'm gonna cost us a hundred runs. \nBILLY 16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games. I can live with that. Can you live with that? \nHATTEBERG I appreciate that, but I know you're just pulling those numbers out of your ass. \nBILLY I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually. \n(THEN) And another thing. When a guy reaches first base, be social. \nHATTEBERG Social? \nBILLY Like a greeter at the Gap. A guy steps into your office, chat him up. You're well read, you went to college. Have some fun out there. Relax. \nHATTEBERG Yes sir. \nBILLY Scottie, you deserve to be here. \n126 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 126 \nPETER is erasing the percentage of games left that they need to win and writing in a LOWER number-- \nBILLY More information. TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY of all of the changes to the board over the following two weeks. \n127 OMITTED 127 \nA128 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY A128 \nIt's the Twins vs. the A's. A TWINS PLAYER stands at first, stoic. Scott figures \"What the hell?\" and turns to him. \nHATTEBERG What are you guys getting up to tonight? \nThe focused Twins player looks at Scott like he's crazy. \nTWINS PLAYER #1 Bed by ten o'clock. Game time. \nHATTEBERG I don't buy it. \nTWINS PLAYER #1 I'm sore, man. Beat up. Day in, day out. \nHATTEBERG Where d'you guys go next? \nTWINS PLAYER #1 Houston. \nHATTEBERG Houston? \n(THEN) You ever get up to Boundary Waters up there in Minnesota? It's beautiful. I went on a trip up there. Fishing trip. Caught some walleye. \nTWINS PLAYER #1 That's good fishing. \nCUT TO: \nScott chatting with a DIFFERENT TWIN on first. \nHATTEBERG \"Mankevich\" is polish? \nTWINS PLAYER #2 Yes, sir. \nTARA What did she say? \nBILLY I was a big moment for them. You know everyone wrote him off? \nTARA You didn't. You found him and you put that together. \nBILLY I know. It was beautiful. But you know... it's not gonna mean a thing. \nHe's upset. She knows it. \nBILLY Here's the thing -- we changed the game. We got this year, maybe next, then they're gonna catch on. This is our moment. I want to go the distance. I wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not just the Yankees, but... these guys deserve it. \nTARA You deserve it. Honey, 20 games. It's a record. \nBILLY That's right, it's just a record. It gets buried in some book. Come on, tell me who won 19? I don't even know. It's 4th place at the Olympics. Any other team wins the World Series this year... great. We're still in the record books. But if we win, we've changed the game. We've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass. If we don't, they're gonna erase us. \nCUT TO: \n162 OMITTED 162 \n163 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 163 \nThe same shot as at the beginning: the Coliseum from high above, only this time the final game of the division series is being played at home. \nLEGEND: \n2002 ALDS \nDECIDING GAME 5 Minnesota Twins at Oakland A's The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's excruciating. The numbers on the board tell us it's been an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody on. \nRay Durham stands in at the plate. Strike one to the Durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPN's Joe Morgan, who's speaking post-game. \nJOE MORGAN V/O The flaw in the A's thinking, and this comes from the top of their organization-- is their failure to comprehend you have to manufacture runs in the post season. \nDurham fouls off a pitch. Strike two. \nJOE MORGAN V/O You have to steal. You have to bunt. You have to sacrifice. You have to trust in small ball, not Billy Ball. \nDurham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs. The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the middle of the field to begin their victory celebration. \nDurham turns away and heads back to the dugout. The A's have lost the series. \nJOE MORGAN V/O They think they've devised a science to win games. They think it resides in a computer. They thumb their nose at fundamentals. At tradition. At Baseball. \n164 OMITTED 164 \nA165 INT. VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT A165 \nHarrowed by the defeat, PETER stares at the TV, listening to Joe Morgan. \nJOE MORGAN V/O They're bean counters in Oakland.

OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT 165 \nA LOCKED-OFF SHOT begins to slowly move towards the pile of celebrating players on the mound and as we near, the sound begins to fade and the PLAYERS BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR, as do the FANS and ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE COLISEUM. DRIFT in an empty stadium, towards the dugout, where the last of the CLEANING CREW brooms the floor. \nA166 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT A166 \nCAMERA MOVES down a dimly lit cinder block corridor, and finally into the - \n166 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT - 1989 166 \nwhere we discover a solitary figure. \nThe camera comes to settle on the Oakland A's player, still in uniform, hours after the game has ended, sitting with his face in his hands. After a long, deep breath he sits up and we discover that it's Billy, 10 years prior. \nCUT TO: \n167 INT.

Do you even know what a scout does? \nBILLY I've been scouted since I was 15. \nALDERSON And you're ready to say, \"I'm not a baseball player\"? \nBILLY I'm not a baseball player. \nCUT TO: \n169 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 169 \nBILLY Ready to do this? Pete nods. Billy calls out -- \nBILLY Suzanne? Get Schott on. \n(TO PETER) You ever been to Boston? The speakerphone rings. Billy answers. \nBILLY We need to talk about the Red Sox. \nSCHOTT (V.O.) So I heard. John Henry reached out to you? \nBILLY Yes. But I haven't spoken with him yet. \nSCHOTT (V.O.) That's what he said. \nBILLY I want your blessing before I do. \nSCHOTT (V.O.) Well, how am I supposed to react to all of this? You're under contract, Billy. You extended. \nBILLY I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk to them. I want to see what they have to say. \nSCHOTT (V.O.) You're asking me to let them talk to you? \nBILLY Yes.

SINAI TEMPLE - BRENTWOOD - LATER - DAY 7 \nThe ceremony is in progress as Billy arrives, plucks a yarmulke from a basket, sets it on his head and finds a place in the back row for himself and his carry-on. He listens to the boy's monotone-reading of verses. He fidgets. Taps his foot. Checks his watch. Turns to the person down the row and whispers -- \nBILLY How much longer you think? \nGUEST What? \nBILLY Nah, it's okay. \n8 INT. TEMPLE LOBBY - LATER - DAY 8 \nAs attendees exit the ceremony and enter the adjacent banquet hall, Billy has cornered Arn Tellem, picking up right where he left off three hours ago in Oakland on the \nPHONE -- \nBILLY Arn, I don't wanna lose him. \nARN \nBILLY -- \nBILLY I don't wanna lose him. \nARN This is my nephew's Bar Mitzvah. \nBILLY He did well with his Torah portion I thought. \nARN Thank you. \nBILLY What did they offer? \nARN He's not staying in Oakland, Billy. \nBILLY What did the Yankees offer him? \nARN It's New York; you've got to give a player a reason not to play there. \nBILLY What did they offer? \nARN 17 million. \nBILLY No way. \nARN Yeah. \nBILLY I don't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars. \nARN I know, I know... \nBILLY For how long? \nARN 17 a year for seven years. \nBilly stares, completely nonplussed... \nBILLY A hundred and twenty million dollars? \nARN Hundred and nineteen. \n(BEAT) You gotta get Steve to let you spend some money. \nBILLY That's pretty good advice, I should do that. \nARN Steve doesn't get it. This isn't a charity raffle. \nBILLY Arn. I get it, he gets it, Jason gets it and you certainly get it. I'll talk to him. \nARN And you're losing Isringhausen, too. \nBILLY Ya think? \nARN I've gotta get back. \nBILLY Hey mazel tov, Arn. \nARN Thank you. Good luck. \nArn walks away. Billy looks to his right to see a 12 year old kid standing right next to him. \nKID Are you Billy Beane? \nBILLY Yes. \nKID That was a pretty serious choke. \nBILLY Are you from around here? \nKID Yeah. \nBILLY You a Dodger fan? \nKID Yeah. \nBilly hands the kid his scotch -- \nBILLY Here, drink a lot of this. \n-- and walks away. \n9 INT. OFFICE - SAN BRUNO - LATER - DAY 9 \nBilly tries, but is having trouble sitting still as he talks with Steve Schott - the A's owner - around 60 - a college player way back when.

He sets his carry-on bag down. Takes out his dead cell phone and plugs it into a charger. Calls Tara on the land line. \nBILLY Sorry, hon. I'm gonna need another day. \nTARA (V.O.)

Billy. Scott. I just got off the phone with Dan. \nBILLY No, you didn't. \nBORAS (V.O.) Yeah, I was surprised he even called me. Because he had said -- \nBILLY No, I have Johnny for seven-point-five or he's not playing anywhere, because that's the deal -- \nBORAS (V.O.) Boston just upped it to seven-seven-five. \nBilly's hand is already in motion to smash the phone, but in a herculean feat of self disciple, he manages to restrain himself before impact. \nBORAS (V.O.) You there? \nBILLY We had a deal. \n", "test2_input": "He hangs up, drives a little longer...letting what Casey said sink in. Then... \nBILLY \n(TO HIMSELF) Shhhit. \n...he turns on the radio. \nANNOUNCER V/O Tim Hudson is carving through this Royals line-up and at the end of three, it's the A's 11 and Kansas City nothing. \nBILLY \n(QUIETLY) Oh God. \n(BEAT) Ohhhh God. \nBILLY sees the sign for the next exit coming up. He makes a decision and quickly crosses to the right, just making the exit. \nCUT TO: \nA141 OMITTED A141 \n141 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - LATER - DAY 141 \nBILLY is striding through an underground corridor which is echoing with the cheers of 55,000 fans. \n142 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 142 \nBILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there. \nBILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the 3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching. Billy looks around. He sees the scoreboard, a FAN with a big funky cowboy hat, the charged-up crowd in the stands, it's like the Coliseum at Rome. \nA143 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY - TOP OF THE 4TH A143 \nIBANEZ of the Royals singles to center field. \nRANDA of the Royals singles to left field. But the Oakland fans are still jubilant and do the wave. \nThen a big error from Tejada puts runners on 1st, 2nd and 3rd (MAYNE, Ibanez and Randa). \nA143A EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - MAGIC HOUR - TOP OF 4TH A143A \nAs if we've entered the Twilight Zone, it becomes twilight and LIGHTS GO ON. \nDEE BROWN of the Royals singles to right, bringing Ibanez and Randa home, and Mayne to 3rd. \nIbanez and Randa high-five each other at the plate, passing Billy as they head to their dugout. Okay, the Royals are on the board now: 11-2, but just barely. Until- \nA143B EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 4TH A143B \nPEREZ of the Royals singles to center field, bringing Mayne home. Then TUCKER of the Royals doubles to left field. Justice makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and suddenly the Royals have 5. Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd, Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with Peterson and Hudson. \nAnd finally Billy, who WALKS OUT. \nB143 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 5TH B143 \nMIKE SWEENEY of the Royals singles to left-center field -- Neither Justice or Long get it, it lands between them. And they have WORDS. \nRanda makes a sloppy single to left field... this one goes between Justice and Tejada. \nC143 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - BOTTOM OF THE 5TH C143 \nMONTAGE of A's at bat: Hernandez grounds out, DURHAM strikes out, Mabry grounds out... A stunned A'S FAN stands up with his arms out in a \"WTF??\" gesture. While the A's are still up, this is excruciating for the fans. \n143 OMITTED 143 \n144 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 144 \nANNOUNCER V/O Kansas City's scored five and Oakland's lead is down to six as Art Howe comes out to the mound to pull Tim Hudson. \nArt Howe comes out of the dugout, gives the signal for \"underhander,\" takes the ball from Hudson. \nANNOUNCER V/O He'll go with the submariner, Chad Bradford. \nWe see SHOTS OF FANS in the sold-out stadium experiencing the height of tension and excitement in sports. \nChad Bradford comes off the bullpen mound to relieve Hudson, and begins counting his steps - \nCHAD One, two, three, four - \n145 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 145 \nChad arriving at the mound taking the game ball from Art, who we see is genuinely supportive and encouraging to Chad. \n146 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 146 \nChad finishing his warm-up pitches. \nCHAD I know what it is to be in need and to have plenty. I am content. I can do all things through Christ who gives me \nSTRENGTH-- \n147 INT. ART'S OFFICE - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 147 \nBILLY is just as tense as the fans. \nBILLY (to himself but to \nCHAD) Okay Chad, let's see it. \n148 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 8TH 148 \nCHAD walks Mayne. An angry fan throws toilet paper onto center field, the one thing Long manages to pick up. The crowd grows anxious. CHAD's submariner pitch to the next batter, DEE BROWN, walks him. BROWN trots down to first and there are now two runners on. Some FANS have to cover their eyes. There's a pitcher conference. \nArt Howe simmers in frustration. He signals Rincon to warm up. The fans aren't happy either. \nORDAZ of the Royals grounds to Tejada, who throws home for the force, and misses. Now it's 11-6! \nHowe pulls Bradford. Rincon throws a controversial strike out. The Royals batter, TUCKER, protests, and fans go crazy BOOING. \nBrown scores, 11-7 now, Royals chipping away that lead, \nAND -- \nHowe pulls Rincon. Tam comes in to relieve him. Sweeney's up. In rapid succession, we seem him battle off TEN PITCHES of Tam. He's got two strikes on him, more toilet paper flies on the field, Bowie comes in to warm up which Tam sees, then - \nSWEENEY HITS A THREE-RUN HOMER TO MAKE IT 11-10! This is excruciating. \n149 OMITTED 149 \n150 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 9TH 150 \nBOWIE is already gone. KOCH is on the mound. There's a Royal, PELLOW, on 2nd. According to the scoreboard, it's 2 outs, 2 strikes. If Koch throws a strike, the game is over. The fans are fucking feverish. ALICEA of the Royals singles to left and Pellow scores. The game is now TIED. \nIn their dugout, Royals GLOAT. \nHe's ended the inning, but in the A's dugout, Koch slams the wall. \n151 OMITTED 151 \n152 EXT.

OAKLAND COLISEUM - SAME TIME 154 \nAs ROY STEELE's booming voice echoes: \nVOICE OF GOD Pinch hitting for Eric Byrnes--Scott Hatteberg. \nScott's wife, ELIZABETH, watches from the VIP seats. She clutches her face. SCOTT lets the first pitch go by. \nUMPIRE Ball! \nArt Howe looks like he can't stand it any longer. In the dugout, Koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill. SCOTT steps out of the box to catch his breath. He steps back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks the pitch will leave the pitcher's hand. \nThe pitch. SCOTT swings. \nCrack! 55,000 erupt. The A's leap to the front of the dugout steps and watch. \nWe see the ball ascending on a strong trajectory, but before we can know for sure where it's headed, TIME SLOWS \nTO A CRAWL- \n155 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - SAME TIME 155 \nBILLY's sitting on the floor with his back against the wall, trying to breathe. He looks like he's in pain. He can't move. He hears the crowd ERUPT outside. His Blackberry buzzes: \n\"hatte homered. a's 12, ryls 11\" \nBilly flips on the TV. With sound off, he watches silent images of his team swarming the mound in (archival footage) mixed in with Art Howe celebrating with them. \n156 OMITTED 156 \n157 OMITTED 157 \n158 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SAME TIME 158 \nThe place is going crazy. ELIZABETH is screaming as she watches her husband get mauled by his teammates at the plate. \n159 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 159 \nBILLY's still contemplating making AL history as celebrating players flood into the locker room just outside. Billy looks through a portal on the door. He's trapped in here now. He crosses into the \n160 INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 160 \nThe place is packed with players, coaches and news crews. There's no champagne spraying but they feel like they won the World Series and in fact have done something much more rare. Billy is trying to make a fast unnoticed exit. After pushing through the crowd, he walks outside of the club house into the - \nA161 INT. CORRIDORS / FAMILY AREA - CONTINUOUS A161 \nwhere the players' families and wives are waiting. Billy sees ELIZABETH HATTEBERG walking toward him-- \nELIZABETH Mr. Beane? I'm Elizabeth Hatteberg. We met at my house last Christmas. \nBILLY Sure. \nELIZABETH Thank you. \nBILLY Thank me? Thank you. Whatever you put in those Christmas cookies, keep-- ELIZABETH starts to cry-- \nBILLY Whoa. It's okay. \nELIZABETH I'm sorry. \nBILLY It's alright. \nELIZABETH You don't know what it's like to have everyone think you're a failure. \nBILLY doesn't say anything but of course he does. \nBILLY Well...You never thought that, and that's \nWHAT'S-- \nELIZABETH (the worst possible \nSIN) I did. \n(BEAT) And he knows I did. \nBILLY takes this in a second... \nBILLY Yeah he does know you did. \nELIZABETH He's talked to you? \nBILLY No. I just know. \n(BEAT) That's all over now. \n(MORE) \nBILLY (CONT'D) Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley two-seam fastball and parked it in the upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit walk-off home run in a record breaking game. Go tell him about it. ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts crying \nAGAIN-- \nBILLY No it's okay now, just go. \nELIZABETH goes off to find her husband.

Sorry. \n(THEN) How was Boston? \nBILLY Impressive. \nPETER You're giving me Youkilis, Billy. \nBILLY Why would I ever do that? \nPETER Come on Billy, Schott's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and I want Youkilis. \nBILLY Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You can't have him. \nPETER And Cash. And a player to be named later. \nBILLY You already have my job.

I've never heard you say you did. \nBILLY So why am I doing this? \nPETER You're not doing it for the money. \nBILLY I'm not? \nPETER You're doing it for what the money says. It says what it says to any player who gets big money: that they're worth it. \nBILLY The offer says that. The money itself is redundant. \n(BEAT) I made one personal decision based on money in my life and I swore to never do that again. \nPETER So you're not going to Boston? \nBILLY I haven't decided. \nPETER It's all over the news that it's a done deal. \nBILLY Look at this place.

The quality is poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy. \nPAUL This guy's gonna start him off with a fastball low and in because he hasn't read the book on our guy and doesn't know that low and in is where he eats. Jeremy takes him to deep center -- We see JEREMY BROWN connect and the ball fly off the bat but the camera stays on JEREMY running to first. PAUL slows down the picture with the remote \nPAUL -- and he knows that if he runs it's a stand-up double and he's running. \nBILLY \n(QUIETLY) Go pal. \nPAUL And now he's gonna do something he never does. He's gonna round first base, he's gonna take the turn. \nBILLY Please tell me he's safe at second. \nPAUL No. Because right here -- \nJEREMY slips and stumbles to the ground. \nPAUL -- is what he's always been afraid of. It's all he can do to get himself back to first. JEREMY has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back to first base. \nBILLY What is that? \nPAUL That's the first base coach. \nBILLY Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that guy, why the hell is he -- \nPAUL Everybody's laughing. \nJEREMY's looking around the field now, looking at his own dugout. We can't see what he sees but he's confused. \nPAUL And now Jeremy finds out why. Watch his face because this is art. He's just found out the ball went 60 feet over the fence. He'd hit a home run but he didn't know it. \nAnd JEREMY's face explodes into a smile. He slaps hands with the first base coach and begins his trot around the bases. BILLY stares at this. He takes the remote and backs it up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again. \nBILLY How can anybody not be romantic about baseball? \nPAUL \n(PAUSE) It was a metaph-- \nBILLY I know it was a metaphor. \nPAUL That was a hell of a baseball season, boss. \nBILLY The Island of Misfit Toys. Okay. \nAnd with that, Billy's mind begins to go elsewhere. No resolution, no decision, other than to get up and wander on. \nCUT TO: \nC177 INT.

The sound of the radio immediately snaps off and the momentary silence is soon broken by CASEY's VOICE-- \nCASEY (V.O.) Hey, Dad. I picked these songs out just for you.

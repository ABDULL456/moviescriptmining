{"test1_input": "SABATINI I'd like to introduce you to Tom Martinez. \nMARTINEZ Very impressive performance today. In my job as the national cross-checker for the New York Mets, I see the top 200 players in the United States. It's been a while since I've seen a five tools guy, the complete package. Your throwing ability, your fielding skills... Ed told me you had power but I had no idea it was of the light tower variety. I hope you're as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft. \nBILLY Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something I want to do full time. I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford. \nMARTINEZ Well, Billy, we're certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well. And we believe in college, but that's something you can do in the winter months. You need to know the sky's the limit with your ability. You could be a superstar before you've even graduated. But to get to that level, you need to work with our people. Pro-ball is where you need to be to develop the skills God gave you. \nCUT TO: \n16 INT. RECEPTION - INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 16 \nUnlike the A's, this is a franchise that can spend actual money on players, and on nice lobby furniture, which is where Billy sits, staring at a classic baseball photo that hangs in the lobby. \nASSISTANT Mr. Beane?

MARK SHAPIRO'S OFFICE - CLEVELAND - DAY 18 \nBilly's counterpart in Cleveland--Indians General Manager MARK SHAPIRO--35 and about three weeks into the job--sits behind his desk in a tie and shirt sleeves like Billy. Joining them in the room are FOUR OTHERS, including PETER \nBRAND. \nSHAPIRO So Billy, what are you looking for? \nBILLY 50 million in additional payroll. \nSHAPIRO Try Giambi. \nBILLY Ouch. \nSHAPIRO 120 million. \nBILLY I should've been a hitter. \nSHAPIRO Where's Steve in all this? \nBILLY Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the team. \nSHAPIRO Bonds is available. \nBILLY Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the field? \nSHAPIRO So what are you looking for? I want to help out. \nBILLY I guess you've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is \nOFFERING YOU-- \nSHAPIRO \nBILLY-- \nBILLY I need a lefty reliever and I want Ricardo Rincon. \nSHAPIRO Not going to happen. \nBILLY Not even a discussion? \nSHAPIRO Come on Billy, even if you could afford him we're not about to let him go. \nBILLY Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you're bringing up. \nSHAPIRO We dished him to Detroit. Keep up. \nBILLY Well there goes my other idea. \nSHAPIRO What else you thinking Billy? \nBILLY You have any outfielders I should be looking at? \nSHAPIRO To replace Damon? \nBILLY Yeah. \nSHAPIRO That's a tough one Billy. \nBILLY Yeah. Who do you got? \nSHAPIRO The guys you might be able to afford? Hollins, Garcia... Coste. \nBILLY Tell me about Garcia. \nSHAPIRO To replace Damon?! \nBILLY Is he healthy? \nSHAPIRO He had a back thing, some minor surgery, but he's okay. Petey? \nPETEY He'll be good by Spring Training. \nBILLY He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash. \nSHAPIRO Mark Guthrie? \nAs Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices Peter whispering to the guy next to him. Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't object. \nSHAPIRO How much are you thinking? \nBILLY \n200 K. \nBRUCE approaches Shapiro and whispers and steps away. \nSHAPIRO Sorry about that. So... Garcia is going to be a no. What else are you thinking about? \nBILLY Let's make it work, I'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker. \nShapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word 'no'. Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark. \nSHAPIRO Sorry Billy, who else you interested in? \n19 INT. INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 19 \nPeter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until he notices Billy hovering over him. \nBILLY Hey. \nPETER Hi. \nBILLY Who are you? \nPETER My name is Peter Brand. \nBILLY What do you do? \nPETER I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro. \nBILLY So what do you do? (pointing at co- \n", "test1_true": "(HE DOES) What do you do? \nPETER Mostly player evaluation right now. \nBILLY Why does Mark listen to you? \nPETER Actually he rarely does. \nBILLY He just did. \nPETER I don't think he was really listening to me in there per se. \nBILLY Really? \nPETER Yeah, I think he was listening to Bruce. \nBILLY Who are you? \nPETER Peter Brand. \nBILLY I don't give a rat's ass about your name. \nNothing from Peter. \nBILLY What happened in there? \nPETER I'm not sure what you're asking me. \nBILLY What did you tell Butch? \nPETER Huh? Oh Bruce? I told him I like Garcia. \nBILLY \n(BEAT) Why? \nPETER \n(BEAT) Probably for the same reasons you do. \nBILLY Meaning what? \nPETER He's undervalued. You were smart to go after him. \nBILLY \n(LONG BEAT) What makes him undervalued? \nPeter is stuck. He can't bring himself to say anything. After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems to say, `I understand, it's okay'. \nBILLY Come on. \nBilly makes a strong gesture indicating Peter to follow. Which he does. They exit the offices into \n20 INT. A VAST PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS 20 \nBILLY Where you from Peter? \nPETER Maryland. \nBILLY Where did you go to school? \nPETER Yale. \nBILLY I hate Yale. \nPETER Why? \nBILLY Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was trying to make. What'd you study? \nPETER Economics. \nBILLY What are you doing in baseball? \nPETER I love baseball. \nBILLY I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey in there? \nPETER I work for a different team. \nBILLY I know, but I'm the first person in baseball who's ever talked to you this long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued? \nPETER Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy to explain. \nBILLY Really? Why's that Peter? \nPETER We might not see the game the same way. \nBILLY Oh really? What do you mean by that? \nPETER You've spent your life in baseball and I don't have a very traditional view of the game. \nBILLY Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to beat you up. Say what you've always wanted to say to a GM. \nPETER Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck in the Dark Ages. I have a more scientific view of the game. \nBILLY Keep going, Peter. \nPETER There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what's really happening. And it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams. They're still asking the wrong questions. People who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players. Sorry to say that. \nBILLY Peter, don't apologize for what you believe. \nPETER The goal shouldn't be to buy players, what you want to buy is wins. To buy wins, you buy runs. You're trying to replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year. When I look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from. \nSUDDEN CUT TO: \nARCHIVAL VIDEO: The back of Johnny Damon's A's jersey as he walks to the plate to adoring Oakland fans. \nPETER V/O His batting average is ignorable. What matters is his on base percentage- \nDAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left field for a single. He leads off first-- \nPETER V/O - which in 2001 was .324. That's 10 points lower than league average, and 17 points lower than Garcia's. \nOn the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second-- \nPETER V/O True, he stole some bases. But attempted steals in general have to succeed 70% of the time before they even start to contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost you runs. DAMON's tagged out at second. \nBACK TO THE GARAGE \nPETER He's got a good glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's not worth the seven point five million Boston is paying him. You're lucky to have him off your payroll, it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities. \nBILLY You read Bill James, Pete? \nPETER Yes. These ideas and this approach to the game aren't all new. In fact, some of them have been around for two decades. \nBILLY If this approach has been around for so long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing them? \nPETER That's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games. Once you begin to pull at that string, your understanding of the world might begin to unravel. \n", "test1_id": 1581, "test2_input": "Billy lets himself out and walks down the hall to the locker room - regards Jeremy Giambi - \nJEREMY Yeah! \nHe's not even aware of Billy.

He dances to a CD of funk music as he dresses, until he becomes aware of Billy standing there, and smiling, he kills the music. \nJEREMY \n(NERVOUS LAUGH) What? \nBILLY Getting swept by the Red Sox at home. Having Long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one-run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out, is that fun? \nJEREMY No. \nBILLY Then what the fuck are you having fun for?! \n(CALMLY) This is what losing sounds like.

Have you thought about what you might do? \nBILLY \n(BEAT) The game's only been over for three hours, I haven't had that much time to think about it. \nSHARON Sure. \n(BEAT) Maybe real estate. \nBILLY I'll be honest, if I don't make it in baseball I don't think I'm going to be able to afford much real estate. \nSHARON \nI MEANT-- \nBILLY I know what you meant. \nSHARON \n(PAUSE) It's just a slump, right? \nBILLY \n(BEAT) No. \nSHARON You're saying every scout was wrong? \nBILLY You're kind of saying it too. \nSHARON \nBILLY-- \nBILLY Honey...don't you think you should divorce me now while you're young? \nSHARON looks at him... then her eyes go to the window. \nCOMMENTATOR (PRELAP) When a science experiment fails in a lab, things blow up. \n97 OMITTED 97 \nIN BLACK: \nProblems are the price you pay for progress. - Branch Rickey \n98 INT.

Ok... five minutes Dave, I'm not waiting. \n(HANGS UP) What's the problem? \nPETER (trying to slow it \nDOWN) Billy, Pe\u00f1a is an all star.

OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 142 \nBILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there. \nBILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the 3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching. Billy looks around.

There's a pitcher conference. \nArt Howe simmers in frustration. He signals Rincon to warm up. The fans aren't happy either. \nORDAZ of the Royals grounds to Tejada, who throws home for the force, and misses. Now it's 11-6! \nHowe pulls Bradford. Rincon throws a controversial strike out. The Royals batter, TUCKER, protests, and fans go crazy BOOING. \nBrown scores, 11-7 now, Royals chipping away that lead, \nAND -- \nHowe pulls Rincon. Tam comes in to relieve him. Sweeney's up.

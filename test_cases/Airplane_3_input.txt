Randy takes the guitar and walks down the aisle. The guitar clonks people on the back of the head. Randy approaches Lisa. 
RANDY Is it all right if I talk to your daughter? 
MRS. DAVIS Oh, I think that would be nice. 
RANDY (to Lisa, who is reading) Hi! 
LISA Hi! 
RANDY I'm Randy. 
LISA I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! 
RANDY I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song. 
LISA Oh, I'd love to. 
RANDY Okay, this is one of my favorites. 
Randy is sitting on the edge of the gurney as she strums three opening chords. 
RANDY (strumming and singing in ballad tempo) 'I've traveled the banks of the River Jordan, to find where it flows to the sea.' 
Stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME. 
RANDY 'I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry and saw that I was looking at me.' 
As singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the Krishnas, then the Black Dudes. Finally, everyone is smiling sweetly at each other. 
INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 
Murdock and Oveur smile sweetly at each other... 
INT. CABIN - NIGHT 
RANDY (singing and playing the guitar) 'And I wanted to know if life had a purpose, and what it all means in the end. In the silence I listened to the voices inside me, and they told me again and again.' 
Tempo Jumps to rock pace. 
RANDY 'There is only one river. There is only one sea.' 
Randy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar, knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V. squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollowÂ­cheeked. No one else notices. 
RANDY 'And it flows through you, and it flows through me. There is only one people, we are one and the same.' 
Lisa manages to reconnect her I.V. 
RANDY (still singing) 'We are all one spirit, one name. We are the Father, we are the son.' 
Randy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the passengers start to get into the music. 
RANDY 'In the Dawn of Creation. We are one.' 
Mrs. Davis rushes to reconnect Lisa's I.V. Lisa doesn't react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest. 
RANDY & PASSENGERS 'We are only one people, we are one and the same.' 
As Lisa revives, Randy swings her guitar and clonks Mrs. Davis on the head. 
RANDY & PASSENGERS 'We are all one spirit on Earth, one name.' 
EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
RANDY & PASSENGERS (v.o.) 'We are the Father, we are the son, and in the Dawn of Creation we are one.' 
INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 
Elaine enters with dinners. 
OVEUR Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight. 
ELAINE Who wants to be first? 
MURDOCK Go ahead, Clarence, I got it. 
Oveur removes his headset, Elaine puts tray down. 
ELAINE How's the weather? 
MURDOCK Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff ahead of us. It might get rough again unless we can climb on top. But our airspeed is holding steady at six hundred ten knots. 
ELAINE That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball. 
Murdock autographs it reluctantly.

FREDO Mike said let him gamble. 
Fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the first attention Mike has ever given him, as though finally he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him. 
FREDO Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of "Superman?" And I don't mean the comic book. 
MICHAEL No. 
FREDO Wait'll you see! 
INT. HAVANA BAR - NIGHT 
Our group are in a large Havana bar; the walls totally covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum and other liquor. 
A couple of the girls from the show are out with the men; Yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance. 
Fredo is a little loaded, and especially attentive to Michael this night. 
FREDO Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember? 
MICHAEL It was hard to have him killed. 
FREDO You?  What do you mean you, I thought... 
MICHAEL It was hard to have him killed. 
FREDO You?  What do you mean you, I thought... 
MICHAEL It was Frankie tried to have me hit. 
FREDO No.  I mean, are you sure? 
MICHAEL You know otherwise, Freddie? 
FREDO Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman. 
CLOSE ON MICHAEL 
A growing feeling about his brother. 
EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT 
The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are little boys running around, begging for money.  And in doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women. 
SENATOR REAM (pushing away from the palm outstretched little hands of the boys) Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of beggars and pimps and whores.  And we bend over backwards to support them with the goddamn sugar quota. 
FREDO (to Geary) What's eating him? 
SENATOR GEARY He lost a quarter million dollars at the casino. 
SENATOR REAM ...goddamn city of whores... 
SENATOR GEARY He gave them a bad check. 
INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT 
A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step- like around a circular area which becomes a stage. 
There are a hundred or so people, practically all men, tourists and business men, standing on the different levels, forming the audience. 
In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole, to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some Latin music. 
MED. VIEW 
Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some important conclusions. 
QUESTADT Why do we have to stand? 
FREDO Everyone stands.  But it's worth it, watch! 
VIEW ON THE ARENA 
Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN 
VIEW ACROSS THE MEN TO THE STAGE 
FREDO That's him; that's Superman! 
Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post. The music is percussive and wild. 
MED. VIEW ON THE MEN 
SENATOR GEARY Ohmygod.  I don't believe it. 
QUESTADT It's got to be fake. 
FREDO That's why they call him Superman. Johnny Ola told me about this; I didn't believe it. 
CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying. 
FREDO (O.S.) ... but seeing is believing.  Ole Johnny knows all the places.  I tol' you... can you believe it? 
If Michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now. 
FREDO (continuing) The old man Roth, would never come; but Johnny knows these places like the back of his hand... 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING 
Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out at the city.  He is troubled and tired. 
His radio is on: 
RADIO (Spanish) "This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30 p.m.  The enemy has retreated..." 
EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING 
This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with no indication of the revolution in progress. 
Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten up early for their shopping spree. 
RADIO (Spanish) (continuing) ... An important military action is developing along a 35-kilometer stretch of the Central Highway. Numerous enemy garrisons are left with two alternatives, surrender or annihilation... 
One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy, but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight. 
CLOSE ON MICHAEL 
watching. 
MICHAEL'S VIEW 
Shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in broken English.  Havana is prosperous. 
RADIO (continuing) ... Victories in war depend on a minimum on weapons and to a maximum on morale... 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

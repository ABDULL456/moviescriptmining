Theo's temper is rising, he breathes deeply. He is obviously making a Herculean effort to keep himself in check. \nTHEO I said, let go of my bag. \nWith lightning speed Theo's hand shoots out and grabs the middle fingers on Sid's right hand. Sid howls in agony. \nSID Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers! \nTHEO Tell your little pal to let go. \nSID Breeze, give him his ball back! \n", "test1_true": "THEO Where can I find Buzz Fazeli? \nBREEZE Whoa, cool your maples.

WOODS - NIGHT\t\t\t\t   10 \nJUNIOR, a dumpy man in his late thirties with a rat tail, bad skin and wearing a white straitjacket and fluorescent orange pants, runs desperately through dark woods. Bloodhounds BARK in the distance. \n11     EXT. ROAD - NIGHT\t\t\t\t    11 \nTheo drives over the draw-bridge and past the Peter Pan Diner with its huge neon sign. \n12     EXT. DEAD END STREET\t\t\t\t 12 \nTheo's car pulls up in front of a modest suburban house. A rooftop weather vane in the shape of a bowler CREAKS ominously in the wind. \n13     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE\t\t\t\t    13 \nTheo rings the doorbell. The porch light comes on, and MILLIE, a fifty-five year-old woman dressed for a night on the town in Reno, but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet, opens the door. A miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at Theo's bowling ball bag, YAPPING and snapping at it. \nTHEO Is Mr. Fazeli in please? \nMILLIE Who wants to know? (to dog) Zeus! \nTHEO I'm a bowler. \nMILLIE I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be? \nBUZZ (OS) Let him in, Millie. And don't frisk him. \n14     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM\t\t\t 14 \nMillie and Theo, with Zeus hot on his trail, enter the room. BUZZ FAZELI, a sixty-five year-old man shaped a lot like a compressed bowling pin, slouches in a recliner. The room is decorated with trophies of Buzz's bygone pro-bowling halcyon days. \nMILLIE Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin! \nBUZZ Clam it! \nMillie is silent. Buzz gets up and approaches Zeus. \nBUZZ Hey, rat. C'mere. \nZeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his sleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously. In one smooth motion, Buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open window and into the night. \nMILLIE Jerk. \nShe heads outside. \n", "test1_id": 2583, "test2_input": "BUZZ Sit down. \nTheo sits on the edge of the couch. Buzz puts out his hand. Theo shakes it. \nBUZZ Buzz Fazeli. \nTHEO Theo. \nBUZZ I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour. \nTHEO I'm not on the tour this year. \nBUZZ (nods understandingly) Need some advice, huh. \nTHEO Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side. \nBUZZ (dismissive wave) Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies. \n15     EXT. THEO'S CAR\t\t\t\t      15 \nMillie's furry slippers protrude from the driver's side door. Zeus chews furiously on the yellow plastic 'Bowler On Board' sign. She rifles through the contents of the overstuffed glove compartment. She notices her dog. \nMILLIE (under her breath) Get that outta your mouth! \n16     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM\t\t\t 16 \nTHEO They suspended me. \nBUZZ Why'd they suspend you? \nTheo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the room dim, and Buzz seems to recede into the far distance. \n17     TV SCREEN - FLASHBACK\t\t\t\t17 \nIn ultra-slow scan we see an image of two bowlers, one is smiling cockily to off-screen fans and waving, the other is Theo, his face filled with hate, winding up to smash the other man in the head with his bowling ball. \nTHEO (VO) It wasn't really my fault. \nIn the far background the hollow booming VOICE of a judge delivers sentence. \nJUDGE (VO) The American Bowling Congress hereby suspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all professional bowling activities within the jurisdiction of the American Bowling Congress and its international co- signers... The ball mashes into the smirking mans head, causing it to snap forward. The judge's gavel BANGS and the crowd ROARS. \n18     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM\t\t\t 18 \nTheo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Buzz leans in. \nBUZZ I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day. \nTHEO They suspended me for 100 years. \nBUZZ 100 years! (knits his brow) \nTHEO I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli. \n", "test2_true": "THEO (sweating slightly) I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king. \nBUZZ Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress. (briskly changing subject) Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips? \nTHEO I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron. \nCUT TO: \n19     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, KITCHEN\t\t\t\t 19 \nMillie and Buzz are in the kitchen, talking in loud whispers. Millie fills a blender while Buzz cuts oranges. \nMILLIE He's the guy Buzz. \nBUZZ He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips. \nMILLIE I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps. \nBUZZ Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here. \nMILLIE You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley. \nBUZZ Millie, I know what I'm doing. \nMILLIE We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house. \n20     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM\t\t\t 20 \nBuzz rejoins Theo in the living room. \nTHEO Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame. \nBUZZ Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark. \nTHEO Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame. \nBUZZ That game was before you was born. \nTHEO My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.' \n21     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, KITCHEN\t\t\t\t 21 \nThe blender is wailing at high speed as Millie throws in a whole box of laxative, a can of Drano and a jar of pills. Her hands are trembling. \n22     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM\t\t\t 22 \nMillie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and safe. There is laughter coming from both men. \nBUZZ And the irony is, thirty years later, that prick is bowling in the seniors on TV all over the world, and look at me. Ah well. The docs made me stop, on account of my ticker. (taps his chest) I don't really miss it, but then... (chokes up) ...I miss it. \nHe spies Millie approaching with the tray. \nBUZZ Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass. \n", "test2_id": 2584, "test3_input": "SHEILA Don't go near the bowling alley. \nKASTLE (enunciating clearly) Bowling \"Center\"! \nKastle hands her the card and heads into the house. \nSHEILA It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it? \nTHEO Nope, I couldn't care less. \nSHEILA I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right? \nTHEO Why should I help that old fuck. \nSHEILA (sarcastically) Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you? \nTHEO Zip. \nSHEILA And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow. \nTHEO (exhaling cigar smoke) Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. (goes to take another drag, then stops) Too late for what? \nShe turns away. \nSHEILA Nothing. \nTHEO Too late for what, Sheila? \nSHEILA You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming? \nTHEO You got any broken bones? \nSHEILA No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it. \nTHEO Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable. \nSHEILA (faltering) I can't tell you, Theo. \nTHEO Why not? \nSHEILA I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders. \nTHEO (gently) Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head. \nSHEILA I'm afraid you'll hurt him. \nTHEO It's Junior, isn't it. \nSHEILA (starting to cry) I can't - I can't do it.

The scream is cut off. With a THUD, the camera falls over and hits the floor. The golf ball rolls slowly into view, and stops. Footsteps recede, a door slams, and a car drives away. \nCUT TO: \n62     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES - NIGHT\t\t\t   62 \nTheo and Sheila walk her Vespa up to the darkened alley. Theo is wearing his own clothes again. The SOUND of a lone bowler is heard. Theo straps on his wristbrace. Sheila pulls out keys. \nSHEILA These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm. \nSHEILA You don't have to do this.

MILES 'O' LANES\t\t\t\t 63 \nTheo snakes his way along the rows of pin machines, towards the only light source - lane six. As he leans in to peer through the machine, a ball EXPLODES into the pins. Junior, wearing his elaborate bowling claw, is working himself into a sweaty froth. Junior picks up his ball and sends it CRASHING into the pins. \nTHEO Knock-knock. \nJUNIOR (stops and looks around) Who's there? \nTheo remains silent. \nJUNIOR (getting angry) Who's there! \nTHEO Buzz Fazeli. \nJUNIOR NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.

I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another. \nJUNIOR You shouldn't touch her. \nTHEO No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her. \nJUNIOR Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her. \nTHEO What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees.

...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens. Slightly larger than the size of a pupil. 
She slips them on.  A bright smile. 
GIN How do I look, honey? 
And Mac smiles.  In return. 
MAC Like a woman.  Of mystery. 
INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT 
Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven. And speaking of heaven... 
...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm, part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us PAN TO... 
...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers, mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and somehow... 
...tender enough.  To suggest real love. 
LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles... 
This is the moment. 
GIN In the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building.  Is a room with two computers.  One for you. And one for me. 
MAC Glad I have a function, here. 
GIN The room is a vault on the 14th floor.  Access codes to that room are changed daily, computer pass- words on the hour, but... 
But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her. 
GIN Four men in the world.  Don't need codes.  Their retinas will scan to unlock everything.  One of these is China's Minister of Finance. 
She lifts the goggles... 
MAC And his retinal plate is in there. 
Yep. 
MAC Our trade for the great train robbery.  All right, let's say we're in the door.  Now what? 
From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to reveal a shiny metallic DISC. 
GIN Hong Kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks. In hundreds of separate accounts... 
Holds up the metallic disc. 
GIN This CD ROM is programmed to send, instantaneously, thousands of instruc- tions, with all necessary confirmation codes, to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those accounts.... 
MAC Modest. 
GIN Two or three million at a crack, in odd numbers.  Total, eight billion.  And change. 
MAC And you've set up a laundry. 
GIN Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches, Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel Islands, the Caymans... 
MAC (quietly) Seychelles? 
GIN (beat) I left that out. 
MAC You're forgiven. 
GIN Thank you.  As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else, til the Mafia couldn't find it. 
MAC But those first instructions, transferring the 8 billion dollars. They're recorded in the main computer. 
She waggles the disc. 
GIN Nope.  The CD instructs the computer to erase the real transactions. And replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded XJ6. Little homage to Limeyland, there. 
MAC Dearest.  The accounts won't reconcile. 
She waggles the disc.  Again. 
GIN Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer to over-report all account totals forever, in the exact amounts we've lifted.  So the Chinese think the money's still there. 
On this one.  He has to smile. 
MAC The money.  Is still.  Missing. 
GIN Sure, the foreign banks know they sent out some money.  But they think Hong Kong knows it, too.  And since we're leaving plenty in every account... 
MAC The shit doesn't splatter.  Until the first account runs dry. 
Exactly. 
GIN And then.  Comes the really brilliant part of the whole thing! 
MAC I was hoping there'd be one. 
He settles back.  Looks at her. 
GIN Admit it, so far you're blown away. 
Well... 
MAC It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
And his fingers reach out...

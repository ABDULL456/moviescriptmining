ROCK LEDGE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nBLACK \nFADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice ECHOES as if in a great cavern. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO We are the secret of the Universe. \nRESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES Bi-la kaifa. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO We are the secret of the Universe. We know of spice...the spice called melange...the greatest treasure in the Universe. It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis, Dune. We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will awaken. \nRESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES Bi-la kaifa. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO And now the prophecy... \nSilence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding in the cavernous space. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D) He will come...the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness. He will have been born of a Bene Gesserit mother. The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice. \nThe picture FADES. \n1B.  KAITAIN - A SCENE FROM SPACE \nHome planet of House Corrino and Shadam IV, Emperor of the known universe. \n2.   INT. DROP - NIGHT \nFADE IN to: \n...interior of one drop of water. The image changes subtly. \n2A.  EXT. - DROP - NIGHT \nPULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the drop. There is a distant ROARING and within the drop we can see the distorted image of a space ship landing on a sophisticated landing field. \n3.   (Deleted) \n3A. EXT. LANDING FIELD - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nOn the dark landing field, chemicals spill out of the ship in troughs and tank-suited Guildsmen begin to swarm out of a hatch opening. \n4. through 6.  (Deleted) \n7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nThe EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in his Throne Room. \nSuddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly begin to clear the large room. Several women are rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman, IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring look to her father, the Emperor. \nIRULAN Father. EMPEROR Irulan. \nShe sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The Emperor moves away from his officers to the center of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black uniform, thinking. \nThe Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar Officers leave her alone with the Emperor. \nEMPEROR (quickly) A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes! \nREVEREND MOTHER We felt his presence. \nEMPEROR I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished. \nREVEREND MOTHER Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions.... \nREVEREND MOTHER (V.O.) (an excited whisper) A chance for escape? But for whom? \n15.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nEMPEROR Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank. \nNAVIGATOR LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life. \n16.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE  - NIGHT \nREVEREND MOTHER (V.O.) He shouldn't speak of this... \n15.  BACK TO SCENE \nNAVIGATOR ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond...to have superior powers... Our power to fold space is in the spice... Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets... You would be lost. \nEMPEROR I can assure you... \nNAVIGATOR Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT... \n16.  BACK TO SCENE \nREVEREND MOTHER (V.O.) Here it comes... \n17.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nNAVIGATOR We ourselves... foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul Atreides. \nEMPEROR You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides... his father. Page missing 24.  EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT \nHigh on the rock cliff stands Castle Caladan, Its appearance us dark and medieval. There is a window on the seaward wall lit from within... \n25.  INT. TRAINING ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT \n...by a drifting glowglobe. Paul sits at an L-shaped table studying filmbooks and maps of Arrakis and the Universe. \n25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK \nWe SEE vast star fields and galaxies. \n25.  BACK TO SCENE \nPAUL (whispering) Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond... \n25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK \nWe SEE the galaxies move as we HEAR a HUM. \nPAUL (V.O.) (whispering) ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis. \nWe HOLD on this, then we see Arrakis grow larger in the filmbook screen and we SEE it is a planet of vast deserts. \n25.  BACK TO SCENE \nPAUL (whispering again) It does look dry.... \n25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK \nThe picture grows larger again, and we see the Arrakeen Valley. FILMBOOK (V.O.) Each day the palms along the outer wall of the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men. The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city Fremen. \n25.  BACK TO SCENE \nPAUL Where are the Harkonnens from here? \n25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK \nThe star fields and galaxies move slightly then. \nPAUL (V.O.) (whispering) There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy. \n25.  BACK TO SCENE \nPAUL Well, how do the Fremen survive there? \nYUEH We don't know much about the Fremen... They live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes... \nPAUL (smiling) The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways? \nTHUFIR Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily. \nPAUL (rising) The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke! \nPaul bows. \nTHUFIR (CONT'D) Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence. \nPAUL I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going? \nTHUFIR We have our new army. (in the same breath) Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him. \nThufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end of the training room, calls out to them. \nTHUFIR (CONT'D) Clear and lock the room. \nGurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS above each doorway. \nTHUFIR (CONT'D) Activate a fighter. \n25C. ROBOT FIGHT \nSuddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling. As the robot begins to rotate and go through several frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box. Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound through the weirding module as he rushes towards the robot. \nGURNEY (to Yueh) Precise control.... \n26.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT \nThe hallway is empty in the foreground but in the distance a changing of the guard is seen. 26A. through 26B.   (Deleted) \n27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT \nPaul walks down the stairway.  In the distance, moving troops are packing Atreides belongings. Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried blood. \nPAUL The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen? \nSuddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant black head. \nPAUL (happily) Duncan! \nDUNCAN Paul. (they shake hands) I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I have to go on ahead. \nPAUL Why?  I wish you were coming with us. \nDUNCAN It's something for your father.  He wants to talk to you. (places hand on Paul's chest) I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of God be with you. \nPAUL May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan. \n28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT \nPaul walks to meet his father near the wall. \nPAUL (diffident) Father. \nDUKE LETO Thank you for joining me, Paul. (voice tired) It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us. 28A. (Deleted) \n28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA \nThey look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes below. \nThe Duke turns to Paul. \nDUKE LETO (CONT'D) (inner voice) My son. (out loud) Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations....  He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud... \nPAUL I want you to be proud of me. \nJESSICA I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes. \nREVEREND MOTHER And your son will pay with you. \n42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT \nUnder a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on a scroll-like piece of paper. \nFinishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING. \nHe pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside the window. \nFADE TO: \n35.  BACK TO SCENE \nPaul enters the room and Jessica closes the door behind them. \nJESSICA Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... (to Reverend Mother) Please... REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace. \nJESSICA Your Reverence. \nPAUL (inner voice) What does she fear? (out loud) What about my Father? \nJESSICA Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. \nJessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if two people are talking -- one normal and the other gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is strange, yet subtle. \nREVEREND MOTHER (using The Voice) Now you come here. \nPaul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he fights her controlling him. \nPAUL (inner voice) She's using The Voice. (out loud) No. \nShe sees him struggling. \nREVEREND MOTHER (inner voice) Some strength there. Surprising! (out loud) Come here. \nThe Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube. \nREVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D) See this... Put your right hand in the box. \nPaul stares at the hole in the box. PAUL What's in the box? \nREVEREND MOTHER Pain. \nJust then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away. \nREVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D) (The Voice) STOP! Put your hand in the box. \nPaul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face. \nPAUL (inner voice) The Voice again. \nREVEREND MOTHER I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals. \nPAUL Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal? \nREVEREND MOTHER Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat. \nPAUL (whispering) It burns. \nREVEREND MOTHER SILENCE... SILENCE. \nPAUL (inner voice)(struggling to compose himself) I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling. \nREVEREND MOTHER You feel the flesh crisping? \n36.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE \nPaul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all sorts of sores. The skin is bubbling. \n47.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nThe surface of the planet is a vast sea of black oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the city there are rows of huge black towering steel heads atop massive furnaces. SMOKE billows out of their mouths. \n48.  INT. CABLE CAR - GIEDI PRIME - DAY \nInside the cable car stands PITER. In one hand he holds the cylinder with DUKE Leto's ring imprint. \nPITER It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. \n48A. INT. GREEN PORCELAIN ROOM - GEIDI PRIME \nSomewhere in the interior of Geidi Prime, we are in a green porcelain room. Two large Harkonnen soldiers, using large hoses, are washing down the walls and floors of the room. WE MOVE DOWN into the water rushing along the floor towards troughs. Closer, WE SEE bits of flesh, hair, and blood. \n49.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nThe car zooms past gigantic faces, and the furnaces far below ROAR with tremendous power. The city now looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of electrical cables stretch off the top into dark energy taps above the city. 50.  INT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nInside the city the cable car passes into a huge inner chamber filled with open-topped lime green porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines criss-crossing above. \n51.  (Deleted) \n52.  INT. BARON'S ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nIn front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body. The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room. \nPITER My Lord! \nBARON Piter. \nPiter moves up to the Baron. \nPITER The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto. \nBARON What does Leto say, Piter? \nPITER He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you. \nBARON (swallowing; angry) I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed. \nHe throws down the cylinder. \nPITER As you instructed me, I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t... BARON My plan! \nPITER The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd, Rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor. \nDOCTOR Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat. \nHis assistant does so. \nRabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty container of tiny animal meat into the dark water trough running through the center of the room. Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter, holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall opposite the Baron. \nBARON (as the Baron watches the boy) You're so beautiful my Baron Your skin, love to me Your diseases lovingly cared for For all eternity. \nBARON I will have Arrakis back for myself... he who controls the Spice, controls the universe... and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto.  This person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar. \nFEYD Who is the traitor? \nBARON (laughs) I won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom. The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The Attendants stand completely still with fear. \nThe Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug, located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS continue to roar. \n52A. through 52B.   (Deleted) \n52C. EXT. ATREIDES SHIP - CALADAN - DAY \nA DRUM CORPS pounds out a powerful cadence in front of a water and cannon show as the Duke, Paul and Jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship.  In the doorway, they turn back for a final look. \nThe Duke places a hand on Paul's shoulder.  We see the signet ring.  Jessica is there.  She tries to get Paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to his father. \nJESSICA (turning away) (inner voice) I must not fear.  Fear is the mind- killer... the little death that brings total obliteration... \nMENTAL IMAGES \n89.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER \nA blurred Guild Navigator. \n89A. INT. MAKER ROOM - SEITCH TABR - NIGHT \nPaul dead on a stone floor. \n89B. EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT \nFire burning. \n90.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nJessica continues to tremble. \nJESSICA (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto! 91.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nOutside in the passageway, feet suddenly move quietly toward the door to Jessica's room. \n92.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nJessica HEARS this and looks up just as the Shadout Mapes silently enters her room. \nJESSICA (staring at the blue-eyed woman -- waiting for possible danger.) Yes? \nSHADOUT MAPES I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders. \nJESSICA You may refer to me as \"my lady.\" I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... \"Shadout\"... that's an ancient word. \nMAPES (strangely asked) You know the ancient tongues? \nJESSICA I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages. \nMAPES As the legend says. \nJESSICA (inner voice) That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. (out loud) I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin. \nMapes takes a step backward to flee. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice. MAPES My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one. \nJESSICA And the means of my death should I prove otherwise. (inner voice) Now we will see which way the decision tips. \nSlowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a sheathed knife. She unleashes it. \nMAPES Do you know this my lady? \nJESSICA (inner voice) It could only be one thing.... (out loud) It's a crysknife. \nMAPES Say it not lightly... (very slowly) Do you know its meaning? \nJESSICA (inner voice) Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. (out loud) It's a maker... \nMapes SCREAMS with elation and grief. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) (inner voice) Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... (out loud) Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker? \nMAPES My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock. \nMapes sheathes the blade... slowly JESSICA (inner voice) There's more here... yes! (out loud) Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded. \nWith a GASP Mapes drops the knife into Jessica's hands and opens her blouse. \nMAPES Take the water of my life! \nJessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and, with the blade, scratches a line just above Mapes' right breast. \nMAPES (CONT'D) You are ours.... You are the one. \nPAUL No one. It... seemed the proper way. \nKYNES That it is. (inner voice) He shall know your ways as if born to them. \nKyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely now. \nGURNEY We're wasting time, Sire. \nDuke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the ornithopter... \n88. Through 89B.    (Deleted) \n90.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nJessica trembles. \nJESSICA (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto! \n91. Through 92.          (Deleted) \n93C. EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - TUNNEL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \n...and the thopter turns slowly as it goes up into the light. \n93D. (Deleted) 93E. EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nFrom outside the Palace's atomic shield we see the blur of the ornithopter pass through a porthole and come out perfect like a gleaming jewel. \n93F. Through 94.    (Deleted) \n94A. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nKYNES Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting. \n95.  EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nThey crest the top of the wall which opens out into a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy distance, flashes of light can be seen. \n96.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nPAUL Will we see a worm? \nKYNES Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. \nPAUL Always? \nKYNES Always. \nPAUL Why do they come? \nKYNES To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. PAUL (inner voice) I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. (out loud, suddenly) Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice? \nKynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes. \nGURNEY The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe. \nKynes takes a second look at young Paul. \nKYNES As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows. \n97. Through 97A.    (Deleted) \n98.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nGURNEY Dust cloud ahead, Sire. \nKYNES That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice. \nDUKE LETO Wormsign? Is it wormsign? KYNES Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp eyes Sire.... May I? \nKynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct frequency. \n106. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - DAY \nDUKE LETO (yelling at the men) Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!! \nThe ground is really shaking now.  A tremendous low THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping HISS. \nKYNES (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over the noise) I can't see him yet but he's very close... DUKE LETO (out loud to himself as he watches the men scrambling) Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy. \nFOUR MEN begin tumbling into the Duke's machine. \nGURNEY Come on boys... come on. (Then, to the Duke) We're going to be heavy, Sire. \nThe men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK with static electricity. \nKYNES (nervous) Here he is... We've got to go. \nThe Duke closes the doorways, surveys the area one last time, then takes the controls. \n106A.     INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nThe ship strains and lifts off -- slowly. \nPaul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of the men... their bluish eyes.  He smells the spice. He begins to feel its affect. \nPAUL (inner voice as a blinding light comes and goes) Spice!... pure un-refined spice! \nKYNES (murmuring) Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world. \nDUKE LETO (yelling) What's that you're saying? \nKYNES Nothing. \nA spice miner turns and sees Kynes, who remains silent. SPICE MINER #1 (astonished) Liet! \nSPICE MINER #2 Shhhhh. \nPaul hears this, then looks to Kynes -- locks on his image. \nPAUL (inner voice) Liet? \nKYNES (pointing down and yelling) You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch! \nPaul looks down as the Duke banks over the harvester. \n107. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY \nStatic electricity is IGNITING in the air and the sand is swirling around the harvester.  Then they see it.  A wide hole emerges from the sand, glistening spokes within it. The hole is twice the size of the harvester.  Suddenly the machine turns and slides into the hole, parts of it EXPLODING.  The SOUND is deafening.  The Duke's ship is WHINING to stay aloft. \n108. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY \nGURNEY Gods, what a monster. \nDUKE LETO Someone is going to pay for this... I promise. \nKYNES (inner voice -- as he studies the Duke) This Duke is more concerned over his men than the spice!  I must admit... against all better judgement... I like this Duke. \nFADE TO: \n109. through 113B.  (Deleted) 114. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT \nDuke Leto walks into the room.  The NIGHT GUARD comes to attention as he passes.  DUNCAN IDAHO, wearing a dark, dusty stillsuit, emerges from the shadows.  DUKE LETO and DUNCAN meet at the foot of the steps.  The men embrace and separate. \nDUKE LETO (happily) Duncan!  What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why haven't we heard from you? \nDUNCAN My lord... I suspect so much.  I think they are the allies we seek... they are strong and fierce... they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly....  As you know, the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone thinks that there are but few -- wandering here and there in the desert.... My lord, I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet... that the Fremen exist in vast numbers... vast numbers... and it is they that control Arrakis. \n115. through 116.

Billowing SMOKE clouds column upwards, forming a black wriggling death curtain around the Palace. \n124. INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT \nTroops are running through the passageway, right and left.  SMOKE is everywhere and the horrible SOUNDS of the explosions continue.  The SOUNDS of stone crunching, shifting, and breaking.  SCREAMS.  A wall of stone suddenly cracks open.  A burst of air and dust shoots out, HISSING.  The Duke's dog runs through the passageway WHINING with fear. 125. (Deleted) \n125A.     EXT. HARKONNEN SHIP - LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - NIGHT \nSardaukar rush out of a Harkonnen ship.

An ATREIDES SOLDIER's head is hit with a large white hot piece of explosion.  Through the black smoke, large SARDAUKAR chase after THREE SOLDIERS and them with hydraulic knife-guns.  One blade enters the back of one man's head and comes out his nose.  Tremendous NOISE of battle.  Gurney and a squad of TROOPERS climb through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the Duke's dog safely inside his coat.  The little dog's head sticks out -- looking about.  Gurney strokes the dog's neck when the reach safety behind some rock.  Small glimpses, as the smoke moves this way or that, let them see thousands of Sardaukar fighting. \nGURNEY LONG LIVE DUKE LETO! \nTROOPERS Long live Duke Leto! \nThe CRY from the men rings out as they attack with frenzy equalling that of the Sardaukar. \n127. INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT \nThe distant HAMMERING of the Harkonnen hammer ship. Jessica's eyes open and she sees two big boots but they seem to be floating above the stone floor she is lying on.  She is gagged and tied.  She looks up. She sees the huge Baron Harkonnen staring down at her.  In the distance she HEARS the battle raging. BARON The drug was timed.  Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us....  What a pity you must remain gagged.  We can't let ourselves be swayed by your witch's Voice, now, can we? \nJESSICA (inner voice) Leto... where are you? \n86.  INT. A ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nDr. Yueh covers his face with his hands in a darkened room... sobbing. \n127. BACK TO SCENE \nThe Baron floats across the room with suspensor- borne lightness. \nBARON Goodbye, Jessica and goodbye to your sweet son....  I want to spit once on your head... just some spittle on your face -- what a luxury. \nHe spits on her cheek.  The Baron floats out of the room into the passageway. \nBARON (CONT'D) We were ordered to kill them... so kill them. \n129. BACK TO SCENE - BATTLE \n127. BACK TO SCENE \nNEFUD What are your orders, Piter? \nPITER Take them to the desert, as the traitor suggested and worms will destroy the evidence.  Their bodies must never be found. 129. BACK TO SCENE - BATTLE \n127. BACK TO SCENE \nPITER (whispering to Jessica, rubbing the spittle around on her face with his hand, delicately) I'd thought of many pleasures with you. It is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm.  Desire clouds my reason....  That is not good... that is bad. \n129. BACK TO SCENE \n128. INT. SUB-BASEMENT PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT - SHIELD EFFECT \nDuncan Idaho kills a Sardaukar soldier and rushes forward frantically.  His eyes blaze intensely.  He yells out to the other Atreides soldiers. \nJESSICA (inner voice) The calming exercise. \nHARKONNEN GUARD #1 The little one! (they laugh) \nSuddenly, Guard #1 reaches around and puts his hand up Jessica's skirt.  He starts breathing hard.  Paul clears his throat. \nPAUL (using The Voice) Remove her gag! \nJESSICA (inner voice) Excellent! \nGuard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag. Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems powerless to stop him.  Once, it's off Jessica smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter floor. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) (The Voice) There's no need to fight over me. \nThe two men stare at one another a moment.  Then Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off into a dangerous nose dive. \nHARKONNEN GUARD #1 Now? \nJESSICA (The Voice) First cut my son's bonds. Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield Wall. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) (The Voice) That's it. \nThe blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's legs.  Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's too late.  The ship falls into the rock. \n130A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT \nThe `thopter slides across the rock, shearing off a wing.  Suddenly they are beyond the rock three miles above the great desert and plummeting fast toward the dunes below. \n130. BACK TO SCENE \nPaul pulls desperately on the controls and manages to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep desert. \nJESSICA Oh, my God! \n131. through 131A.  (Deleted) \n131B.     EXT.

Someone's torn the insignia off your uniform.  Such carelessness. \nLeto shows no sign that he has heard. PITER It was Feyd. \nLeto's POV:  The Baron and his Mentat are only DIM FARAWAY SHAPES.  Their voices reach Leto as if travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him over. \nBARON It was Feyd? (laughing) It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring. \nPITER The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I... \nBARON You killed the doctor too soon, you fool! \nDUKE LETO (inner voice) Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica safe... the tooth! \nPITER He's coming round, my Lord. \nThe Baron moves from behind a table stacked with dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to Leto. \nDUKE LETO (inner voice) Wait... he must be near... \nBARON Where is your ring? \nThe Baron's face is now very close to Duke Leto's. \nBARON (CONT'D) You do not answer! \nPaul plants the thumper which begins a powerful rhythmic noise.  He turns to Jessica. \nPAUL (returning) Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper. \nJESSICA (puts in her noseplug) I'm ready. \nPaul and Jessica move into camera and exit right. \n151B.     EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT \nAnother burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to ache.  Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind them. \nPAUL Keep going... \n152. EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER) \nTheir breathing becomes very labored.  The sand moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up. Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops. Paul turns. \nPAUL Faster!! JESSICA (screaming) It's deafening! \nTheir bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look. \n153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT \nA flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed. The power of this worm is awesome. \n153A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT \nPAUL (screaming) Run! \nJESSICA I can't... I can't. \nShe turns to see.  Then she runs. \n153B.     EXT. DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT \nAll at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand. The SOUND is very loud. \nPAUL Drum sand! \nThe DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground. Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud. Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm changes.  They turn. \n154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT \nThe gigantic head of the worm is just breaking through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth arches forward searching for them. \n155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT \nPaul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow slit of rock. 155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT \nThe worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot penetrate the narrow opening in the rock. \n156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT \nPaul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of hundred feet. \n156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT \nStill the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS drive through the black stone.  Over and over again the worm mindlessly hits at the rock. \n156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT \nPaul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock prevents them from moving back any more. \n156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT \nThe breath from the worm is like a hurricane of WIND. \nPAUL (inner voice) Cinnamon... the spice! (out loud) Do you smell it? \nJESSICA Yes... \nJESSICA Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit. \nA FREMEN It is the legend. \n167. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT \nUp on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It is a girl. \nCHANI I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe. \nPAUL (inner voice) From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter? \nPaul stares at her in wonder. CHANI Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way down. \nThey exit. \n168. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT \nSTILGAR (to Paul, as they meet) You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly. \nPAUL (thinking) What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon? \nSTILGAR We call that one Muad'dib. \nPAUL Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib? \nSTILGAR You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you. \nWind blows a cloud of dust through the rock.  High above the moon with the mouse shadow glows brilliantly.  It dissolves into the sun. \n168A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY \nPaul, Jessica and the Fremen march through the dunes. \n171. through 171B.  (Deleted) \n172. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DUSK/SUNSET \nHEAT WAVES and sand dunes.  Mysterious SOUNDS echo in the distance as the giant sun is setting. \nChani takes Paul to the top of a dune.  They stare at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the distance. CHANI Seitch Tabr. \nPaul looks at the rock, then turns to her. \nCHANI (CONT'D) Tell me of your homeworld, Usul. \nThese words rend Paul's soul.  He cannot speak.  He reaches out and touches her hand - her cheek. \n173. (Deleted) \n174. INT. ENTRANCE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nThe Fremen troop enters into a large square room with slot passageways going off in various directions. \n175. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nThey all move down one of the passageways which are beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns.  They are like passages in the pyramids, dark with sharp turns and inclines upwards or downwards, some very steep and long, and others descending hundreds of feet.  There is a strong, moaning WIND. \n176. through 177.   (Deleted) \n178. INT. PASSAGEWAY/STAIRS - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nA quiet WIND can be heard -- deep and moaning. \nJESSICA Moisture... \nShe looks at Paul.  He, too, notices. \nPAUL Wind traps... huge ones. \nDown a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go until they reach a stairway cut into the stone.  It is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly opens out on something so totally unexpected it shocks Paul. 179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nDISSOLVE TO: \n183. through 187.   (Deleted) 188. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nFremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns to Paul and Jessica with a strange look. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (to Jessica, in an ancient voice) So you are the ones. \nShe turns away towards the monks who are very busy blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice, purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low notes below. \nPaul looks to his mother. \nHe then sees Chani. \nCU Chani. \nCU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her. \nStilgar motions to Paul. \nSTILGAR (whispering to Paul) Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning. \nHe shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very strange and somewhat horrifying scene. \n189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nA thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a beautiful deep blue bile as it dies. \n189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nThe bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial containers.  Paul turns to Stilgar. STILGAR The Water of Life. \nPAUL (inner voice) The most lethal poison in the Universe. \nThen we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation with the Reverend Mother: \nREVEREND MOTHER ... Many men have tried. \nPAUL Did they try and fail? \nREVEREND MOTHER They tried and died. \n190. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nStilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move back carrying their smoking cleansing bags. \nMONK #1 One among us has consented to enter the rite.  She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother. \nPAUL (inner voice)(turning to his mother) What if she should fail? \nHe brings the jug close to Jessica. \nMONK #1 Drink! \nJessica drinks. \nJESSICA (inner voice) The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I must transform the poison configuration within my body... the blue must be made clean. \nShe swallows.  Her body contorts and spasms violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother screams with her. 191  (Deleted) \n192. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nWe see Jessica sitting, shoulders tight and spasming -- straining, her eyelids half-closed and flickering. \n193. (Deleted) \n194. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nThe old Reverend Mother slowly extends a hand toward Jessica's shoulder. \n195. JESSICA - MENTAL IMAGE \n170. INT. BASEMENT ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nNefud stands eating candies behind Thufir's chair. Nefud has a stun gun, even though Thufir's hands are tied.  The Baron enters with Feyd. \nBARON Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already....  Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.  But this is not why we're here.  We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it if you wish to live.  A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day....  Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.  You know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat... \nThufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare. \nFEYD All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill. \nBARON Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now, aren't you Thufir? \nTHUFIR (inner voice) My dear Duke... how I have failed you. 211. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nJessica's face shows signs of straining.  Women move around her, Chani and Harah at her side, helping her give birth.  Suddenly ALIA is born and her freshly- born moist body is held up in front of Jessica. Alia's eyes snap open, burning brightly. \nHARAH What will you call her? \nJESSICA Alia. \nAs they lift Alia for Jessica to see... \nALIA Mother. \n210. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nPaul walks down the steps into the training room - followed by Harah's two sons.  He pauses at the foot of the steps. \nPAUL Activate your weirding modules... \nPaul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit. \nPAUL Set the range for two meters. \nPaul walks down the line of Fremen. \nPAUL Korba... (points to robot) The arm... \nKORBA (aiming the module) Chuuk-sa... \nPAUL Motion... Chuuk-sa... \nKORBA Chuuuk-sa... \nHe fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot off.  Paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder - Paul walks on. PAUL Stilgar... \nOne of the FREMEN calls out to Paul. \nA FREMEN Muad'dib!... \nThe word `Muad'dib' causes a tremendous power to build.  The module shakes violently in his hand - it suddenly fires upwards, and the wall explodes. \nPAUL (inner voice) My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well? \n211A.     NEW SCENE \nSTILGAR (to Paul as he applies red colour to the shoulders of several large Fremen men) Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin. \nHe pauses, then holds up his brilliantly red hand. \n212. (Deleted) \n213. EXT. DESERT - DAY \nAn EXPLOSION.  Paul turns and his eyes are totally blue.  He lifts binoculars to them and looks.  He sees the Fremen fighters below charging at the Harkonnens.  As the Fremen run they make powerful SOUNDS with their weirding modules, exploding everything in their path and catching things on fire. \n213A.     EXT. CARRYALL - DESERT - DAY \nIn the distance, a huge spice carryall is shot down and it falls to the ground EXPLODING more violently on impact. \n213. BACK TO SCENE \nCut to Paul screaming horribly in the desert. \n235. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nAlia walks forward in the very dark room.  Blood rushes from her nose.  She forces herself to walk to Jessica's bed.  She finds that Jessica's nose is bleeding also.  Jessica wakes in pain.  They stare at each other in the darkness. \nJESSICA ALIA! \nALIA Mother - help me! \nJESSICA (struggling) Alia!  What is it? ALIA It's Paul.  He's taken the Water of Life. \n233C.     INT.

PAUL'S MIND \nNavigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam. Navigator bursts into a huge light ring and we quickly travel through ring after ring and masses of liquid stars.  The light increases until it is blinding and then in the light... 235B.     EXT.

She cuts the rope bonds with her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the whole of the desert. \nPaul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani stares at him in awe. \nCHANI Paul... Paul. 240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING \nA huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands. \n240C.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT \nPAUL Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED. \nGiant echoes of this phrase reverberate across the vast desert.  The worms bend back into the sand and leave with thundering power. \nMUSIC FULL. \n266. EXT.

STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY \nEMPEROR Bring in that floating fat man... the Baron. \nThe Baron is brought in.  Distant warning SIGNALS begin.  The Baron is fighting to contain his fear because RABBAN'S HEAD SITS ALL BLOODY ON THE FLOOR in front of him.  Finally the Emperor speaks. \nEMPEROR Why have you brought me here? \nBARON Your Highness... There must be some mistake... I never requested your presence. \nEMPEROR Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it. Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgement in assigning to Rabban -- (he gestures toward the head) -- the governorship....  You forced me to come here and set things straight... personally. A VOICE Bring in the messenger. \nAlia is brought in by the Sardaukar soldiers.  She is smiling. \nALIA I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you. \nEMPEROR Silence!...  I do not court your brother's pleasure. \nSuddenly the Reverend Mother looks horrified and grabs her throat. \nREVEREND MOTHER (struggling, speaking) Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!! Kill her. (points to Alia, who is smiling at her) Get out of my mind!!! \nALIA Not until you tell them both who I really am. \nREVEREND MOTHER (strained speech void of emotion) Sister of Paul Muad'dib. \nThe Reverend Mother slumps.  The Baron's mouth flies open.  The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips tremble. \nEMPEROR Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?! \nHe turns quickly and looks at the two Guild agents present in the room.  They stare at him icily.  Alia is smiles happily. \n268. INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN - DAY \nPaul smiles. \nPAUL (laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar) Alia keeps pace with the storm.

SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY \n...TWENTY EXPLOSIONS of hydrogen bomb intensity go off in a row, cutting a huge gorge through the width of the massive Shield Wall.

STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY \nAlia smiles as they HEAR the tremendous roaring, atomic screams of the explosions.

I told you... He is here now. \nSARDAUKAR OFFICER #2 Majesty, into the ship! \nEMPEROR (to his officers)(rising) Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this little abomination to the storm. \nThey all leave the room, including the Sardaukars. 270A. through 271.  (Deleted) \nThufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks Thufir over. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (inner voice) A knife.... (out loud) In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish.  Anything at all. (quietly) Do you need my life, old friend? \nHe turns his back on him. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (quiet) It is yours. \nThufir's eyes grow sad and wide. \nPAUL I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to strike, do it now. \nThufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags. \nHis head lolls back and he looks up to Paul urgently. THUFIR (CONT'D) Three... generations... of you... \nHis breath escapes him and he is dead. \nPAUL (to the guards) Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor. \nThe guards do as they are instructed. \nPAUL Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM BACK! \nEMPEROR How dare you speak to me... \nGUILDSMAN #2 (speaking into electric microphone) Stop your speaking!! \nPAUL (to the Guildsmen) Good.  You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it first. \nGUILDSMEN #3 (fear) No! \nPaul smiles as we move closer and closer to him. \n282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE \nSuddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the Heighliner. \nPAUL (V.O.) Where are you....  Let me see you or there will be no spice. We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING. Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator. \nPAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D) You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever. \nThe Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and grows louder and louder. \n283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nThe Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend Mother then turns and glares at Paul. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours. \nREVEREND MOTHER Stop him, Jessica! \nJESSICA Stop him yourself. \nPAUL You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand. \nREVEREND MOTHER You mustn't speak of... \nPAUL (using The Voice) SILENCE! \nThe old woman is shot backwards by the power of his shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine.  I can kill with a word. A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy. \nFEDAYKIN #1 ...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous. \nFeyd hears this and is angered. \nFEYD The righteous! \nPAUL (to Emperor) There is a Harkonnen among you.

Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The machines start; at first low, then they WHINE upwards to a high pitch. When the pitch is steady, a series of levers are pulled. \n74.  EXT. PALACE - ARRAKEEN - DAY \nJust after the second set of levers is pulled, a huge house shield is seen going up in a box shape, encompassing the Palace with SHIMMERING protection. \n75.  EXT. WINDOW - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nFrom a small window, Thufir observes the shield with a critical eye. \nTHUFIR (inner voice; worried) We found these sabotage devices too easily... \n76.  INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nTwo giant glowglobes drift into the Great Hall where Jessica and Dr. Yueh stand watching a giant bull's head is being hung above the massive fireplace. The MOVING TROOPS are unpacking crates and organizing furnishings. Jessica watches them. Distant SOUNDS reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside them. \nDR. YUEH Listen here.... You can here the people of Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry \"Soo Soo Sook\" of the water sellers? \nJESSICA So many reminders of the scarcity of water. \nDR. YUEH Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall... the Harkonnen put them in... to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people.... Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men. \nJESSICA The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them. \nDR. YUEH (swiftly) My wife... you didn't know my wife... they... JESSICA (out loud) Forgive me... (inner voice) ... His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the signs are al over him.... They must have killed here. \nJessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's cheek. \nDR. YUEH I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it. \nAbove them a series of iron curtains begins to open over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in uniform approach. \nATREIDES WOMAN #1 (referring to several robed figures standing in the room) My lady... the local people... the maids and servants await your inspection. Hawat has cleared them. \nDr. Yueh turns to Jessica. \nDR. YUEH The Harkonnens may have tampered medically.... please wait. \nHe turns a yellow light on a moves it over the crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue- within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand shakes slightly. \nJESSICA (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands) He's hiding something -- holding something back. (She studies his face closely.) It's not just his wife... He's a good man though. He's probably trying to save my feelings... (We see her mouth.) I could use The Voice... make him tell me... It would only shame him. (We see her eyes.) I must place more trust in my friends. (We see Yueh turn toward her, fearful.) 77.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nPaul wanders through the darkened passageways alone, his footsteps echoing as goes. He takes pleasure observing the details of the rock Palace but all the while he feels an uneasiness -- a feeling of fear builds in him. \n78.  INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nPaul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the bed. He opens the filmbook, and activates it. \n78A. INSERT - FILMBOOK \nWe SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a narrator speaks over. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) One carryall handles four spice mining teams; however, it will fly only two harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one carryalls.... \n78.  BACK TO SCENE \nPaul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to them and scans them with his poison detector, which he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and the word \"safe\" appears in green light. Paul takes a pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed. Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry. \nPAUL (inner voice) Spice... \nAs he continues eating he notices the sunlight through the slates over the window begins to GLOW white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light GLOWS brilliantly. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (whispering inner voice) Terrible purpose.... What is it? \n78B.

The ground is uneven rock and the ceiling is low. The troops fan out shining chemical lamps here and there. A soldier suddenly stops. Ahead in his light is a dead Harkonnen -- bloody vomit dried around his mouth. He lies beside an electronic device. \n86.  INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nDr. Yueh covers his face with his hands in a darkened room... sobbing. \n86A. EXT. WALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT \nSEARCHLIGHTS sweep over the faces of City Fremen who are sitting or moving solemnly around the outer wall of the Palace. Some are chanting \"Mahdi\" and \"Lisan al-Gaib.\" Others hold up one open hand as a sign they feel the messiah is near. A slow-moving spike- backed dog sucks ants up out of a small anthill; he snorts. \n86B. INT.

OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nDuke Leto sits with Paul, Thufir, EIGHT GENERALS and SIX SUB-LIEUTENANTS. The Duke's small dog wanders under the table and rests his head on the Duke's boot. In front of Thufir is a device FLASHING brilliant light bursts over his face. The others are all talking among themselves. Suddenly Thufir's face turns brilliant red (as red as his sapho-stained lips) and he begins speaking rapidly into the machine in code using a strained high voice. THUFIR (Mentat voice) Sector 6 - 80 -- copy the sixth -- the summit -- the eight the quadrant over the ninth plus eighty -- four circles -- weave the eighty and call the fourth copy -- enter nine -- seven by seven a seven the seven call seven B seven -- enter the circles call the sixth copy the sixth over the summit.... eight. \nThe machine FLASHES several bright irregular SIGNALS. Then it stops and HUMS. The blood leaves Thufir's face. \nTHUFIR (CONT'D) (very fast and casually) Eight.... Thufir Hawat... Mentat... Master of Assassins. \nThe hum stops. Thufir turns to Duke Leto. He looks up. Everyone is quiet now. \nTHUFIR (CONT'D) The Palace is now secure. The city of Arrakeen is under martial law... we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors six through ten. The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield. Our new army is still training, but everything is shielded.... With the shielding, we are impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire, for your inspection of spice mining operations, but since the attempt of the young master, I am against your leaving the Palace. \nDUKE LETO (very angry) The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all know what to do. (Turning towards Gurney) ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice miners... many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men ... any with open sand experience. You must persuade them to enlist with us. GURNEY They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup as the east wind. And they shall gather the captivity of the sand. \nDUKE LETO (squints at Gurney) Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners here in this place. \nGURNEY (artfully easing the Duke's anger) Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work. \nGurney strides off. Thufir sits, contemplating. Paul and Duke Leto smile at each other and shake their heads. \n88.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY \nJessica is sitting in a small room, smiling, reading a note. It reads \"I miss you. Leto.\" She sets the note down. She begins to tremble. She becomes fearful.

She CRIES, pouring out her grief, but soon the sound of it is carried away by the building rush of WIND.  Paul turns and looks out to the open desert, this portion of which is a dust ocean. \n138A.     PAUL'S POV: \nThe Mouse Moon has risen. \nRipples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of the moon.  The WHISPERING grains billow up like the foam of waves as they hit the rock. \n138. BACK TO SCENE \nPaul turns, his face illuminated by the two moons above.  His eyes lock on the moon which has the image of the mouse. PAUL (inner voice) The second moon... from the dreams... \n138B.     INT.

The skin on the Duke's race slowly rips open -- making a hideous tearing SOUND. Black SMOKE issues forth from the hole which teats larger. \nPAUL (V.O.) (distorted) House Atreides is ruined.

MOUSE MOON - NIGHT \nThe moon continues to spew out pieces of moving images which are seen then disappear as fast as sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a fist. \nPAUL (V.O.) I am only a seed... \nThe fist begins to open. \nDUKE LETO (V.O.) The seed must grow. \nThe hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats eerily forward. \nDUKE LETO (V.O.) The sleeper must awaken. \n139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT \nThe last image which passes is foaming and spitting dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to blackness. \n140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT \nThrough the darkness we move to Paul's clenched hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then to his mother. \n", "test2_true": "PAUL The spice!

It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.  I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze. (massaging in rhythm) Give me spice!  Drive them into utter submission.  You must not show the slightest pity or mercy... as only you can...  Never stop! (releasing him) Go....  Show no mercy! \nRABBAN Yes, my lord Baron. \nRabban leaves just as Feyd steps out of the shower. The Baron turns to him lovingly.

ROCK LEDGE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT \nBLACK \nFADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice ECHOES as if in a great cavern. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO We are the secret of the Universe. \nRESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES Bi-la kaifa. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO We are the secret of the Universe. We know of spice...the spice called melange...the greatest treasure in the Universe. It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis, Dune. We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will awaken. \nRESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES Bi-la kaifa. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO And now the prophecy... \nSilence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding in the cavernous space. \nREVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D) He will come...the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness. He will have been born of a Bene Gesserit mother. The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice. \nThe picture FADES. \n1B.

The image changes subtly. \n2A.  EXT. - DROP - NIGHT \nPULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the drop. There is a distant ROARING and within the drop we can see the distorted image of a space ship landing on a sophisticated landing field. \n3.   (Deleted) \n3A. EXT. LANDING FIELD - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nOn the dark landing field, chemicals spill out of the ship in troughs and tank-suited Guildsmen begin to swarm out of a hatch opening. \n4. through 6.  (Deleted) \n7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nThe EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in his Throne Room. \nSuddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly begin to clear the large room. Several women are rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman, IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring look to her father, the Emperor. \nIRULAN Father. EMPEROR Irulan. \nShe sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The Emperor moves away from his officers to the center of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black uniform, thinking. \nThe Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar Officers leave her alone with the Emperor. \nEMPEROR (quickly) A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes! \nREVEREND MOTHER We felt his presence. \nEMPEROR I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished. \nREVEREND MOTHER Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions.... \n", "test1_true": "REVEREND MOTHER Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him. \nEMPEROR He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can. \nREVEREND MOTHER I am your Truthsayer, my lord... (sensing something outside the room) He is here, my lord. \nUnder the carved inscription \"Law is the Ultimate Science\", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the Emperor through a translating device. \nTANKED GUILDSMEN #1 The Bene Gesserit witch must leave. The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother. \nEMPEROR Leave us. \nREVEREND MOTHER Yes, my Lord. \nEMPEROR (after she has gone) We are alone... \n8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nThe Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes her eyes. \n9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nInside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a \"V\" formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens, slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty, pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper. \nThe tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas, and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic chemical spills dripping from under the tank. Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the tank translates into English and broadcasts it into the room. \nNAVIGATOR We have just folded space from Ix... \nEMPEROR (extremely nervous) Yes?... How was your journey? \nNAVIGATOR (after a long pause) Many machines on Ix... new machines. \nEMPEROR Oh yes? NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans. \nEMPEROR Is there a problem?... Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit. \nNo answer. \nNAVIGATOR (finally) The answer is within the problem... \n10.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nOutside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother sits, her eyes closed, straining. \n11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT \nA very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild Navigator. She is not getting the English version but a much different language version which is fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song monologue. \n12.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nNAVIGATOR I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it. \nEMPEROR Yes. \nThe Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and swishes gently in his tank. \nNAVIGATOR You must share with us. EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops. \nNAVIGATOR So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides... \nEMPEROR Yes. \n13.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT \nOutside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches. \n14.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT \nThe Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very close to her. We hear the Navigator speak to her. \nNAVIGATOR (to Reverend Mother, mentally) Reverend Mother... I will give you the Tleilaxu Path. \n", "test1_id": 1710, "test2_input": "47.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nThe surface of the planet is a vast sea of black oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the city there are rows of huge black towering steel heads atop massive furnaces. SMOKE billows out of their mouths. \n48.  INT. CABLE CAR - GIEDI PRIME - DAY \nInside the cable car stands PITER. In one hand he holds the cylinder with DUKE Leto's ring imprint. \nPITER It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. \n48A. INT. GREEN PORCELAIN ROOM - GEIDI PRIME \nSomewhere in the interior of Geidi Prime, we are in a green porcelain room. Two large Harkonnen soldiers, using large hoses, are washing down the walls and floors of the room. WE MOVE DOWN into the water rushing along the floor towards troughs. Closer, WE SEE bits of flesh, hair, and blood. \n49.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nThe car zooms past gigantic faces, and the furnaces far below ROAR with tremendous power. The city now looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of electrical cables stretch off the top into dark energy taps above the city. 50.  INT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nInside the city the cable car passes into a huge inner chamber filled with open-topped lime green porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines criss-crossing above. \n51.  (Deleted) \n52.  INT. BARON'S ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY \nIn front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body. The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room. \nPITER My Lord! \nBARON Piter. \nPiter moves up to the Baron. \nPITER The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto. \nBARON What does Leto say, Piter? \nPITER He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you. \nBARON (swallowing; angry) I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed. \nHe throws down the cylinder. \nPITER As you instructed me, I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t... BARON My plan! \nPITER The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd, Rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor. \nDOCTOR Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat. \nHis assistant does so. \nRabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty container of tiny animal meat into the dark water trough running through the center of the room. Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter, holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall opposite the Baron. \nBARON (as the Baron watches the boy) You're so beautiful my Baron Your skin, love to me Your diseases lovingly cared for For all eternity. \nBARON I will have Arrakis back for myself... he who controls the Spice, controls the universe... and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto.  This person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar. \nFEYD Who is the traitor? \nBARON (laughs) I won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom. The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The Attendants stand completely still with fear. \nThe Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug, located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS continue to roar. \n52A. through 52B.   (Deleted) \n52C. EXT. ATREIDES SHIP - CALADAN - DAY \nA DRUM CORPS pounds out a powerful cadence in front of a water and cannon show as the Duke, Paul and Jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship.  In the doorway, they turn back for a final look. \nThe Duke places a hand on Paul's shoulder.  We see the signet ring.  Jessica is there.  She tries to get Paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to his father. \nJESSICA (turning away) (inner voice) I must not fear.  Fear is the mind- killer... the little death that brings total obliteration... \n", "test2_true": "53.  EXT. HEIGHLINER - SPACE \n3,415 Atreides ships are approaching the Guild Heighliner, which is staggeringly colossal.  The Atreides ships look like dots next to the sun.  The Duke's ship enters the frame and moves toward the Heighliner. \n53A. through 54.    (Deleted) 55.  INT. ATREIDES SHIP - SPACE \nPaul, Jessica and Duke Leto look out the forward viewing glass as tiny lights move outside in the darkness. They hear and feel their ship stop with a huge, echoing, metallic jolt. They look at each other in the silence which follows. \nDUKE LETO Soon they'll begin to fold space. \nPAUL (inner voice) Far off in the control rooms.... Travelling without moving. \nThey wait. \n56.  (Deleted) \n57.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE \nWe pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot high control room filled with orange spice gas. On the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional layered miniature replica of the entire Universe. The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The Navigator turns and emits another piece of light which travels to the opposite side of the Universe. It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges deep into the light. The navigator swims to the point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this hole through the rings of light. The Navigator becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost in darkness. The sounds fade. 58. through 60.     (Deleted) \n60A.

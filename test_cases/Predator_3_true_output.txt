Schaefer turns back to see Anna, staring fixidly at Mac,    * watching his lips.  Schaefer turns quickly to Blain's       * body and kneels alongside Dillon.

is at Blain's side, shocked at the sight of the mutilated body.  He is joined by Dillon.

SCHAEFER (to himself) Blain... (puzzled) ...Just like the others...no powder burns, no shrapnel. 
DILLON The wound all fused, cauterized...what the hell did this? 
Schaefer stands, looking at the body.  In the b.g. Anna drifts away from the group. 
SCHAEFER (to Mac) ...Mac! 
Mac stares ahead, dumbly, not hearing.  He grabs Mac by his shoulders, shaking him violently back to awareness. 
SCHAEFER (demanding; angry) Mac!  Mac!  Look at me! 
Mac turn to face Schaefer, a shocked expression on his face. 
SCHAEFER (urgent) Mac, who did this? 
Mac is suddenly angry and frustrated, he has no explanation. 
MAC I don't know.  Goddamn it, something...I saw something/. 
Ramirez runs from the jungle, breathing hard, shaking his head. 
RAMIREZ Nothing.  The same thing. Not a fucking trace.  No bodies, blood, anything.

Mac stands.  Instinctively the team has now grouped around Schaefer, their weapons pointing into the jungle, ready, their nerves on total edge.  Schaefer looks upward at the darkening sky. 
SCHAEFER (quietly) We're losing the light.  Mac, I want a defensive position above this ridge, mined with everything we're got. 
Man is again the hardened professional. 
MAC Yessir. 
Schaefer looks down at Blain's body.  He turns to Ramirez and Billy. 
SCHAEFER Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning. 
MAC I'll take him. 
99     ANNA                                                  99 
as they leave approaches the brush, her attention focused on something clinging to the leaves, well off to the side of where Mac saw the Hunter.  She draws closer, reaching out, hesitant, as if drawn magnetically to the leaves. 
100     EXT. DETAIL - HUNTER'S BLOOD - DAY                   100 
Clinging to the leaves, thick, viscous, pale-orange, almost like the sap of an exotic plant.  Her fingers hover above it, hesitantly, and then touch it. 
101     ANNA                                                 101 
examines the blood, transfixed.  Dillon appears at her shoulder, startling her.  He motions for her to return. She turns, wiping the blood onto her pants leg. 
102     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DUSK                               102 
The team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of trees, a solid wall to their backs.  The men are barely visible they blend in so well.

102     CONTINUED:                                           102 
Nearby, Mac is stringing a TRIP WIRE, low to the ground, covering it with leaves and grass.  He moves into camp and reports to Schaefer.

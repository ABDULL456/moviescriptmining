He waits for approval. 
Angle shot.  JUDY, BUZZ and group (seen from JIM's angle). He is in f.g.  They are staring at him.  Nobody laughs. 
CRUNCH (flat) Yeah, moo. 
BUZZ Moo.  That's real cute.  Moo. 
GOON Hey, he's real rough-- 
CRUNCH I bet he fights with cows. 
BUZZ Moo. 
They turn from him.  JIM withers and looks front.  JUDY smiles a little and looks away so the others cannot notice her amusement. 
LECTURER (O.S.) Sagittarius and Aries--all as they have ever been. 
PLATO leans in and touches JIM's shoulder, lightly at first, then harder.  JIM turns to him. 
PLATO You shouldn't monkey with him. 
JIM What? 
PLATO He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them. 
JIM I don't want to make friends. 
He turns back, unhappy at having revealed himself. 
Another shot.  JUDY, BUZZ, CRUNCH.  JIM seen in b.g.  The kids are whispering among themselves and pointing at JIM, who looks up and notices.  He is getting uncomfortable. 
LECTURER (O.S.) And while the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled the light years into distance-- 
Full shot.  The dome.  The star rushes nearer, looming larger and larger.  The music rises in tension and volume. 
LECTURER (O.S.) Has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies, we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came. 
Two shot.  JIM and PLATO staring upward, cringing back into their seats as the light on their faces increases.  Music is up loud. 
Full shot.  The dome seen past PLATO's head.  The heavens grow brighter as the star plummets near.  Music at crescendo. 
LECTURER (O.S.) Destroyed as we began in a burst of gas and fire. 
The sky is blasted by a wild flash of light.  Music reaches explosion.  The stars appear again. 
Moving shot.  Faces of normal kids watching seriously--very impressed. 
LECTURER (O.S.) (continuing) The heavens are still and cold once more.  In all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond, the Earth will not be missed. 
Med. shot.  JIM and PLATO looking up. 
LECTURER (O.S.) Through the infinite reaches of space, the problems of Man seem trivial and naive indeed.  And Man, existing alone, seems to be an episode of little consequences. 
PLATO ducks his head down on the back of JIM's chair.  JIM looks at him. 
LECTURER (O.S.) That's all.  Thank you very much. 
The lights go on.  The rustle and confusion of kids stretching after sitting too long.  Scattered applause.  JIM rises and ruffles PLATO's hair. 
JIM Hey, it's over.  The world ended. 
PLATO looks up at him. 
PLATO What does he know about Man alone? 
Med. shot.  LECTURER as he reaches over and turns a dial. "Morning Song" by Grieg comes on softly. Low angle.  OLD LADY TEACHER rising.  She stares around at the bustling students and claps her hands sharply, but the noise is barely heard above the tumult. 
TEACHER (shrill) May I have your attention?  May I please have your attention? Classes will meet at the busses outside.  May I have your attention? (to herself) The heck with it. 
She picks up her coat and bag. 
Planetarium parking lot.  School busses and autos, some new and some heaps, are parked in f.g.  Beyond is the dome of the Planetarium.  Kids mill about, some already driving off in their cars.  One bus, already full, pulls past camera. 
Med. shot.  Front of bus seen from within.  Driver in f.g. Kids swarm up the steps and enter.  PLATO is among them, but keeps looking back for JIM.  PLATO boards the bus and pauses near the driver to peer through windshield.  His face clouds.

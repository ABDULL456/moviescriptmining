The CAMERA STARTS ON A LONG SHOT and DOLLIES THROUGH THE GROUP, passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the impending baby are sketchily HEARD.  The CAMERA CONTINUES toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music sheet of A MAN CHASES A GIRL. 
Betty looks up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her look to Phil, who is dancing with Rita.  Rita nestles up close to Phil.  This is seen by Bob and Betty.  Bob smiles. 
CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND RITA 
On closer view, we can see that Rita is the aggressor. 
PHIL (Referring to the grip) Don't you want me to breathe? 
RITA Not especially. 
PHIL What's gotten into you? 
RITA You were chasing me in Florida. 
PHIL And you were running.  What made you stop? 
RITA You're interested in Judy, aren't you? 
PHIL That's it, eh?  Unless it belongs to someone else, a girl doesn't - Ouch! (Evidently Rita has deliberately stepped on his instep) 
SCENE FROM BOB'S VIEWPOINT 
Betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but yield.  Bob's reaction still implies that this is understandable since Betty loves Phil.  He turns back toward the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and Phil. 
Still at the same camera distance, we see Betty turning Phil over to Judy. 
CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY 
Judy is a little cool. 
PHIL What's the matter? 
JUDY Nothing is the matter. 
PHIL This isn't the way you dance. 
JUDY Some people dance closer than others. 
Phil is delighted that she is jealous. 
PHIL Yes, that's true.  I'm one of the close ones.  That's my type. 
He holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased with himself. 
MED. FULL SHOT - ROOM 
The dance music stops.  The people disperse. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PIANO 
Harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of A MAN CHASES A GIRL.  Bob and Betty are leaning over the piano, Bob humming the melody.  Betty pantomimes to the others to quiet down.  Bob starts to sing the lyric.  In the second chorus, he is joined in the singing by Betty.  During this chorus we CUT TO show various reactions of the group, and end on Phil, sitting close to Judy, holding her hand. 
CLOSE TWO SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY 
We HEAR Bob and Betty, off scene, continuing to the end of the second chorus, on which Phil, sotto voce, sings the last four bars. 
PHIL (Singing; looking at Judy) And once you've caught him, don't ever let him go.

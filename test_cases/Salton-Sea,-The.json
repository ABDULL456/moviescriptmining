She obviously isn't enjoying it. \nDanny watching intently. \nKUJO (cont'd) Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you in on the opportunity of a lifetime, the least you can do is pay attention. \nDanny turns back to the table. Kujo slides another glass over. \nKUJO (cont'd) This is the courier \nCREEPER You should use something smaller. He's the same size as the office. It doesn't ring true. \nKujo rolls his eyes.  He uses a peanut instead. \nOLD MAN (O.S.) And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot .... \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nA courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case. \nKUJO (O.S.) He delivers at four o'clock on the nose every Friday.

CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nHe slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut. \nKUJO (cont'd) ... number two team, which will be me and Jimmy, will be positioned in the stairwell at the other end of the hall. \nKujo slides over two more peanuts. \nThe trashy dude heads into the bathroom.  Danny sneaks another look at Colette.  This time, she gives him a big smile. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo emerges from the stairwell, also alone, approaching the courier. \nHe is wearing shorts, a tank top and after-ski boots.  He has a big powdery crank donut around his nostrils. KUJO (cont'd) With alpha team following from the elevator, number two team will approach from the stairwell, cutting the courier off before he reaches the lab. \nCreeper still fast asleep inside the elevator.   He wakes with a start, breaking down into a karate stance. \nINT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nThe courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the cashew. \nKUJO (cont'd) Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons, the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands. \nINT.

CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nJimmy listening intently, takes some of the peanuts. \nKUJO Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team. \nJIMMY I thought you were done. \nJimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the table. \nOLD MAN I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side ... \nKUJO (cont'd) Now here's the beautiful part.  The getaway.  Both teams will rappel right down the center of the stairwell, change clothes and walk right out the front door like nothing happened. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo tumbling head-over-heals down the metal steps.

CEDARS SINAI - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the path of ... \n... an ONCOMING AMBULANCE, which drags him underneath for a good fifty feet. \nINT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nDanny watches as the trashy dude exits the bathroom. \nKUJO So what's it gonna be, Danny boy? You in or out? \nTrashy dude goes to Colette.  It looks like he wants to leave and she doesn't. \nKUJO (cont'd) Danny! \nTrashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool and pushes her out the front door. \nDANNY (watching Colette) I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on this one, boys. \n", "test1_true": "INT.

Stops again. \nDANNY (cont'd) Why are you out here? \nCOLETTE Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out. \nDanny isn't quite sure what to do. He takes a half-step towards her. \nDANNY Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved. \nCOLETTE I understand. Thanks anyway. \nShe looks up. That face. Those eyes. Everything about her says \"Get involved.\" \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT \nDanny and Colette in a near-deserted retro coffee shop. \nA LONE WAITRESS AND COOK mull behind the counter. \nColette's mascara is running.

It could be worse. \nShe looks up. \nCOLETTE How? \nDANNY I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen. \nShe laughs \nDANNY (cont'd) See. No matter how bad things are, there's always someone a little worse off. \nCOLETTE What about the guy on the very bottom? \nDANNY Leave me out of this. \nCOLETTE That bad, huh? \nDanny holds up his water glass. \nDANNY Nevertheless, I still try to see the glass as half-full. \nHe takes a sip. \nDANNY (cont'd) Problem is, it's usually half-full of something that tastes a  lot like urine. \nHe pulls a face.  Sets the glass down. \nCOLETTE Could be worse. (beat) Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to. \nDANNY Ouch. \nColette sips her coffee.   Danny looks around nervously. \nDANNY (cont'd) Hey, did I mention that I was a coward? \nColette frowns, not sure what he means. \nDANNY (cont'd) Quincey. You sure he isn't gonna come looking for you? \nCOLETTE Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now. \nDANNY This man sounds like a real catch. \nCOLETTE Oh, he's a keeper all right. \nDANNY Colette ... \n", "test1_id": 2403, "test2_input": "LIZ ...

CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nThe bar is almost empty. \nDanny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back of the room - the through-line of Davis' \"All Blues.\" \nCOLETTE (O.S.) This seat taken? \nDanny looks up. \nDANNY Oh. Hi. \nCOLETTE What happened to your eye? \nDANNY Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.

What is it? \nDANNY Miles Davis. \"All Blues.\" \nCOLETTE Never heard of him. \nDANNY Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music. \nCOLETTE Like you? \nDANNY Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part. \nDanny continues to play. \nDANNY Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest. \nCOLETTE And you admire that? \nDANNY It's the only way to play. \nColette slides closer. \nCOLETTE Is that how you play? \nDANNY I try. \nCOLETTE No false notes? \nShe pulls even closer. \nCOLETTE No deep dark secrets? \nShe goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her. \nDANNY (cold and abrupt): What are you up to? \nCOLETTE Nothing. \nDANNY What do you want from me, Colette? \nCOLETTE I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? \nDANNY It gets me through the day. \nCOLETTE You really need to lighten up. \nShe puts her hand on his leg. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Just relax. \nHe moves his leg away. \nDANNY Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after. \n", "test2_true": "DANNY So you're just attracted to me, is that it? \nCOLETTE Yes.

You use 'em like some sort of shield. \nDANNY Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers? \nCOLETTE There you go again. You're nothing but false notes. \nDANNY You don't like the tune, find another station. \nCOLETTE What are you hiding, Danny? \nDANNY Therapy session is over. \nHe closes the keyboard cover. \nCOLETTE You think you're the only one down here with a sad story? \nDANNY No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.

Pooh-Bear. Did five years manslaughter for beating a pimp to death with an electric wheelchair. \nDANNY Excuse me? \nGARCETTI Several possession charges, but nothing major. \nDANNY Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy? \nGARCETTI They have. But they never found a lab. \nTANNER That's because he doesn't have one. \nDANNY Whata you mean?  He told me - \nTANNER Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is. \nDANNY What's to stop him from just ripping me off then? \nTANNER That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme. \nGARCETTI You're lucky, Flynne. \nDANNY Funny, I don't feel lucky. \nGARCETTI We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered. \nDANNY What if he caps me before you can make a move? \nTANNER Golly, I hadn't thought of that. \nGARCETTI Don't we always take good care of you? \nDanny doesn't look reassured. \nDANNY Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me? \nGARCETTI You mean the menacing red car? \nGarcetti and Tanner exchange a smile. \nDANNY What? Is it bad? \nTANNER I'm afraid so, Danny. \nDANNY Who is it? \nGARCETTI Brace yourself. \nDanny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner. \nDANNY Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys? \nGARCETTI Worse. Much worse. (beat) A teacher. \nGarcetti and Tanner break out laughing. \nTANNER Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer. \nDanny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti and Tanner have to say. \nGARCETTI She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years. \nTANNER Now that's scary! \nDanny lost in thought. \n", "test2_id": 2404, "test3_input": "Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately. \nLITTLE BILL What? \nHe follows their gaze to the cash. \nDANNY CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?! \nPOOH-BEAR (eyes on Little Bill) Yeah. \nDanny extracts himself from the cage just as ... \n... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in the cage. \nINT.

Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny. \nDANNY What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0? \nPOOH-BEAR No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time. \nPooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Take it easy.  You passed. \nDanny hands over the bundle of cash. Pockets the dope. \nDANNY Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel? \nPOOH-BEAR I'll keep that in mind. \nMOVE UNDER THE TABLE - Danny's Glock taped to the underside, out of sight. \nEXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT \nDanny, Garcetti and Tanner.  Tanner doing a chemical test on the meth with a field kit.  The tester turns a tell-tale blue. \nTANNER We're in business. \nGARCETTI Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat. \nDANNY That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks. \nTANNER We got the 411 on your good old boy. \nTanner produces a print out from an F.B.I criminal computer file.  A MUG SHOT OF BUBBA.  The name BUFORD \"BUBBA\" NGUYEN underneath. \nTANNER (cont'd) Nothing local so we ran his prints through the F.B.I. Believed to be a major supplier in Texas.  Jumped bail on a murder rap last April. \nDANNY Murder.  Beautiful. \nTANNER Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant. \nDanny heaves a sign and plops down on a bench. \nDANNY You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit. \nGARCETTI Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead. \nDanny looks up. \nTANNER Took a pig-slicker to the heart. \nDANNY Jesus. \nTANNER I thought you'd be happy. \nDANNY Yeah. \nHe doesn't look happy. \nINT.

It's Tom. \nNancy and Verne look at one another. \nINT. PALOS VERDES HOUSE - NIGHT \nDanny and Verne sitting at the dining room table.  Nancy brings in a pot of coffee.  Verne eyes Danny silently.  Danny won't look him in the eye. \nDANNY All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down? \nNANCY Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you. \nNancy pours the coffee. \nNANCY (cont'd) Billy's a cop now, you know. \nVERNE Highway Patrol. \nNANCY He said you were ... the people you Were with ... well ... \nVERNE Said you were a drug addict. \nDANNY Maybe I should just go. \nDanny pushes away from the table.  Nancy grabs Danny's wrist. \nNANCY No. We want to help you, Tom. \nDanny stays put. \nNANCY (cont'd) I know everyone deals with grief in their own way.  I know how hard it is to find closure. \nDANNY Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there? \nNANCY I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ. \nDANNY Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife? \nNANCY You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding. \nDANNY Maybe I am dealing with it. \nNANCY I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ... \nDanny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano. \nDANNY Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there? \nVERNE That was my idea. \nDANNY You never did like me much, did you Verne? (beat) And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you? \nVerne's silence is answer enough. \nDANNY (cont'd) I don't blame you for hating me.  At least I understand that. (back to Nancy) But forgiving the butchers who killed Liz well I'm having some trouble with that one. \nNANCY Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, a persecute you. \nDanny touches Nancy's hand tenderly. \nDANNY I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me. \nNANCY Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker. \nDANNY I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. (beat) Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like? \nNANCY It's not too late to show her you're sorry. \nDANNY How? \nVerne slams his hand down on the table. \nVERNE By not disgracing her memory! \nDANNY What does that mean? \nVERNE You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter? \nVerne glares at Danny.  No forgiveness in his heart. \nVERNE (cont'd) You ever think you might be buying drugs from the very people who took her life? \nDANNY You don't understand. \nVERNE Understand what? \nDanny starts to say something.

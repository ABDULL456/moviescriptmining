{"train": "THE SALTON SEA by Tony Gayton \nTHE SALTON SEA \nby \nTony Gayton \nFADE IN: \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nA MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt defaced by a flower of blood.  The room is ON FIRE all around him. \nHe is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting and lonely piece. \nDANNY (V.O.) My name is Tom Van Allen ... (beat) or Danny Flynne ... \nA DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED.  The money burning, tiny flaming pieces floating around the room. \nDANNY (cont'd) ... I don't know anymore. (beat) Maybe I'll let you decide.  Maybe you can help me, friend.  As you can see, I don't have a hell of a lot of time left. \nA PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The photo is on fire.  Only her smile remains. \nDANNY (cont'd) Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ... Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ... The prince of Denmark ...? \nA GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word, CONGRATULATIONS! on the front.  The wind from the fire blows the card open.  Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN. \nDANNY (cont'd) All of these? None of these? You decide, friend.  You decide. Trumpet player? Speed freak? (beat) Speed freak. (beat) That's as good a place as any. (beat) But first, a little background on the mad world of the tweaker .. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN. \nINT. LABORATORY - DAY \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a glass beaker. \nDANNY (V.O.) Methedrene was first distilled by a Japanese scientist before WWII. Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing when they saw it. \nINT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY \nA wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the controls. \nDANNY (V.O.) This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks he can survive this without a scratch. \nSTOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship, bursting into a ball of flames. \nDANNY (V.O.) Maybe not. (beat) By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers, soldiers, pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nA wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house. \nDANNY (V.O) In the fifties, the housewives got ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine. Methedrene ... \nShe attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette. \nDANNY (cont'd) Now that's a classic speed freak for you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll bet her poor husband never knew what hit him in the sack either. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTHE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor. \nSTOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV. \nDANNY (V.O.) There were even rumors that one of our presidents dabbled with mysterious \"energy shots\".  Imagine that: a slammer in the White House. \nKennedy talking animatedly. \nDANNY (cont'd) If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev never got a word in edgewise. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nA sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type. \nDANNY (V.O.) By the late 60's the government finally cracked down and sent the whole thing underground.  Bikers controlled the market for a while. \nINT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT \nThe trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the Kamikaze. \nDANNY (V.O.) But now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and the right ingredients can cook it up at home. \nINT. PHARMACY - NIGHT \nA CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION. \nDANNY (V.O.) Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak buying up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the morning. \nThe cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin plastered on his face. \nDANNY (cont'd) Take it from me, he ain't got no cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his kitchen and you'll find a whole grocery list of unsavory ingredients. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers. \nDANNY (V.O.) Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads for red phosphorus, ether and of course the cold medicine .. that's for Ephedrene, soon to become Methedrene \nJIMMY Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn. \nDANNY Why's that? \nJIMMY My features. They're Finnish. \nDANNY You don't say. \nJIMMY Finland is a country. \nDANNY Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack. \nINT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nDanny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking at. \nA GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand. \nHe is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity. \nJIMMY Bobby? \nBOBBY Shhh. \nBobby never takes his eyes off his arm. \nBOBBY (cont'd) (whispering) They're coming. \nJIMMY (likewise whispering) What? \nBOBBY The spiders. \nBobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening. \nBOBBY (cont'd) (sing-song) I'm ready for you this time. \nBobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm. \nBOBBY Aha! Yeah! (super rapid-fire) You thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby! \nBobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with bug spray. \nBOBBY (cont'd) With Bobby you thought you could fuck? \nDanny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders. \nHe looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug- addled confusion. \nBOBBY (cont'd) Who the fuck are you? \nJIMMY It's me ... Jimmy \nBobby squints. \nBOBBY Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy. \nJIMMY Yeah. \nBOBBY What can I do for you? \nJIMMY Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us. \nDanny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously. \nThere is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE. \nBOBBY Don't pay her no mind. \nA MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the box springs. \nBOBBY (cont'd) Shut the hell up, goddamit! \nBobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath. \nBOBBY (cont'd) I got no vocation skills!  What the fuck you want from me? (keeps slapping) I got no vocation skills! \nJIMMY Hey man, take it easy. \nBobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity. \nBOBBY What? \nJIMMY Come on.  Ease off the girl. \nBobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises. \nDanny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two stainless steel spears. \nBobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then Danny. \nBOBBY Did you bring the plastic men? \nBobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move or speak. \nBOBBY (cont'd) Did you bring the plastic men? (beat) Did you bring the plastic men? \nBobby rubs his nose. \nBOBBY Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men? \nDANNY Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts. \nQUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS. \nTANNER No last name? \nDANNY It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries. \nGarcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges over. \nGARCETTI This the guy? \nDANNY It speaks! \nThe humorless Garcetti hands Danny a \"WANTED POSTER\".  Bobby's mug shot glaring. \nDANNY That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though. \nGARCETTI Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne. \nDANNY Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards. \nGARCETTI What's he holding? \nFLASHBACK - INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nBobby's hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth. \nDANNY (O.S.) Couple of eightballs, maybe more. \nQUICK SHOT of an open drawer.  A GUN can be glimpsed inside. \nDANNY (cont'd) Cheap ass techno knockoff in the drawer with extra mags. \nANOTHER QUICK GLIMPSE of the closet.  A shotgun butt visable \nDANNY (cont'd) 12 gauge in the closet. \nTANNER (O.S.) Any company? \nThe WOMAN'S HAND protruding from underneath the mattress. \nDANNY (O.S.) Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich (beat) And there was a kid. \nA SILHOUETTE visible through a crack in the BATHROOM DOOR. \nTANNER (O.S.) A kid?  Are you sure? \nA BEAT-UP ELMO DOLL and SOME COLORING BOOKS on top of the dresser. \nEXT. PARK - NIGHT \nBack on Danny. DANNY Yeah. Pretty sure. (beat) Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. \nTANNER God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker. \nDANNY Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. \nGarcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car. \nDANNY (cont'd) Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay? \nTANNER Danny, I'm touched. \nDANNY Don't be. I'm worried about the kid. \nGARCETTI Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there? \nDANNY Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts? \nGarcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose. \nGARCETTI I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne. \nDANNY Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect. \nGarcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off. \nDANNY You're welcome. \nEXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nA GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking lot. \nBOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a Bobby's sheet-covered body. \nA SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful little Tai-Chi gesture. \nA LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs. \nREVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing away. \nA ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain. \nAs the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT. \nThe place cries out \"YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!\" \nLIZ That's so ... (not finishing the word) \nDANNY / TOM Melancholy? \nLIZ Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a beautiful composition. \nDANNY/TOM And the performance? \nLIZ (goofing) A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece. \nDANNY/TOM Thank you.  Thank you very much. \nLIZ And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it. \nDANNY/TOM Again, I thank you. \nLIZ I was talking about Miles. \nDanny playfully tackles her to the ground. \nDANNY/TOM You, madam, are a heartless wench. \nLIZ And you've got wiener breath. \nDANNY/TOM Really? \nLIZ It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch. \nDanny starts kissing her over and over again. \nLIZ (laughing) Tom! Gross! \nShe finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next to her, spooning her in the sand. \nDANNY/TOM You know how I make that song melancholy when I play it? I think of what my life would be like without you. \nLiz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny. \nLIZ Tom, let's spend the night here. \nDANNY/TOM There's no motels around here. \nLIZ No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nDanny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet.  THE IMAGE IS STILL PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

We'll get eaten alive. \nDANNY (at the vanity, softly) No ... We'll stay. \nBACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore. \nThe sun sinks completely below the horizon. \nA long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals. \nThe dying fish breaths its last. \nDanny (at the vanity) closes his eyes. \nSERIES OF QUICK CUTS \nThe trumpet goes back in the case. \nThe lid is closed. \nThe case goes back in the box. \nThe neatly folded clothes are laid on top. \nThe box goes back to the shelf. \nThe light in the closet is turned off. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN. \nEXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT \nDanny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table. \nTanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nDanny watching silently. \nTanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it. \nThe envelope lays there between them for the following conversation. \nDANNY You think I'm a Judas? \nTANNER Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord. \nDANNY Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nDanny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone. \nA PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny. \nDanny stands up.  Dusts his pants off. \nThe truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside. \nDanny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ... \n... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA. \nAn AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela Anderson-type on the saddle behind him. \nDANNY (checking out the painting) Ride 'em cowboy) \nBUBBA (southern twang) You like that? \nDANNY Who wouldn't? \nBUBBA First rate, ain't it? \nDANNY It's downright classy is what it is. \nBubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster. DANNY (cont'd) You consider my presentation? \nBUBBA Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over. \nDanny climbs in.  The window goes back up.

(guzzles some beer) Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit together so tight? \nDanny chuckles. DANNY That's a good one. \nJIMMY I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'. \nDANNY I guess there's just no substitute for good genes. \nJimmy finishes his beer.  Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for more beer. \nDANNY (cont'd) You hear about Bobby? \nJIMMY Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity. \nDanny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words. \nJIMMY (cont'd) He was a good supplier. (gets an idea) You think maybe there's any drugs left in his room?  You know, like hidden? \nDANNY I kind of doubt it, Jimmy. \nThe beers arrive.  Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp. Danny slides his over. \nJIMMY So, why'd you want to see me? \nDANNY Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash. \nJIMMY See that?  That's just what I'm talking about. \nDANNY What? \nJIMMY You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man. \nJIMMY You wanna score some go-fast? \nDANNY Not tonight. \nThey continue on.

At least I'm sure you think you don't.  Anyway, I want to tell you. It's a good story, guaranteed to break the ice at a party. \nPooh-Bear leans back, grinning broadly \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Dude shorted me eleven dollar ... thought I wouldn't count it till I got home.  Wrong. (beat) You know what I did?

You should have heard him howling. \nBACK TO PRESENT: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette \nPOOH-BEAR Then I took a Saws All and I cut His skull open \nQUICK FLASH: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP. Pooh-Bear reaching for something OFFSCREEN. POOH-BEAR (V.O.)

I mean, anyone stupid enough to jam me up doesn't really use their brain to begin with. You know what I'm saying? (beat, dead serious) So I took it. \nPooh-Bear makes a POPPING SOUND as he illustrates with his hands. \nQUICK FLASH BACK: Pooh-Bear looking down at SOMETHING in his hand, his face blossoming into a sick smile. \nBACK TO PRESENT: Danny listens somberly. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Hell, I make better use out of it than he ever did.  Got it up in my freezer. I take it out from time-to- time, mix a little of it up in my dinner .... (looks at the plate of eggs) ... of breakfast. \nON THE PLATE - little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs. \nPooh-Bear smiles knowingly.  Danny turns pale. \nPOOH-BEAR 10,000 a pound \nDanny decides to nerve it out \nDANNY Now you're insulting me.  Nice talking business with you. \nDanny gets up to leave. One of his hands shaking uncontrollably. He steadies it with the other hand. \nPOOH-BEAR 9,000.  Take it or leave it. \nDanny stops. \nDANNY I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as I'll go.  See ya'. \nDanny goes to leave again. \nPOOH-BEAR All right, all right. Don't get your knickers in a knot. I can live with eight. \nPooh-Bear stands up. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) You got a deal. \nThey shake hands. \nPOOH-BEAR God damn, Danny, you got some nerve. Pooh-Bear respects that. (beat) Oh, by the way ... \nPooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the table ... \n... a store-bought package of COW BRAINS. \nQUICK FLASH BACK: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat section in a GROCERY STORE.

Good price. \nPooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling. \nBACK TO PRESENT: \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) You want to stay for lunch? \nDanny amused by the conversation.  He sees something out of the corner of his eye ... \nThe boyfriend kissing Colette roughly.  She obviously isn't enjoying it. \nDanny watching intently. \nKUJO (cont'd) Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you in on the opportunity of a lifetime, the least you can do is pay attention. \nDanny turns back to the table. Kujo slides another glass over. \nKUJO (cont'd) This is the courier \nCREEPER You should use something smaller. He's the same size as the office. It doesn't ring true. \nKujo rolls his eyes.

They don't hold him for more than a day or two. \nDANNY That's long enough to get out of town. \nCOLETTE I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live. \nDanny chews it over for a second then ... \nDANNY Then make sure he gets put away for longer. \nCOLETTE How? \nDanny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Tell me how. \nDANNY I don't know. (beat) Let me think about it. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nUrban blight abounds \nINT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of offices. \nBUBBA THE ASIAN COWBOY sitting on a desk. Danny pacing back and forth in front of him. \nBUBBA (Texas drawl) I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes. \nDANNY Why? The guys is ready to deal now. \nBUBBA Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner. \nDANNY Now that's down-right insulting. \nBUBBA I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules. \nBubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket.  Tosses it on the table. \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME \nTanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street. \nGarcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out building.  He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the mike. \nDANNY (O.S.) (filtered, broken) I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice. \nBUBBA (O.S.) (filtered) Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss. \nGarcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner. \nGARCETTI You thinking what I'm thinking? \nTANNER Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for. \nEXT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME \nBubba exits the building and disappears around the corner. \nTANNER You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne. \nDANNY After that ass-whipping you gave me? \nGarcetti suppresses a smile. \nGARCETTI (finishing up with the bundle) What's on the other end of this thing? \nDANNY Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy. \nGARCETTI Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne. \nDANNY Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips. \nTANNER What're your taking down? \nDANNY Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory. \nTanner looks at Danny quizzically. \nTANNER Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off? \nDANNY Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him. \nDanny holds his hands up \nDANNY (cont'd) But now I've seen the error of my ways.  I'll just walk away ... call the whole deal off. \nGARCETTI Wrong. \nHe tosses the bundle of cash to Danny. \nDANNY You mean you want me to roll on these guys? \nTheir silence is answer enough. \nDANNY (cont'd) No. No way.  These guys catch a whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini. \nTANNER You've got no choice. \nDANNY Whata you mean I've got no choice? \nTANNER Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ... \nDANNY For that old possession charge? Gimme a break. \nTANNER No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al? \nGARCETTI Dime, minimum. \nMOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent.  MOVE INTO THE VENT, then ... \n... OUT OF A VENT in another room. \nBUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the wall vent in the other room. \nTANNER (O.S.) And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat. \nGARCETTI (O.S.) That's not good in prison. It's just not good. \nBubba listens intently. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nDanny hunkered down in the back sea.  Garcetti sniffing the air. \nGARCETTI What's that smell? \nDANNY That would be me. \nGARCETTI What'd you do, piss your pants? \nDANNY Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler? \nGarcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile. \nGARCETTI Who'd have thought it?  Danny \"Chickenshit\" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses. \nDANNY Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood. \nGARCETTI No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack. \nTANNER Bullshit. He's a liar. \nDANNY News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat. \nTANNER You think you're so god damned smart, don't you? \nThe dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship.  Tanner is now the bad cop. \nTANNER (cont'd) Well, you played the wrong mark this time, asshole. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT \nDanny approaching the building, we hear shots ... \n... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a liquor store and watches from the window. \nThe red car cruises slowly past. \nLIZ ... Tom ... screw it.  Tell me when you're ready to apologize. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nDANNY lying on the bed, reliving the moment.  THE IMAGE STILL PROJECTED ON THE WALL.

Danny sleeping soundly. \nThe roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS BED. \nDanny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly.

CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nThe bar is almost empty. \nDanny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back of the room - the through-line of Davis' \"All Blues.\" \nCOLETTE (O.S.) This seat taken? \nDanny looks up. \nDANNY Oh. Hi. \nCOLETTE What happened to your eye? \nDANNY Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. (beat) By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. (off her puzzled look) Where's Quincey? \nCOLETTE Don't worry. He's out of town. \nDANNY How far out of town? \nCOLETTE Trust me. We're safe. \nColette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Please keep playing. \nHe continues. She sits there listening for a few moments. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) That's nice. What is it? \nDANNY Miles Davis. \"All Blues.\" \nCOLETTE Never heard of him. \nDANNY Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music. \nCOLETTE Like you? \nDANNY Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part. \nDanny continues to play. \nDANNY Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest. \nCOLETTE And you admire that? \nDANNY It's the only way to play. \nColette slides closer. \nCOLETTE Is that how you play? \nDANNY I try. \nCOLETTE No false notes? \nShe pulls even closer. \nCOLETTE No deep dark secrets? \nShe goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her. \nDANNY (cold and abrupt): What are you up to? \nCOLETTE Nothing. \nDANNY What do you want from me, Colette? \nCOLETTE I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? \nDANNY It gets me through the day. \nCOLETTE You really need to lighten up. \nShe puts her hand on his leg. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Just relax. \nHe moves his leg away. \nDANNY Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after. \nPooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately. \nLITTLE BILL What? \nHe follows their gaze to the cash. \nDANNY CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?! \nPOOH-BEAR (eyes on Little Bill) Yeah. \nDanny extracts himself from the cage just as ... \n... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in the cage. \nINT. POOH-BEAR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER) \nDanny sitting at the kitchen table.  THE SCREAMS OF LITTLE BILL AUDIBLE FROM THE OTHER ROOM. \nDanny is FIDDLING WITH SOMETHING UNDER THE TABLE when he HEARS POOH- BEAR APPROACHING. \nDanny finishes up, stuffing a roll of DUCT TAPE into his pocket. \nPooh-Bear drops a zip-lock bag of METH on the table. \nDANNY I ought to just call this whole thing off right now. \nPOOH-BEAR Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny. \nDANNY What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0? \nPOOH-BEAR No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time. \nPooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Take it easy.  You passed. \nDanny hands over the bundle of cash. Pockets the dope. \nDANNY Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel? \nPOOH-BEAR I'll keep that in mind. \nMOVE UNDER THE TABLE - Danny's Glock taped to the underside, out of sight. \nEXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT \nDanny, Garcetti and Tanner.  Tanner doing a chemical test on the meth with a field kit.

Thanks. \nTANNER We got the 411 on your good old boy. \nTanner produces a print out from an F.B.I criminal computer file.  A MUG SHOT OF BUBBA.  The name BUFORD \"BUBBA\" NGUYEN underneath. \nTANNER (cont'd) Nothing local so we ran his prints through the F.B.I. Believed to be a major supplier in Texas.  Jumped bail on a murder rap last April. \nDANNY Murder.  Beautiful. \nTANNER Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant. \nDanny heaves a sign and plops down on a bench. \nDANNY You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit. \nGARCETTI Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead. \nDanny looks up. \nTANNER Took a pig-slicker to the heart. \nDANNY Jesus. \nTANNER I thought you'd be happy. \nDANNY Yeah. \nHe doesn't look happy. \nINT.

I need the money. \nDANNY You always been this stubborn? \nColette cracks a crooked smile. \nCOLETTE From day one. (beat) I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em. \nDANNY Ass first into the world. \nCOLETTE I been that way ever since. \nDanny smiles.  He gently touches her eye.  Colette reaches up and touches Danny's bruised eye. COLETTE (cont'd) Look at us.  What a pair. \nColette leans in to kiss him, but they bump bad eyes. \nCOLETTE/DANNY Ouch. They laugh. \nCOLETTE Can we try that again? \nThey kiss again.  Deep and long.  Danny suddenly pulls back mid-kiss. \nDANNY I can't. \nColette goes to touch him. He pulls away. \nDANNY (cont'd) I can't. \nCOLETTE Why not? \nDANNY I just can't. Okay? \nDanny paces uncomfortably. \nCOLETTE What's wrong, Danny? \nDANNY Look, maybe you oughta' leave. \nCOLETTE No. I want to know what the hell is going on. \nDANNY I can't tell you. \nColette comes to a slow realization. \nCOLETTE There's someone else, isn't there? \nTHE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA. \nDanny freezes.  Looks up at Colette. DANNY Yes. \nColette waits a beat, then turns to leave. \nDANNY (cont'd) Don't go. (beat) Please, Colette. (she stops) Stay and talk to me, please. \nSomething about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't seen in him before.  MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE. \nDANNY (O.S.)

I could have done something. \nCOLETTE They would have killed you too. \nDANNY (finally looks her in the eye) Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now. \nColette puts her arms around him and hugs him tight.

I want you to beep me at this number. He writes the number down on a dollar bill. \nDANNY Will you do that? (off her nod) Then I want you to get out of the room. \nCOLETTE Why? \nDANNY Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back. \nColette goes to protest. Danny puts his hand to her mouth the same way she did to him earlier. \nDANNY Just do it.

Shoots a look over at ... \n... one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier. \nDANNY Come on, man, let's deal. \nHe throws the bag on the table, knocking a beer into the guys lap.

Not what he wanted to hear. \nDANNY You want to do this some other time? \nPOOH-BEAR (gloomy and tired) Pull your pants down. \nDANNY I'm sorry? \nPOOH-BEAR Pull your motherfucking pants down. \nDanny looks to the two Bills for help. \nDANNY (laughing nervously) Come on, guys ... \nPOOH-BEAR Big Bill. \nBig Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his jacket and points it at Danny's head. \nBIG BILL Argh, matie. I'm a pirate. \nPOOH-BEAR Little Bill \nLittle Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is started into silence. \nThe saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat. \nPooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it under the light. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Introduce him to Captain Steubing. \nHe pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked. \nThe Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED WEASEL INSIDE. \nThe cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) You'll have to excuse him, he ain't ate for over a week. \nThe weasel is foaming at the mouth. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) That and the rabies.  Don't make for a happy weasel. \nDANNY (trying to stay calm) Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this? (off Pooh-Bear's silence) It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal. \nPOOH-BEAR Big Bill \nBig Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist level. \nPOOH-BEAR Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police. \nDANNY What?! \nPooh-Bear holds up his hand. \nPOOH-BEAR Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation. \nDANNY Please .. I don't know what you're ... \nPOOH-BEAR Uh-uh-uh ... \nHe points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas. \n", "test1_true": "The weasel continues to gnaw. \nPOOH-BEAR He don't believe you. Big Bill. \nBIG BILL Drop your package in the cage. \nDANNY My what? \nBIG BILL Put your pee-pee through the hole. \nThere is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the Plexiglas from Captain Steubing. DANNY This is fucking crazy! \nBig Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun. \nBIG BILL Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. \nDANNY Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ... \nDanny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, is watching the weasel. \nLittle Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the side. \nDanny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order. \nPOOH-BEAR Shoot him. \nDANNY Okay! Okay! \nFrom behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the cage. \nDANNY (cont'd) (eyeing the wild rodent) Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ... \nDanny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is standing right next to him. \nPOOH-BEAR Now get talkin' \nDANNY I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God! \nPooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an inch. \nTHE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm through. \nPOOH-BEAR You got something to tell Captain Steubing, you'd better do it now. \nThe weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas. \nDanny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between the coat and the lining. \nNo one notices. \nPooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more.  The weasel is able to get his head through the hole.  He bares his filthy teeth. \nDANNY (rapid-fire) Captain Steubing, listen to me. You're after the wrong guy. This is the fuck you should be talking to. \nHe nods towards Little Bill.  Pooh-Bear cocks his head. \nDANNY (cont'd) Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his own stuff on the side. \nLITTLE BILL That's a pack of discharge. \nDanny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently. \nDANNY It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night ... said he was dissin' your ass in front of one of your customers. \nPooh-Bear rises slowly.  Approaches the triumvirate. \nDanny keeps one eye on ... \n... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening. \nPOOH-BEAR Man'll say a lot of thing when he's sporting weasel food for a pecker. \nLITTLE BILL Damn straight. \nPOOH-BEAR Least I can do is check it out though. \nPooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband. \nDANNY Can I pull my dick out now? \nPooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Big Bill \nBig Bill pats Little Bill down. \nLITTLE BILL (holding up his arms) Go ahead. I got nothing to hide. \nBig Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty. \nThe weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole. \nDANNY Can I pull my dick out? \nDanny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat. \nBIG BILL He's clean. \nDanny can't believe it.  But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big roll of cash protrudes from the hole. \n", "test1_id": 2403, "test2_input": "EXT.

This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up.

Avenging Angel, Judas, loving husband, prodigal son, prince of Denmark.  I was all of those things. (beat) Tom Van Allen got his revenge. Good for Tom.  And Danny Flynne?

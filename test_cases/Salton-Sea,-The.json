CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nDanny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking at. \nA GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand. \nHe is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity. \nJIMMY Bobby? \nBOBBY Shhh. \nBobby never takes his eyes off his arm. \nBOBBY (cont'd) (whispering) They're coming. \nJIMMY (likewise whispering) What? \nBOBBY The spiders. \nBobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening. \nBOBBY (cont'd) (sing-song) I'm ready for you this time. \nBobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm. \nBOBBY Aha! Yeah! (super rapid-fire) You thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby! \nBobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with bug spray. \nBOBBY (cont'd) With Bobby you thought you could fuck? \nDanny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders. \nHe looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug- addled confusion. \nBOBBY (cont'd) Who the fuck are you? \nJIMMY It's me ... Jimmy \nBobby squints. \nBOBBY Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy. \nJIMMY Yeah. \nBOBBY What can I do for you? \nJIMMY Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us. \nDanny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously. \nThere is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE. \nBOBBY Don't pay her no mind. \nA MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the box springs. \nBOBBY (cont'd) Shut the hell up, goddamit! \nBobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath. \nBOBBY (cont'd) I got no vocation skills!  What the fuck you want from me? (keeps slapping) I got no vocation skills! \nJIMMY Hey man, take it easy. \nBobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity. \nBOBBY What? \nJIMMY Come on.  Ease off the girl. \nBobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises. \nDanny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two stainless steel spears. \nBobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then Danny. \nBOBBY Did you bring the plastic men? \nBobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move or speak. \nBOBBY (cont'd) Did you bring the plastic men? (beat) Did you bring the plastic men? \nBobby rubs his nose. \nBOBBY Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men? \nDANNY Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts. \nQUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS. \nTANNER No last name? \nDANNY It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries. \nGarcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges over. \nGARCETTI This the guy? \nDANNY It speaks! \nThe humorless Garcetti hands Danny a \"WANTED POSTER\".  Bobby's mug shot glaring. \nDANNY That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though. \nGARCETTI Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne. \nDANNY Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards. \nGARCETTI What's he holding? \nFLASHBACK - INT.

Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich (beat) And there was a kid. \nA SILHOUETTE visible through a crack in the BATHROOM DOOR. \nTANNER (O.S.) A kid?  Are you sure? \nA BEAT-UP ELMO DOLL and SOME COLORING BOOKS on top of the dresser. \nEXT. PARK - NIGHT \nBack on Danny. DANNY Yeah. Pretty sure. (beat) Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. \nTANNER God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker. \nDANNY Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. \nGarcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car. \nDANNY (cont'd) Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay? \nTANNER Danny, I'm touched. \nDANNY Don't be. I'm worried about the kid. \nGARCETTI Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there? \nDANNY Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts? \nGarcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose. \nGARCETTI I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne. \nDANNY Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect. \nGarcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off. \nDANNY You're welcome. \nEXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nA GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking lot. \nBOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a Bobby's sheet-covered body. \nA SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful little Tai-Chi gesture. \nA LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs. \nREVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing away. \nA ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain. \nAs the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT. \nThe place cries out \"YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!\" \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nDanny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone. \nA PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny. \nDanny stands up.  Dusts his pants off. \nThe truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside. \nDanny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ... \n... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA. \nAn AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela Anderson-type on the saddle behind him. \nDANNY (checking out the painting) Ride 'em cowboy) \nBUBBA (southern twang) You like that? \nDANNY Who wouldn't? \nBUBBA First rate, ain't it? \nDANNY It's downright classy is what it is. \nBubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster. DANNY (cont'd) You consider my presentation? \nBUBBA Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over. \nDanny climbs in.  The window goes back up.  As the care pulls away, we \n... MOVE back over to the gravestone. \nThe stone reads: \"ELIZABETH VAN ALLEN.  BELOVED WIFE\" \nEXT. THE CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nA non-descript. cinder block bar.

He looks nervous, eyes darting around for potential assassins. \nHe has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all. \nJimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny.  Danny signals for Jimmy to go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers. \nDANNY Jimmy, you don't look so hot. \nJimmy has dark circles under his eyes. \nJIMMY I'm hurting. \nDANNY You on a roll? \nJIMMY Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me? \nDANNY Sorry. \nJIMMY Why does it have to feel so bad? \nDANNY You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer. \nJimmy sighs, scratches his arms.  They are all scabbed up. \nDANNY (cont'd) You see the crank bugs? \nJIMMY Oh yeah. (guzzles some beer) Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit together so tight? \nDanny chuckles. DANNY That's a good one. \nJIMMY I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'. \nDANNY I guess there's just no substitute for good genes. \nJimmy finishes his beer.  Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for more beer. \nDANNY (cont'd) You hear about Bobby? \nJIMMY Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity. \nDanny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words. \nJIMMY (cont'd) He was a good supplier. (gets an idea) You think maybe there's any drugs left in his room?  You know, like hidden? \nDANNY I kind of doubt it, Jimmy. \nThe beers arrive.  Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp. Danny slides his over. \nJIMMY So, why'd you want to see me? \nDANNY Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash. \nJIMMY See that?  That's just what I'm talking about. \nDANNY What? \nJIMMY You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man. \nJIMMY You wanna score some go-fast? \nDANNY Not tonight. \nThey continue on. Jimmy looks at the vest. \nJIMMY Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway? \nDANNY Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT \nA TRASHY LOOKING DUDE banging on Colette's door. \nDanny at his door, fumbling with his keys, watching the dude. \nDUDE (sees Danny eyeballing him) You mad dogging me, Bitch? \nDANNY Heavens no. I was just admiring your boots. \nThe dude looks down at this beat-up motorcycle boots. \nDANNY Did you purchase them locally? \nThe dude ignores Danny and keeps pounding on the door. \nDANNY (cont'd) Goodbye now. Nice meeting you. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nDanny enters.  AN ARGUMENT ENSUES NEXT DOOR between the dude and Colette. \nThe sounds of a struggle.  Colette screams.  The dude yelling at the top of his lungs.  A LOUD SMACK. SILENCE. \nColette sobbing. The dude talking in hushed tones, contrite. \nEXT.

Danny in the passenger's seat, looking down at ... \n... the floorboard, or lack thereof.  It is completely rusted out.  The freeway rushes by underneath. \nDANNY You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over. \nJIMMY You mean, like to throw 'em off? \nDANNY Yeah, that's what I mean. (beat) Where the hell does this guy live anyway? \nJIMMY Palmdale \nDANNY Why do they call him Pooh-Bear? \nJIMMY I think on account of his nose. \nDANNY You're going to have to explain that one. \nJIMMY He doesn't have one. \nDANNY You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy. \nJIMMY Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh always got his nose stuck in the honey jar? Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much crank, they had to cut his nose off. He's got a plastic one though. \nDanny wonders what he's getting himself into. \nJIMMY (cont'd) You know, they say he hasn't slept in over a year. \nDANNY You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep? \nJIMMY No (beat) You think she's a tweaker? \nEXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - DAY \nA sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert. \nA GUY passes out in the front yard.  A DOG sniffs at him, then starts pissing on him.  He never moves. \nA PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway. \nCLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.  It almost blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more disconcerting. \nHe takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a long exhale. \nPOOH-BEAR Okay, here we go gentlemen ... \nA REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape. \nPooh-Bear working the remote control device. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Zapruder? \nA GUY filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera. \nGRAINY SUPER 8 FOOTAGE: the pigeons continue along, their stupid eyes glazed with confusion. \nZAPRUDER Ready. \nDanny amused by the conversation.  He sees something out of the corner of his eye ... \nThe boyfriend kissing Colette roughly.  She obviously isn't enjoying it. \nDanny watching intently. \nKUJO (cont'd) Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you in on the opportunity of a lifetime, the least you can do is pay attention. \nDanny turns back to the table. Kujo slides another glass over. \nKUJO (cont'd) This is the courier \nCREEPER You should use something smaller. He's the same size as the office. It doesn't ring true. \nKujo rolls his eyes.  He uses a peanut instead. \nOLD MAN (O.S.) And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot .... \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nA courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case. \nKUJO (O.S.) He delivers at four o'clock on the nose every Friday.  Alpha team will be in the elevator with the courier. That'll be Danny and Creeper. \nMOVE INTO THE ELEVATOR - Creeper standing in the corner alone, asleep on his feet, drool trickling down his mouth. \nKUJO (cont'd) Every member of the team will be equipped with night vision goggles, a police scanner and two-way radios. \nThe elevator door closes on the dosing Creeper. \nINT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nHe slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut. \nKUJO (cont'd) ... number two team, which will be me and Jimmy, will be positioned in the stairwell at the other end of the hall. \nKujo slides over two more peanuts. \nThe trashy dude heads into the bathroom.  Danny sneaks another look at Colette.  This time, she gives him a big smile. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo emerges from the stairwell, also alone, approaching the courier. \nHe is wearing shorts, a tank top and after-ski boots.  He has a big powdery crank donut around his nostrils. KUJO (cont'd) With alpha team following from the elevator, number two team will approach from the stairwell, cutting the courier off before he reaches the lab. \nCreeper still fast asleep inside the elevator.   He wakes with a start, breaking down into a karate stance. \nINT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nThe courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the cashew. \nKUJO (cont'd) Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons, the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo and the courier playing tug-of-war with the case.  Kujo points a dustbuster vacuum at the courier like it was a gun. \nINT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nJimmy listening intently, takes some of the peanuts. \nKUJO Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team. \nJIMMY I thought you were done. \nJimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the table. \nOLD MAN I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side ... \nKUJO (cont'd) Now here's the beautiful part.  The getaway.  Both teams will rappel right down the center of the stairwell, change clothes and walk right out the front door like nothing happened. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo tumbling head-over-heals down the metal steps.  He gets to his feet, a bloody mess. \nThe kit has sprung open, sending shit samples everywhere. \nKujo quickly scrapes as much as he can back into a container and runs off. \nEXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY (FLASH FORWARD) \nKujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the path of ... \n... an ONCOMING AMBULANCE, which drags him underneath for a good fifty feet. \nINT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nDanny watches as the trashy dude exits the bathroom. \nKUJO So what's it gonna be, Danny boy? You in or out? \nTrashy dude goes to Colette.  It looks like he wants to leave and she doesn't. \nKUJO (cont'd) Danny! \nTrashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool and pushes her out the front door. \nDANNY (watching Colette) I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on this one, boys. \nHe stops. COLETTE What? \nDANNY Nothing. \nCOLETTE Go ahead. \nDANNY Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy? \nCOLETTE It's not that easy. \nDANNY Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt. \nCOLETTE Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? (beat) I hate the son-of-a-bitch. \nDANNY Then leave. \nCOLETTE I can't. \nDANNY Why not? \nCOLETTE You don't understand. \nDANNY There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig. \nCOLETTE I can't leave. \nDANNY You get off on abuse or something? \nCOLETTE Fuck you. \nDANNY Then why don't you leave? (beat) Just give me one good reason. \nCOLETTE Because he'll kill me. \nThe waitress and cook look up. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Is that simple enough for you? \nDANNY Why don't you call the cops? \nCOLETTE Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two. \nDANNY That's long enough to get out of town. \nCOLETTE I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live. \nDanny chews it over for a second then ... \nDANNY Then make sure he gets put away for longer. \nCOLETTE How? \nDanny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Tell me how. \nDANNY I don't know.

BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of offices. \nBUBBA THE ASIAN COWBOY sitting on a desk.

The guys is ready to deal now. \nBUBBA Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner. \nDANNY Now that's down-right insulting. \nBUBBA I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules. \nBubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket.  Tosses it on the table. \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME \nTanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street. \nGarcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out building.  He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the mike. \nDANNY (O.S.) (filtered, broken) I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice. \nBUBBA (O.S.) (filtered) Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss. \nGarcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner. \nGARCETTI You thinking what I'm thinking? \nTANNER Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for. \nEXT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME \nBubba exits the building and disappears around the corner. \nTANNER You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne. \nDANNY After that ass-whipping you gave me? \nGarcetti suppresses a smile. \nGARCETTI (finishing up with the bundle) What's on the other end of this thing? \nDANNY Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy. \nGARCETTI Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne. \nDANNY Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips. \nTANNER What're your taking down? \nDANNY Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory. \nTanner looks at Danny quizzically. \nTANNER Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off? \nDANNY Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him. \nDanny holds his hands up \nDANNY (cont'd) But now I've seen the error of my ways.  I'll just walk away ... call the whole deal off. \nGARCETTI Wrong. \nHe tosses the bundle of cash to Danny. \nDANNY You mean you want me to roll on these guys? \nTheir silence is answer enough. \nDANNY (cont'd) No. No way.  These guys catch a whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini. \nTANNER You've got no choice. \nDANNY Whata you mean I've got no choice? \nTANNER Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ... \nDANNY For that old possession charge? Gimme a break. \nTANNER No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al? \nGARCETTI Dime, minimum. \nMOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent.  MOVE INTO THE VENT, then ... \n... OUT OF A VENT in another room. \nBUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the wall vent in the other room. \nTANNER (O.S.) And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat. \nGARCETTI (O.S.) That's not good in prison. It's just not good. \nBubba listens intently. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nDanny hunkered down in the back sea.  Garcetti sniffing the air. \nGARCETTI What's that smell? \nDANNY That would be me. \nGARCETTI What'd you do, piss your pants? \nDANNY Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler? \nGarcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile. \nGARCETTI Who'd have thought it?  Danny \"Chickenshit\" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses. \nDANNY Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood. \nGARCETTI No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack. \nTANNER Bullshit. He's a liar. \nDANNY News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat. \nTANNER You think you're so god damned smart, don't you? \nThe dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship.  Tanner is now the bad cop. \nTANNER (cont'd) Well, you played the wrong mark this time, asshole. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT \nDanny approaching the building, we hear shots ... \n... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a liquor store and watches from the window. \nThe red car cruises slowly past. \nLIZ ... Tom ... screw it.

Danny sleeping soundly. \nThe roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS BED. \nDanny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly.

CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT \nThe bar is almost empty. \nDanny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back of the room - the through-line of Davis' \"All Blues.\" \nCOLETTE (O.S.) This seat taken? \nDanny looks up. \nDANNY Oh. Hi. \nCOLETTE What happened to your eye? \nDANNY Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. (beat) By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. (off her puzzled look) Where's Quincey? \nCOLETTE Don't worry. He's out of town. \nDANNY How far out of town? \nCOLETTE Trust me. We're safe. \nColette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Please keep playing. \nHe continues. She sits there listening for a few moments. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) That's nice. What is it? \nDANNY Miles Davis. \"All Blues.\" \nCOLETTE Never heard of him. \nDANNY Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music. \nCOLETTE Like you? \nDANNY Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part. \nDanny continues to play. \nDANNY Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest. \nCOLETTE And you admire that? \nDANNY It's the only way to play. \nColette slides closer. \nCOLETTE Is that how you play? \nDANNY I try. \nCOLETTE No false notes? \nShe pulls even closer. \nCOLETTE No deep dark secrets? \nShe goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her. \nDANNY (cold and abrupt): What are you up to? \nCOLETTE Nothing. \nDANNY What do you want from me, Colette? \nCOLETTE I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? \nDANNY It gets me through the day. \nCOLETTE You really need to lighten up. \nShe puts her hand on his leg. \nCOLETTE (cont'd) Just relax. \nHe moves his leg away. \nDANNY Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after. \nGARCETTI You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nDanny waiting on the corner. \nGARCETTI (V.O.) When is the deal going down? \nDANNY (V.O.) I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week. \nJimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and hands Danny the keys. \nON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU! \nDanny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, leaving Jimmy with the sign. JIMMY You sure you don't want me to go with you? \nDanny burns rubber. \nEXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT \nDanny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE BILL AND BIG BILL.

What's up? \nPooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing. \nLITTLE BILL He's blue. \nBIG BILL Comin' down from a 10 day ride. \nDanny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear. \nDANNY You want to do this some other time? \nPOOH-BEAR (gloomy and tired) Pull your pants down. \nDANNY I'm sorry? \nPOOH-BEAR Pull your motherfucking pants down. \nDanny looks to the two Bills for help. \nDANNY (laughing nervously) Come on, guys ... \nPOOH-BEAR Big Bill. \nBig Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his jacket and points it at Danny's head. \nBIG BILL Argh, matie. I'm a pirate. \nPOOH-BEAR Little Bill \nLittle Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is started into silence. \nThe saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat. \nPooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it under the light. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Introduce him to Captain Steubing. \nHe pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked. \nThe Bills escort Danny over to the cage.

Pockets the dope. \nDANNY Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel? \nPOOH-BEAR I'll keep that in mind. \nMOVE UNDER THE TABLE - Danny's Glock taped to the underside, out of sight. \nEXT.

Maybe not. (beat) By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers, soldiers, pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nA wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house. \nDANNY (V.O) In the fifties, the housewives got ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine. Methedrene ... \nShe attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette. \nDANNY (cont'd) Now that's a classic speed freak for you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll bet her poor husband never knew what hit him in the sack either. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTHE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor. \nSTOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV. \nDANNY (V.O.) There were even rumors that one of our presidents dabbled with mysterious \"energy shots\".  Imagine that: a slammer in the White House. \nKennedy talking animatedly. \nDANNY (cont'd) If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev never got a word in edgewise. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nA sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type. \nDANNY (V.O.) By the late 60's the government finally cracked down and sent the whole thing underground.  Bikers controlled the market for a while. \nINT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT \nThe trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the Kamikaze. \nDANNY (V.O.) But now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and the right ingredients can cook it up at home. \nINT. PHARMACY - NIGHT \nA CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION. \nDANNY (V.O.) Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak buying up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the morning. \nThe cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin plastered on his face. \nDANNY (cont'd) Take it from me, he ain't got no cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his kitchen and you'll find a whole grocery list of unsavory ingredients. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers. \nDANNY (V.O.) Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads for red phosphorus, ether and of course the cold medicine .. that's for Ephedrene, soon to become Methedrene \n", "test1_true": "DANNY (cont'd) This guy's a regular Julia Child. Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time. \nThe freaky cook sees something he doesn't like. His eyes widen. \nDANNY (cont'd) Oh-oh. \nEXT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nAs the structure explodes. \nINT. PARTY HOUSE - UNKNOWN \nThick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows. \nA huge container of empty beer cans, washed and neatly arranged. \nLines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as Nails as the Nuremberg rally. \nA GROUP OF TWEAKERS in the middle of a binge. \nTwo skinny women, NANCY and Teresa bent over a drawer-full of neatly folded socks on the living room floor.  They stare at the drawer as if they were pondering a Rembrandt. \nNANCY It ain't right \nTERESA You think? \nNANCY Something's off. \nTERESA We can do better. \nThey take the socks out and being rearranging them again. \nThree guys squeezed onto a couch together: KUJO, JIMMY THE FINN and CREEPER.  Kujo is talking a blue-streak.  He makes Dennis Leary took mealy-mouthed. \nCreeper and Jimmy stare straight ahead, clearly bugging. \nKUJO So the alphabet, I mean look at it, there's 26 letters.  Why not 27 or 28 or 106?  And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u. What the hell is up with that? \nCREEPER And sometimes y. \nKUJO What I'm saying is that I love it! It's great. I could go on all night about it. \nAnd he does. \nKUJO (cont'd) Let's take every letter individually. I mean, let's really break the mother's down. \nDANNY is sitting in an armchair.  He is the only one who looks tired. He sits there, taking the scene in. \nALL SOUNDS FADE OUT \nDANNY (V.O.) And so this is where I find myself. No. I should choose my words more wisely: this is the world I sought out.  The land of the perpetual night- party.  Day swallowing night and night swallowing day.  The crank compressing time like some divine piston on its awesome downstroke. \nDANNY'S P.O.V. - SCANNING THE ROOM.  NO SOUND.  The girl's folding the socks ... Kujo ranting on ... Creeper and Jimmy the Finn grinding their jaws ... the BLANKETS AND TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS. \nDANNY (cont'd) We've been at this for three days ... or is it four?  Tweakerrs, lokers, slammers coming and going, swearing eternal allegiance and undying love for one another, only to wake up after the binge and realize you wouldn't walk across the street to piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire. (beat) Is it three days or is it four? \nBACK ON DANNY. He blinks lethargically. \nDANNY (cont'd) I know what you're thinking. But don't give up on me just yet.  And for God's sake, don't pity me. Don't make any judgments until you've seen my whole story. (beat) And keep your eyes open. (beat) Nothing is what it seems. \nSuddenly ... \nKUJO (O.S.) OH SHIT! WE'RE OUT OF DRUGS! \nINT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT \nDanny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door. \nDANNY How the hell did we get this detail? \nJIMMY Guess it's our turn. \nDanny nods. \nDANNY What time is it? \nJIMMY Twelve \nDANNY Midnight? \nEXT. PARTY HOUSE - DAY \nAs the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun is blazing. \nThe party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major intersection. \nJimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light. \nDANNY Where to? \nJIMMY I know a guy. \nDANNY Lead the way. \nThey slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses. \nJIMMY Nice day \nDANNY I hadn't noticed. (beat) I've seen you around.  What's your name? \n", "test1_id": 2403, "test2_input": "LIZ That's so ... (not finishing the word) \nDANNY / TOM Melancholy? \nLIZ Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a beautiful composition. \nDANNY/TOM And the performance? \nLIZ (goofing) A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece. \nDANNY/TOM Thank you.  Thank you very much. \nLIZ And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it. \nDANNY/TOM Again, I thank you. \nLIZ I was talking about Miles. \nDanny playfully tackles her to the ground. \nDANNY/TOM You, madam, are a heartless wench. \nLIZ And you've got wiener breath. \nDANNY/TOM Really? \nLIZ It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch. \nDanny starts kissing her over and over again. \nLIZ (laughing) Tom! Gross! \nShe finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next to her, spooning her in the sand. \nDANNY/TOM You know how I make that song melancholy when I play it? I think of what my life would be like without you. \nLiz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny. \nLIZ Tom, let's spend the night here. \nDANNY/TOM There's no motels around here. \nLIZ No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it. \nINT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nDanny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet.  THE IMAGE IS STILL PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM. DANNY (at the vanity, whispering) Okay, we'll stay.  We'll stay. \nNOW THE DANNY IN THE IMAGE ANSWERS .... \nDANNY/TOM (on the beach) Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive. \nDANNY (at the vanity, softly) No ... We'll stay. \nBACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore. \nThe sun sinks completely below the horizon. \nA long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals. \nThe dying fish breaths its last. \nDanny (at the vanity) closes his eyes. \nSERIES OF QUICK CUTS \nThe trumpet goes back in the case. \nThe lid is closed. \nThe case goes back in the box. \nThe neatly folded clothes are laid on top. \nThe box goes back to the shelf. \nThe light in the closet is turned off. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN. \nEXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT \nDanny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table. \nTanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nDanny watching silently. \nTanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it. \nThe envelope lays there between them for the following conversation. \nDANNY You think I'm a Judas? \nTANNER Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord. \nDANNY Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit. \n", "test2_true": "Danny smiles. \nTANNER (cont'd) I'm serious.  He hates 'em.  You ever hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins? \nTanner shakes his head and smiles. \nDANNY Thanks for not judging me. \nTANNER It's not my place. \nDANNY Don't you wonder why I do it? \nTANNER The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill. \nDANNY You don't find that repugnant? \nTANNER Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know. \nDANNY Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid. \nTANNER Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him. (beat) Now take the money. \nDanny stuffs the money into his jacket. \nTANNER (cont'd) One think I do want to know is how the hell did you get yourself into this position to start with?  You seem like a smart enough guy. \nDANNY It's a long story.  Maybe I'll tell you all about it some day. \nGarcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up. \nDANNY (cont'd) Hey, Garcetti ... You ever get confused and try to flush yourself? \nGarcetti (all business) You tell him? \nTANNER I was getting to it. \nDANNY (to Tanner) Tell me what? \nGARCETTI I'll tell him. \nDANNY (worried) Tell me what? \nGarcetti sits down next to Danny. Sighs. \nGARCETTI (mock concern) Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back? \nDANNY Yeah.  What about him? \nGARCETTI Turns out he's connected. \nDANNY To who? \nGARCETTI The Mexicali Boys \nDANNY And what does this have to do with me? \nGarcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up. \nGARCETTI He knows somebody ratted him. \nDANNY What?! \nGARCETTI And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was. \nGarcetti leans in close \nGARCETTI (cont'd) You know that thing where they slit your throat and pull your tongue out of the hole. \nDanny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up.  Garcetti stalks him. \nGARCETTI (cont'd) Apparently they call it a necktie because it hangs down about yay long and looks very similar to a tie. Isn't that weird, Danny?  Isn't that weird? \nDANNY Shut up, Garcetti! \nDanny turns to Tanner \nDANNY If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man. \nTANNER Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people. \nDanny paces back and forth. \nTANNER (cont'd) And if you're that worried about it, maybe you ought to get out of town. \nDANNY How the hell am I gonna do that?  You guys are still stringing me a long on that possession charge. \nGARCETTI (mock surprise) You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet? \nGarcetti chuckles at Danny's fear \nDANNY Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me. \nGARCETTI Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time? \nTANNER Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A. \nDANNY When? \nTANNER Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.

You should have heard him howling. \nBACK TO PRESENT: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette \nPOOH-BEAR Then I took a Saws All and I cut His skull open \nQUICK FLASH: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP. Pooh-Bear reaching for something OFFSCREEN. POOH-BEAR (V.O.)

I mean, anyone stupid enough to jam me up doesn't really use their brain to begin with. You know what I'm saying? (beat, dead serious) So I took it. \nPooh-Bear makes a POPPING SOUND as he illustrates with his hands. \nQUICK FLASH BACK: Pooh-Bear looking down at SOMETHING in his hand, his face blossoming into a sick smile. \nBACK TO PRESENT: Danny listens somberly. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) Hell, I make better use out of it than he ever did.  Got it up in my freezer. I take it out from time-to- time, mix a little of it up in my dinner ....

Danny turns pale. \nPOOH-BEAR 10,000 a pound \nDanny decides to nerve it out \nDANNY Now you're insulting me.  Nice talking business with you. \nDanny gets up to leave. One of his hands shaking uncontrollably. He steadies it with the other hand. \nPOOH-BEAR 9,000.  Take it or leave it. \nDanny stops. \nDANNY I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as I'll go.  See ya'. \nDanny goes to leave again. \nPOOH-BEAR All right, all right. Don't get your knickers in a knot. I can live with eight. \nPooh-Bear stands up. \nPOOH-BEAR (cont'd) You got a deal. \nThey shake hands. \nPOOH-BEAR God damn, Danny, you got some nerve. Pooh-Bear respects that.

He is looking down at the package of COW BRAINS in his hand. \nPOOH-BEAR (in the grocery store) Hmm.

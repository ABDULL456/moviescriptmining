Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat. 
Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and talking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from her mouth. 
LESTAT Let's make some party of it, shall we? Maybe there's some life in the old lady yet? 
Louis flees into the street. 
LESTAT Come back, Louis, you are what you are. The plague would have got her within hours anyway. Merciful Death how you love your precious guilt. 
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
Louis running through an assortment of streets. All the night life of New Orleans flows by him. 
LOUIS (V.O.) For years I had not savored a human. And when I had Lestat's words made sense to me. I knew peace only when I killed and when I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm I knew again what peace could be. Yet even then I could not contenance it... 
EXT. WATERFRONT - DAWN 
Fingers of light in the sky. Louis, pale and shivering, walks splashing through the water. He comes to a huge sewer-pipe, crowded with rats. He crawls inside. 
EXT. WATERFRONT - SOME EVENINGS LATER 
The same sewer-pipe. Now the bodies of dead rats lie all around. A pair of fine leather boots splash through the water - Lestat's. 
INT. SEWER-PIPE - EVENING 
Louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems close to death. Lestat comes through. 
LESTAT All I need to find you Louis is follow the corpses of rats. 
He bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his own coat around him. 
LESTAT Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on. 
LOUIS No... 
They emerge from the sewer and walk along the waterfront. 
LESTAT Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms. 
LOUIS Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving. 
LESTAT That and more. 
He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering. 
LESTAT Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves. 
LOUIS Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel? 
LESTAT Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child. 
Louis is baffled. He follows. 
INT. INN - SUPPER ROOM 
Lestat enters. 
LESTAT She's here, your wounded one. 
LOUIS What are you saying? 
LESTAT You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine... 
Lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four- poster bed. Claudia lies there, angelic, under the coverlet, two marks on her neck. 
LOUIS Lestat! 
LESTAT You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her - 
LOUIS I didn't want to kill her. 
LESTAT Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive. 
Lestat shakes her gently. 
LESTAT Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well. 
LOUIS Lestat, what do you mean? 
Louis runs at him, but Lestat brushes him aside effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. Lestat bites his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's mouth... He winces in pain. 
LESTAT That's it dear. More. You must drink it to get well.

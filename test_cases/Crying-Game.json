{"test1_input": "JODY Nice to meet you, Fergus. \nFERGUS My pleasure, Jody \nEXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him. \nFERGUS Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree. \nJODY Tree. \nHe walks toward it, breathing heavily. \nJODY You've got to loosen my hands. \nFERGUS Can't. \nJODY Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you? \nFergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him. \nJODY Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants! \nFergus turns him around and unzips his fly. \nJODY Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying -- \nFergus takes Jody's penis out. \nJody takes two steps toward the wall. \nJODY I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all over myself. Will you hold my hands for me. \nFergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward. Jody now pisses with immense relief \nJODY Now, that was worth waiting for. \nFERGUS Hurry up, would you? \nJODY These things take time, Fergus. \nHe shakes his body. \nJODY It's amazing how these small details take on such importance... \nHe steps back. \nJODY Now put it back in. \nFERGUS Give us a break. \nJODY I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat. For fuck's sake, it's got no major diseases. \nFergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up. \nJODY Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well. \nFERGUS Shut up, would you? \nJODY I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus. \nFergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus leads Jody back to his chair. \nJODY Fergus? \nFERGUS Yeah? \nJODY Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you. \nHe begins to laugh. \nFERGUS The pleasure was all mine. \nFergus begins to laugh, without knowing why. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT. \nMaguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of laughter. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nJody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head. \n", "test1_true": "MAGUIRE What the fuck is this? \nFERGUS It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all. \nMAGUIRE You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep. \nFergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door. \nJODY Yeah. Get some sleep. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus sleeping. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nJody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands, watching him. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE AND FIELDS - DAY \nThe sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nFergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is sitting where he sat before, stock-still. \nFERGUS Did he talk? \nMaguire shakes his head. \nFERGUS Didn't make you laugh? \nMaguire shakes his head. \nFERGUS Here. Have some breakfast. \nHe hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs. \nJODY Good morning, Fergus? \nMaguire looks hard at him. \nMAGUIRE So he knows your name? \nFERGUS I told him. \nMAGUIRE Are you all there? \nHe rises, and drags Fergus out the door. \nFERGUS Back in a minute, Jody \nEXT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nMAGUIRE You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me? \nFERGUS Yes. \nMAGUIRE And do you know why? \nFERGUS Why? \nMAGUIRE Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why. \nMaguire goes back to the house. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nJody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters. \nJODY They giving you trouble, Fergus? \nFergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward Jody \nJODY It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of people. Those who give and those who take. \nFergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to feed him. \nJODY Ah, take the thing off, man. \nFergus says nothing and keeps feeding him. \n", "test1_id": 2898, "test2_input": "FERGUS So it was you all the time. \nMAGUIRE Who'd you think it was? \nFERGUS I thought it was Dave. \nMAGUIRE And who's Dave when he's at home? \nFERGUS He's at home. \nMAGUIRE Should blow you away, you know that? \nFERGUS I know that. \nMaguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks him on the teeth with his closed fist. \nMAGUIRE I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy? \nFERGUS I understand. \nMAGUIRE Fuck you, too -- \nJude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the street outside. \nJUDE Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love. \nMAGUIRE That true, Fergus? You in love? \nFERGUS Absolutely. \nMAGUIRE And what's she like between the sheets? \nFERGUS Definitely unusual. \nMAGUIRE And who is she? \nFERGUS Just a girl. \nMAGUIRE And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you? \nFERGUS Aye, I do, Peter. \nMAGUIRE Good. \nEXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT. \nThe car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club. \nIn the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the building. \nMAGUIRE So what do you think that is, Hennessy? \nFERGUS A hotel? \nMAGUIRE It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond. \nHe nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away. Fergus looks from the window to the car. \nFERGUS Who is he? \nMAGUIRE Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target. \nFERGUS Thank God for that. \nMAGUIRE You being cynical, Hennessy? \nFERGUS Hope not. \nMAGUIRE Good. So what do you think? \nFERGUS Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in. \nMAGUIRE Right. \nFERGUS So it's on the street. \nMAGUIRE Right. \nFERGUS Kind of suicide, isn't it? \nJude turns around to look at him. \nFERGUS But, then, I don't have a choice. \nJUDE Och, you do, Fergie. \nFERGUS Of course. I forgot. \n", "test2_true": "Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe- bar with some tables outside. \nEXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT. \nFergus and Jude, crossing the street. \nJUDE You keep your mind on the job, boy -- \nFERGUS And then you'll leave her out of it? \nJUDE Aye. Then we'll leave her be. \nThey take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel down the way. \nJUDE He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to get to the door. \nShe checks her watch. Fergus is sweating. \nFERGUS And what if I say no? \nJUDE You know what. Go. \nDown by the brothel, the door swings open. \nFergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel. There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it. The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens. \nFergus quickens his pace. \nJude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking. \nThe gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car. \nA burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward the old gent. \nFergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes Fergus's elbow. \nGENT Pardon me, young man -- \nFergus walks on. \nJude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler. Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off. \nWhen the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back. \nJude smiles and leaps up as he approaches. \nJUDE You were made for this. \nFERGUS Was I? \nJUDE Perfect. \nFERGUS And what happens then? \nJUDE We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do. \nFERGUS And what if you don't? \nJUDE Fergus, I think you don't trust me. \nFERGUS You may be right. \nJUDE Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear. \nJude begins to walk away. \nFERGUS Jude? \nJUDE Yes? \nFERGUS Who's the old geezer? \nJUDE Some judge... \nShe walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car. Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes inside; he follows. \nFERGUS Why'd you follow me, Dil? \nDIL Was jealous, Jimmy. \nShe downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high. \nFERGUS Shouldn't be, Dil \nDIL Why shouldn't I be jealous? \n", "test2_id": 2899, "test3_input": "Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. \nDIL Why are we going here, Jimmy? \nFERGUS Look on it like a honeymoon. \nINT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT. \nFrom above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. \nTime lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. \nEXT. SITE - EVENING. \nA car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand. \nINT. SITE - EVENING. \nFergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude. \nJUDE You a handyman, Fergie? \nFERGUS I take pride in my work. \nJUDE I sincerely hope so. \nFergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag. \nJUDE Tools of the trade. \nShe kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly. \nJUDE And forget about the girl. \nFergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. \nINT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT. \nFergus enters. The room is empty. He calls. \nFERGUS Dil? \nNo reply. He runs outside. \nEXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. \nFergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her. \nFERGUS Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here? \nDIL I'm going home! \nFERGUS Told you to stay in the hotel! \nDIL Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me. \nThey are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very drunk. \nFERGUS I had to go to work! \nDIL Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy. \nHe takes her arm. \nFERGUS Come on... \nDIL No! I'm going home... \nFergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat. \nDIL So tell me. \nFERGUS I was trying to get out of something. \nDIL No! Tell me everything, Jimmy. \nFergus looks at her. \nFERGUS You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil. \nDIL You mean that? \nFERGUS Yes. \nAnd she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue. \nFERGUS Stop it, would you? \n", "test3_true": "FERGUS Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake -- \nStill no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She opens her eyes slowly. \nDIL Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy, then I'll be all right. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. \nHe walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then goes to the window to check the street outside. \nShe takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey. \nFERGUS You heard what I said, Dil? \nDIL My pills... \nShe points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom. \nFERGUS What pills? \nDIL Prescription. For my condition. \nFERGUS What condition? \nDIL My condition. Ennui. \nHe goes and gets the pills. \nShe takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey bottle. \nFERGUS Are you supposed to take that many? \nDIL Only in times of extreme stress. \nShe walks around the room, drinking, then sits down. \nDIL See, they all say good-bye sometime. 'Cept for him. \nShe looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus. \nFERGUS Are you all right, Dil? \nDIL I will be. \nShe stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees. \nDIL Go on, then. \nFergus walks slowly toward the door. \nFERGUS Good-bye, Dil \nDIL Jimmy? \nFERGUS What? \nDIL Don't go like that. \nShe looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly attractive about her. \nDIL Can't help what I am. \nHe walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips. \nWe see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his. \nDIL Knew you had a heart... \nFergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it. \nFERGUS Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man. \nDIL You knew which man? \nFERGUS Your soldier. \nDIL You knew my Jody? \nShe still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away. \nFERGUS Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days. \nDIL You knew my Jody? \nFERGUS Are you listening? \n", "test3_id": 2900}

{"train": "The Crying Game \nThe Crying Game \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CARNIVAL - DAY \nA loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a Woman,\" as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris Wheel turning round and round. \nA black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings around a bowling pin. \nJODY And that's cricket, hon. \nAn attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in his huge hands. He gives it to the girl. \nJODY You want it? \nGIRL Sure. \nJODY Doesn't matter if you don't. \nHe puts his arm around her and drags her on. \nJODY Jody won't be offended. Jody's never offended. What'd you say your name was? \nGIRL Jude. \nJODY Jude. Suits you, Jude. \nJUDE The teddy bear? \nJODY No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June. \nHe comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET. \nJODY Gotta piss, Jude. \nHe holds her hand. \nJODY Don't run off, Jude. \nJUDE You don't know me, do you? \nJody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored. \nJODY (inside) What if I did? \nJUDE You'd know I wouldn't run off. \nShe stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark- haired man in a dark jacket. He nods. \nJODY Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude. \nJUDE You didn't? \nJODY And you know what? \nJUDE Tell me, Jody \nHe staggers out, buttoning up. \nJODY It's nice. \nHe goes to kiss her. She turns her head away. \nJUDE Not here. \nJODY Who gives a fuck. \nJUDE You never know. \nShe pulls him over toward the water. \nJODY I never know nothing. \nJUDE People. They could be looking. \nJody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle. \nJUDE Come and get me, soldier -- \nJODY Whatever you say, Jude... \nHe sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them. \nCLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly. \nJUDE Fucking do. I had him all over me. \nHe touches her face. \nFERGUS Tough work, that. \nJUDE Someone's got to do it. \nShe rubs her hand on his chest. \nJUDE Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of you. \nShe sidles closer, coming on to him. \nJUDE And you know what, Fergus? One of you made me want it... \nShe puts her lips to his neck. \nFERGUS Which one? \nShe doesn't answer. They embrace. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING. \nA hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward a greenhouse. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nDusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap. Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He holds one out toward him. \nFERGUS Eat something, would you? \nJODY Can't. \nFERGUS What do you mean you can't? \nJODY Can't eat through a canvas bag. \nFergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats, slowly. \nJODY This is a farce, man. \nFERGUS How is it a farce? \nJODY I seen your fucking face. \nFERGUS So, what do I look like? \nJODY You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face. \nFERGUS Am I? \nJODY Yeah. And the brown eyes. \nFergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth. \nJODY You're the handsome one. \nJody eats the last bits. \nJODY Thank you, handsome. \nFERGUS My pleasure. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nJude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She is carrying a pot of tea and two cups. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nIt is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat. \nJODY I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a Christian, will you? \nJude comes into view. \nJODY Tell him to take the hood off, honey... \nJude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground. \nFERGUS How did you know it was her? \nJODY I can smell her perfume. \nJude pours out the tea. \nJUDE See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance. \nJODY Nope. Not handsome at all. \nFERGUS You trying to hurt my feelings? \nJODY No. It's the truth. \nFERGUS Well, I could say the same about you. \nJODY Could you? \nFERGUS But I won't. We're more polite around these parts. \nJODY So I've noticed. \nFergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on his lap. \nJODY Hey -- \nFERGUS What is it now? \nJODY You're going to have to do it, aren't you? \nFERGUS Do what? \nJODY Kill me. \nFERGUS What makes you think that? \nJODY They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me. \nFERGUS They won't let him die. \nJODY You want to bet? \nFERGUS I'm not a gambling man. \nJODY And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose. \nFERGUS Why can't we? \nJODY Not in your nature. \nFERGUS What do you know about my nature? \nJODY I'm talking about your people, not you. \nFERGUS What the fuck do you know about my people? \nJODY Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go. \nFERGUS Shut the fuck up, would you? \nJODY And you know the funny thing? \nFERGUS No, what's the funny thing? \nJODY I didn't even fancy her. \nFERGUS Didn't look like that to me... \nJODY She's not my type. \nHe looks at Fergus. \nJODY C'mere. \nFERGUS No. \nJODY Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something. \nFERGUS What? \nJODY My inside pocket. \nFergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's inside pocket. \nJODY Take out the wallet. \nFergus's hand emerges with a wallet. \nJODY Open it. \nCLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification photograph. \nJODY Inside. There's a picture. \nFergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites, smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles. \nJODY Nice to meet you, Fergus. \nFERGUS My pleasure, Jody \nEXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him. \nFERGUS Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree. \nJODY Tree. \nHe walks toward it, breathing heavily. \nJODY You've got to loosen my hands. \nFERGUS Can't. \nJODY Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you? \nFergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him. \nJODY Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants! \nFergus turns him around and unzips his fly. \nJODY Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying -- \nFergus takes Jody's penis out. \nJody takes two steps toward the wall. \nJODY I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all over myself. Will you hold my hands for me. \nFergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward. Jody now pisses with immense relief \nJODY Now, that was worth waiting for. \nFERGUS Hurry up, would you? \nJODY These things take time, Fergus. \nHe shakes his body. \nJODY It's amazing how these small details take on such importance... \nHe steps back. \nJODY Now put it back in. \nFERGUS Give us a break. \nJODY I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat. For fuck's sake, it's got no major diseases. \nFergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up. \nJODY Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well. \nFERGUS Shut up, would you? \nJODY I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus. \nFergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus leads Jody back to his chair. \nJODY Fergus? \nFERGUS Yeah? \nJODY Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you. \nHe begins to laugh. \nFERGUS The pleasure was all mine. \nFergus begins to laugh, without knowing why. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT. \nMaguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of laughter. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nJody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head. \nJODY It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I prattle on, do you? \nFergus shakes his head and says nothing. \nJODY I will take it by your silence that you don't. \nHe eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody. \nJODY Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the frog. Ever heard of them? \nFergus says nothing. \nJODY Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. Frog says, \"If I give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me.\" Scorpion replies, \"It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown.\" Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, \"Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?\" Scorpion replies, \"I can't help it, it's in my nature.\" \nJody chuckles under his hood. \nFERGUS So what's that supposed to mean? \nJODY Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man. \nFERGUS Why? \nJODY 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature. \nFergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles up at him. \nJODY See? I was right about you. \nFERGUS Don't be so sure. \nJODY Jody's always right. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON. \nBoth men dozing in the heat. \nJODY Where would you most like to be now, man? \nFERGUS Doesn't matter where. \nJODY Come on, man. If this shit was all over. \nFERGUS Having a pint in the Rock. \nJODY You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring. \nFERGUS Like what? \nJODY Like having a pint in the Metro -- \nFergus laughs. \nFERGUS Having two pints in the Rock. \nJODY Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita. \nFERGUS Who's Dil? \nJODY My special friend. \nFERGUS Oh, yeah. \nJODY We got simple tastes, you and me. \nFERGUS The best. \nJODY But you fellas never get a break, do you? \nFERGUS Do you? \nJODY Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? \nFERGUS We don't look on it like that. \nJODY I've often wondered how you do it. \nFERGUS Depends on what you believe in. \nJODY What do you believe in? \nFERGUS That you guys shouldn't be here. \nJODY It's as simple as that? \nFERGUS Yes. \nJude enters. \nJody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him. \nJODY Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit more wind -- \nFergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on him again. \nJODY Bit of fun, Fergus, eh? \nAnd suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to Fergus. \nJODY Told you I was fast -- \nFergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody \nJODY Don't do it. \nAnd suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt and the huge wheels grind over him. \nFergus, screaming, \"No-!\" He almost moves forward, then sees soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns and runs. \nEXT. TREES - DAY \nFergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as he runs. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY \nTinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it, shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nBullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the others on the floor, scrambling for weapons. \nEXT. TREES - DAY \nFergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging branches till eventually he is hidden from sight. \nEXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN. \nA forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields. \nAn old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car appears; and Fergus gets out of it. \nTOMMY Fergus! \nFERGUS You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping? \nINT. CARAVAN - DAY \nThe old man pouring whiskey into a teacup. \nTOMMY You'll notice I've asked you nothing. \nFERGUS That's wise, Tommy. \nTOMMY All right, then. I like to be wise. \nHe pours Fergus more whiskey. \nTOMMY So what do you need, Fergus? \nFERGUS Need to go across the water. \nTOMMY Do you now. \nFERGUS Need to lose myself awhile. \nTOMMY Aha. \nHe looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette. \nHe puffs. \nTOMMY There's a man I know ships cattle to London. \nEXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING. \nThe ferry, churning into the sunset. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. BUILDING SITE - DAY \nFADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and relentlessly, like a machine. \nWe see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole. \nFergus's face, as he works. \nDil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them is empty. \nDIL That should make her happy. \nFERGUS Who's she? \nDIL Don't know. Who is she? \nEXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. \nFergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway. \nThe doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows. \nINT. METRO - EVENING. \nHalf full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way through it. \nBARMAN Hi, Dil \nDIL Hiya, hon. \nShe sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat. \nBARMAN What'll it be? \nFERGUS A bottle of Guinness. \nDil, looking at Fergus. \nDIL See that, Col? \nCOL See what, Dil? \nDIL He gave me a look. \nCOL Did he? \nFergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink. \nDIL Just cut his hair, you know. \nCOL Yeah? \nDIL What you think? \nCOL Nice. \nFergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face turned away, but sees him in the mirror. \nDIL There, he did it again. \nCOL Saw that one. \nDIL What would you call it? \nCOL Now, that was a look. \nShe eyes Fergus in the mirror. \nDIL Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking. \nThe barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus. \nCOL She wants to know do you want to know what she's drinking. \nFergus is about to talk when she pipes up. \nDIL A margarita. \nThe barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink. \nDIL Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col. \nCOL She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair. \nFERGUS Tell her I'm very happy with it. \nDIL He's Scottish, Col. \nCOL Scottish? \nFERGUS Yeah. \nDIL What'd he say, Col? \nCOL He agreed that he was. \nThey walk out of the alley. \nFERGUS You all right? \nDIL Yes, thank you. \nFERGUS What was that all about? \nDIL He wants me to perform for him. \nFERGUS Perform? \nDIL You know. \nFERGUS You on the game? \nDIL God no. I'm a hairdresser. \nFergus looks back. Dave is rising. \nFERGUS He's getting up. \nDIL You can't leave me then, can you? \nEXT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLAT \nFergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs. \nDIL You want me to ask you in, right? \nFERGUS No, I didn't -- \nDIL But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap. \nThere is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave, holding his neck. \nDAVE Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt. \nDil leans close to Fergus. \nDIL If you kissed me, it would really get his goat. \nShe tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly. \nDIL Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane. \nFERGUS Where? \nDIL Half-five. At Millie's. \nShe goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave. \nEXT. HAIR SALON - DAY \nDil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus. \nDIL Give me that look again. \nFERGUS What look? \nDIL The one you gave me in the Metro. \nFergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She holds them, with theatrical feeling. \nDIL Darling, you shouldn't have. \nShe laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon pull back a curtain, and they all clap. \nFERGUS What's that about? \nDIL They're jealous. \nFERGUS Why? \nDIL I wonder. \nShe takes his arm and walks off with him. \nINT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. \nFergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks on their table, then leaves. \nDIL Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it? \nFERGUS Like what? \nDIL Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes? \nDAVE Fucking mad! \nFergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms. \nDAVE Don't chuck my clothes out! \nDIL Take your fucking goldfish, too! \nDil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the street. \nDAVE You fucking bitch! \nHe tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands. \nDAVE Murderer! \nUpstairs, Dil closes the window shut. \nDIL Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace? \nFERGUS Must be in love to manage that. \nDIL Doesn't know the meaning of the word. \nFergus stands as Dil hands him a glass. \nFERGUS He lived here with you? \nDIL Tried to. Sit down, will you? \nFergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from her to the picture. \nFERGUS What about him? \nHe nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink. \nDIL He was different. \nFERGUS How different? \nDIL As different as it's possible to be. \nFERGUS Tell me about him. \nDIL No. \nFERGUS Shouldn't I go? \nDIL Yes. \nAnd they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently passionate. \nThey fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress with his hands. She suddenly pulls away. \nDIL No -- \nFERGUS Did you do that to him? \nShe comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close to his ear. \nDIL You want to know how I kissed him? \nFERGUS Yes... \nDIL Are you jealous of him? \nFERGUS Maybe. \nDIL That's good... \nShe opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes. \nFERGUS What would he think? \nDIL Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool. \nShe sits in front of the mirror. \nFERGUS Do you miss him? \nDIL What do you think? \nFERGUS I think you do. \nDIL (dreamily) You say that like a gentleman. \nFERGUS Do I? \nCol, the barman, pours her drink. \nDIL One for him, too. \nCol pours and smiles. \nDIL Drink. \nFERGUS What is this? \nDIL I'm superstitious. Drink. \nHe drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one. \nDIL Can't leave me now. \nFERGUS Aha. \nDIL The thing is, can you go the distance? \nFERGUS Depends what it is. \nDIL No, depends on nothing. \nShe takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She slams it back. He sips. \nDIL In one. \nShe tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. \nShe enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs. \nDIL What you thinking of, hon? \nFERGUS I'm thinking of your man. \nDIL Why? \nFERGUS I'm wondering why you keep his things. \nDIL Told you, I'm superstitious. \nShe turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her shoulders. \nFERGUS Did he ever tell you you were beautiful? \nDIL All the time. \nFergus runs his hand down her throat. \nDIL Even now. \nFERGUS No... \nDIL He looks after me. He's a gentleman too. \nShe draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down. They kiss passionately. \nDIL Give me one minute. \nShe walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks extraordinarily beautiful. \nHe reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward him. He begins to kiss her face and neck. \nFERGUS Would he have minded? \nShe murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders. \nCLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness. Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man. \nFergus sits there, frozen, staring at her. \nDIL You did know, didn't you? \nFergus says nothing. \nDIL Oh my God. \nShe gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him. Fergus smacks the hand away. \nFERGUS Jesus. I feel sick -- \nHe gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet. \nDIL Don't go, Jimmy -- \nFergus leaves. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT. \nFergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We hear the song \"The Crying Game.\" \nFergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and sticks it in the letter box. \nEXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY \nA man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine. \nBelow the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working. \nINT. SITE - DAY \nFergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out. \nFergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus . \nDEVEROUX How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum? \nFRANKNUM Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux. \nDEVEROUX Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid. \nFERGUS Sorry. \nDEVEROUX Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum? \nFRANKNUM Not in my experience. \nDEVEROUX Off his wages. \nFERGUS Do you mean that? \nDEVEROUX He wants to know do I mean that. \nFRANKNUM I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux. \nDEVEROUX Bloody right I do... \nThrough this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at her, looking up her skirt, etc. \nShe passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him. \nDEVEROUX Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart? \nFERGUS She's not a tart. \nDEVEROUX No, of course not, she's a lady. \nFERGUS She's not that either. \nFergus walks out of the room. \nFergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks and opens the hamper. \nDIL Darling -- \nShe is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She pecks him on the cheek. \nDIL Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say. \nFERGUS What you doing here? \nDIL Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon. \nFERGUS Don't call me that. \nDIL Sorry, darling. \nFERGUS Give it over, Dil -- \nDIL Apologies, my sweet. \nFergus smiles in spite of himself. \nDIL That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa. \nShe takes out a thermos and pours him some tea. \nFERGUS You're something else, Dil, you know that? \nDIL Never said a truer word. \nShe hands him a neatly cut sandwich. \nDIL Make it up to me, then. \nFERGUS How? \nDIL Ask to meet me again. \nFERGUS Will you meet me again? \nDIL When? \nFERGUS Whenever. Tonight. \nShe leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site. \nEXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. \nFergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling. Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach. \nFERGUS Do they know? \nDIL Know what, honey? \nFERGUS Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that. \nDIL Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings. \nFERGUS Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl. \nDIL Details, baby, details. \nFERGUS So they do know. \nDIL All right, they do. \nShe takes his arm as they walk off. \nFERGUS Don't. \nDIL Sorry. \nFERGUS I should have known, shouldn't I? \nDIL Probably. \nFERGUS Kind of wish I didn't. \nDIL You can always pretend. \nFERGUS That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he? \nDIL Absolutely. \nFERGUS Won't be quite the same though, will it? \nDIL Are you pretending yet? \nFERGUS I'm working on it. \nFergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look. \nFERGUS There's Dave. He knew too. \nDIL Stop it, Jimmy. \nFERGUS Am I becoming repetitious? \nDIL A little. \nFERGUS Sorry. \nThey reach her door. The car stops. \nFERGUS Don't ask me in. \nDIL Please, Jimmy. \nFERGUS No. Can't pretend that much. \nDIL I miss you, Jimmy. \nFERGUS Should have stayed a girl. \nDIL Don't be cruel. \nFERGUS Okay. Be a good girl and go inside. \nDIL Only if you kiss me. \nFERGUS What the fuck do you know, Jude? \nShe pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth. \nJUDE You fucking tell me, boy -- \nFergus stares at her. Then says quietly: \nFERGUS She's nobody. She likes me. \nJUDE So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us. \nShe kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple. \nJUDE Keep the faith. \nShe goes. Fergus stands in the darkness. \nEXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. \nFergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand. \nHe stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then the chair turns and we see it is Jude. \nFergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil \nINT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. \nJUDE He your boyfriend? \nJude, turning in the chair. \nJUDE Lucky you. \nINT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. \nDIL Carnations. \nFERGUS What? \nDIL He'd bring me carnations. \nFERGUS So I got it wrong, then. \nDIL Not at all, honey. \nFERGUS Don't. \nDIL Okay. \nShe smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly. \nHe throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog- marches her out. \nFERGUS Come on. \nDIL Why, honey -- \nFERGUS Come on. \nDIL You gonna tell me why? \nFERGUS No. \nAs they pass Jude, she smiles. \nEXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. \nOutside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away. \nDIL What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong \nFERGUS Not here. \nThey pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising. \nINT. METRO - NIGHT. \nDil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar. \nDIL You gonna tell me what it is? \nA figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude. \nJUDE What was it? \nDIL You know her, Jimmy? \nThere are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face. \nDIL Don't. My makeup. \nShe sits down; he joins her. \nDIL She own you, Jimmy? \nFERGUS Yes. \nDIL She from Scotland too? \nFERGUS You could say that. \nDIL And you're not going to tell me more? \nFERGUS I can't. \nHe wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more. \nDIL What you doing, Jimmy? \nFERGUS I'm not sure. \nDIL Do you like me even a little bit? \nFERGUS More than that. \nDil's face, staring at him. \nFERGUS Come on, let's go for a walk. \nShe allows herself to be led out. \nEXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT. \nDil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window. \nFERGUS You do something for me, Dil? \nDIL Anything. \nFERGUS You'd do anything for me? \nDIL Afraid so. \nFERGUS You got the keys to the shop? \nThey walk inside. \nINT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT. \nDil and Fergus standing in the darkness. \nDIL You want another haircut, baby? \nFERGUS No. Sit down. \nHe sits her down in one of the chairs. \nFERGUS You'd do anything for me? \nDil nods. \nDIL Anything. \nFergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head leaps back. \nDIL No way -- \nFERGUS You said anything, Dil \nDIL A girl has to draw the line somewhere -- \nFERGUS Want to change you to a man, Dil... \nShe stares at him. \nDIL Why? \nFERGUS It's a secret. \nDIL You'd like me better that way, Jimmy? \nFERGUS Yes. \nDIL And you wouldn't leave me? \nFergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. \nDIL Why are we going here, Jimmy? \nFERGUS Look on it like a honeymoon. \nINT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT. \nFrom above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. \nTime lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. \nEXT. SITE - EVENING. \nA car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand. \nINT. SITE - EVENING. \nFergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude. \nJUDE You a handyman, Fergie? \nFERGUS I take pride in my work. \nJUDE I sincerely hope so. \nFergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag. \nJUDE Tools of the trade. \nShe kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly. \nJUDE And forget about the girl. \nFergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. \nINT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT. \nFergus enters. The room is empty. He calls. \nFERGUS Dil? \nNo reply. He runs outside. \nEXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. \nFergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her. \nFERGUS Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here? \nDIL I'm going home! \nFERGUS Told you to stay in the hotel! \nDIL Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me. \nThey are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very drunk. \nFERGUS I had to go to work! \nDIL Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy. \nHe takes her arm. \nFERGUS Come on... \nDIL No! I'm going home... \nFergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat. \nDIL So tell me. \nFERGUS I was trying to get out of something. \nDIL No! Tell me everything, Jimmy. \nFergus looks at her. \nFERGUS You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil. \nDIL You mean that? \nFERGUS Yes. \nAnd she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue. \nFERGUS Stop it, would you? \nDil smiles woozily. \nDIL Yes. \nFERGUS I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died. \nDIL Died... \nFERGUS Did you hear me? \nDIL You killed my Jody? \nFERGUS In a manner of speaking. \nDIL It was you... \nShe is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere. \nFERGUS You should scream. You should beat my head off. \nShe woozily tries to hit him round the face. \nDIL You killed my Jody \nFERGUS No. \nDIL You didn't. \nFERGUS I suppose I tried. \nDIL You tried. \nFERGUS Don't you want to kill me? \nDil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him. \nDIL Bang... \nHe strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily \nDIL Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too. \nFERGUS Okay. \nHer eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks down at her, almost fondly. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING. \nThey are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes. She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the gun. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING. \nJude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT. \nDil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to wake him. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING. \nJude, in front of a mirror, getting ready. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT. \nShe draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking so it is secure. \nFERGUS What the fuck -- \nDil speaks unnaturally quietly. \nDIL So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING. \nJude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and slips it in her handbag. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING. \nDil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand. \nDIL Didn't really listen last night. I heard but I didn't listen. \nFergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings. \nDIL That won't do you no good. Dil knows how to tie a body. \nShe stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus. \nThe judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT - DAY \nDil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck -- \"The Crying Game\" song. She comes to the bed, and points the gun at Fergus's head. \nDIL You like me now, Jimmy? \nFERGUS I like you, Dil -- \nDIL Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more. \nFERGUS More what? \nDIL More endearments. \nFERGUS I like you, DIl \nDIL Love me. \nFERGUS Yes. \nDIL Tell me you love me. \nFERGUS Whatever you say, Dil. \nDIL Then say it. \nFERGUS Love you, Dil. \nDIL You do? \nFERGUS Yeah. \nDIL What would you do for me? \nFERGUS Anything. \nShe begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest. \nDIL Say it again. \nFERGUS I'd do anything for you, Dil. \nShe pulls on his bindings to release him. \nEXT. STREET. \nTwo police cars, sirens wailing. \nINT. DIL'S FLAT. \nDil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound his hands are nearly undone. \nDIL And you'll never leave me? \nFERGUS Never. \nDIL I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it. \nHis arm is free. He strokes her hair. \nFERGUS I'm sorry, Dil. \nShe shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the background. \nJude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a gun. \nJUDE You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough. But twice. \nDil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude. \nDIL You didn't knock, honey -- \nDil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the floor. \nFERGUS Dil! \nJUDE Get that thing off me, Fergus -- \nDil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude. \nDIL What was that she called you, Jimmy? \nFERGUS Fergus. \nDIL What's Fergus? \n", "test1_input": "Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others. \nMAGUIRE We've had word. They've used every trick in the book on him. He's starting to talk. You're going to have to do it in the morning. \nMaguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods. \nMAGUIRE You OK about that? \nFERGUS I'm a volunteer, am n't I? \nMAGUIRE Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days. \nJUDE Not the only one -- \nMAGUIRE Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus. \nFERGUS Peter. \nMAGUIRE What? \nFERGUS Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight -- \nJUDE You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter. \nMAGUIRE Shut the fuck up, Jude. \nHe turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's shoulder. \nMAGUIRE Why do you want to do that for? \nFERGUS Would make me feel better about it. \nMAGUIRE You sure about that? \nFERGUS I'm sure. \nMAGUIRE Okay. You're a good man, Fergus. \nFergus leaves. \nINT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT. \nFergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody. \nJody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound of crying. \nFERGUS Don't. \nJODY I'm sorry. \nThe crying stops. \nJODY Help me. \nFERGUS How can I? \nJODY I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette. \nFergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke. \nJODY Don't even smoke, you know that? It just seemed the right thing to do. \nFergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips. Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth. \nFERGUS Go to sleep now. \nJODY I don't want to sleep. Tell me something. \nFERGUS What? \nJODY A story. \nFERGUS Like the one about the frog? \nJODY And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything. \nFERGUS When I was a child... \nJODY Yeah? \nFERGUS I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things... \nJODY What does that mean? \nFERGUS Nothing. \nJODY Tell me something, anything. \n", "test1_true": "JODY Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus? \nFERGUS Me? No, I'm not good for much... \nEXT. FIELDS - MORNING. \nThe farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it. \nEXT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING. \nMaguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks the chamber. \nFergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his back, by the elbow. \nFERGUS Stand up, now -- \nJody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire. \nMAGUIRE I wish to say on behalf of the Irish Republican Army -- \nFergus turns with sudden fierceness. \nFERGUS Leave him be -- \nHe pulls Jody through the fields. \nEXT. TREES - MORNING. \nFergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his back. \nJODY Take the hood off, Fergus -- \nFERGUS No. \nJODY I want to see a bit. Please, please. Don't make me die like an animal. \nFergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a cut lip where Jude struck him. \nFergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward. Fergus is all cold and businesslike. \nJODY I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus? \nFERGUS Why? \nJODY Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro -- \nFERGUS Stop that talk now -- \nJODY Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus? \nFERGUS The fastest. \nJODY Faster than cricket? \nFERGUS Cricket's in the halfpenny place. \nJODY So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there? \nFERGUS You won't run. \nJODY But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back -- \nJody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands, then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in fury after him. \nFERGUS JODY!!! \nFergus aims, then changes his mind and runs. \nFERGUS You stupid bastard -- \nJODY What you say, faster? \nFERGUS I said you bastard -- stop -- \nJODY Got to catch me first -- \nFergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing, almost laughing. \nJODY Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called? \nFERGUS Hurling -- \nJODY What? \nFERGUS Hurling -- \n", "test1_id": 2898, "test2_input": "Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way. \nCOL Take it out, if you want. \nFergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and drinks with the other. \nCOL You came to see her, didn't you? \nFergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to his left smiles at him. \nCOL Something I should tell you. She's -- \nFERGUS She's what? \nThe barman looks up toward the stage. \nCOL She's on. \nTHE JUKEBOX. \nA hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by Dave Berry, \"The Crying Game.\" \nAT THE BAR. \nFergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins, making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands. \nThe crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of approval or derision we can't be sure. \nFergus watching. \nDil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song. The crowd cheers. \nFergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar, toward him. \nDIL He's still looking, Col. \nCOL Persistent. \nDIL Good thing in a man. \nCOL An excellent quality. \nDIL Maybe he wants something. \nCOL I would expect he does. \nDIL Ask him. \nCOL Ask him yourself. \nShe looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him. \nDIL So tell me. \nFergus says nothing. He shrugs. \nDIL Everybody wants something. \nFERGUS Not me. \nDIL Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col? \nCol shrugs. \nDIL You old-fashioned? \nFERGUS Must be. \nThe burly man comes up to her. \nMAN Got the money, Dil? \nDIL Fuck off, Dave. \nDAVE You fucking promised. \nDIL Did I? \nDAVE You fucking did. \nHe suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink. \nDAVE Didn't you?

PUB - NIGHT. \nFergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an alley. He looks up it. \nP0V - ALLEY. \nWe see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her roughly. \nDAVE Don't be like that -- \nDIL You heard me -- \nShe beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs after her. \nDAVE Got very fucking grand, haven't we -- \nHe tries to pull her back. \nDAVE Talk to me, you stupid bitch -- \nThey both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch. She smiles. \nDIL Hi. \nFERGUS Hi. You forgot your bag. \nHe holds it up to show her. \nDIL Thank you. \nDAVE Who the fuck is he? \nDIL Jimmy. \nDAVE It's him, isn't it? \nDIL Maybe. \nDave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on the ground. \nDIL See, they get the wrong idea. \nDAVE (from the ground) Cunt. \nFergus puts his foot on Dave's neck. \nFERGUS What was that? \nDIL They all get the wrong idea. \nDAVE Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt. \nDIL Charming. \nDave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus presses down his foot. He looks to Dil. \nFERGUS What'll I do? \nDIL Break his neck. \nFergus presses his foot. \nDIL No, don't. \nShe bends low to Dave. \nDIL He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me? \nDAVE Cunt. \nBut his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs his arm. \nDIL Come on, honey. \nShe draws him away. \nEXT.

And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy? \nFERGUS I understand. \nMAGUIRE Fuck you, too -- \nJude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the street outside. \nJUDE Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love. \nMAGUIRE That true, Fergus? You in love? \nFERGUS Absolutely. \nMAGUIRE And what's she like between the sheets? \nFERGUS Definitely unusual. \nMAGUIRE And who is she? \nFERGUS Just a girl. \nMAGUIRE And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you? \nFERGUS Aye, I do, Peter. \nMAGUIRE Good. \nEXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT. \nThe car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club. \nIn the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the building. \nMAGUIRE So what do you think that is, Hennessy? \nFERGUS A hotel? \nMAGUIRE It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond. \nHe nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away. Fergus looks from the window to the car. \nFERGUS Who is he? \nMAGUIRE Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target. \nFERGUS Thank God for that. \nMAGUIRE You being cynical, Hennessy? \nFERGUS Hope not. \nMAGUIRE Good. So what do you think? \nFERGUS Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in. \nMAGUIRE Right. \nFERGUS So it's on the street. \nMAGUIRE Right. \nFERGUS Kind of suicide, isn't it? \nJude turns around to look at him. \nFERGUS But, then, I don't have a choice. \nJUDE Och, you do, Fergie. \nFERGUS Of course.

Then we'll leave her be. \nThey take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel down the way. \nJUDE He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to get to the door. \nShe checks her watch. Fergus is sweating. \nFERGUS And what if I say no? \nJUDE You know what. Go. \nDown by the brothel, the door swings open. \nFergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel. There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it. The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens. \nFergus quickens his pace. \nJude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking. \nThe gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car. \nA burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward the old gent. \nFergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes Fergus's elbow. \nGENT Pardon me, young man -- \nFergus walks on. \nJude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler. Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off. \nWhen the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back. \nJude smiles and leaps up as he approaches. \nJUDE You were made for this. \nFERGUS Was I? \nJUDE Perfect. \nFERGUS And what happens then? \nJUDE We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do. \nFERGUS And what if you don't? \nJUDE Fergus, I think you don't trust me. \nFERGUS You may be right. \nJUDE Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear. \nJude begins to walk away. \nFERGUS Jude? \nJUDE Yes? \nFERGUS Who's the old geezer? \nJUDE Some judge... \nShe walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.

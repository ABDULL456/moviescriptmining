White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow. 
White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itís Fredrick  -  just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He doesnít scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth. 
Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteís neck, traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess. 
INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing noise. 
BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength. The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run away but glances at the floor. 
The fish is flapping about  -  still alive. 
EXT.  STREET 
White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance: LIBRARY. 
INT.  POLICE STATION 
A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood blast away violently. 
BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship. 
A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled. 
ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman. 
BUMSTEAD Dammit! 
MISS CRENSHAW Sorry, sir. 
BUMSTEAD Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you? 
MISS CRENSHAW Patricia Crenshaw. 
She puts out her hand. 
MISS CRENSHAW Iím your new assistant. 
BUMSTEAD I didnít requisition a secretary. 
MISS CRENSHAW The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand. 
BUMSTEAD (uncertain) Oh. 
He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake. 
MISS CRENSHAW Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man. 
BUMSTEAD Good. 
MISS CRENSHAW You wonít regret this, sir. 
BUMSTEAD Fine. 
Bumstead moves off. 
INT.  LIBRARY 
White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned, then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor. 
He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still. 
WHITE Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing? 
The librarian looks up from her book. 
LIBRARIAN Which would you like first? 
WHITE Okay.  Newspapers. 
She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads. She studies White. 
LIBRARIAN Are you alright? 
He looks around  -  restrained panic. 
WHITE (looks at the woman) Sure.  Iím fine. 
LIBRARIAN (nods) Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the hall.  Third floor.  Turn left. Section C-7.  Row 35, near the toilets. 
She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away. 
LIBRARIAN Donít mention it... 
She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES LOUDLY. 
INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR 
White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes.  Comes to number 7. 
He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34 but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc.

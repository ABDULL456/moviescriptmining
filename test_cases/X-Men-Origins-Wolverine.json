{"test1_input": "LOGAN Forget it. Logan walks around to the front of the cabin. Stryker and Agent Zero follow. Logan's battered old pickup truck is parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln. \nSTRYKER It's a team of hunters. We're going after some very bad people. Logan climbs into the driver's seat. STRYKER (cont'd) You read the papers, Logan? They're killing mutants. Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to warm it. Stryker taps on the window. Logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel. STRYKER (cont'd) Listen to me. They have names. They have addresses. \nLOGAN I can take care of myself. \nSTRYKER All right, forget about yourself. Your country needs you. \nLOGAN I'm Canadian. He hits the gas, forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot. Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go. \nEXT. DISTRICT UNIFIED SCHOOL - DAY \nLogan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school. He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building. The school day has ended. STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or DADS for the ride home. As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking around. Something's not quite right. Logan'ducks his head at the last. possible second and a snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches. Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him, hurling snowballs and screaming. \nFOURTH GRADERS Get him! Logan jumps back around the corner, out of sight. The fourth graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice. Logan is nowhere in sight. The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for their target, snowballs melting in their hands. \nLOGAN (O.S.) Hey, fellas. The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second- floor window ledge. He has already formed six perfect snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders. The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan. \nKAYLA Nice. Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish. \nLOGAN They started it. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - LATER \nLogan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice. She sings softly along with the country song on the radio. \nLOGAN Stryker came by the house today. \nKAYLA Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one you told me about? (off Logan's nod) What did he want? \nLOGAN Wants me back. \nKAYLA And? \nLOGAN Told him no. \nKAYLA So why can't they get someone else? Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a degree of self-loathing in his tone. \nLOGAN I'm the best there is at what I do. And what I do best isn't very nice. Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment. LOGAN (cont'd) Maybe he's right. Maybe it's the only thing I'm good for. Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an errant thought. LOGAN (cont'd) Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute. He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer. f CONTTN11Fn1 \nCONTINUED: LOGAN (cont'd) I'm not going anywhere. First time in my life, I don't feel like a freak. \nKAYLA Hey. You're not a freak. \nLOGAN Most guys don't have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream. \n", "test1_true": "LOGAN A gift? Logan shakes his head, staring at the black ribbon of road. LOGAN (cont'd) You can return a gift.. \nINT. CABIN - NIGHT \nA well-built fire burns in the fireplace. Logan and Kayla sit naked in front of it, wrapped in an old flannel quilt. \nKAYLA The kids made cornhusk dolls today in Arts and Crafts. She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll. KAYLA (cont'd) I made one for you. Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight. Given the limitations of the art form, it's a skillful representation of Logan, unique hairstyle and all. \nLOGAN I look like Elvis. \nKAYLA You're Elvis with claws. The moon, swollen and red-hued, rises above the dark hills, framed in the cabin's window. I coNTTNTTRn 1 \nCONTINUED: \nLOGAN Full moon tomorrow. \nKAYLA You know why the moon's so lonely? Logan shakes his head. Kayla lies back, resting her head on Logan's leg as he plays with her hair. KAYLA (cont'd) She used to have a lover. Kuekuatsheu. They lived in the Spirit World and every night they'd wander the skies together. But one of the other spirits was jealous. Trickster wanted the Moon for himself. So he told Kuekuatsheu the Moon asked for flowers. He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses. \nLOGAN Never trust a guy named Trickster. \nKAYLA Yeah, well, you do some stupid things when you're in love. Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back. Now he's trapped here. Every night the Moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls her name... but he can never touch her again. For a moment they're both quiet, contemplating the sad myth. \nLOGAN Koo-koo-choo got screwed. \nKAYLA Kuekuatsheu. The Wolverine. \nEXT. CABIN - NIGHT \nViewed from a distance, the little cabin looks warm and inviting, the firelight shining from the windows. Something watches from the edge. of the dark woods. Something monstrous, its black talons carving gashes in the trunk of a pine tree. \nEXT. LOGGING CAMP - MORNING \nKayla drops Logan off at the logging camp. The site is already loud with motorized activity. TRIMMERS remove the limbs from fallen trees. TEAMSTERS in forklifts load logs onto flatbed trucks. Logan comes around to the driver's side window, holding his orange Husqvarna chainsaw in one hand. \nKAYLA Be careful. Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips. He turns and walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled around a SUPERVISOR with a clipboard. Logan turns when he hears a honk. Kayla leans out the window. KAYLA (cont'd) I love you, by the way. Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this scene. He clears his throat. \nLOGAN T love you, too. \nSUPERVISOR (thick Maine accent) We all love you, Casanova, but could we get to work here? We need to let some daylight in the swamp. The lumberjacks laugh loudly. Damage done, Kayla waves a cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp. Logan trudges into the circle of lumberjacks, who make kissie- kissie sounds and slap his shoulder. SUPERVISOR (cont'd) All right, I need a team of choppers for 3B, that's gonna be Phelan, Marcuse, Van Mier and Logan. Two teams for 3C... \nEXT. ACCESS ROAD - MORNING \nKayla steers the pickup along the access road leading away. from the logging camp. C'C)NTTNTTF.n ) \n", "test1_id": 1419, "test2_input": "INT. OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe male nurses transfer Logan from the gurney to the operating bed. One FEMALE NURSE prepares Logan's arm for an IV while a second NURSE cuts open his blood-soaked shirt with surgical scissors. The frenetic activity in the room ceases. Everyone stares at Logan's unblemished chest. \nSURGEON What is this? ( CO749TNnFn ) \nCONTINUED: Logan lunges forward, grabbing the surgeon's collar and pulling the startled man's face next to his own. \nLOGAN Where is he? \nMALE NURSE #1 Hey, hey, easy-- The male nurses struggle to restrain Logan but he's too strong for them. The surgeon gasps for air. \nLOGAN Where is he? \nSTRYKER (O.S.) His name is Victor Creed. Logan turns and sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room. STRYKER (cont'd) I can help you find him. \nEXT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nLogan storms out of the hospital, followed by Stryker. \nSTRYKER He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year. Started murdering mutants. Shape- changer in New Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California-- Logan turns on Stryker, grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp post. \nLOGAN Three years I been here. Three years everything's good. Nobody knows me. And then one day you show up and the next day she's dead. \nSTRYKER I came to warn you-- \nLOGAN You knew he was coming. f CONTTNfJRD 1 \nCONTINUED: Stryker shakes his head as well as he can with Logan's hand on his throat. Stryker's face is turning red. LOGAN (cont'd) How did you know? \nSTRYKER He got the List. \nLOGAN What list? Stryker chokes, gasping for air. Logan eases up on his grip but doesn't release the man. Stryker takes a deep breath. \nSTRYKER The List. Every known mutant in North America. Government's been keeping it for years. Names, addresses, everything. \nLOGAN How did he get it? \nSTRYKER Someone must have leaked it to him. There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed. Logan releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket collar and composes himself. \nLOGAN Creed's a mutant, too. \nSTRYKER Apparently he doesn't have much tribal loyalty. Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled. He walks fast. Stryker calls after him. STRYKER (cont'd) Do you have a plan, Captain? \nLOGAN I'm not in the Army anymore. \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: (2) Logan turns and stares at Stryker. \nLOGAN I'm gonna track him down and I'm gonna end him. That's the plan. \nI \nSTRYKER You already tried that. He's a hundred miles away and you're walking out of the hospital. Logan's fists are clenched. He's ready to hammer Stryker into the ground, but the older man does not back down. STRYKER (cont'd) You can't beat him. Not the way you are right now. You've probably gone your whole life without losing a fight, but I'm telling you now, you can't beat him. \n(BEAT) Unless I give you the tools. Logan glares at Stryker, still itching for immediate revenge. STRYKER (cont'd) You come with me, I promise you two things. You will suffer more pain than any other man could bear. And you will have your revenge. Logan stares into Stryker's eyes. \nEXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY \nA black helicopter lands on a concrete helipad inside the walls of the massive compound. SENTRIES armed with assault rifles man the guard towers, scanning the perimeter with binoculars. Logan, Stryker and Agent Zero step out of the helicopter. Logan glances around the foreboding place before following Stryker inside the main building. \nINT. SURGICAL PREP ROOM - DAY \nLogan lies on his back on an examining table, naked save for a strategically-placed towel. (-ONTTNTTFr) l \nCONTINUED: A red-bearded scientist, DR. CORNELIUS, draws blood from Logan with a syringe. An Army surgeon, CAROL HINES, marks Logan's skin with an indelible pen. He looks like a Maori warrior, his body mapped with strange lines, dots and x's. Stryker watches Hines work. \nSTRYKER Could you unsheath your claws? Logan raises his left hand. The bone claws pop out, the same length they were before Creed shattered them. STRYKER (cont'd) Remarkable. Full regeneration. Logan examines the markings on his forearm. \nLOGAN The hell you planning on doing to me? Hines gives Stryker a worried look but he ignores her. \nSTRYKER We're going to make you indestructible. But first we have to destroy you. Stryker heads for the door but stops midway and turns. STRYKER (cont'd) I forgot to give you something. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out an old set of dog tags and tosses them to Logan. Logan inspects the tags with ambivalence. \nLOGAN Never wanted to put these on again. \nSTRYKER Held on to them for years. Figured you'd be back one day. Logan slips the steel chain over his head. STRYKER (cont'd) \n(SMILING) Now you'll always know your name. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nStryker walks down a long concrete corridor lit by fluorescent ceiling lights. Hines steps out of the prep room and hurries after him. \nHINES Sir? Stryker stops and waits.for her to catch up. HINES (cont'd) I know we've discussed this before-- He knows what she's going to say. He shakes his head and continues down the hallway, forcing Hines to chase after him. \nSTRYKER Ad nauseam, Lieutenant. \nHINES Anesthetic won't work on him. His healing factor neutralizes drugs. Including painkillers. \nSTRYKER He can handle the pain. \n", "test2_id": 1420, "test3_input": "GUNNER Direct hit. \nEXT.

APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS \nAs the gunner continues to scout the ground for any sign of a corpse, the pilot notices something out of the corner of his eye. He stares at the roof of the sheep barn. A smoke-darkened figure stares back at him. \nEXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS \nLogan, claws extended, skin blackened with soot, jumps from the roof of the barn. He lands on the helicopter windshield. \nINT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS \nThe pilot nearly jumps out of his seat. \nPILOT Jesus!

Come back to base. \nAGENT ZERO (O.S.) Have a little faith, boss. \nSTRYKER You don't have the weaponry... \nEXT. HUDSON FARM - DAY \nAGENT ZERO Don't care what kind of bones he's got. Fifty caliber bullet through his eyeball ought to do it. \nSTRYKER (O.S.) Nord, goddamnit-- \nAGENT ZERO I'm losing you, boss. Agent Zero clicks off his headset and.raises the sniper rifle, searching through the smoke with his scope. AGENT ZERO (cont'd) (muttering to himself) Come out and play... \nEXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS \nLogan emerges from the Apache's wreckage and runs toward the sheep barn door. A bullet cracks him in the forehead and Logan falls backwards into the snow, stunned. For a few seconds we can glimpse the adamantium of his skull. His healing factor takes over and his skin begins to knit itself back together. Logan combat crawls inside the sheep barn. \nINT. SHEEP DARN - CONTINUOUS \nHe throws the tarp off the '48 Harley. James Hudson restored this bike with love and elbow grease. The chrome and leather shine as brightly as any new model on the factory floor. The key is in the ignition. This used to be a safe neighborhood. \nEXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS \nLogan bursts out of the barn on the Harley. The tires spin on the snow but Logan is an experienced rider. He steadies the bike, steers it onto the blacktop and accelerates, heading in the opposite direction from Agent Zero. \nEXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS \nAgent Zero grabs his rifle and jogs over to a black SUV with tinted windows and off-road tires. \nEXT.

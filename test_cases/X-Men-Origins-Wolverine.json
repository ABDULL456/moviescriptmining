{"train": "X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE \nWritten by \nDavid Benioff & Skip Woods \nEXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY \nA two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops, heading south before the first snowfall. A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time. Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a hard-charging engine. An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but the car comes straight at him. The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows. Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the four, shakes his head and laughs. \nGILMAN Kid didn't even move. You see that? Where's your survival instincts, boy? The boy says nothing. He readjusts his bookbag and resumes his long walk northward. GILMAN (cont'd) Hey! Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around- GILMAN (cont'd) The hell you going? You hear me talking to you? One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and inspects the boy's face. \nMASON This is the kid whose old man robbed the truck stop last year. Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen tower over the small boy. I C_ONTTNTT f 1 \nCONTINUED: \nGILMAN You the one with the convict daddy? The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking. \nMASON That's him. \nGILMAN What's the matter, you about to piss your pants? Answer me. The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully. Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring, against the.boy's cheek. GILMAN (cont'd) You a tough guy like your daddy? Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman. GILMAN (cont'd) You want to play tough guy with me? Huh? Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face. The boy falls to the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his cheek where the class ring cut him. \nMASON (a ringside announcer) Right cross to the face... and he's down! The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy. The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain. \nGILMAN What's the matter? You want some more? The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy in the side of the head, knocking him down again. GILMAN (cont'd) (to his friends) Let's get out of here. \nCONTTNTTF:T) I \nCONTINUED: (2) Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder. \nMASON You gave that little pissant something to think about. Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be sprawled and crying on the ground. Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt, and walks toward Gilman. \nGILMAN You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna knock the-- But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something impossible happening. The gash on the boy's cheek knits itself shut, leaving no sign of injury. Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch. And then another. The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy. Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down, trying to protect his face from the blur of blows. Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off. The other two football players, amazed to see their leader getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe. The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground, prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist. Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and razor sharp. Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits hollering and stares. The other two football players blink and slowly back away. Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl backwards, away from this beast on top of him. \n((\"ONTTN11F.1)1 \nCONTINUED: (3) But the boy is more shocked than-any of them. He stares with horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed. He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over, lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him toward the Oldsmobile. The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road. The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the black spruce, into the darkening northern sky. \nINT. CABIN - MORNING \nLOGAN wakes. with a wordless shout, sitting upright, shirtless, in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets. KAYLA SILVERFOX (25) wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear. \nKAYLA It's okay... shh... it's okay. Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered sheets in his fists. Kayla holds him tight until his bone claws retract. KAYLA (cont'd) I'm right here with you. Okay? I'm right here with you. Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled back in a ponytail. She's been sleeping in one of Logan's flannel shirts. KAYLA (cont'd) The war dreams or the one where you're a kid? Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He relaxes into Kayla's arms. \nLOGAN The one where I'm a kid. Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his forehead. He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm. He takes her arm and looks at the wound. \nLOGAN Forget it. Logan walks around to the front of the cabin. Stryker and Agent Zero follow. Logan's battered old pickup truck is parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln. \nSTRYKER It's a team of hunters. We're going after some very bad people. Logan climbs into the driver's seat. STRYKER (cont'd) You read the papers, Logan? They're killing mutants. Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to warm it. Stryker taps on the window. Logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel. STRYKER (cont'd) Listen to me. They have names. They have addresses. \nLOGAN I can take care of myself. \nSTRYKER All right, forget about yourself. Your country needs you. \nLOGAN I'm Canadian. He hits the gas, forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot. Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go. \nEXT. DISTRICT UNIFIED SCHOOL - DAY \nLogan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school. He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building. The school day has ended. STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or DADS for the ride home. As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking around. Something's not quite right. Logan'ducks his head at the last. possible second and a snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches. Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him, hurling snowballs and screaming. \nFOURTH GRADERS Get him! Logan jumps back around the corner, out of sight. The fourth graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice. Logan is nowhere in sight. The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for their target, snowballs melting in their hands. \nLOGAN (O.S.) Hey, fellas. The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second- floor window ledge. He has already formed six perfect snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders. The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan. \nKAYLA Nice. Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish. \nLOGAN They started it. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - LATER \nLogan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice. She sings softly along with the country song on the radio. \nLOGAN Stryker came by the house today. \nKAYLA Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one you told me about? (off Logan's nod) What did he want? \nLOGAN Wants me back. \nKAYLA And? \nLOGAN Told him no. \nKAYLA So why can't they get someone else? Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a degree of self-loathing in his tone. \nLOGAN I'm the best there is at what I do. And what I do best isn't very nice. Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment. LOGAN (cont'd) Maybe he's right. Maybe it's the only thing I'm good for. Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an errant thought. LOGAN (cont'd) Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute. He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer. f CONTTN11Fn1 \nCONTINUED: LOGAN (cont'd) I'm not going anywhere. First time in my life, I don't feel like a freak. \nKAYLA Hey. You're not a freak. \nLOGAN Most guys don't have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream. \nCONTINUED: An eighteen-wheel flatbed loaded with trimmed logs blocks the road. Men in reflective vests stand on the flatbed, securing the load with chains. Kayla hits the brakes and checks-her watch. She's late. She taps the horn. A FOREMAN ambles over to her, in no particular rush. \nFOREMAN Can't move the truck till the load's tied down. \nKAYLA Please? I'm already late. \nFOREMAN Not gonna happen, ma'am... The foreman thinks about it, sighs, and changes his tune. FOREMAN (cont'd) (yelling to truck driver) Hey Zeke! Pull this mother over. Lady's got to get through. Moments later the truck rolls forward, enabling Kayla to scoot through in her pickup. She toots her horn and waves. \nKAYLA Thanks, fellas. \nEXT. TIMBER STAND - MORNING \nLogan and three other lumberjacks-- PHELAN, MARCUSE, and VAN MIER-- tramp through the woods towards their designated area, carrying their chainsaws and helmets. Phelan, whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion, has fallen behind. \nPHELAN You all want to ease the pace a little bit? Trees ain't going anywhere. Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley face carved into a tall pine tree. His gaze travels from the carving to something sitting on the forest floor. (CON'TNt1F.n I \nlB. \nCONTINUED: PHELAN (cont'd) What you got there? The other lumberjacks gather around Logan. A severed bear's head, haloed by buzzing flies, rots in the sun. PHELAN (cont'd) Goddamn. \nVAN MIER Hunter? \nMARCUSE Why would a hunter leave the head? \nLOGAN Bullet didn't kill this bear. \n(BEAT) Claws did. \nINT. TRUCK - MORNING \nKayla sings along with the tape on the tape deck. \nKAYLA Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here, Lolly Lolly Lolly got some adverbs here, Come on down to Lolly's get the adverbs here... Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt. The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's been sleeping in the woods for weeks. Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat turns. It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her. What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes, black and loveless and utterly inhuman. f CONTTNT1FD' \nCONTINUED: Victor Creed walks toward the truck. He scrapes his talons over the hood: screeeeee. Five parallel gashes now scar the hood, carved straight through the steel. \nEXT. TIMBER STAND - CONTINUOUS \nLogan, hearing a noise the other men can't, rises from his crouch. He looks to the west, listening carefully. \nPHELAN What's the matter-- Logan holds up a hand: quiet. He hears a distant scream. A. voice he knows better than any other. He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind. No one can run through the woods faster than Logan and'Logan has never needed to run faster. He vaults fallen trees, ducks under branches, accelerates when he hits the access road. \nEXT. ACCESS ROAD - MINUTES LATER \nLogan sees the pickup truck in the distance. Even a hundred yards away he can tell that something is.wrong. It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he does, reaching the truck in seconds. He sees the claw marks gouged through the steel hood. He sees.the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty yards. from the truck. And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on the side of the access road. Blood puddles beneath her. Her skin has already begun to lose its 'color. He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any sign of life in her lifeless form. \nINT. OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe male nurses transfer Logan from the gurney to the operating bed. One FEMALE NURSE prepares Logan's arm for an IV while a second NURSE cuts open his blood-soaked shirt with surgical scissors. The frenetic activity in the room ceases. Everyone stares at Logan's unblemished chest. \nSURGEON What is this? ( CO749TNnFn ) \nCONTINUED: Logan lunges forward, grabbing the surgeon's collar and pulling the startled man's face next to his own. \nLOGAN Where is he? \nMALE NURSE #1 Hey, hey, easy-- The male nurses struggle to restrain Logan but he's too strong for them. The surgeon gasps for air. \nLOGAN Where is he? \nSTRYKER (O.S.) His name is Victor Creed. Logan turns and sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room. STRYKER (cont'd) I can help you find him. \nEXT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nLogan storms out of the hospital, followed by Stryker. \nSTRYKER He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year. Started murdering mutants. Shape- changer in New Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California-- Logan turns on Stryker, grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp post. \nLOGAN Three years I been here. Three years everything's good. Nobody knows me. And then one day you show up and the next day she's dead. \nSTRYKER I came to warn you-- \nLOGAN You knew he was coming. f CONTTNfJRD 1 \nCONTINUED: Stryker shakes his head as well as he can with Logan's hand on his throat. Stryker's face is turning red. LOGAN (cont'd) How did you know? \nSTRYKER He got the List. \nLOGAN What list? Stryker chokes, gasping for air. Logan eases up on his grip but doesn't release the man. Stryker takes a deep breath. \nSTRYKER The List. Every known mutant in North America. Government's been keeping it for years. Names, addresses, everything. \nLOGAN How did he get it? \nSTRYKER Someone must have leaked it to him. There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed. Logan releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket collar and composes himself. \nLOGAN Creed's a mutant, too. \nSTRYKER Apparently he doesn't have much tribal loyalty. Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled. He walks fast. Stryker calls after him. STRYKER (cont'd) Do you have a plan, Captain? \nLOGAN I'm not in the Army anymore. \nGENERAL MUNSON I We tried to use that stuff for tank armor. Too damn expensive. \nSTRYKER It took us three years to prepare enough alloy for the skeleton. \nGENERAL MUNSON So if this works, I guess Weapon X won't be walking through any metal detectors. \nSTRYKER If this works, General, Weapon X will walk wherever he wants. \nINT. SURGICAL THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nLogan spasms in the tank like a man being electrocuted. \nHINES (O.S.) Heart rate one ninety. \nCORNELIUS (O.S.) Density? \nTECHNICIAN #2 (O.S.) Four four seven. CLOSE on Logan's clenched eyelids and CLOSER still, entering the mind of the tortured man. Horrific images flicker past, selected traumas from a deeply traumatic life. Logan cradles the lifeless body of Kayla Silverfox. The feral boy stares at his monstrous claws and howls. Logan (looking identical in age to the man we've been following) stands in a village in Vietnam as bamboo huts-burn around him. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGENERAL MUNSON How long before he's mission operative? \nSTRYKER Remains to be seen. We're in uncharted territory here. \nGENERAL MUNSON Uncharted territory is a pretty good description of your budget, Colonel. This doesn't work, you can kiss the Eleven good-bye. \nSTRYKER We need the Eleven. Our victory in the war to come depends on it. \nGENERAL MUNSON Not everyone in the Pentagon thinks there's gonna be a war. Stryker turns and fixes his gaze on the general. \nSTRYKER Oh, it's coming, General. The enemy walks among us. We'd better be prepared. \nINT. SURGICAL THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nLogan thrashes in the tank, his convulsions increasingly violent, his eyes rolling back in their sockets. The water in the tank begins to steam. The reel of blood-stained images from Logan's past continues. A bull-necked man beats the feral boy with an axe handle. \nHINES (O.S.) Body temperature one zero eight. Heart rate two ten. Sir-- A dying Russian lies on his back on a dock in Odessa, staring at the sky, his shirt punctured with three precise holes. Logan stares down at him, bone claws extended. (CONTTNi1FT)1 \nCONTINUED: \nSTRYKER (O.S.) He's a warrior, Hines. He can handle it. Victor Creed plunges his clawed hand into Logan's gut. \nCORNELIUS (O.S.) Density? \nTECHNICIAN #2 (O.S.) Probe rejected, sir. \nLOGAN Sorry... It's a little cold out there. \nJAMES HUDSON Uh huh. It's the middle of January and you got no clothes on. \nLOGAN That's probably it. \n(CFNTTNEWF ) \nCONTINUED: Hudson sighs and lowers his shotgun. \nJAMES HUDSON You're not on the drugs, are you? \nLOGAN No sir. \nJAMES HUDSON Just had a rough night? \nLOGAN Pretty rough, yeah. \nJAMES HUDSON All right, come on. I got some old clothes'll probably fit you. He turns and Logan begins covering strategic places with wads of straw. JAMES HUDSON (cont'd) I'll take you around back so my wife don't see you again. \nLOGAN Sorry if I scared her. \nJAMES HUDSON Scared her? \n(SNORTS) I'm not worried about you scaring her. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nLogan sits at the breakfast table with James and Heather. He wears an old plaid shirt, dungarees, and a pair of scuffed work boots. A heaping breakfast lies before him: scrambled eggs, pork sausages, pancakes with maple syrup, a steaming mug of coffee. Logan devours everything in front of him, looking up only to nod in thanks as Heather scoops more food onto his plate. \nJAMES HUDSON You mind if I ask where you came running from? r()NTTNITF.n ) \nCONTINUED: \nHEATHER HUDSON Jimmy. Let the boy eat. Logan piles eggs onto a slice of buttered toast. \nJAMES HUDSON I'm just wondering. We're twenty miles from town. It's a miracle you didn't get hypothermia out there. \nLOGAN I've got good circulation. (gesturing toward barn) Nice chopper you got out there, by the way. James's face lights up. Logan has found the man's passion., \nJAMES HUDSON You know motorcycles? \nLOGAN What is it, '48 Panhead? \nJAMES HUDSON Best bike Harley-Davidson ever made. First one with a seventy-four- cubic inch engine, hydraulic valve lifters, aluminum heads-- Heather stands to clear the plates. \nGUNNER Direct hit. \nEXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS \nAGENT ZERO Locate the target and fire again. \nINT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS \nThe gunner glances at his pilot. Both men seem mystified by the command. \nGUNNER Sir... the target's destroyed. \nAGENT ZERO (O.S.) Repeat: locate the target and fire again. \nEXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS \nThe Apache circles the smoking ruin where the house once stood. No sign of Logan is visible in the scorched debris. \nINT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS \nGUNNER They must've hated this guy big time. t C'_C?NTTNTTRI)1 \nCONTINUED: \nPILOT What was he, terrorist or something? \nGUNNER I don't know but he's a puddle now. \nEXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS \nThe Apache hovers near the sheep barn, rotor blades fanning the rising smoke. \nINT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS \nAs the gunner continues to scout the ground for any sign of a corpse, the pilot notices something out of the corner of his eye. He stares at the roof of the sheep barn. A smoke-darkened figure stares back at him. \nEXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS \nLogan, claws extended, skin blackened with soot, jumps from the roof of the barn. He lands on the helicopter windshield. \nINT. APACHE LONGBOW - CONTINUOUS \nThe pilot nearly jumps out of his seat. \nPILOT Jesus! Logan raises his right hand and plunges his claws through the bulletproof glass. \nAgent Zero grabs an Atchisson assault shotgun from a rack behind his seat that holds an impressive array of weaponry. He lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on Logan, who swerves to keep himself (and his more fragile motorcycle) a tricky target. \nEXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY \nAgent Zero fires six shells in rapid succession. Hundreds of steel pellets scream over the motorcycle, perforating the face of a smiling farmer on a fertilizer billboard. Logan turns and sees the SUV closing on him. Agent Zero rams the bumper into the Harley and Logan very nearly loses control, managing to right the bike at the last second. \n( C'ONTTNTIRF 1 \nCONTINUED: Logan accelerates and opens up thirty yards of breathing room. He turns and sees Agent Zero catching up again. Logan clamps on the brakes, hard. He holds out his left hand and extends his claws. The tips of the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly. The SUV cannot brake in time. As it hurtles past the motorcycle, Logan's claws hit the SUV's front tire and shred it instantly. A split-second later he shreds the rear tire. The SUV totters, falls to its side, and barrel rolls across the empty road. It ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch, wheels still spinning in the air. Logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended SUV. He lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks to the driver's side. Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to push open the door. He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who slices the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws. Logan grabs Agent Zero by the back of the neck and hauls him out of the car. \nLOGAN Those were good people back there. Innocent people. Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a sheath on his ankle. \nAGENT ZERO You ever notice good people tend to die when they spend time with you? He swings the knife at the side of Logan's neck.`Logan catches Agent Zero's wrist and slams it against the door frame. Agent Zero drops the knife with a pained smile. He didn't think that would work. AGENT ZERO (cont'd) Maybe you should stick with the bad people. We're more your speed. \nLOGAN I got a message for your boss. \n(C'_ONTTNTTF.T) I \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAGENT ZERO \n(SMIRKING) Yeah? Tell me. The smirk fades from Zero's face as he sees the adamantium claws plunging toward his heart. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nLogan stands at a pay phone beside the Texaco station, watching a couple of SKATEBOARD PUNKS practice their ollies. He punches in a number and waits for the connection. \nOPERATOR (O.S.) Department of Agriculture. \nLOGAN Get me the Pest Control Division. \nOPERATOR (O.S.) I'm sorry, sir, there is no Pest Control Division. \nLOGAN Why don't you get 'em anyway. And tell 'em Logan's calling. While he waits he watches one of the kids attempt a backside tailslide on the curb. The kid loses his balance and wipes out, skinning his palms on the asphalt. \nSTRYKER (O.S.) Where are you? \nLOGAN (controlled fury) You shouldn't have killed those people. All they were doing was helping a stranger. \nINT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY \nStryker sits behind the desk of his office. His aide, COLLINS, stands on the other side of the desk, listening in on an extension. \nSTRYKER You ran on me, goddamnit. We had a deal. Now you get back to base-- \nCUT TO: Ninna the ring-tailed lemur mewls softly, trying to hide herself deep within the baobab tree as her human friend \nSCREAMS. \nEXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT \nLogan, riding James Hudson's vintage motorcycle, rolls down the famous strip, lit by the mammoth neon signs above him. He stops at a red light and stares at the lonely moon rising over the desert. \nLADY OF THE NIGHT (O.S.) You look like a man who could use a night off. (C fNTTNTTRT)1 \nCONTINUED: Logan turns to look at a REDHEAD in a tight silver dress, waiting at the light in her Cadillac convertible. She looks like she's expensive, and she looks like she'd be worth it. \nLOGAN You're way out of my league, darlin'. \nLADY OF THE NIGHT You never know. You looking for a good time with a bad woman? Logan smiles and shakes his head. \nLOGAN Not tonight. The redhead purses her lips. \nLADY OF THE NIGHT You don't know what you're missing. Logan revs his engine as the light changes. \nLOGAN I know exactly what I'm missing. The courtesan waits at the green light,. watching Logan speed off into the night - \nEXT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT \nIn a seedy part of town, far from the casinos' bright lights, Logan walks through the front door of a rundown boxing gym. \nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT \nEven at this hour the gym is packed with aspiring PUGILISTS. Las Vegas has become the Mecca of world boxing, and many 'of the fighters here exhibit impressive skills as they batter the heavy bag, tap at the speed bag, and jump rope. Logan walks toward a ring in the center of the gym. Two young BOXERS inside the ropes, wearing headgear and sparring gloves, dance around throwing quick jabs that don't land. JOHN WRAITH (45) stands outside the ring, watching this action with evident distaste. He wears a black cowboy hat, sunglasses, and a handlebar mustache. He has the swagger and drawl of a rodeo cowboy. \n! ('ONTTNTTF.T) ) \nCONTINUED: \nWRAITH This is a contact sport, ladies. If you don't like hitting people, try golf. Logan comes up behind Wraith, unseen by the Texan.. \nLOGAN You talk tough for a guy who always let me do the dirty work. A slow smile creases Wraith's face. He turns. \nWRAITH Look at this. You never get old, do you? The two men'embrace. There is genuine affection here, the camaraderie of men who have fought together, bled together. WRAITH (cont'd) Nobody followed you? \nLOGAN You tryin' to insult me? \nWRAITH Can't be too careful, brother. I've been retired five years I still check under the car every time I drive. \nLOGAN I'm looking for Victor Creed. Wraith's face goes serious at the mention of the name. He looks around the gym, making sure no one's watching them. He glances at the boxers in the ring, who lean on the ropes and breathe heavily, awaiting instructions. \nLOGAN Help me find him. \nWRAITH He's a hard cat to track. \nLOGAN Just tell me where to start looking. I'll do the rest. Wraith taps the bottleneck, considering. \nWRAITH Might want to talk to his friends from the ultramax. \nLOGAN The prison he busted out of? \nWRAITH \n(NODDING) Feds built it to hold the baddest of the bad mutants. Worked pretty well. Only problem-- now they all know each other. \n(BEAT) You ever hear of a guy named Fred J. Dukes? \nLOGAN Nope. \nWRAITH People call him the Blob. You find him, you'll know why. Got out of the hoosegow a few months ago. Went home to Iowa. Town called Elgin. \nLOGAN You think he's still in touch with Creed? f C_ONTTNTIRT)1 \nCONTINUED: (3) Wraith leans back in his chair and allows himself another slow smile. \nWRAITH I bet you'll find out. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nLogan, on his Harley, speeds past a welcome sign for Elgin, Iowa, Population 676. \nEXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT \nThe neon Vacancy sign shines, a beacon for tired travellers in the heartland. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nLogan lies on top of the bed covers, hands behind his head. The lights are out and Fox News plays on the television, casting the small room in blue light. \nINSERT TELEVISION A REPORTER stands in a Detroit alleyway as POLICE OFFICERS in the background cordon off the area from ONLOOKERS. \nREPORTER This is the 13th confirmed mutant slaying of the last two months, and with the investigation apparently stalled, members of the mutant community are voicing their outrage. A YOUNG WOMAN wearing a \"Mutants are Humans, Too\" t-shirt speaks passionately for the camera. \nYOUNG WOMAN Of course there's bias at work here. If these were normal people getting. chopped up, you better believe there'd be an FBI Task Force investigating, there'd be all sorts of resources allocated to find this killer. Why is it that when violence is done to our community, the nation turns its back? \n(MORE) \nFRED J. DUKES You ever been to Superior? \nLOGAN The club for mutants? Down in New Orleans? \nFRED J. DUKES Creed likes to party down there. Talked about it all the time-- how hot the girlies were. That's all I know. Logan shaves Dukes' jaw with the edge of his claw. \nLOGAN Nah. You know more than that. Dukes tilts his face, trying to keep his face from getting scraped off. \nFRED J. DUKES Joint's owned by a guy named Barbarus. Shared a cell with Creed in the ultramax. Anyone knows where to find him, it's Barbarus. Logan stares into the Blob's face, gauging the man's words. \nLOGAN He better be there, Freddie. And he better know something good. \n(MORE) ( r'nNT T NT TF.n ) \nCONTINUED: (4) LOGAN (cont'd) 'Cause I'm in a mood for violence and you're way too big to hide. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nStryker stands by a window-overlooking Alkali Lake while General Munson sits at the head of the conference table. \nSTRYKER we have information that he was in Las Vegas two nights ago. We'll find him soon. \nGENERAL MUNSON This is turning into a goddamn disaster, Colonel. \nSTRYKER I disagree. I'd say the experiment has been a success. \nGENERAL MUNSON Success? Are you kidding me? \nSTRYKER Weapon X is a prototype. Nothing more. He's the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable. That, along with the healing factor we've replicated from his blood, will insure that the Eleven is capable of protecting our species from extinction. \n(BEAT) At this point, Logan is merely an inconvenience. He won't be for long. \nGENERAL MUNSON I'm sorry, William. I've lost confidence in your leadership. I'm going to recommend your dismissal to the Joint Chiefs. Stryker stares out the window at the distant lake, with no visible reaction to the General's words. \nSTRYKER Disappointing, General. Expected, but still... disappointing. \nI CONTTN:]M ) \nCONTINUED: General Munson takes a sip of water from the glass in front of him. \nGENERAL MUNSON I know you believe in what you're doing. But I don't. War with the mutants is not inevitable. The general coughs. He begins to look confused as he coughs again, his breathing gone suddenly ragged. He clutches at his chest. A thin smile curls Stryker's lips. He turns to regard the General. \nSTRYKER You're having a massive heart attack, sir. Leading cause of death for men in your age bracket. The general gasps for air, trying to rise to his feet. In his death throes, he knocks the glass of water from the table. It shatters on the floor. STRYKER.(cont'd) The war is coming. It's time to choose sides. The general collapses-and Stryker stands above him, staring down at the dying man with pitiless eyes. STRYKER (cont'd) You chose treason. \nEXT. CLUB SUPERIOR - NIGHT \nLOGAN I came back. Where is he? \nBARBARUS Somewhere in America. Doing what he does best. \nLOGAN What's that? \nBARBARUS Putting people's insides on the outside. \nLOGAN He's killing mutants, bub. Barbarus smiles, twenty fingers drumming on the table top. \nBARBARUS Some mutants need killing. \nLOGAN You got that right. Snikt! Barbarus shoves his girlfriend out of the way and stands, unsheathing three more black commando knives from his belt. The other MUTANTS quiet down, watching the fireworks. Barbarus swings, the four knives whistling through the air. Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as Barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel. Logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground. Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with his three good arms. Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly severed hand lands on the table. Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me. Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers himself and charges. Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a well-hit baseball. Barbarus crashes to the floor. Pantera hisses and pounces at Logan, her black claws aimed at his face. Logan backhands her. She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood. C_nWTTAATFT) \nCONTINUED: (2) Logan kneels beside Barbarus. LOGAN (cont'd) You want to keep your other hands? Where is he? Blood dribbles from Barbarus's lip. He spits out a tooth. \nBARBARUS He don't sent me postcards. \nLOGAN No? Way I hear it, you two were practically boyfriends before he busted out. \nBARBARUS Busted out? \n(LAUGHING) You been misinformed. Victor Creed got himself a government pardon. Some fellas from the Department of Agriculture came and picked him up. \nLOGAN You're lying to me. Barbarus grins, his teeth red from the blood in his mouth. \nBARBARUS No, sir. But somebody is. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nA five-story concrete parking structure on the edge of Las Vegas. John Wraith walks to his black.'68 Mustang, whistling a Jerry Jeff Walker song. When he gets to the car he drops to the floor and checks the underbody for bombs. Nothing down there. He stands, reaching into his pocket for his keys. \nVICTOR CREED (O.S.) You think I'd use a bomb on you, Johnny Boy? Wraith spins around. Victor Creed sits on a concrete parapet, the desert wind blowing his filthy blonde hair. He hops off the parapet and walks toward Wraith. \n(COWTNIIEFL 1 \nCONTINUED: VICTOR CREED (cont'd) It's all about human contact for me. Wraith quickly unlocks the car door and get in. He slips the key into the ignition. The engine turns on the first try. Wraith hits the gas and the Mustang squeals out in reverse. He slams on the brakes, shifts into drive, and guns the car right at Creed. An instant before impact, Creed sidesteps the car and punches through the driver's window. It's a miracle of a punch, timed perfectly, a crushing shot to Wraith's jaw. Wraith loses control. of the car and it sideswipes a parked Hummer, spinning to a stop against a concrete wall. Wraith blinks and tries to clear his head. Creed reaches inside the broken window and hauls the Texan out. He lifts the bleeding man into the air and flashes his white fangs. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) Hear you been talking out of school. \nWRAITH He'll find you. \nVICTOR CREED That's the plan. It's a lot easier than finding him. Creed slams Wraith against the concrete wall and plunges his claws deep into Wraith's gut. The Texan's mouth opens as the full force of the pain hits him. Creed whispers in his ear. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy. A sickening crunch as vertebrae are crushed like walnut shells. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) Never knew you had one. Creed drops Wraith's body to the ground. \nINT. HINES' HOUSE - NIGHT \nCarol Hines, the Army surgeon last seen in Alkali Lake, unlocks her front door and steps inside her house. she looks exhausted, with deep circles under her eyes. She puts her keys and the mail on a table by the door and then looks up, startled, when she hears SHRIEKING. Hines, very nervous, advances into the dark kitchen. She flicks on the lights. A red kettle on the stove top whistles. A mug waits on the counter. Hines, mystified, turns off the burner. \nSTRYKER Good. \nCORNELIUS Sir... Lieutenant Hines hasn't reported to base today. \nSTRYKER Hines? \n(C_ONTT1 TIED 1 \nCONTINUED: Stryker considers the information for a moment and nods. STRYKER (cont'd) All right, thank you, Doctor. (glancing at case) What's this? Cornelius sets the case on the table and opens it. Six gleaming, armor-piercing bullets rest in green felt niches. \nCORNELIUS We saved the leftover adamantium from the Weapon X procedure. Stryker plucks one of the bullets from its niche and rolls it between his fingers, examining it with a practiced eye. CORNELIUS (cont'd) Each one's got a high-explosive core. Two in the head and Logan's brain will have to regenerate from scratch. \nSTRYKER They won't kill him? \nCORNELIUS According to the computer models we ran, there's a 30 percent chance his healing factor will reconstitute the gray matter. But those synaptic bridges that form our memories? Gone. If he survives, his brain will come back fresh. \nSTRYKER A blank slate... easy to train. Stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly. STRYKER (cont'd) She's a pretty little thing. \nCORNELIUS She ought to be. That's the world's most expensive bullet. Stryker pulls a revolver from his shoulder holster, dumps the standard rounds, and begins loading the adamantium bullets. (rfNTTN11F.T 1 \nI \nCONTINUED: (2) CORNELIUS (cont'd) There's another way, a more reliable way, to break down his memory. \nSTRYKER Mm? \nCORNELIUS Only problem is, the procedure can only be done here at Alkali Lake. Stryker swings the chamber shut and holsters his gun. \nSTRYKER Oh, he's coming back, Doctor. We have what he's looking for. \nEXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY \nHines, driving an old Ford, pulls up.to the guard house at the perimeter of the compound. A YOUNG SENTRY salutes her. \nYOUNG SENTRY Morning, Lieutenant. Hines smiles brightly, trying to hide her nervousness. \nHINES Good morning! The sentry looks into the car's cabin. The passenger seat is empty. The back seat is empty. \nYOUNG SENTRY Could you pop the trunk for me? \nHINES The trunk? \nYOUNG SENTRY Yes, ma'am. It's all standard procedure but Hines is close to panicking. She opens the glove compartment and hits the trunk release. The sentry inspects the trunk... nothing but a coil of rope and a roll of electrical tape. He slams the trunk door. YOUNG SENTRY (cont'd) You have a good day. \n(C'NNTTNTTHN 1 \nHINES Welcome to Weapon Eleven. \nLOGAN \n(STUNNED) I thought it was just gonna be one guy. This is... \nHINES Ten thousand. They reach the cavern floor and walk amongst the Eleven. HINES (cont'd) Stryker says mutants and humans will fight a war soon. (gesturing to Weapon XI) This is his army. The camera glides over the isolation tanks as Hines continues to speak. We catch glimpses of the ELEVEN inside, comatose soldiers with needles and wires protruding from their skin, exactly like Logan during the Weapon X procedure. The men all look identical and they all look oddly familiar. HINES (cont'd) They incorporate the most successful features of the previous Weapons. Enhanced skeletons, heightened senses, healing factor-- f r0NTTNTTF.T) I \nCONTINUED: (2) Logan stops beside one tank and looks at the man inside, who floats in his chemical sleep. His eyes widen when he realizes what he's looking at. \nLOGAN It's Creed... He looks inside another tank. Same cruel face, same powerful body. Only their shaved heads distinguish them from Victor Creed. LOGAN (cont'd) They're all Creed. \nHINES Stryker's most successful mutant hunter. They cloned him years ago. \n(BEAT) The Colonel's been planning this for a long time. _ Logan walks through the midst of this vast, sleeping army, surrounded by ten thousand replicas of his worst enemy. \nLOGAN They get into the world, it's genocide. \nHINES I think that's the general idea. Logan stops in mid--stride, head raised in the manner of a hunting dog who has just caught wind of his prey. HINES (cont'd) What's the matter? Logan moves, walking quickly, nearly knocking over a technician entering data into one of the stasis pods. \nTECHNICIAN Hey... Hines hurries after Logan, smiling apologetically at the annoyed technician. \nHINES Where you going? Logan never turns. f rONTTNUT n % \nCONTINUED: (3) \nLOGAN Don't follow me. Hines stops, standing alone in the middle of the Eleven. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nLogan walks rapidly down the hallway, his pace accelerating as he nears a closed doorway. He rests his head against the door for a moment before putting his hand on the knob and entering the room. \nINT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nStryker sits behind his desk, smiling at Logan. But Logan's not looking at the colonel. He's looking at the young woman who sits across from Stryker, her back to the door. She doesn't turn. Her long black hair cascades down her back. \nSTRYKER Hello, old friend. We've been waiting for you. Logan walks toward the desk, slowly now, a man in a nightmare he can't wake from. STRYKER (cont'd) Did you really think we just let you walk away three years ago? You're a dangerous man, my friend. We like to keep an eye on dangerous men. When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her shoulder. Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him, tears streaming down her face. \nKAYLA I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. An aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air, smashing the back of Logan's head. Logan falls to the floor, unconscious. Victor Creed stands above him, staring at the flattened barrel of the baseball bat. f nNTTNITFT)1 \nCONTINUED: \nVICTOR CREED Man's got a hard head. \nSTRYKER \nLOGAN You loved me. I know you loved me. Kayla blinks and looks away. \nKAYLA I'm a good actress. \nLOGAN No one's that good. (C ONTTN1TF.f ) \nCONTINUED: \nSTRYKER Everybody's a sucker for something. Figuring out what it is, that's the trick. For you, it's a woman's love. An easy weakness to forgive. But still a weakness. Stryker signals to Cornelius. The doctor and his assistant attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logan's skull. The halo is wired to the electric chair. Logan never takes his eyes off Silverfox. STRYKER (cont'd) Don't be angry at her. She was just serving her country, keeping the mutant menace in check. She and victor have been a real credit to their race. It takes Logan a moment to understand this comment. \nLOGAN You're a mutant? \nKAYLA My Daddy found out when I was twelve. Said a freak like me deserved whatever I got. \nVICTOR CREED My kind of guy. \nSTRYKER She's a gifted girl. She can plant thoughts in anyone's mind, make them believe what she wants-- as long as she stays focused on them. He strokes her long dark hair, proud of his protege. Kayla doesn't seem thrilled by Stryker's touch, but she endures it. STRYKER (cont'd) A useful tool in a seduction. \nKAYLA (to Logan) Spent so much time getting you to love me, by the time the Colonel showed up I couldn't get you to leave me. (r0N'rTN1 F.n 1 \nCONTINUED: (2) Dr. Cornelius finishes calibrating his machine and adjusting the halo brace. \nCORNELIUS We're good to go. \nSTRYKER So, Logan... The truth is, you're a real pain in the ass. But we've invested far too much time and treasure to terminate you. We're starting over. Cornelius checks the digital gauges on the machine. \nCORNELIUS If I've calibrated correctly, we'll leave intact the hard-wired functions, walking and talking, all that good stuff. \nVICTOR CREED You mean I don't get to potty train him? \nCORNELIUS But every memory you've ever had will evaporate. Just like it never happened. Logan never takes his eyes off Kayla, his personal Judas. \nLOGAN Good. \nSTRYKER (to Cornelius) Let me know when he's clean. I have to look in on our other guest. Stryker exits the room, followed by Victor. \nLOGAN (to Kayla) That story you told me... about the guy who goes to get flowers for the Moon. I can't get it out of my head. Except I had it all backwards. I thought you were the moon and I was your Wolverine. But you're the Trickster, aren't you? \n(MORE) \n( ('ONTTNTTF.1)) \nCONTINUED: (3) LOGAN (cont'd) And I'm just a schmuck who got played. Kayla is silent for a moment. \nKAYLA My mother told me that story. She takes a deep breath and turns to go. KAYLA (cont'd) It doesn't matter. You won't remember any of this. \nINT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY \nLogan sits in his electric chair, staring straight ahead, preparing himself for the pain. \nINT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCornelius stands behind the glass viewing window with his ASSISTANT. He puts his hand on a red switch. \nINT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - CONTINUOUS \nThousands of volts surge into Logan's skull, forcing his body to arch. After several seconds the power shuts off. Tendrils of white smoke rise from the copper halo. Logan opens his eyes and stares at Cornelius. \nLOGAN That all you got? \nINT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCORNELIUS (to his assistant) This could take a while. Raise the amperage by forty percent. \nINT. STRYKER'S OFFICE - DAY \nStryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide, Collins. Kayla stands by the window, picking at her fingers. \nKAYLA You're going to let Victor kill that woman. Stryker and Collins ignore her. KAYLA (cont'd) When you got me out of prison, you told me we were going to help people. Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up. \nSTRYKER We are. We're saving humanity. \nKAYLA From the mutants? The phone rings. Stryker answers it. \nSTRYKER Yes? \n(LISTENING) Good. I'm coming down. (hanging up; to Collins) The Eleven is ready. He stands and heads for the door. Collins follows. In the doorway, Stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on Kayla. STRYKER (cont'd) Don't worry, my sweet. You're one of the good ones. I'll protect you. He and Collins exit the room, leaving Kayla alone with her misery. \nINT. RE-EDUCATION CENTER, ALKALI LAKE - DAY \nLogan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm rests with white fingers, waiting for the next surge of electricity. It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in his body contracting, the veins in his neck bulging. \nINT. VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCornelius and his assistant watch Logan with no detectable sympathy. They turn when Kayla walks into the room. \nKAYLA Is he clean yet? Cornelius and the assistant face front again.. \nCORNELIUS He's stronger than I thought. We could be here all night.. Kayla watches Logan in his agony. A glimmer of remorse passes over her face. \nKAYLA He was good to me. Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in a sardonic smile. \nVICTOR CREED Amen to that. Kayla stands in between them, holding up her hands. \nKAYLA Please! We shouldn't be fighting each other. Stryker's using us. \n(CONTTNTIF.T) I \nCONTINUED: \nVICTOR CREED A little late for the Mutant Power crap. We hunt freaks for the man. That's why we're free. \nKAYLA What's he gonna do with us when the other mutants are dead? Put us in a zoo? Creed hesitates, considering the logic of her words. A fanged smile splits his face. \nVICTOR CREED Don't try your head games on me. I've gutted better telepaths than you. Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a blow that would separate her head from her body. Logan catches Creed's fist inches from Kayla's face. \nLOGAN Time you quit picking on girls. \nVICTOR CREED Oh, I'm happy picking on men. Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight begins. This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every lunge would kill any other adversary. Every parried blow would shatter a normal man's arm. Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet. She helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door. \nKAYLA Get out of here. Hines doesn't have to be told twice. She flees. Creed sees his plaything running out the door. He snarls in frustration. \nVICTOR CREED You're ruining my party. He grabs hold of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the cell wall-- a concrete support wall. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nLogan crashes to the floor, covered in rubble. Creed steps out of the cell, licking his fangs. Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls out of the way and gets back on his feet. The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through the air. A team of SENTRIES charge around the corner, wearing tactical armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles. They level their rifles at the battling mutants. \nSENTRY #1 Get down! Get down! \nSENTRY #2 Down on your knees! Logan and Creed, trying to punch holes in each other, ignore the sentries. Kayla, staring down the barrels of the big guns,. holds up her hands. She concentrates, staring into the sentries' eyes. \nKAYLA We're here as guests of Colonel Stryker. The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance. \nSENTRY #1 Very sorry about that. \nKAYLA You boys are no longer needed here. Go back to barracks. \nSENTRIES You got it. See ya later. Bye! The sentries wave cheerfully and depart. Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down. Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures. Holding both of Wolverine's wrists up with one hand, Creed grabs Wolverine's face with his free hand. (CONTTNI IRh ) \nCONTINUED: His black claws slide toward Wolverine's eyes. \nVICTOR CREED How you gonna fight without eyes, little man? Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium- enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin. The big man groans. Logan spins Creed around, jamming him against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment. Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall. He brings his hands. together, the adamantium blades slicing through granite as if it were cheesecake. Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him. He grabs Logan in a-bear hug. A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and, unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through the hole, disappearing from sight. Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern. \nINT. WEAPON XI FACILITY - CONTINUOUS \nLogan and Creed fall seventy feet, clawing at each other in mid-air. Logan hits the floor hard, the impact blasting a small crater in the concrete.

Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree branches are covered with several inches of snow. Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar. His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air. \nLOGAN. Smells like government. Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black overcoats glance at each other. Logan, halving another block of wood, doesn't turn around. One of the newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special Forces. He still has the look. His hair is cropped short, his bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce. f r_ONTTNTJF D \nCONTINUED: CHRISTOPH NORD, A.K.A.

The LEADER OF THE PACK, a muscular brute far bigger than his comrades, snarls at Logan. Logan stares back at the wolf. The wolf jumps at Logan, fangs bared, aiming for the man's throat. Logan sidesteps and the wolf hurtles past, skidding on the snow when he lands. Logan and the wolf circle each other, looking for weakness. The wolf gnashes its wet teeth and pounces again. Man and beast battle in the moonlight, a shadowy combat of ferocious velocity, of gleaming fangs and gray fur. The wolf lunges for Logan's throat again, but this time Logan catches the wolf in one hand and slams it to the snow. The wolf, desperate to escape, rakes Logan's arm with his claws. Logan ignores the bloody welts. rC)NTTNTTF.T) ) \nCONTINUED: His face is close to the wolf's face and they stare into each other's eyes, predator to predator. Snikt! Logan presses the claws of his left hand to the wolf's throat. The wolf quits fighting, mewling submissively. He goes slack in Logan's grip, rolling over to signal surrender. Logan stands over the newly-subservient alpha wolf. The other wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion. Intense light shines on Logan's face. He turns and sees that he's surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor. Powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their guns, which are pointed at Logan. The wolves flee, dodging through the pines, their paws kicking up snow. \nSOLDIER #1 Put your hands in the air! \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nStryker and the others are able to watch Logan in action, as night-vision security cameras mounted in the trees beam a constant live feed back to monitors in the control room. \nSTRYKER These soldiers are the creme de la creme. They're equipped to handle the situation. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "SOLDIER #1 Hands in the air, now! Logan charges at the soldiers. The soldiers fire their weapons. These are not rifles but high-powered Tasers. Twelve darts sink into Logan's skin, each connected to a silvery wire. Thousands of volts of electricity course through Logan's body. (fC)NTTNIJF.n \nCONTINUED: Gritting his teeth and fighting through the pain, he slices the twelve wires with his claws and advances on the stunned soldiers. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe monitors show the fallen soldiers lying in the snow. For a moment everyone in the room is quiet. \nHINES The creme de la creme just got creamed. Stryker gives her a very nasty look before turning to General Munson and speaking in calming tones. \nSTRYKER There's a high-voltage fence on the perimeter of the base-- \nGENERAL MUNSON Is it made out of adamantium? \nEXT. HUDSON FARM - DAY \nAn old Chevrolet pickup truck rattles down a snow-covered road that passes acres of frozen farm fields. A Good Sam Club sticker is pasted on the rear bumper. \nINT. CHEVROLET - CONTINUOUS \nJAMES and HEATHER HUDSON, a middle-aged farmer and his middle- aged wife, are bundled up in heavy parkas. James drives; his wife talks. \nHEATHER HUDSON Marge'll probably make her walnut pie again. I thought I'd do meringues this year. Try something different. Don't you think? \nJAMES HUDSON Yep. \nHEATHER HUDSON You like my meringues, don't you? \nJAMES HUDSON Yep. ((Y)NTTN!JRr 1 \nCONTINUED: \nHEATHER HUDSON \n(GOOD-HUMORED) Yep. Yep. Forty years of conversation, all I get is yeps. Heather grabs her husband's arm. HEATHER HUDSON (cont'd) Jimmy! James turns in time to see a naked man sprint across the snow and slip inside a red sheep barn. HEATHER HUDSON (cont'd) I think there's a naked man in the barn. \nJAMES HUDSON .yep. \nINT. SHEEP BARN - DAY \nJames Hudson cautiously slides his barn door open. He holds an old shotgun in his hands, a gun he hasn't fired in years. He advances slowly into the barn, sunlight from the open door falling on the scattered straw. A vintage motorcycle covered in a tarp stands near the side wall. Hudson looks inside each sheep pen. His thick-wooled SHEEP, ready for breakfast, bleat hopefully. In the third pen Hudson finds Logan, who has covered himself with straw. A few curious sheep sniff at the fugitive's face. Hudson stares at Logan, who stares back somewhat, well, sheepishly. \nJAMES HUDSON Son... What in hell are you doing? \n"}

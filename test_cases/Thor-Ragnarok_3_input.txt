SKURGE You girls are in for a treat. 
Angle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast aside in another pile of "stuff." Skurge hastily runs and grabs it. 
10   EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS                                    10 
Thor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on his heels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below! 
Thor looks back, genuinely nervous. The dragon is OPENING its jaws to swallow Thor whole when- 
-Suddenly Bi-Frost OPENS! The portal surrounds Thor and engulfs the dragon's head! In an instant, they're gone. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 8. 
MAIN TITLE 
11   INT. THE OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER                           11 
Skurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost. 
BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore. 
The dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock. 
The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself. 
SKURGE Girls! (beat) Well well, look who decided to pop in. Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains. 
THOR Who are you? 
SKURGE Don't you remember? I'm Skurge. (Thor doesn't) We fought together on Vanaheim. 
THOR Right.   Where's Heimdall? 
SKURGE That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne. 
THOR Traitor? 
SKURGE Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial. Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe. 
Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  9. 
THOR Sure. 
SKURGE Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival. 
Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.   Skurge starts the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge.

A13   EXT. THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY                                      A13 
THOR arrives with Surtur's skull. 
There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched in the `savior' pose. 
Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron. 
THOR What the hell is that? 
13    EXT. ASGARD - ROYAL TERRACE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER              13 
LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY. 
In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute. 
Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki. 
ACTOR LOKI Oh, brother. This is it.    I take my leave. 
ACTOR THOR You fool, you didn't listen! 
ACTOR LOKI I'm sorry. 
ACTOR THOR Lady Sif!     Get help! 
"Sif" awkwardly runs off. The "Warriors Three" watch sadly. A small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO. 
ACTOR SIF Somebody help! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                10. 
In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show. Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches. 
ACTOR LOKI Sorry for all I've done. 
ACTOR THOR It's all right.   Hold on. 
ACTOR LOKI I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth. 
ACTOR THOR They'd be lucky to have you. 
ACTOR LOKI I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract. I just couldn't help myself. 
ACTOR THOR I know. 
ACTOR LOKI I'm a trickster. 
ACTOR THOR So mischievous. 
ACTOR LOKI Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog. 
ACTOR THOR It was a wonderful joke. 
ODIN (to no-one in particular) Twas indeed hilarious. 
ACTOR THOR You are the savior of Asgard.

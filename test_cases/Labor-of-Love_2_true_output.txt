A large PHOTO OF MAURICE is next to the headline. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
DINER 
A red-headed waitress slices a credit card through the machine and waits... Green computer letters blink - "This account has been closed." 
The waitress returns with the card -- she shakes her head "No" at Maurice who digs into his wallet for cash. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MOTEL 
Maurice slides two twenties across the counter to the motel manager.  Maurice checks the remaining bills in his wallet... only a few bills left. 
In the motel room we find Maurice sitting over the edge of a bed buckled over in a coughing attack.  It finally stops. Maurice flops back to the pillows, completely drained. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
ROADS 
The flatlands have vanished.  The roads now serpentine through mountain ranges. 
VIEW FROM THE MOUNTAIN RANGE; Maurice moves like a grain of dust over the black line of the road. 
Maurice rests every half mile.  He labors up every incline with ultimate effort.  He braces himself with a branch serving as a make due crutch. 
Maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the mountain range.  He begins the journey to rest. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
GROCERIES 
Maurice pays for his food with the last few bills in his wallet. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
ROAD 
Another stick serves as a walking cane.  The multi layers of clothes have been shed for a short-sleeve shirt.  Maurice follows a dirt road that breaks free of the mountains and into the open country again. 
SUPERIMPOSE:  COALVILLE, UTAH... MILE 2,472 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DUSK 
A dust covered mailbox at the end of a long dirt driveway. Maurice wipes the mailbox clean with his hand.  The name emerges like an ancient inscription from beneath the mud... "CALDWELLS." 
CUT TO: 
FRONT DOOR 
Maurice tentatively moving to the front door.  His hand instinctively clutches his empty stomach. 
The wind blows gently.  Maurice shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath.  He opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table being set.  Potatoes, gravy, fresh baked bread... floating through the half open window to Maurice's thankful smile. THE SOUNDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS CAN BE HEARD INSIDE. 
The first LIGHT KNOCKS go unheard with all the commotion. HARDER.  The door squeaks open.  Maurice puts on his best smile... the door opens wider -- no one stands before him. 
BOY (O.S.) Hi. 
Maurice looks down to find an adorable little boy, black hair, big eyes and an even bigger grin.  This is three year old ISAAC CALDWELL. 
MAURICE Well, hello. 
ISAAC I'm Isaac... I'm three. 
MAURICE I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home? 
Beat.  Isaac thinks. 
ISAAC You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger. 
MAURICE Is that right? 
ISAAC You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon. 
MAURICE You'll probably be bigger than your brothers. 
ISAAC Yeah! 
Isaac is happy with this thought. 
Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door. 
MRS. CALDWELL Who are you talking to Isaac? 
Mrs. Caldwell stops as she stares at Maurice. 
MAURICE Hello, I'm Maurice Parker.  I'm just passing through and I need to conserve what little funds I have... I need some food and a roof to sleep under for one night... Now I don't look like much, but if there are any things that need to get done around the house -- 
Mrs. Caldwell doesn't listen, but instead yells behind the door. 
MRS. CALDWELL Dave... you're not going to believe who's here.

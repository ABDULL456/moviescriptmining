YOICHI Why did Tomo-chan die? * 
>* -chan is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection. >It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for >boys. 
ASAKAWA Well... it looks like she was really, really sick. 
She takes a seat on the bed. 
ASAKAWA Will you do me up? 
Yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up. 
YOICHI You can die even if youre young? 
ASAKAWA If its something serious... well, yes. 
Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him. 
ASAKAWA As hard as it is for us, what your auntie and uncle are going through right now is even harder, so lets not talk about this over there, OK? 
Yoichi nods. 
ASAKAWA (remembering) You and her used to play a lot together, didnt you? 
Yoichi says nothing. 
EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 
RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house. 
INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 
There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, down a hallway. 
INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 
Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon zabuton cushions. 
Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response. 
ASAKAWA Dad. 
Kouichi turns to see her. 
KOUICHI Ah! 
ASAKAWA How is sis holding up?

Nervous, the Councilor knows these thugs aren't shy. 
COUNCILOR No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything. ARCHY Don't worry, she's a friend,..and a member. (raises his voice) Jackie,..fancy a run'a'round with the Councilor? 
Pause.   She looks sullen, stroppy and rude all at the same time. 
JACKIE Only if he's wicked. 
She turns away to hit a ball, the Councilor's heart skips a beat. 
COUNCILOR (excited and shy) What does she mean by that? 
ARCHY I think she likes you boy-o.

Lenny is at the bar on his own looking at the papers and picking at the nuts. In walks the Councilor with Archy, the Councilor sits next to Lenny at the bar. 
LENNY COLE They say that times are changing Councilor, that this country isn't what it used to be, it's the new New York, they say. You being a political man must know all about that.

COUNCILOR Errh, I think they are probably right, times have changed, but that shouldn't affect you Lenny. 
LENNY COLE They say it's all gone "international" now, out with the old guard in with the new, but I think they're wrong. (beat) Anyway, where are my manners? Look at you sweaty as a native and pink as a pelican,...and I haven't even offered you a wet one. 
COUNCILOR A lemonade and orange please. LENNY COLE Oh that's nice,..refreshing, that'll put you back on top boy. 
Lenny pulls out the plans and a leather pack of cigars. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) Here you go, plans and papers. (beat) Would you like a cigar? 
COUNCILOR I don't mind if I do,...that's a nice lighter. 
LENNY COLE Eight grand they wanted for it cheeky toads and I paid, you know why? 
COUNCILOR Tell me Lenny. 
LENNY COLE 'Cos it's all about the details. 
Looking at the plans. 
COUNCILOR (awkwardly) Is our little deal in there too Lenny? 
Lenny milks the silence while he lights his cigar, the Councilor feels like a prick waiting, it goes on and on.

He puts the Dunhill lighter down on the plans. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) I'll leave you with them. (beat) I gotta run, can't stay here chewing the fat all day, a mans got to make a living. Call me in the 'morrow. 
He walks toward the door as Jackie is walking in, Lenny looks slyly at her as they pass. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) Look after him Jackie. 
In the distance. 
COUNCILOR Oh Lenny, you forgot your lighter. 
Lenny looks back to the Councilor. 
LENNY COLE Can't be mine, it's got your name on it. 
CUT TO the bottom of the lighter, "THE COUNCILOR." Lenny carries on walking and smiling.

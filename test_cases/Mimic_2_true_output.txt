SUSAN Then this little piggy will tear it in half... 
And a third!!! 
SUSAN ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.  These are precision tools here. Can you remember that? 
The guys nod. 
SUSAN Good.  Then get it right. 
A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads, revealing... 
...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging sweats. He smiles at Susan. 
CUT TO: 
EXHIBITS 
Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ. 
PETER (teasing) "Baby in a bottle..." 
He gives it to Susan. 
SUSAN Don't tease. 
Around them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff, as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an "ARCHITECTS OF NATURE" banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools. 
PETER You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns. 
SUSAN (laughs) Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they? 
She gently touches her belly. 
SUSAN Trust me. I've never been this late. Never. 
She shakes the bottle. 
SUSAN If nun's pee is what it takes... 
Peter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a larvae model from a pile on the floor. 
SUSAN You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that. 
PETER Don't get kinky here... 
Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits perfectly inside. 
PETER Okay, meet me out front. (to Susan) I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight. 
SUSAN I'll be late. 
He kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group working on that sculpture. 
SUSAN Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions... 
SIRI (a wicked smile) Just like Trump Tower, then. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET 
A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic jam. 
INT. VAN 
Peter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured, can-do guy -- drives. 
JOSH ...So I say "buddy, you have every violation in the book.  Gimme one good reason not to close you down." You know what the Kraut says to me? 
In the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging sweats and into his worksuit. 
JOSH The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..." 
PETER (distractedly) Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates... 
JOSH Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. (honks furiously) We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren. 
PETER Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!" 
EXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY 
The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out. 
COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH badge. 
JOSH Health Department... 
The cops let them pass. 
PETER You really love flashing that thing, don't you? 
JOSH Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want? 
Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry. 
PETER Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were the first on the scene? 
WOYCHEK (gestures to Rice) We were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. Then I looked through that cellar window. We both did... 
PETER You gone in? 
WOYCHEK No. We waited.

NAOMI (CONT'D) That was a joke, folks. It was built for the Chrysler corporation. 
Naomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly in love with her. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) The spire is a beauty, especially on a winter's morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to... 
GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST (INTERRUPTING) How tall is it? 
NAOMI 1047 feet madam, not allowing for pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross. 
Naomi leads the tourists across the busy road. She has to go back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear. Arthur hurries alongside Naomi. 
ARTHUR Can I join your tour please? 
NAOMI Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the free authentic street pretzel. Sorry, my bosses make the prices. 
Arthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Sorry. I can't take cards. (BEAT) Ah, owe me it. I start on that corner every day on the hour... 
Just as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving very aggressively, nearly hits her. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't your braille windshield work? 
CABBIE (ANGRY) !NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS! 
NAOMI PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED PINCHAZO GRANDE SU MADRE ES UN PUTA ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN MARTILLO! 
The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss. She smiles back. 
ARTHUR Wow. What did you say? 
NAOMI Just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals. (to the tourists) Everyone make it over alive? Excellent. Next we enter Times Square, world famous for New Year's Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball descends at eye-poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools. Many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise. (TO ARTHUR) Sir? What shape is Times Square? 
ARTHUR A circle? 
NAOMI (LAUGHS) See? Morons. 
More tourists laugh this time. Some... 
GRUMPY MALE TOURIST When do we get the pretzel? 
NAOMI Soon, sir. Soon. 
She checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Okay, next the very Laundromat once used by George Gershwin, Donald Trump... 
INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Naomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle and makes a loud buzz. 
NAOMI ...Mr Big from Sex and the City and three of the 9-11 terrorists. 
She starts unloading the machine of a large man's whites - vests, underwear, shirts, all stained red by a baseball cap. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Oh, dad. 
She transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it quarters. Arthur stays close. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the Chelsea Hotel half an hour after losing a sock in this very dryer. 
ARTHUR (CONSPIRATORIAL) Are you abusing this tour to do your errands? 
NAOMI Are you abusing the tour to stalk me? 
ARTHUR Absolutely. 
Arthur stares at the big tumble dryers. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) These things are amazing. Have you ever put all your father's clothes on and just got inside one? 
Naomi looks at him, bemused but intrigued as she heads to the door. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY 
Hobson's out of the car looking for Arthur. 
HOBSON Where the blazes is that boy? Arthur! 
EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

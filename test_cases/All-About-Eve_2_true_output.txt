BILL (nods) He must be miserable, the life he lives out there- 
ADDISON These so-called abnormalities - they're our stock in trade, they make us actors, writers, directors, et cetera in the first place- 
MAX Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer? 
ADDISON What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair? 
MAX This answer satisfies me a hundred percent. 
ADDISON We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities... 
BILL (laughs; to Eve) You don't have to read his column tomorrow - you just heard it. I don't agree, Addison... 
ADDISON That happens to be your particular abnormality. 
BILL Oh, I admit there's a screwball element in the Theater. It sticks out, it's got spotlights on it and a brass band. But it isn't basic, it isn't standard - if it were, the Theater couldn't survive... 
MISS CASWELL (to a passing butler) Oh, waiter... 
The butler goes right by. 
ADDISON That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler. 
MISS CASWELL Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler... 
ADDISON You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point. 
MISS CASWELL I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink. 
MAX (getting up) Leave me get you one... 
MISS CASWELL (pitching) Oh, thank you, Mr. Fabian. 
Max leaves with her empty glass. 
ADDISON Well done. I see your career rising in the East like the sun... (to Bill) ... you were saying? 
BILL I was saying that the Theater is nine-tenths hard work. Work done the hard way - by sweat, application and craftsmanship. I'll agree to this - that to be a good actor, actress, or anything else in the Theater, means wanting to be that more than anything else in the world... 
EVE (abruptly) Yes. Yes, it does. 
BILL (goes on) It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little... 
Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says. She looks at no one in particular, just off... 
EVE So little. So little, did you say? Why, if there's nothing else - there's applause. It's like - like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up. Imagine... To know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you... they smile, their eyes shine - you've pleased them, they want you, you belong. Just that alone is worth anything... 
She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks of warm interest. She's embarrassed, she turns away - then scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the direction of the pantry. 
Margo's had too much to drink. Her fake smile fades as Eve gets up. She's unpleasant and depressed. 
MARGO Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother. 
EVE (hurt) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- 
BILL (sharply) Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly! 
MARGO You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- (to Eve) - aren't we, honey? 
KAREN Margo, really... 
MARGO Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter... (to Addison) I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"? 
ADDISON You're maudlin and full of self pity. You're magnificent. 
Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink. 
LLOYD How about calling it a night? 
MARGO And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep... 
BILL It's a good thought. 
MARGO It won't play. 
KAREN As a nonprofessional, I think it's an excellent idea. Undramatic, but practical... 
As she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side. 
MARGO Happy little housewife... 
BILL Cut it out. 
MARGO This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-! 
KAREN Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast! 
ADDISON Hear, hear... 
LLOYD Now let's not get into a big hassle- 
KAREN It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off. 
MARGO (suddenly) All right! I'm going to bed. (to Bill) You be the host. It's your party. Happy Birthday, welcome home, and we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you.

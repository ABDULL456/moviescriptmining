M waits. 
PARKER LYNCH!? LYNCH!!! (then) ANSWER ME!!! 
The wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk 
D towards Lynch's body. 
One step at a time. 
CUT TO: 
E 78   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                              78 As the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and towards Lynch...it is revealed that he is only winded. 
He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a broken rib or two. His right arm is twisted at an odd angle and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or fractured in addition to being dislocated. 
LYNCH PARKER. 
PARKER (O.C.) ARE YOU OK? 
The wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks. 
The other wolves watch from the bushes. 
LYNCH I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA GET RESCUE. 
X CUT TO: 
79   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                    79 
R PARKER Hurry.   Please. 
CUT TO: 
A 80   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                               80 Lynch gets himself to his feet. His body is in massive pain, but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight 
M through it. 
He moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair. 
The leader growls. Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry mouth as it takes a step back. 
D PARKER (O.C.) NO!   JOE! 
LYNCH I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP! 
E The wolf leader advances on Lynch. 
Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Come on!     Try something, fucker! 
The wolf stares back at him, growling.      Their eyes are locked. 
Lynch swings the pole at it angrily. 
LYNCH (cont'd) COME ON! 
The leader shies away but growls harder. 
LYNCH (cont'd) STAY AWAY! 
SNAP! 
X A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth. 
LYNCH (cont'd) ARGH! 
R The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill. 
CUT TO: 
A 81   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 81 Parker looks from Lynch to the ground way below her. 
M PARKER (crying) JOE!

82   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            82 
D Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm. 
Finally, he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the wolf's body. 
E The wolf SHRIEKS in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack. 
The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait.   This food still has some fight left in it.

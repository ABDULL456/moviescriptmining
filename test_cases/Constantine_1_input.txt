Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror. Tired, aging eyes stare back. 
WEISS (O.S.) 
Gutsy move out there, Dodson. Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker. 
ANGELA 
Gutsy?    Well that's a new one. The two exchange a look. 
WEISS 
You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No point in using the other words. 
ANGELA 
Thanks. 
WEISS 
(shuts his locker) Even though it was reckless -- irresponsible -- stupid... 
ANGELA 
I knew you still cared. 
WEISS 
You're good, Angela, real good but one of these days... 
ANGELA 
(heard it before) I know, nobody's luck lasts forever. He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care. Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her locker door, notices her reflection does not turn. She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it should be. She shudders, slams the locker door. 
EXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM 
So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which is -- 
JOHN 
Two frogs on a bench. Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him -- he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. 
CHAZ 
Two frogs on a bench. But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card shows a BEAR in a dress. 
CHAZ 
What?   But I'm with him!   Right, John?   John? John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz backs away, stares after him. Someday. 
INT. CLUB MIDNITE 
MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro speakeasy for the new millennium. John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses, sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing off for several ladies. One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water. Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up. NICO, a young black man, walks past John. 
NICO 
Neighborhood's going to Hell. John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on. One of the men in the group turns, watches John. Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN. 
INT. HALLWAY 
John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of two very large doors. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over countless centuries. John places his fingers into the gnarled folds, closes his eyes -- 
JOHN 
Numquam leadatur a morsu. A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors don't budge. 
JOHN 
Bastard changed the code again. (bangs the doors) Midnite! Come on, do I have to huff and puff here?! The doors unlatch. 
INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE 
SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific sculpture that normally displays our solar system in relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL, ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- "CREATOR." This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And it's not moving. 
MIDNITE (O.S.) 
Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes... John steps in through the doors behind. 
JOHN 
Deciding which color to paint this place again? PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office. Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A full six and half feet of solid contradictions. 
MIDNITE 
You're back early. 
JOHN 
I got tired of spending your money.

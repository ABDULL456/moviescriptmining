RUDY You got a letter from Uncle Terry. 
SAMMY What?! 
Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears it open and reads it with growing excitement. 
INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER 
Sammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household files, miscellaneous files. 
She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked "Terry -- Correspondence." The folder is stuffed with other letters, on all different kinds of stationery from all over the country, all from Terry. 
INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for just two people. 
RUDY Whose room is he gonna stay in? 
SAMMY He can stay in the little room. (Pause) But you know what? He's not going to live here. He's only gonna stay for a little while... And it's OK if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here... But it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit. Don't you think? 
Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER 
Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition notebook. Sammy comes downstairs. 
SAMMY Rudy? Would it distract you if I put on some music? 
RUDY No. 
She puts on a CD, sits down and picks up a book. She looks at Rudy, who is writing away. 
SAMMY Did you think of a story? 
RUDY Uh huh. 
SAMMY What's it about? 
RUDY My father. 
Pause. 
SAMMY What about your father? 
RUDY It's just a made-up story about him. 
SAMMY Can I read it when you're done? 
RUDY It's not very good. 
SAMMY Don't say that. 
Rudy keeps writing. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER 
Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her. 
INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER 
Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone. She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better judgment she picks up the phone and dials. 
INT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT 
Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy. 
SAMMY Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and Rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government... And it just made me feel weird. You know? Because I never really say much to him about Rudy Sr., because I don't know what to say. And I don't know whether I should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether I should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. You know? 
BOB Well... I don't know, Sammy. What have you told him already? 
SAMMY Not much. He knows I don't have the highest opinion of him. And he knows I don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever. But I tried to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway... I could go into a lot more detail, believe me. 
BOB Well... It's an interesting problem. But I don't really know what to tell you... It's a little outside my personal field of expertise...

DWIGHT Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your time. 
BAR 
It is late afternoon, dusty and empty. 
Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position. 
As the bartender approaches: 
DIEDRICKSON Rye. 
ED Just coffee. 
DIEDRICKSON You sure you don't want something stiffer? 
Ed shrugs and shakes his head. 
BARTENDER Coffee it is. 
He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop and stares at them. After a beat: 
DIEDRICKSON ...County M. E. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody. I don't know if you knew that. It's routine. 
Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at his hands, plows on: 
DIEDRICKSON ...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told. 
ED Told what? 
DIEDRICKSON I, uh... thanks. 
The bartender has set down the drinks. 
Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his glass. Finally: 
DIEDRICKSON ...I'm sorry to add to your burden, Crane, but I'd want to know it it was me. Your wife was pregnant. First trimester. 
A pause. 
DIEDRICKSON ...Well, there it is. 
Another pause. 
DIEDRICKSON ...I'm sorry. 
He mutters to himself: 
DIEDRICKSON ...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing. 
ED My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years. 
Diedrickson stiffens. 
DIEDRICKSON (murmuring) ...Jesus. (aloud) ...Well, that's not really my business. 
He is hastily digging for money. 
DIEDRICKSON ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is. 
He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he leaves: 
DIEDRICKSON ...Good luck, Crane. 
His retreating footsteps echo down the bar. 
APARTMENT HALLWAY 
It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the middle background, knocking on a door. 
ED (V.O.) Doris and I had never really talked much. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily. But it was funny: now I wanted to talk--now, with everyone gone. I was alone, with secrets I didn't want and no one to tell them to anyway. 
The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.

He picks up a CB, speaks into it. 
HANS McClane!  McClane!  I have some news for you...McClane? 
330     THE MACHINE FLOOR                                     330 
TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed. 
Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct. 
331     THE VAULT ROOM                                        331 
HANS McClane? (pause, then on a new channel) Karl?  Karl? 
Nothing.  He looks at Theo. 
HANS Hurry. 
332     THE ROOF                                              332 
Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few out. 
333     LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS     333 
They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash shaking the trees. 
334     POWELL AND ROBINSON                                   334 
Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion. 
335     HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                  335 
They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to himself, moves towards the door: 
336     VAULT ROOM                                            336 
Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue. 
HOLLY (to Hans, scornfully) After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief. 
HANS I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite. 
He SLAPS her. 
337     MACHINE FLOOR                                         337 
Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one. McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs upwards, propelling Karl into the air: 
338     LOW ANGLE                                             338 
Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes entangled. 
339     MCCLANE                                               339 
jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain. 
340     KARL                                                  340 
is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured fish -- starts to turn blue: 
341     MCCLANE                                               341 
Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out. 
CUT TO: 
342     CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                 342 
We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot. 
BIG JOHNSON Just like Saigon, eh, Wally? 
PILOT My kind of town. 
CUT TO: 
343     THE ROOF                                              343 
The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door, OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She meets him halfway. 
MCCLANE Where's Holly -- 
GINNY The took her -- after they saw the kids on television -- 
MCCLANE What?  God -- 
He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS. 
MCCLANE Listen to me!  All of you, get down to the lower floors -- you're all in danger. 
HOSTAGE What are you, crazy?  We're being rescued!  Those helicopters --

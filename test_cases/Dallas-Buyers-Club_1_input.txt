EFFEMINATE MAN Is it true you can get it in Mexico?! 
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.C.) What about dextran sulfate?! 
As the chaos and shouting continues, Ron walks out in frustration and we're suddenly-- 
24   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                                         24 
CLOSE ON -- a line of flickering CANDLES. 
That's Ron's POV as he grimaces, despair in his eyes. He doesn't look at the moving, out-of-focus SILHOUETTES in front of him. 
RON (mumbles to himself) I need to slow it down a second, catch my breath. I'm not ready to crawl into a corner. You hear that? I'm not fucking ready. Man, if you're up there you better be listening. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 19A 
RON (CONT'D) And if there's a chance, if I got one fucking chance, send me a sign. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 20 
Ron downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the candles on a stage in front of a STRIPPER, lost in his thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention. 
STRIPPER If you're not gonna look or buy a dance, you could at least tip me. 
Ron stands and throws some bills on the stage. 
RON I'll take a dance, but not fer me. Just shake it, he'll see you. 
Ron looks heavenward. 
RON Thanks. 
And he walks off towards a man at the end of the bar: the Hispanic Orderly from the hospital. 
25   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT                     25 
Cowboy boots nervously play with a McDonald's Bag on the ground next to a garbage dumpster. They stop when the Hispanic Orderly walks out of the hospital. He gets to the dumpster, throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in it, picks up the McDonald's bag, looks inside and leaves without a word. 
26   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                    26 
Ron sits at the table, removes a box of pills from the bag labeled AZT, FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 21 
Ron removes a pill, decides two is better, washes them down with a beer, and sniffs a line of coke. Looks at his reflection in the turned-off T.V. 
27    EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY                                             27 
As Ron pulls up to his jobs site in his battered '73 Lincoln, he spots T.J., Clint and a half dozen other WORKERS through the windshield, all staring at him menacingly. Before Ron gets out, the Foreman emerges through the crowd. Without a word, the guy just slowly shakes his head. Ron gives him the finger and drives off, popping a few more AZT pills. 
A27   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT                        A27 
The Hispanic Orderly throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in the dumpster, picks up a fast food bag, and leaves. 
28    EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BLEACHERS - DAY                             28 
Empty; closed for the day. Ron sits in the empty bleachers, sweaty and shivering; he looks horrible, maybe disoriented. He pops a pill of AZT and drinks from a bottle of Tequila. 
29    EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT                                        29 
A labyrinth of identical trailers. Ron wanders, searching for his own. Confused, he changes direction and continues to make his way down the different rows. 
He stops in front of one and stares at the door where two YOUNG BOYS are seated on the steps, staring back at him. 
RON The hell you doin' here? 
He waves them aside. As he walks up the steps, his neighbor BUCKY and his WIFE stare at him blankly. 
RON Fuck you doin' in my house? 
Ron doesn't realize that he's not at his place. 
30    INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - DR. EVE SAKS' OFFICE - DAY          30

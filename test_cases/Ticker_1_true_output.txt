Glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set-up. 
GLASS (cont.) Jesus Fucking H. Christ... 
Reilly has never heard Glass swear before... 
REILLY Fuck factor? 
GLASS Off the scale. 
REILLY What do we do? 
Glass turns to Mary. 
GLASS Can you hold it? 
She nods.   Reilly releases her gently, joining Glass at the van. 
REILLY Talk to me.     Let's assess. 
GLASS Right. 
Glass stares at the digital read-out on the device anchored in one of the C4 crates. It reads: "1:30, 1:29..." 
REILLY C'mon, talk to me! We can do it! 
GLASS He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote. (beat) Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor. 
Reilly does it the way he saw Glass do it before. 
GLASS Good, now the other side. 
REILLY Nothing. 
GLASS Okay, let's go in. 
Reilly feels around, finally finds an access hole. 
Reilly works the hole bigger. 
GLASS (cont.) Not enough time ... gotta go for the blasting cap. Only one chance... hand entry. 
REILLY Keep talking. 
GLASS Close your eyes, feel your fingertips.   Tell me everything you feel. 
Reilly' hand disappears into the hole. 
CLOSE-UP - INSIDE THE BOMB 
His fingers snake through complex circuitry as he describes each layer. 
REILLY Wires... metal, cold... something soft... 
GLASS Don't touch that. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The red digital numbers keep counting down: 0:38, 0:37, 0:36 
REILLY More metal... sharp edge... 
GLASS Stay to your left.

DINKO (re: Judy) So is she, like, your girlfriend or are you guys just fucking? 
JIMMY (O.C.) She's my girlfriend, my best friend, and yes we fuck. And don't ever, ever fucking touch her. That's MY only rule Dinko. 
Judy is frustrated with Jimmy's lack of attention. 
JUDY (O.C.) Jimmy! 
Jimmy turns the camera to her. She's starting to do her best impression of a stripper dance. 
DINKO It's all good man. I ain't gonna touch your old lady. Shit man, she's so into you anyway. 
Dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area, crossing the frame. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on various items in the kitchen while Dinko talks. 
There's ripped open small electronics and appliances everywhere, as if Dinko's been taking everything apart and trying to put it back together. 
DINKO So there's this dude. Fucker taught me everything I know about meth and shit. He'd fucking flip for your girl, man. You should go up and see him. He's in Erlanger. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Uncle Rodney? 
Camera drifts across several messy piles of papers and cardboard boxes with bags of drugs in them. 
DINKO (O.C.) Right, right! I forgot.     Yeah, Uncle Rodney! 
JUDY (O.C.) You have an Uncle Rodney baby? 
Judy is too stoned to realize that Jimmy has already told her about Uncle Rodney. 
Jimmy pulls out to include Judy in the shot. She's in the kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top. 
JUDY I want to meet your uncle. 
JIMMY (O.C.) He's not my uncle. He's not anybody's uncle. People just call him that. He's the one I told you about from the nut house. 
As Judy bends down to snort her line, camera drifts over to Dinko who's holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand and stuffs it into a box of cereal. Jimmy zooms in on the cereal box. There's a whole bunch more cash in there. 
JIMMY (O.C.) I said one day I'd take you up to Erlanger one day, remember? 
JUDY (O.C.) When was that? 
Dinko throws the cash on the table.    Jimmy ZOOMS OUT catching Judy in the frame. 
JIMMY (O.C.) When we were naked. 
JUDY We're always naked, Jimmy. 
Judy wipes powder from her nose, then goes foggy for a split second, losing then catching her balance. 
JUDY (re: crank) Fuck... Woah, that's cool. 
DINKO (O.C.) That's some good shit, huh? 
JUDY (disoriented) Uh huh... 
Jimmy turns the camera onto Dinko. 
DINKO So you guys should like, totally go see him, man. I don't fuckin' go up there no more, 'cuz like, I got all the shit I need right here man, 'cuz my place is cool and all, but there's no fucking room here, ya know? So like you should go see him and shit. 
Judy steps into frame. At this point, she's in her bra and is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera. 
JUDY You like this, Jimmy? 
THERE'S A KNOCK at the door. 
DINKO (O.C.) (calls out to door) Yo! (to Jimmy) Customers call. 
Judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while Dinko goes to the door. Judy finishes her bottle of beer. She's pretty drunk and cranked out at this point. 
Dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer. We can't see her and we can barely hear what they're talking about, but it seems Dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with her. He yells back into the living room from the front door. 
DINKO (O.C.) Yo, Jimmy.     Is your girl into chicks? 
JIMMY (O.C.) I don't know. (to Judy) Are you into chicks? 
JUDY Do you want me to be into chicks? 
JIMMY (O.C.) (calls to her) Sure Dinko. Bring her in. 
Dinko brings in HAZEL,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict. She's scared, nervous, and completely strung out, and she looks like death. They stand off to the side of the room watching Judy dance. 
Judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing. 
Jimmy zooms in on the woman. Looking closer we see that Hazel is in the final stages of her life/addiction. She's sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull. 
Dinko turns the music down so they don't have to scream. 
JIMMY (O.C.) You know what, never mind Dink.    I don't think Judy's into chicks. 
JUDY Yeah, I'm not into chicks. 
DINKO Well Hazel here will do anything we want. Ain't that right Hazel? 
Hazel nods her head yes.

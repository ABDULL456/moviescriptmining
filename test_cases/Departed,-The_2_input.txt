INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS. 
FITZY closes the cellphone. He puts it into COLIN'S hand. 
INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS 
MISTER FRENCH Everybody out. Move. 
The DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the tables. MISTER FRENCH lights a cigarette with his ZIPPO, and then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY watches. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS. 
COLIN takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket. 
FITZY Who are you? When do I get out of here? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day. 
INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE.CONTINUOUS 
COLIN comes out and hands BROWN the CELLPHONE. 
COLIN Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra. 
BROWN Why'd you use my phone? 
COLIN Because you didn't go in there. 
INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
COLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table.     Madolyn looks at him. 
MADOLYN The light's nice here in the morning. 
COLIN doesn't respond. 
MADOLYN (CONT'D) It's all right. Guys tend to make a big deal out of it. It's actually quite common. 
COLIN I gotta go to work. 
COLIN simply gets up and walks away. 
INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. DAY 
A clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy. Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more guarded than Billy. 
BILLY It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A beat. 
BILLY (CONT'D) People make things up in confession. You know that? 
MADOLYN I know they do. 
BILLY People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films. 
MADOLYN That's an interesting observation. 
BILLY Do you lie? 
MADOLYN Why do you? 
BILLY I'm asking if you lie. 
MADOLYN Honesty isn't synonymous with truth. 
BILLY You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it? 
MADOLYN I expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel. 
BILLY So, you had a parent who was a drunk? 
MADOLYN looks up at him, transpierced. Tables turned on the psychiatrist. BILLY smiles at her. 
MADOLYN (flustered) Did you? 
BILLY (simply) No. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MADOLYN Let's keep this with you. 
BILLY (abruptly) There was a cop leaving when I came in. 
MADOLYN How do you know he was a cop? 
BILLY Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops? 
MADOLYN That's part of what I do. Although, I don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy. 
BILLY You should get a better job... 
BILLY (CONT'D) Do they all come in and cry...your cops? 
MADOLYN Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons. 
BILLY Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV. 
MADOLYN I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail? 
BILLY You want to hear about the showers? 
MADOLYN Did something happen to you?

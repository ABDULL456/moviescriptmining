WELLES (into phone) Okay... 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) (from phone) My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash. 
WELLES I'm not positive this means anything. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) The checks were for odd amounts... 
INT.  MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS 
Mrs. Christian has the amounts written out on paper. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (into phone) One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents... 
WELLES (V.O.) (from phone) Okay, I follow you so far... 
MRS CHRISTIAN Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars. 
INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS 
WELLES (into phone) You're joking. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) (from phone) To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash. 
Welles considers this, lost in thought. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) Hello... ? 
WELLES I'm here. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) Do you think the film could have cost that much? 
WELLES For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) Okay. 
WELLES Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself? 
MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.) You told me to look, so I looked. 
WELLES You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian. 
EXT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY 
TEENAGERS work cleaning this large DORMITORY, sweeping and mopping the floor, making the bunk beds, washing windows. Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing. 
WELLES Her name was Mary Anne Mathews. 
Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY.  The woman puts on her glasses, looks at the picture... looks at Welles. 
NUN Yes... I remember Mary 
WELLES You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure... 
NUN (examines picture) Yes.  I remember her. 
INT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY 
In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE.  The cage is full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS. 
NUN She lived here for only about a month, if I recall correctly.  She didn't return one night.  She never came back.  I didn't know what to think... 
The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way, looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES. 
NUN Do you know what happened to her? 
WELLES I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents. 
The nun sees what she wants, finds a STEP LADDER, tries to open it.  Welles comes to help her. 
NUN (pointing on shelf) Can you get that down for me? 
Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes... 
NUN No, the next shelf... there... 
Welles takes down a small SUITCASE.  It's covered in dust. He climbs down the ladder with it. 
WELLES What is this? 
NUN Those are her belongings. 
WELLES Her belongings? 
NUN That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture. 
Welles puts the suitcase down, examines the LUGGAGE TAG: "Mary Anne Mathews," no address.  Welles looks to the nun. 
WELLES Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time? 
NUN She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate? 
WELLES I'll do what I can. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT 
Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it.  He takes out some of Mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside. 
He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING.  Resting on a SWEATER are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten.  Welles examines them, frowning, puts them aside. 
He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS, "July 2, 1992."  Several job possibilities circled, others crossed out.  He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS. 
All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and an ADDRESS BOOK.  Welles examines the address book, finds a folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...

"THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS" 
FADE IN: 
JACK BAKER 
is standing before a dirty window, looking out at a dirty city street.  He is wearing a tuxedo. 
VOICE (O.S.) Hey. 
WIDEN ANGLE 
It's the GIRL from this afternoon. 
JACK Hey. 
Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment. Not good. 
GIRL Whatcha doin' over there? 
JACK Gotta go. 
GIRL How come? 
JACK Job. 
The Girl glances at the bedside clock. 
GIRL Funny hours. 
JACK Funny job. 
GIRL Will I see you again? 
Jack looks out at the dirty street again. 
JACK No. 
The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this. 
GIRL (at the tux) You weren't wearing that, were you? Earlier. 
Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on the sill. 
JACK Brought it. 
GIRL Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep. 
JACK Thanks. 
GIRL I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit. 
Jack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to the door. 
GIRL (continuing) Hey. (as he stops) You got great hands. 
EXT.  STREET - JACK 
Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel. Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent. 
DOORMAN Hey, Jackie! 
JACK How goes it, Tommy? 
TOMMY (DOORMAN) (shrugging) Ah, you know. Howsa pooch? 
JACK Losing his teeth. 
TOMMY No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps. 
JACK Yeah. (standing back) Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy. 
Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat. 
TOMMY Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday. 
JACK Another five years, huh? 
TOMMY Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie. 
JACK It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here? 
TOMMY (nodding) He's got blood in his eye. 
Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and moves into the hotel. 
INT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK 
Jack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the lounge when he sees Jack approaching. 
FRANK Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it. 
JACK How we doing?

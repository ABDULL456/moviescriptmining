HATTIE Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool. 
SUZIE I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra. 
HATTIE He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox. 
SUZIE I can't accuse him just dry long 
HATTIE Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes. 
SUZIE What must I do? 
HATTIE If it was left up to me, I would poison him. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Harry sees that it is safe to leave. He sees Sunny sweeping in Gideon's room. Gideon is sound asleep. Sunny is sweeping around the bed. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Harry comes in and Hattie and Suzie stop talking. Harry is aware that he was the subject. The SOUND of the boy next door playing his horn is heard. 
HARRY Good afternoon, ladies. 
SUZIE Good afternoon to you. 
Harry waits for Hattie to respond but it is obvious that Hattie isn't about to speak to him. 
HATTIE I'm going to check on Gideon. 
Harry moves out of her way to let her go by. Hattie doesn't even give him a glance. Harry continues to look at her as she disappears into Gideon's room. 
HARRY As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman. 
SUZIE You must have done something to her. 
HARRY Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones. 
SUZIE Hattie is a different person now. 
HARRY I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is? 
SUZIE I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house. 
HARRY You invited me. 
SUZIE Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend? 
Harry takes his time in looking for an answer. 
HARRY Like that boy next door playing that his horn. If he was a friend, he would stop irritating people, but if he stops practicing, he wouldn't be perfect in what he does someday. 
INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Hattie enters Harry's room. She goes through his things. She reads one of his letters. As she walks over to the window reading his letter, she steps on the plate, cracking it. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
SUZIE I want you to leave. 
Harry looks sad and suddenly a lot older as if what she said has taken away some of his life. 
HARRY Okra, M.C. and Herman want to go back home with me. (beat) Suzie, I'm not a bad fellow; I just like to have a good time. (beat) M.C. is coming by to pick me up tonight. I'll come back to get my things. Well, I hope Gideon recovers. You know I have an extra picture of one of my sons that I would like for you to put with those baby pictures over your dresser. It's better than being in my dusty wallet with addresses and names of people who are no longer on this earth. 
Suzie takes the picture. She seems as if she has doubts about having asked Harry to leave.

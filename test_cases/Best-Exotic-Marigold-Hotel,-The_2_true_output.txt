Sonny is at the flower market, sitting on his motor bike, waiting for the flower vendor to tie up his bundle of marigolds. He's on his phone. 
SONNY Come on. Pick up pick up pick up. The phone is answered at the other end. 
SONNY (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Sunaina, I must see you. I must. If I cannot hold your body against mine, I swear I will go mad. We cut to the call centre. It's not Sunaina on the phone, but Jay, who is standing next to her. 
SONNY'S VOICE 
(ON PHONE) I yearn for you, I burn for you, 
I - 
JAY I think it's my sister you're burning for there, Sonny boy. 
SONNY Thank you, Jay. Thank you. Jay hands the phone to Sunaina. 
SUNAINA Hey. 
SONNY Private line, Sunaina. Do those words mean nothing to you? 
SUNAINA He took the phone. What could I do? 
SONNY I miss you. I miss you every moment. Come and see me. Tonight. 
SUNAINA I cannot tonight. It is my parents 25th wedding anniversary. Tell your mother that. 
SONNY Come after. Come late 
SUNANINA You'll be asleep. 
SONNY I'll be waiting. 
SUNANINA You'll be asleep. But i can wake you in that special way... 
SONNY You will sneak in? 
SUNAINA I'm not ashamed. 
SONNY Neither am I. Absolutely not. There is no shame. You do not have to sneak. 
(BEAT) All the same, if you did want to be very quiet, and not let anyone see you, it couldn't hurt.

Norman is talking to DR RAMA. 
NORMAN I'm worried there's no lead in my pencil. 
DR RAMA OK. I don't know what that means. 
NORMAN No snap in my celery. 
DR RAMA I'm still not quite with you. 
78A. 
NORMAN I plan to party hearty tonight, but I can't guarantee that my love gun will fire. 
DR RAMA Mr Smith - 
NORMAN Will the lance dance, and the trouser lion roar? 
DR RAMA What is your problem? 
NORMAN I don't know if I can still have sex. 
DR RAMA Ah. 
NORMAN I'm not a young man anymore, doctor. And I'm a little bit scared. Truth be told, I'm a lot scared. 
DR RAMA How long since you've been with a woman? 
NORMAN What's today? 
DR RAMA Monday. 
NORMAN Six years.

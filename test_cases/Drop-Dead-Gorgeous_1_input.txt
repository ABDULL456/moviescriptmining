A visibly upset Amber still applies make-up to Brett. 
AMBER Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her dad's thresher - she said the heavy vibration helped her think, y'know? But I know for a fact she only smoked after a good drive.  You ask me or anyone else who isn't scared to talk about it - Tammy was murdered. (holding back tears) God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to deal with crap like this... (to crew guy) Toss me "Caucasian #5," would ya? 
A crew guy walks IN FRAME and hands her a make-up jar. 
AMBER (cont'd) Man, I can't wait for fishin' season... 
Mr. Larson bursts in, white as a corpse. 
MR. LARSON Amber... 
AMBER No, don't say it.  Another stray bullet to the head. 
She adjusts Brett's red plaid hunting cap. 
AMBER (cont'd) I'm gonna need more caps. 
MR. LARSON You hafta go home.  There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park. 
AMBER Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys." 
MR. LARSON No.  Loretta called.  There's been a... a fire. 
She grabs the keys and RUNS OUT. 
EXT. TRAILER PARK STREET/INT. HEARSE - NIGHT 
Amber drives fast and furious as we come to what's left of her trailer.  All the NEIGHBORS are out drinkin' beers, eatin' food and watchin' the excitement. 
AMBER Oh my God - no!  Is my mom okay?  Was she home? 
Hearse SCREECHES to a halt.  We hear a THUD, then MOANS from in back.  Amber jumps out.  Camera follows, a la "COPS."  It's pandemonium with fire trucks, neighbors, an ambulance, etc. 
AMBER (cont'd) Mom!  Mom!?  MOMMMM! 
Loretta runs up to Amber as TWO FIREMEN approach. 
FIREMAN #1 You family? 
LORETTA No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!" kcause she's got Tourettes... She's Annette's kid, dipshit. 
AMBER (to Loretta) Is Mom okay? 
LORETTA She's alive, sweetie. 
AMBER Where is she?! 
LORETTA She's right over there. 
Camera pans over to see a semi-conscious Annette as they load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and start to pull away.  Amber runs after them. 
AMBER Mommmm!  I'll be right behind you in the hearse! 
LORETTA Don't let that worry you, Annette! 
EST. SHOT - FARMINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
INT. HOSPITAL - ANNETTE'S ROOM 
A DOCTOR, Amber and Loretta stand beside Annette, who's got an I.V., bandages and her LEFT HAND wrapped and ELEVATED. 
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) So, doctor, is this sort of an unusual injury here? 
DOCTOR Oh you betcha, this was a doozy. Right now, our chief concern is to stabilize Annette, then, in surgery, remove this here. 
Removing BANDAGE to reveal BEER CAN, still held in her hand. 
AMBER Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. 
ANNETTE Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. (weak) Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY!  Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window.  Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.

{"train": "JAY ... she wanted you to have... a wonderful birthday party surrounded by all your friends. \ne glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter... \nJAY Please excuse me. \n... and hurries after them.   Marie is left dumbfounded. So close, but so far... \nMARIE Jay! What about my present? \nShe chases after him... \nINT. CLIFFORD MANSION HALLWAY - DAY \nMarie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie and the late Julie... \nMARIE Jay? H e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices. \nJAY (O.S.) It simply can't be done... \nMarie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway, and down towards Jay's study... \nJAY (O.S.) (CONT'D) In all construction there's delays. \nMarie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. What she sees makes the blood run cold in her veins... \nAn imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn of this little operation. \nMR. BARAJAS Four months is not a delay. It's a disaster. \nJAY You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the building is almost finished. Just give me a week, two tops. \nBarajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb. \nMR. BARAJAS We are long past the negotiation stage. \nCicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood stain the spotless white carpet. \nMR. BARAJAS (CONT'D) For every day the building goes unfinished, we'll take a finger... \nA sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips. \nCICATRIZ Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the eleventh day... \nAnd with that the Cuban men head to the door. Marie scrambles away, her heart pounding... \nShe's halfway down the hallway when Mr. Barajas and Cicatriz exit Jay's study. She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban 'businessmen' stare her down. J ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow. \nJAY Marie! Shouldn't you be with your friends? \nA \nMARIE I was just... \nCicatriz takes a step towards her. \nJAY (to Marie) I'll be right there. With your gift... just... wait outside, OK? \nMarie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban men... \nEXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON \nMarie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne. \nJenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost sheep with open arms. \nJENNY So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue Bay's richest bitch? \nMarie's thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine. All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of MUD in its wake. \nnd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers. \nJENNY Holy shit, who invited her? \nMarie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. Elena brings the bike to a screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. The ultimate partycrasher... \nMARIE This is a private party... \nJay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor. \nJAY Enough's enough. I think it's time you left. \nThis brings a teasing pout to Elena's lips. \nELENA Is that any way to treat Marie's new best friend? \nJay's taken aback. \nJAY You're best friends are you? \nELENA Sure. We've been having sleepovers. Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's been teaching me about shopping, I've been teaching her about giving mind blowing head... \nJay's taken aback once more. How much more aback can he be taken? He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens. \nJAY Gimme the camera back... \nElena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. Keeps the camera trained on his worried face... \nELENA Come get it. \nJay's reaching his elastic limit. He reaches for the camera, but Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera. And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor... \nELENA (slyly) Ooopppps. \nElena runs her finger under Jay's chin, then turns and walks away, leaving Jay standing there, all taken aback. \nEXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING    - NIGHT \nA drunken Marie brings her BMW to a swerving halt outside the construction site. She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on the passenger seat for dutch courage... \nMARIE (sotto) It's present time. \nShe reaches for the car door handle, but comes up short. When she looks back up she's in for some taking aback of her own... \nElena comes walking out of the building site, and the two girls lock eyes. There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a satisfied smile and walks away... \nMARIE What the hell... \nMarie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car. \nJAY What are you doing here at this time of night? \nMarie stammers to find the words... \nMARIE I just...wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. I was out of line. \nJay's mood lightens. \nJAY When we admit our mistakes we grow. You've made an important step. \nMARIE So...what about my present? \nJAY Meet me at the Museum. Before school tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep, I'm gonna finish up here... \nHe walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. MUSEUM - MORNING \nA perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun. \nMarie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels... \nJAY (O.S.) You really think you're ready for your inheritance? \nMarie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in the same clothes as yesterday... \nMARIE It was...it was what Mom wanted... \nJay looks at her sternly. \nJAY You're the only one who can open that lock, but I'm the one with the key. She wanted you to have the diamonds when you were responsible enough to know what to do with them... M MARIE I'm...responsible... \nJay shakes his head slowly, deliberately. \nMORRISON You sure you want to go through with this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk away right now.... \nKristen interjects... \nKRISTEN Please, Detective, this isn't the right time... \nELENA I ain't lying. You think I'm lying? \nKristen turns to her young ward... \nKRISTEN If you're telling the truth, you won't find a more sympathetic ear... \nELENA 'If' I'm telling the truth... \nKRISTEN And if you're not, there's gonna be trouble, you understand? \nMORRISON This is already trouble. The man you're accusing happens to be a friend of mine, and when the DNA tests prove you're lying I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks, mark my words... \nElena withers under his glare... \nINT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nJay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney. \nTHEO We're gonna sue their asses til time runs backwards... \nJAY (to Marie) You've gotta believe me, I would never, could never do anything like this, you know that don't you? \nMarie takes his hand, squeezes it. \nMARIE We're team Clifford. \nJay forces a tired smile... \nJAY That's my girl. \nThe door swings open and Morrison enters... \nMORRISON Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom... \nJay stands, shakes Morrison's hand. \nMORRISON (to Marie) Would you mind waiting outside while me and your stepdad have a little chat... \nMarie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave. \nJAY It's OK honey. Michael and I are old pals... \nReluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her. Jay sits back down. Morrison takes a chair opposite. \nJAY How's the divorce treating you? \nMORRISON She's taken me for everything I'm worth. I swear to God, I'm never trusting another woman as long as I live. T heo intervenes... \nTHEO This is most egregious, Detective, my client has pressing matters at his construction site. He can't afford to waste time with this frivolous nonsense... \nMORRISON (to Jay) Look, we're taking her statement right now, gonna run every forensic test in the book. Guarantee the case'll come apart like a $2 watch... \nJay nods, certain he can beat this rap... \nJAY She had my camcorder. Recorded what happened. It should still be at the construction site. It'll clear my name... \nMorrison nods. \nMORRISON You'll be outta here by tonight. \nINT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY \nMarie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute on her cell phone... \nMARIE (ON PHONE) I can't believe it, Jenny...It just doesn't make sense...I mean, I know Jay...I know he'd never... \nWhen a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone. Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes her and reveals...Elena. \nMARIE This can't be... \nA look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's beautiful face. Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss. \nELENA From here? \nChad goes red. Puts the plastic cup down on the desk and Elena grabs it.            C HAD If...you wouldn't mind...removing your clothes. I'll leave the room, give you some priv... \nThe breath catches in Chad's throat as Elena takes her shirt off without hesitation. Stands there in just her black bra. \nELENA Done. Next? \nChad's jaw drops. Not just because Elena's in her underwear, but because of the clear BITE MARKS on her neck and arms... \nCHAD Those are... \nELENA Bite marks. He chowed down. \nCHAD They're clear evidence markers... \nHe reaches out, grabs a Polaroid Camera from the desk, starts snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention. The FLASH of the camera fills the room... \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nFLASHBULBS explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the steps of the austere Blue Bay courthouse, surrounded by a gaggle of sound bite hungry pressmen... \nREPORTER 1 Any comment, Mr. Clifford? \nJay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses. He disappears quickly into the shelter of the courthouse. \nREPORTER 2 (to Marie) Did your stepfather rape that girl? How could he do something like that? Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng of reporters... \nMARIE Jay...is innocent... \nSays it like she means it... \nINT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nThe packed courthouse is abuzz and the elderly JUDGE WILCOX is forced to slam his gavel down... \nJUDGE WILCOX Order! \nJay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair immaculate, game face on. Theo sits beside him, scribbling notes. Marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her coiffured peers. She tries to smile stoically at Jay... \nKristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table. C had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District Attorney, steps forward. \nD.A. MEESE Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the night of the 25th? CHAD Yes they do. D.A. MEESE Do they show that it was forced? \nCHAD \nYes. There was extensive bruising and tearing. We found no semen evidence. The latex abrasions point to the use of protection. This is quite common in cases of premeditated rape. \nD.A. MEESE And what can you tell us about Miss Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor? \nCHAD Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common date rape drug. Traces were also found on the bottle of beer at the crime scene. Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's fingerprints were all over the bottle. \nJAY I took it from her. She was far too young to be drinking! \nA slam of the gavel silences Jay. \nD.A. MEESE Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's been marked as state's exhibit number 1. He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life. An EVIDENCE PHOTO that Chad took of Elena's wounds is displayed on a screen beside him. \nD.A. MEESE What does this slide show? CHAD Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous bite marks on her upper torso that occurred during the rape. \nJUDGE WILCOX What about those other markings? \nChad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots aligned in a small circle. \nCHAD I wasn't able to determine...Fingernail markings, possibly... \nJUDGE WILCOX (to Meese) Please continue. \nMarie can barely breathe... \nD.A. MEESE I'm going to show you another slide \nthat's been marked as state's exhibit number 2. \nMeese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide. The court goes dark for a second before the next slide is displayed...It's a close up of Jay's teeth mouldings compared to \nthe bite marks... \nJAY You had your chance. (to Marie) If we're gonna win at all costs, we're gonna have to change the game. (to Theo) Do you have it? \nTheo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a KEY. \nTHEO I'm still dead set against this, Jay. \nJAY I couldn't care less. \nMARIE What's the key for? \nJAY The diamonds...If that's what it takes, then that's what it takes... \nMARIE But...they're my inheritance... \nJAY All my assets are tied up in the condos, Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make her testify that she faked the tape, faked the evidence. \nMARIE But, Jay...they're my diamonds... \nJAY As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have them back. I swear. I know people, who can...persuade her to hand them over... \nMarie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay, uncertain what to say. \nMARIE I t's wrong. \nJAY More wrong than what she's doing to us? We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm not guilty. You know I could never do anything like this. So do the right thing and get me out of this hellhole... \nMarie's cracking... \nMARIE I can't... \nJAY (tenderly) No such word as 'can't.' Please... \nThe tears well in her eyes. \nINT. MUSEUM - NIGHT \nThe key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother Daughter diamonds. The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems... \nThe Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully watching his prize exhibit being removed. \nCURATOR I knew the day would come, still doesn't make it any easier... \nMarie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds, carefully takes them from the case. \nCURATOR The offer still stands, Marie. If you ever decide to sell them, please give us a first chance... \nMarie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her. \nMARIE I don't think I'll be able to, I'm sorry... \nShe scampers towards the door, past the security guards. \nCURATOR (sotto) Me too... \nEXT. THE GATOR TRAILER PARK - NIGHT \nTheo's SUV drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the 'GATOR' trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting trailer. Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the mud. Marie reluctantly steps out of the car... \nA blinding PORCH LIGHT flicks on. Theo and Marie spin round, squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer doorway...           E LENA Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in... (to Theo) DA know you're here? \nTheo squirms... \nMARIE We need to talk. \nELENA So talk. \nTHEO Somewhere private, maybe? \nINT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nAn elderly man, UNCLE MARTY, in a sweat-stained T-shirt and ratty underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of WHISKY hanging from one limp hand... \nTheo freezes when he sees him... \nTHEO Who's this? \nELENA Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out til morning. \nTheo's balls shrink instantly. \nTHEO What...did you just say? \nELENA He didn't just sexually assault me. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone... T he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise. \nTHEO Isn't it true that you were inebriated during the assault, that it may not in fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone? \nA smirking Meese doesn't even bother to stand up. \nD.A. MEESE Objection. Leading the witness. \nJUDGE WILCOX Sustained. Council will please rephrase the question. \nTheo's stumped. His eyes plead with Elena to take the ball and run with it. She does. Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone. \nELENA I was messed up, alright. In fact, only two things I remember. One was that bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that Goddamn video camera while he violated me. The other was what he whispered in my ear, right before I blacked out... \nShe pauses, for emphasis. Judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the town of Blue Bay, the state of Florida hangs on her every word... \nELENA He said, \"You won't remember, but you'll never forget.\" \nThat's it. The court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along with the veins in Jay's head. \nKristen's reeling from shock... \nKRISTEN (to Morrison) What did she just say? \nMarie leaps to her feet, screams... \nMARIE Lying bitch! \nMarie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to claw Elena's tear stained eyes out... \nINT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT \nA small Television blares out today's top story... \nACTION NEWS ANCHOR The young victim's wrenching testimonial proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Jay Clifford. It took less than an hour for the jury to deliberate and sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years. T V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs... \nJAY (ON TV) You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU CAN'T! \nCLICK. The TV turns off. Marie sits huddled in Jay's unfinished concrete building site office, staring at the darkened television set. Mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face. \nMARIE (mumbling) No such thing as can't... \nShe lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it smashes on the concrete floor. Strangely the dregs of the champagne start running down the floor... \nMarie's heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the rustling of plastic from outside the office. \nMARIE Who's there? \nNo answer. She steels herself, gets shakily to her feet, stumbling drunkenly toward the door... \nEXT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nKristen stands in the darkened doorway of Elena's less-than- welcoming trailer. She knocks. \nKRISTEN Elena. Open up. \nNo answer. She tries the door handle. It's unlocked. She takes a deep breath, steps inside. \nINT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nKristen flips on a light switch. The room is illuminated for a split second before the bulb surges and burns out, leaving Kristen in the near-darkness... \nKRISTEN Elena?   Hello? \nShe takes out a FLASHLIGHT, creeps through the front room, stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus. \nThe beam of light finds a small BLUE PILL nestled in the carpeting. Kristen picks it up, slides it into her pocket... \nINT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT \nMarie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor, past the crime scene tape. In the dim light, her eyes dart to every corner, every shadow. S he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged into darkness. Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS switch on, filling the room with black light. \nAnd with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly turns, coming face to face with... \nKRISTEN Once a thief, always a thief... \nThey suddenly freeze as the front door swings open, the blood running cold in their veins as Uncle Marty stumbles inside. They hold their breath, praying he doesn't see them, standing in Elena's doorway. Uncle Marty just mumbles something incoherent and collapses face first onto the couch, out like a light... \nINT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT \nChad reaches into an evidence bag filled with BLUE PILLS. He removes three... \nCHAD Little blue pills. One of the perks of the job. \nLaughter as   the girl's accept the roofies, swallowing them like candy. Chad   gulps down the third as Elena begins to run her hands up and down   Marie's back and shoulders. Chad's hands are all over Marie as he   helps slip off her bra. \nElena's lips move hungrily across Chad's face, until they find his mouth. They kiss deeply. \nhen they pull apart, Chad helps Elena pull off her T-top, as Marie runs her hands up and down Elena's bare back. Elena turns back to her with a mischievous grin. \nELENA You won't remember... \nMARIE But you'll never forget. \nDamn straight. \nEXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY \nThe early morning sun illuminates a massive slab of windowless concrete surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of nowhere... \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - MORNING \nJay takes a seat on an uncomfortable metal chair in front of bullet-proof glass. He's half the man he used to be, broken, trembling, smoking like a chimney. His mind's still a steel trap, just one that's rusted shut. He picks up the TWO-WAY PHONE... \nTHEO (into phone) Mr. Clifford, this is Kristen Richards, Elena Sandoval's probation officer. \nJAY She want to pin me for some more crimes? \nKristen takes the phone from Theo. \nKRISTEN No, Mr. Clifford. I just have a few questions. I've noticed some inconsistencies... \nJAY You've noticed some inconsistencies? \nJAY Here's one big fucking glaring inconsistency for you: I was set up! \nKRISTEN Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why were you set up? What would Elena Sandoval have gained from all this? \nJay hesitates, unsure how, or if, to proceed. Theo shifts nervously. Jay gives J up. \nAY What the hell. I'm already in jail. How much worse can it get? I paid her off, okay? My assets were tied up in the condos so we used Marie's diamonds. defensive) It wasn't like I had a choice. She had me by the short an' curlies, understand? \nKRISTEN But Elena's testimony was damning. Why wouldn't she play ball? \nJAY What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? How the fuck should I know? Manipulative little skank probably figured she could bleed me for some more money down the road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm gonna get those diamonds back, make her wish she was never born. \nKristen's mind is racing, trying to piece together the puzzle. \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nElena's airboat blasts through the reeds out into the middle of nowhere. She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a VIDEO TAPE marked \"BLUE BAY DIVING MEET/MARIE'S BIRTHDAY\", looks them over one last time... \nELENA Later potato... \nAnd tosses them into the mire, where they're soon gobbled by ravenous Gators... \nEXT. GATOR TRAILER PARK - MORNING \nElena glides her airboat to a stop on the muddy banks of the trailer park, stomps over to her trailer, when she sees... \nTwo sets of tire tracks in the mud. \nINT. ELENA'S TRAILER - MORNING \nElena stands in her bedroom, disbelief washing over her. No sign of the newspaper articles. Her walls are barren. E LENA (sotto) Oh shit... \nEXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - DAY \nThe diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to practice. Lagging behind is Marie. She's about to catch up when she runs smack dab into a panicked Elena. \nMARIE What the...If anyone sees us together... \nKRISTEN You're 18. That's heiress payday, no? Must've crossed your mind that Jay might never let you have them... \nMARIE No, of course not. \nShe's a bad liar. \nKRISTEN And then this little scam artist saunters in and just takes them. With your help, no less. \nKristen moves in for the kill. \nKRISTEN But what I don't get is, why wouldn't Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name? After all, she'd gotten what she wanted. \nMARIE How should I know? \nMarie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the ring against the back of her hand. Hard. Winces, then... \nKRISTEN I mean, the only way I can make sense of it is if somehow getting Jay released from prison would spoil the plan. \nMARIE What plan? \nShe hands the ring back to Marie. Not so lucky anymore... \nKRISTEN You tell me... I INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY \nChad strolls gingerly down the hallway, opens the door to the forensics lab, freezing when he sees... \nINT. BLUE BAY PD FORENSICS - DAY \nKristen, waiting patiently for him. \nCHAD Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something I can do for you? \nKRISTEN I was wondering if you'd do me the favor of running a quick test. \nCHAD Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me? \nShe hands him the Blue Pill she found in Elena's trailer. \nKRISTEN Could you tell me what this is? \nChad tries to keep his cool. \nCHAD No problemo. It'll only take a minute. \nWhile Chad goes about his work, Kristen begins nosing around the office. Chad looks over his shoulder. \nCHAD Be careful, I got lots of evidence here. \nShe starts flipping through EVIDENCE PHOTOS... \nKRISTEN Are these the evidence photos from the Elena Sandoval rape? \nCHAD They are, but... \nKRISTEN Ever find out what caused these markings? \nShe holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the Judge questioned Chad about in court... \nCHAD Like I told the Judge, I guess they're finger nail markings... \nKRISTEN They don't look like finger nail markings to me. They look more like this... \nShe holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the indentation with Marie's ring. \nKRISTEN Would you say these markings are the same? \nCHAD W-where did you get that? \nKristen smiles. \nKRISTEN Marie gave it to me. But you already knew that, didn't you, Doc? \nChad has no answer to that. He can only blink stupidly and pray his silence doesn't incriminate him further. Kristen heads for the door... \nCHAD (calling after) The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies. \nKRISTEN Been there. Done that. \nMARIE No, I mean he really fucked us. He drugged me an' took the diamonds! \nEXT. SWAMPS - MORNING \nElena stands on the edge of the airboat, fear rising in her. \nELENA ell me you're kidding... \nMARIE (V.O.) Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the diamonds! \nElena lets out an anguished wail. \nMARIE (V.O.) Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as it is. \nELENA We've gotta stop him. \nINT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - MORNING \nMarie's fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock. 7:30. Finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface. \nMARIE He's heading to the museum, got himself an 8am meeting... \nELENA (V.O.) He's gonna sell the diamonds... \nMARIE Not if we find him first... \nEXT. EVERGLADES - DAY \nThe deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass, speeding across the endless swampland expanse. Elena expertly maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair... \nEXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY \nChad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty DAEWOO bangs down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees. Every hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then cuts back into the trees. C had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him. He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the trees. That wasn't...it couldn't be, could it? \nThe winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst fears come true...Elena's racing along side of him in the AIRBOAT, fighting to keep up... \nELENA Pull over! \nINT. CHAD'S CAR - DAY \nThe road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him, matching his speed. \nELENA Give us back the diamonds! \nChad's heart stops. \nCHAD Us? \nHe spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT HIM! \nCHAD FUCKING HELL! \nHe yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches... \nINT. MARIE'S BMW - CONTINUOUS \nMarie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on the dirt road. She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying Melaluca trees. No sign of Chad's car... \nEXT. SWAMPSIDE - CONTINUOUS \nElena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the reeds and clambers up to the dirt road. There's no sign of Chad's car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed through... \nMarie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand... \nELENA (sternly) We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We just get the diamonds back... \nMARIE I 'm not gonna hurt him. No way... \nMarie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road... \nMARIE I'm gonna kill him. \nElena's breath catches in her throat. Marie disappears into the trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road... \nELENA Marie! Don't do this... \nShe hears a scream, a girl's scream... \nELENA This can't be happening... \nMarie slows, looks back to Elena. \nMARIE What now? \nELENA I'm more than five miles away from the Police station. I go beyond five miles and the alarm goes off... \nMarie snarls... \nMARIE You telling me your Parole Officer knows you're out here? \nElena can barely speak... \nELENA She knows... \nEXT. SWAMP - DAY \nChad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds. Sweat cascades from his brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body swirl in the stagnant waters... \nMost gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right leg. As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve energy goes. He collapses in the stagnant marsh. \nNot far off, GATORS circle. It's only a matter of time before they notice the blood in the water. \nEXT. EVERGLADES - DAY \nThe small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland. Elena steps into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED. \nELENA Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or she'll find us here... \nA splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls... \nMARIE You hear that? \nThe sound echoes off the dense trees. Marie points left. \nMARIE You go that way... \nMarie heads off in the opposite direction. Elena hesitates, wants to follow, but does as she's told, and goes left, soon enveloped by canopy of trees... \nINT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY \nKristen blasts down the Blue Bay streets, a siren in the windshield blaring... \nThe handheld GPS continues to monitor Elena's exact position in the midst of the swamp... E EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY \nElena stumbles through the thick, stagnant water, scouring the horizon for any sign of Chad... \nELENA (sotto) Please... \nA rustling sound stops her in her tracks. Dead silence, until... \nA HAND GRABS HER LEG, AROUND THE FLASHING ANKLE BRACELET, DRAGS HER DOWN INTO THE SWAMP... \nEXT. EVERGLADES CLEARING - DAY \nMarie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire iron, like a Prada clad big-game hunter... \nMARIE (calling out to Elena) You see him? \nNo reply, just her own voice echoing back... \nMARIE Elena? \nShe rolls her eyes. \nMARIE Useless bitch... \nEXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY \nKristen's unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road. \nINT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY \nShe checks the flashing GPS signal. Getting closer... \nEXT. EVERGLADES - DAY \nThe Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds. Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her, shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt... \nCURATOR Marie? Are you alright? \nMARIE Never better. Got the money? \nThe Curator nods nervously. \nCURATOR I convinced the board of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding... \nMARIE Good. S he fishes in her bag for the diamonds... \nCURATOR I...I received a call from your 'associate'. He said he would be handling the transaction. \nMARIE Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied up at work. Completely swamped... \nThe Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further... \nMarie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag, thrusts them at the Curator. He screws up his wrinkled face, afraid to touch them... \nMARIE Calm down. It's just blood. \nEXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nWith trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car. She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground... \nShe carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match... \nShe can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in fear... \nFinally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until, finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out... \nELENA Don't do this to me, please... \nIn frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her. \nElena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove compartment. \nELENA You gotta have a lighter or some... \nShe's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT! \nDeafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. Elena's heart skips a beat. Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the steering wheel. \nELENA Jesus... \nShe struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the horn... S ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the driver's side door... \nELENA I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... \nNot as sorry as she's going to be... \nThe match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to smoulder for a second, then REIGNITES! \nINT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON \nThe Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and over in his hands. Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her muddy shoe on the marble floor... \nMARIE So? \nCURATOR I...I'm not sure... \nMARIE Can you get the cash or not? \nThe Curator looks up to her, bemused. \nCURATOR I can get the cash...it's just... \nMarie smiles a wicked grin. \nMARIE Then let's have those dead presidents... \nEXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nThe discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car... \nINSIDE THE CAR \nINT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT \nElena sits with her head in her hands, across from Kristen in an anonymous interview room. \nKRISTEN I told you. \nElena looks up, tears streaking her mascara. \nELENA Told me what? \nKRISTEN That if you were telling the truth I'd back you all the way. If you lied to me there'd be trouble... \nElena slumps back down, her head on the table. \nELENA Chad swerved off the road, I swear... \nKRISTEN Just swerved for no reason. Just decided to take a shortcut through the swamp? \nElena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye. \nELENA It was an accident... \nThe door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands... \nMORRISON Accident my ass. \nHe flips the pages of the report... \nMORRISON Forensics finds the head trauma that killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a single blow from behind. E lena looks up, through Panda eyes... \nELENA The crash. He...he hit his head... \nMORRISON Was that before or after you dragged him through the swamp? \nElena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt, snaps them on Elena's wrists. \nMORRISON You got the right to remain silent, which in your case is probably best, cos of the shit you come up with... \nKristen stands up, shaking her head. \nKRISTEN That's two strikes, Elena. One more and you're out. \nElena looks at her pleadingly. \nELENA I'll do whatever you want. \nKristen stops. Thinks for a moment. Nods to Morrison as he drags Elena to her feet. \nKRISTEN Yeah. Yeah you will. \nELENA I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you what happened. She killed him, and took the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie Clifford... \nMorrison just sneers. \nMORRISON Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the Judge. I think its time he heard the truth about Jay Clifford's accuser. \nKRISTEN Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be cleared, you know that. You need Marie, you need the proof they set him up... \nMorrison considers this. \nKRISTEN You came so close to nailing the Black Widow, don't let this slip through your fingers, Detective... \nHe's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings. Kristen takes it from Elena, looks at the CALLER ID, sees Marie's name... \nKRISTEN Speak of the Devil... \nShe holds the phone up. \nKRISTEN You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna say that everything went fine. No one found Chad's body. The plan's still on. Do you understand me? \nElena nods slowly. Morrison turns to Kristen. \nMORRISON You thinking what I'm thinking? K risten's patient with him. \nKRISTEN This is your chance. Feds can't take this one from you... \nMorrison weighs his options, then finally nods. \nElena adjusts the mic taped to her chest, wincing as the tape pulls her delicate skin. \nELENA I..don't think I can do this... \nMARIE (O.S.) It's already done. \nElena looks up guiltily. Marie is standing by the side of the pool. How much did she see? \nMARIE So? \nThe word's stick in Elena's throat... \nELENA I had no choice... \nMARIE Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead. Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it out. \nELENA Jay's got cash. At the building site. I saw it. \nMarie rolls her eyes. \nMARIE That's your brilliant plan? It's in a safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have you got magic fingers, gonna pick that lock? I don't think so. Next. \nINT. MORRISON'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nKristen winces as she listens to the girls' conversation. E LENA (V.O.) (through the speakers) We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we did. \nMARIE (V.O.) Like hell we are. \nEXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS \nElena walks down the bleachers, approaching a skeptical Marie. \nELENA Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him we'll come clean, tell the police everything, if he gives us the combination. I'm still a minor, they'll send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do that time standing on my head... \nMarie's wavering. \nMARIE How much money? \nElena reaches Marie, puts her hands on her hips. \nELENA Enough for you and me. \nGrinds against her. Slowly, sensually. \nMARIE We don't have to tell the cops anything. We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking. \nELENA But, we got rid of the real one... \nMARIE I kept a copy. Never trusted you backstabbers. \nElena tries to pull away, but Marie drags her back until their faces are inches apart. \nMARIE You're trembling. \nThere's no denying it. Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's face, down her neck, to her chest. So close to the wire. Finally places her palm over Elena's heart... \nELENA Marie, I... \nMARIE Ssshhhh... \nBOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM... \nINT. MORRISON'S CAR - NIGHT \nMorrison and Kristen listen intently in their headphones, unable to breath... \nEXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS \nElena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity, unblinking... B OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM... \nFinally Marie smiles... \nMARIE Alright. Let's do it... \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT \nJay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by an inch of bullet proof glass. Theo stands by the door. \nELENA We'll never get away with this. You know that don't you? \nMarie steps on the gas. She ain't saying a word, and time's running out for Elena... \nINT. MORRISON'S POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nMorrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving. Kristen stays focused on the one-sided conversation in her headphones... \nKRISTEN Come on, Elena...Keep pushing... \nEXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT \nMarie's BMW screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos, and Marie strides towards the construction site entrance. \nElena gets out the car, feeling decidedly sick. She circuitously adjusts the microphone taped to her chest, then follows Marie into the dark, unfinished building \nINT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMarie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey, heading straight for the safe. With a rock steady hand, she works the lock...CLICK... \nMARIE One down... \nEXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - NIGHT \nMorrison brings his clunky Police sedan to a halt around the back of the building site. I INT. MORRISON'S CAR - NIGHT \nKristen listens intently to the live feed. \nELENA (V.O.) (over headphones) Marie! Please, I can't do this... \nINT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMarie's working the safe combination like a master thief, spinning it nimbly between her buffed nails. CLICK... \nMARIE Two down. \nElena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips. \nELENA I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it to the police. \nMarie doesn't even look round, concentrating on the job at hand. Elena's reeling. \nELENA I'll tell 'em you made me lie about your stepfather raping me, made me perjure myself on the stand, went and killed Chad, and now... \nMARIE (sotto) 99. A very good year... \nCLICK. Third and final tumbler falls. The safe door swings open, revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN... \nINT. MORRISON'S CAR - NIGHT \nKristen shakes her head. It's hopeless, Elena can't get Marie to say an incriminating word... \nMORRISON This has gotta end. \nKRISTEN It's gonna end. One way or another... \nINT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMarie pulls out a wad of crisp, clean bills, draws them across her nose like a wine connoisseur. \nMARIE Money. Always in style. \nShe dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face. \nELENA Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die? \nMarie slides up against Elena, fluttering the cash over her in the world's most expensive shower. Elena couldn't be less interested, focused on getting that confession... \nELENA You killed him, Marie. You murdered him in cold blood... \nMarie presses up against Elena, pushing her up against the unfinished dry wall. Kisses her passionately, finally silencing her for a few, brief, electric seconds. And when she pulls away her fingers dance down Elena's shirt until... S he rips the microphone from Elena's chest. Stands there with the dangling cord in her hands, her face caught in a permanent snarl. The blood drains from Elena's face... \nINT. MORRISON'S POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nA piercing feedback forces Kristen to throw aside the headphones. She looks to Morrison. \nKRISTEN She's been made... \nKRISTEN (O.S.) Just got off the phone with the Parole board... \nMorrison turns around, sees Kristen approaching, still visibly shaken. \nK \nKRISTEN They want me to bring Elena back to Miami in the morning. \nShe hesitates... \nKRISTEN I'm... sorry for this whole mess. \nMorrison considers this, picks his words carefully. \nMORRISON Don't be. It was my gun that fired the shots, so it must've been me who pulled the trigger. I'll take the credit on this one. After all the Black widow crap I had to put up with, I've earnt it... \nKristen nods. \nKRISTEN You did the right thing... \nMORRISON We did the right thing. \nristen smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the Detective. He closes his eyes, savors the moment. As she pulls away, she hands him a card. K RISTEN You call me, promise? \nMorrison beams. \nMORRISON I will. I will. \nKRISTEN Now that this is all over, maybe we can have that drink soon... \nShe leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips. Morrison watches her walk away. In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nEXT. COUNTY JAIL - MORNING \nMorrison's unmarked Sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of the County Jail. The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight. \nMorrison gets out of the car, meets Jay. \nMORRISON How you holdin' up, Jay? \nJAY Been better. \nHe sure has. \nMORRISON So what's next? \nJAY No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed. Guess there's nowhere to go but up. \nIt's all he can do to keep from breaking down. \nMORRISON I can't help but feel partially responsible. If there's anything I... \nJay shakes his head. \nJAY I don't think so, but thanks. \nMORRISON Can I at least give you a ride somewhere? \nJAY Ain't got nowhere to go... \nMorrison watches sadly as Jay stumbles past him, walking to nowhere in particular. \nMORRISON (hopeful) ... but up, right? \nNo reply. \nThe Detective heads back to his car, stops for a second, reaches into his pocket and pulls out Kristen's already-dog eared card. He can't resist. Dials the number After four rings there's no message. Just a BEEP. \nMORRISON (into phone) Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't heard from you. Hope you're doing okay. Everything's fine here. \nMORRISON(CONT'D) Haven't been any questions asked that I can't answer, an' no one's brought your name up. So give me a call back and maybe we can go for that drink... H e's cut off by... \nRECORDED VOICE BEEP. The mail box you are trying to reach is full. Your message has been deleted. \nMorrison's disconnected. Puzzled, he gets into his car. \nAt her side is a PAPER SHREDDER, and between sips from a pi\u00f1a colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped BLACK WIDOW EVIDENCE in red ink... \nKristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching bikini. \nKRISTEN I can't believe Morrison just handed me the key to the evidence locker... \nA broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the contents of a velvet pouch onto a table. T he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight. \nKRISTEN These are...genuine? \nElena nods. \nELENA Nothin' like the real thing. Switched 'em for the fakes right after Marie tried to pay me off... \nKRISTEN They're...So beautiful. \nElena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen. \nELENA The mother. \nKristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena. \nKRISTEN The daughter. \nINT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY \nMorrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end. Dammers stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look etched across his face. \nMORRISON She was the Black Widow. Her and that little... \nHe tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena. Can't come up with anything, continues pacing frantically. \nMORRISON Played me like a fool. \nDammers shrugs. \nDAMMERS Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard on yourself, Morrison... (beat, smile) That's my job. \nMORRISON You smug son of a bitch. It's not like you knew who she was anymore than I did. \nDammers nods slowly. \nDAMMERS That's the God's honest truth. But at least I didn't give her my evidence locker keycard. \nDAMMERS(CONT'D) And I didn't lie about who fired the shots that killed the Clifford kid. \nMorrison's heart sinks. He looks like he's going to faint. Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago... \nEXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY \nDammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car. They pass MR. Barajas and Cicatriz. Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood... \nMR. BARAJAS Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer! \nMorrison stops, regards Barajas... \nMORRISON What did you say? \nCICATRIZ The foundation is sinking. The entire site is a sink hole. It's completely worthless. \nMR. BARAJAS I'm going to kill Jay Clifford... \nMORRISON You and me both... \nEXT. PARADISE - DAY \nElena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the sun, when a voice rouses them... \nJAY (O.S.) Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do that to a friend. Especially one going through such a nasty divorce. \nThey look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini... \nJAY Told me he'd never trust another woman as long as he lived. And then along came a spider... \nKRISTEN A black widow. \nJay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink. \nKRISTEN Let's go get our money. \nThey gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson red... \nTHE END \nAs the credits roll.... \nINT. OFFICE - MORNING \nAn anonymous, luxurious office. A fat, balding, semi-conscious MAN lies curled up on the floor as Elena, half undressed and wearing a black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse... \nThere's a crackle on her WALKIE-TALKIE... \nKRISTEN (V.O.) We got problems... \nFrom outside, she can hear the wailing of SIRENS. Getting closer. \nELENA Almost done here. \nKRISTEN (V.O.) Leave it. Come on! \nElena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her pocket for good measure. \nKRISTEN (V.O.) He gonna be able to make an ID? \nElena glances at the Man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over like a jelly donut. \nELENA Not on your life. I gave him enough roofies to make an elephant forget. \nEXT. OFFICE - MORNING \nElena gets into a waiting car outside the bank. The getaway driver...Kristen, of course... \nELENA I can't believe we just gave up all that cash. \nKRISTEN Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got an angle on our real prey. \nELENA We goin' to Blue Bay? \nKRISTEN He won't know what hit him. \nA smile crosses Elena's perfect lips... \nELENA 'bout time... \nAnd the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank. \nINT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - JAY'S OFFICE - DAY \nJay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his unfinished office. \nKRISTEN (O.S.) That's an awful lot of money... \nJay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him. \nJAY Who the hell... \nKRISTEN Not enough though. Gonna need those Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this disaster... \nJAY What? What the hell do you mean? \nKristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of marbles. Throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards B Jay... \nut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the concrete floor... \nKRISTEN The building's built on a sink hole, Jay. You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans off your back... \nJay's tiny mind can't take it all in. \nJAY How'd you...how'd you know all this... \nKRISTEN It's what we do. \nJAY We? \nElena walks seductively into the unfinished office. It's on. \n", "test1_input": "WILD THINGS: DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH \nWritten by \nAndy Hurst & Ross Helford \nINT. MUSEUM - DAY \nA perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun. \nTounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL. \nThe stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds... \nShe reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling her BABY DAUGHTER... \nMARIE Today's the day, Mom... \nCURATOR (O.S.) You here again, Marie? \nMarie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing behind her. \nMARIE Just leaving. \nMarie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case... \n'THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS...' \nEXT.

The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds fluttering skywards... \nCREDITS appear over... \nARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway, Marie's BMW streaking through the endless tract of Florida wetlands. In the water, GATORS, warm themselves in the early morning sun... \nMOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening AIRBOATS... \nThrough thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club. \nMarie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue Bay High School. \nINT. MARIE'S BMW - MORNING \nMarie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when... \nSCCCREEEECCCHHHH! \nShe SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car. Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt. \nShe sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from the front bumper of the BMW. \nThe sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster rambles on... \nRADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.) ... operation, aimed at finally capturing the Black Widow suspect after a six month trail of embezzlement and fraud, once again failed to snare its subject. \nELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me clothes. \nRADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING \nThe auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back. \nMarie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still shocked by what happened out in the parking lot... \nJENNY (handing over a present) Happy birthday, babe. They ain't diamonds, but you're just gonna have to wait for those... \n", "test1_true": "MARIE (unconvincing) Thank you. Thank you so much... \nJENNY Are you OK, hon? \nMarie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the Goddess she is... \nMARIE I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's just...that new girl...I almost hit her in the parking lot... \nJENNY You mean the towel girl, the one who transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You know the only reason she's slinging towels is 'cos it's court ordered... \nMarie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage. \nMOSSTER We're here today to address a growing epidemic that affects all of you. \nHe pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down... \nMOSSTER National studies report sexual activity among students at an all-time high. \nThe students all cheer, naturally. \nMOSSTER We'll see who's cheering when you've got an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or get slapped with a paternity suit...Or arrested for date rape. But don't take my word for it... \nHe motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome... \nPRINCIPAL MOSSTER Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to tell you about the pitfalls first hand... \nKristen steps up to the lectern. \nKRISTEN Good morning, my name is Kristen Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami juvenile parole board, as some of you already know... \nQuick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes... \nKRISTEN But that's not what brings me here today. When I heard about Principal Mosster's sex education program I thought I'd volunteer my own personal story, in hopes that you might learn from the mistakes I made. Back in High school all I wanted to do was get drunk, stoned and laid... \nThe students roar their approval. \nKRISTEN By my junior year, my life was a blur of cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every night of the week... \nElena covers her mouth, as if to cough... \nELENA (through fake coughs) ...whore... \nKristen ignores the slur. \nKRISTEN And then, one night at some pathetic frat party, someone slipped a roofie in my drink...and raped me. \nThis quiets the auditorium. \nKRISTEN There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't crawl when I think of the violation and humiliation I endured. I can promise you that if you make the same kind of wrong- headed choices I did, you'll be seeing Dr. Borman... \nChad steps to the podium. \nCHAD Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr. Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at the police department, where my work has helped convict hundreds of sex offenders. Most teens like Ms. Richards never get their lives together. The physical scars may go away, but the emotional damage stays forever. \nWhile Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet locked around one of her ankles. \nMUDDY That's not...what I think it is, is it? \nELENA Whattchya think it is, bitch? \nThe words catch in his throat. \nMUDDY One of them...Parole leashes... \nELENA Bingo. \nMUDDY So you can't, like, go more than ten miles from the cop shop? \nElena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet. \nELENA Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch. \nBack at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words resonate with the student body. \nCHAD And as for the perpetrators of this heinous act, even if you are still a minor, you will be tried as an adult, and, if convicted, you will do hard time. \nHe pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students. \n", "test1_id": 1824, "test2_input": "CHAD Are there any questions? \nELENA (calling out) Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards. \nKRISTEN Ask away. \nELENA When they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity, you sued his sorry ass, right? \nKristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth... \nKRISTEN Uh, no, actually, I was never able to make a positive ID. All I remember was his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in my ear, \"You won't remember, but you'll never forget...\" \nElena cracks a sideways grin... \nELENA So what you're really saying is you fucked for free... \nKristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to control the situation... \nPRINCIPAL MOSSTER Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young lady! \nLike Elena cares.   She leans back, nods. Job done. \nEXT. BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL - DAY \nThe bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full swing... \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Blue Bay High School would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri-county region... \nBreathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area. \nBut all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches... \nAnd as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white bathing suit. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) First up, district champion Marie Clifford... \nThe crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder... \nJAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front row of the bleachers... \nJAY C'mon now baby, you can do it... \nMarie just rolls her eyes. \nJENNY Your stepfather's just got a lot invested in the team. \nMarie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him... \nJAY (to Marie) Just try to keep those legs together. \nELENA (O.S.) Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen Virgin. \nJay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with the world's hottest towel girl... \nJAY Excuse me? \nELENA You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in Clifford construction? \nJAY I am, yes, but... \nELENA I'd love to see one of your erections... \nWhoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into the air. \nIt's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with her teammates before crossing to Jay. \nJAY Nice take off, gotta work on the landing... \nMARIE I can't do any better... \nJay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately. \nJAY No such word as 'can't. Now do it again. Only better... \nMarie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel... \nELENA Bet you choke. \n", "test2_true": "MARIE What's your major malfunction? \nELENA Just wanted to make a wager. Between best friends. \nMarie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform. \nELENA You blow this dive, I get those diamonds of yours. \nMarie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the ladder, shakes her head... \nMARIE How'd you know about my inheritance? \nELENA Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's the day, right? \nMARIE And what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when I win? \nElena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile. \nELENA I'll stay away from your stepfather. You make it, I won't be your new stepmom anytime soon. Whattya say? \nMarie just stands there incredulous for a moment. \nMARIE Take your sorry ass back to the swamps. \nShe ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind... \nELENA Choke! \nMarie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below, walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him... \nMarie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop looming beyond... \nShe slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond... \nShe throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne... \nShe twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion. \nAnd as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash. \nMarie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers... \nEXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON \nSickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion... \nBanners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non- alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland... \nMarie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her. J ENNY What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that one judge only gave you a 9.7? \nMarie forces a smile. \nMARIE Nah. I'm cool. \nJENNY Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe. You got diamonds on the mind. \nJAY (O.S.) Have either of you seen my video camera? \nMarie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to Jay's face. \nJAY I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure... \nHe shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers... \nJAY Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday. \nEveryone raises their fine crystal. \nH \nJAY She's become every inch of the woman her Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is now, Julie's looking down and smiling. \nTears well in Marie's eyes... \nJAY And that's why, on your eighteenth birthday, Marie, I know your mother wanted you to have... \nHe notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words... \n", "test2_id": 1825, "test3_input": "Marie surfaces, reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the pool, before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers, an electronic ankle bracelet locked around one leg. \nELENA Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing... \nMarie's blood boils. \nMARIE What the hell are you doing here? \nElena just reaches down and picks up Marie's unfinished ring. \nELENA Looks like your bling ain't blinging... \nMARIE Give me that back. It was my Mother's... \nMarie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena... \nELENA Looks like she got ripped off Princess, where's the rock? \nMarie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger. \nMARIE Is that what this is all about? \nElena reaches out, tries to stroke the wet hair off Marie's face. She recoils before she'll let Elena touch her... \nELENA You're not a dumb as you look... J enny, followed by the rest of the diving team, come marching out of the locker room and see the two arch-enemies confronting each other. \nJENNY (to her team mates) We got trouble... \nElena won't back down. \nMARIE You're ruining my life, and my stepfather's. \nELENA It can end. Just like that. \nShe snaps her fingers and Marie's on the verge of tears... \nJenny and the rest of the diving team approach, stand behind Marie, a seething mass of bikini-clad mindless hate... \nMARIE Why are you doing this? \nELENA Because I can. \nAs she turns and walks away... \nELENA (CONT'D) Good luck in court. \nINT. BLUE BAY COURTROOM - DAY \nThe usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the small courtroom. \nMarie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her stepfather at the defendant's table. Gone is the immaculate suit, the perfect hair, the poker face. He's looking worried now... \nTheo paces in front of Marie, running her through a series of well- rehearsed questions. \nTHEO And why did you go to your stepfather's building site that night, Miss Clifford? \nMARIE It was my birthday. Jay left the party before giving me my present. \nTHEO And you say you saw Miss Sandoval leaving? \nMarie takes a moment, looks to Elena at the Prosecution table. \nMARIE I did. \nTHEO And how would you describe her appearance? \nMARIE She was...she looked fine. She smiled at me. Actually smiled... \nTHEO No further questions. \nHe takes a seat next to Jay, whispers in his ear. D.A. Meese starts his cross-examination. \nD.A. MEESE Would it be fair to say you don't like Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford? M MARIE We don't see...eye to eye... \nD.A. MEESE Is that why you attacked her at your party earlier that night? \nMarie squirms. \n", "test3_true": "D.A. MEESE You'd had a few drinks, correct? \nMARIE (reluctantly) I'd had a drink. Yes. \nD.A. MEESE So by the time you allege to have seen Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court exactly how much you'd had to drink? \nMARIE A glass of Champagne. Or two, but... \nD.A. MEESE No further questions. \nJay sinks a few inches lower in his seat. Going down... \nINT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - DAY \nA bleary eyed Chad sits in front of a bank of monitors, working the image enhancement equipment, fighting to get a watchable picture from the fuzzy static in front of him. Kristen sits behind him, fighting to stay awake. \nCHAD (to himself) Take out the chroma, raise the luminescence... \nHe clumsily reaches over the control panel, hitting almost every button on the way. And that does the trick... \nSuddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear. Kristen's eyes snap open. \nKRISTEN H oly shit... \nThe pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV... \nKRISTEN (CONT'D) Call Detective Morrison. Now... \nSCENE OMITTED \nINT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS- DAY \nThe shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV. Soon enough though her smile fades... \nELENA (ON TAPE) You're kidding right? \nJay's voice can be heard behind the camera... \nJAY (O.S. ON TAPE) C'mon now baby, you can do it... \nThe video shows Elena cowering... \nELENA (ON TAPE) Please...you can't do this... \nJAY (O.S ON TAPE) No such word as can't... \nA hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs Elena, throws her violently against a concrete wall. \nJAY (O.S. ON TAPE) Fuck me... \nA flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus. When the camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall and she's sobbing... E \nLENA (ON TAPE) Please, Mr. Clifford, don't... \nJAY (O.S ON TAPE) Just try to keep those legs together... \nAnd then static... \nPulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom, \ncompletely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all staring in shock at the blank TV screen... \nD.A. MEESE If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to rape, the state is prepared to drop the \ncharges of kidnapping and assault. \nJUDGE WILCOX \n(to Jay) If I were you I would seriously consider the offer. INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY \nIn the cold stone jail visiting room, Jay sits behind the wire mesh, an emotion Marie and Theo opposite. The PRISON GUARD waits by the barred door, keeping his beady eyes on Jay. \nJAY I'm gonna lose this trial. \nTHEO I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a fake, right? So all we need to do is... \nJay holds up a hand, instantly silencing his attorney. \n", "test3_id": 1826}

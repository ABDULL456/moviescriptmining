{"test1_input": "CHAD Are there any questions? \nELENA (calling out) Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards. \nKRISTEN Ask away. \nELENA When they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity, you sued his sorry ass, right? \nKristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth... \nKRISTEN Uh, no, actually, I was never able to make a positive ID. All I remember was his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in my ear, \"You won't remember, but you'll never forget...\" \nElena cracks a sideways grin... \nELENA So what you're really saying is you fucked for free... \nKristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to control the situation... \nPRINCIPAL MOSSTER Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young lady! \nLike Elena cares.   She leans back, nods. Job done. \nEXT. BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL - DAY \nThe bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full swing... \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Blue Bay High School would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri-county region... \nBreathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area. \nBut all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches... \nAnd as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white bathing suit. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) First up, district champion Marie Clifford... \nThe crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder... \nJAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front row of the bleachers... \nJAY C'mon now baby, you can do it... \nMarie just rolls her eyes. \nJENNY Your stepfather's just got a lot invested in the team. \nMarie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him... \nJAY (to Marie) Just try to keep those legs together. \nELENA (O.S.) Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen Virgin. \nJay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with the world's hottest towel girl... \nJAY Excuse me? \nELENA You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in Clifford construction? \nJAY I am, yes, but... \nELENA I'd love to see one of your erections... \nWhoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into the air. \nIt's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with her teammates before crossing to Jay. \nJAY Nice take off, gotta work on the landing... \nMARIE I can't do any better... \nJay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately. \nJAY No such word as 'can't. Now do it again. Only better... \nMarie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel... \nELENA Bet you choke. \n", "test1_true": "MARIE What's your major malfunction? \nELENA Just wanted to make a wager. Between best friends. \nMarie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform. \nELENA You blow this dive, I get those diamonds of yours. \nMarie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the ladder, shakes her head... \nMARIE How'd you know about my inheritance? \nELENA Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's the day, right? \nMARIE And what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when I win? \nElena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile. \nELENA I'll stay away from your stepfather. You make it, I won't be your new stepmom anytime soon. Whattya say? \nMarie just stands there incredulous for a moment. \nMARIE Take your sorry ass back to the swamps. \nShe ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind... \nELENA Choke! \nMarie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below, walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him... \nMarie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop looming beyond... \nShe slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond... \nShe throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne... \nShe twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion. \nAnd as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash. \nMarie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers... \nEXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON \nSickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion... \nBanners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non- alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland... \nMarie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her. J ENNY What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that one judge only gave you a 9.7? \nMarie forces a smile. \nMARIE Nah. I'm cool. \nJENNY Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe. You got diamonds on the mind. \nJAY (O.S.) Have either of you seen my video camera? \nMarie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to Jay's face. \nJAY I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure... \nHe shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers... \nJAY Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday. \nEveryone raises their fine crystal. \nH \nJAY She's become every inch of the woman her Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is now, Julie's looking down and smiling. \nTears well in Marie's eyes... \nJAY And that's why, on your eighteenth birthday, Marie, I know your mother wanted you to have... \nHe notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words... \n", "test1_id": 1824, "test2_input": "MORRISON You sure you want to go through with this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk away right now.... \nKristen interjects... \nKRISTEN Please, Detective, this isn't the right time... \nELENA I ain't lying. You think I'm lying? \nKristen turns to her young ward... \nKRISTEN If you're telling the truth, you won't find a more sympathetic ear... \nELENA 'If' I'm telling the truth... \nKRISTEN And if you're not, there's gonna be trouble, you understand? \nMORRISON This is already trouble. The man you're accusing happens to be a friend of mine, and when the DNA tests prove you're lying I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks, mark my words... \nElena withers under his glare... \nINT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nJay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney. \nTHEO We're gonna sue their asses til time runs backwards... \nJAY (to Marie) You've gotta believe me, I would never, could never do anything like this, you know that don't you? \nMarie takes his hand, squeezes it. \nMARIE We're team Clifford. \nJay forces a tired smile... \nJAY That's my girl. \nThe door swings open and Morrison enters... \nMORRISON Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom... \nJay stands, shakes Morrison's hand. \nMORRISON (to Marie) Would you mind waiting outside while me and your stepdad have a little chat... \nMarie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave. \nJAY It's OK honey. Michael and I are old pals... \nReluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her. Jay sits back down. Morrison takes a chair opposite. \nJAY How's the divorce treating you? \nMORRISON She's taken me for everything I'm worth. I swear to God, I'm never trusting another woman as long as I live. T heo intervenes... \nTHEO This is most egregious, Detective, my client has pressing matters at his construction site. He can't afford to waste time with this frivolous nonsense... \nMORRISON (to Jay) Look, we're taking her statement right now, gonna run every forensic test in the book. Guarantee the case'll come apart like a $2 watch... \nJay nods, certain he can beat this rap... \nJAY She had my camcorder. Recorded what happened. It should still be at the construction site. It'll clear my name... \nMorrison nods. \nMORRISON You'll be outta here by tonight. \nINT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY \nMarie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute on her cell phone... \nMARIE (ON PHONE) I can't believe it, Jenny...It just doesn't make sense...I mean, I know Jay...I know he'd never... \nWhen a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone. Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes her and reveals...Elena. \nMARIE This can't be... \nA look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's beautiful face. Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - DAY \nPolice cars line the driveway outside the beach front building site. Officers cordon off the road as Forensics teams photograph every inch of the building... \nStanding amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate Mr. Barajas, accompanied, as ever, by Cicatriz. They are both on CELLPHONES, both talking angry, fast Spanish. \nINT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT \nPlastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished condos. The white suited FORENSICS TEAM work meticulously, led by the tireless Dr. Chad Borman, delicately dusting anything and everything that might yield evidence... \nMorrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by POLICE TAPE. He's looking at Jay's smashed DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA, now bagged and tagged as evidence... \nKRISTEN (O.S.) Sexual predators often keep a trophy... \nMorrison spins, sees Kristen. He stumbles with his words, not used to talking to beautiful women... \nMORRISON I'm sorry? \nKRISTEN Maybe he recorded the rape. \nMorrison looks at the remains of the camera. \nMORRISON And maybe he didn't. We'll never know. Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take months to fix it. \nHe looks up into Kristen's hypnotic eyes. \nMORRISON We were never properly introduced. Michael Morrison. \nShe offers her hand, and Morrison shakes it. \nKRISTEN Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was just in town for a couple days checking in on some parolees when all this went down... \nShe hands Morrison a BUSINESS CARD, which he absently stuffs into his pocket... \nMORRISON You think maybe you could lean on the girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We all know she's lying. With all this Black widow shit going down, we just don't have the time or manpower to... \nKRISTEN She might not be lying, you know. \nMORRISON What makes you think that? \nKRISTEN Just a look in her eye. I...I have some experience... \nMorrison doesn't want to push her further... \nAll of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the Forensics team, leaving everyone in pitch darkness.... \nMORRISON What the hell? \nSlowly an eerie ULTRA VIOLET GLOW fills the room. The white suited forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait patiently for evidence to show itself... \nSuddenly the clear IMPRINTS of hands on the wall become clear, along with the black stains of BLOOD FLECKS... \nCHAD Gotcha... \nMORRISON What is it? \nCHAD Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle. I'd say we've got a rape on our hands, Detective, but we won't know for sure until we run the tests... \nMorrison's head is spinning... \nMORRISON Fine. Just do it... \nINT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT \nElena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab, rubbing her arm where a band-aid covers a fresh needle mark. Chad appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him. \nELENA You vampires really need five pints of my blood? That's like an armful... \nChad's surprised by her venom. \nCHAD It's standard procedure in a rape test. Test for drugs and such... \nELENA And such. \nShe continues to pace as Chad makes his way into the room, rounds the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf. \nCHAD We're going to need a urine sample. Do you think you could fill this? \n", "test2_id": 1825, "test3_input": "INT.

If you lied to me there'd be trouble... \nElena slumps back down, her head on the table. \nELENA Chad swerved off the road, I swear... \nKRISTEN Just swerved for no reason. Just decided to take a shortcut through the swamp? \nElena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye. \nELENA It was an accident... \nThe door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands... \nMORRISON Accident my ass. \nHe flips the pages of the report... \nMORRISON Forensics finds the head trauma that killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a single blow from behind. E lena looks up, through Panda eyes... \nELENA The crash. He...he hit his head... \nMORRISON Was that before or after you dragged him through the swamp? \nElena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt, snaps them on Elena's wrists. \nMORRISON You got the right to remain silent, which in your case is probably best, cos of the shit you come up with... \nKristen stands up, shaking her head. \nKRISTEN That's two strikes, Elena. One more and you're out. \nElena looks at her pleadingly. \nELENA I'll do whatever you want. \nKristen stops. Thinks for a moment. Nods to Morrison as he drags Elena to her feet. \nKRISTEN Yeah. Yeah you will. \nELENA I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you what happened. She killed him, and took the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie Clifford... \nMorrison just sneers. \nMORRISON Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the Judge. I think its time he heard the truth about Jay Clifford's accuser. \nKRISTEN Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be cleared, you know that. You need Marie, you need the proof they set him up... \nMorrison considers this. \nKRISTEN You came so close to nailing the Black Widow, don't let this slip through your fingers, Detective... \nHe's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings. Kristen takes it from Elena, looks at the CALLER ID, sees Marie's name... \nKRISTEN Speak of the Devil... \nShe holds the phone up. \nKRISTEN You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna say that everything went fine. No one found Chad's body. The plan's still on. Do you understand me? \nElena nods slowly. Morrison turns to Kristen. \nMORRISON You thinking what I'm thinking? K risten's patient with him. \nKRISTEN This is your chance.

GROUCHO That's it... 
Takes gloves from Trentino's breast pocket and socks him across the face... and puts them in his own breast pocket. Trentino becomes apoplectic 
TRENTINO (Spluttering and stuttering) Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war... (Turns to go and turns and yells to Groucho) You RUNT! 
GROUCHO I still like UPSTART the best. 
Trentino exits in a rage.  Vera pretends that she is overcome by the scene 
VERA (Putting her hand to her brow) Oh, this is dreadful!  If you'll excuse me I'll go to my room... 
She exits toward stairway 
MRS.  TEASDALE (Excited - almost hysterical) Yes, it's awful! (To Groucho) Are you sure you did the right thing? 
GROUCHO Of course.  Who ever heard of calling off a war after ordering all the ammunition? 
By this tine Vera has descended the stairs and exited from scene.  Groucho looks around the room furtively to make sure he is not being observed and takes a large envelope from his inside pocket. 
GROUCHO The plans of war are in this envelope. I want you to take care of them -- no one will ever suspect you. 
He hands papers to her 
CUT TO Vera lingering on stairs looking down on the scene below.  Having heard the conversation, she exits from scene, and we CUT down stairs to Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale. 
GROUCHO Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you... 
MRS. TEASDALE (Modestly, with a bashful lowering of her eyes) Now -- er -- 
GROUCHO Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness... 
MRS. TEASDALE Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet. 
Groucho puts his arms around her and tries unsuccessfully to lift her off her feet. 
GROUCHO (Angrily) Swell chance I've got taking you off your feet... 
Mrs. Teasdale sinks down into a chair; without hesitation, Groucho slides into her lap and continues his passionate love making. 
GROUCHO Gloria -- may I call you Gloria? 
MRS. TEASDALE Why -- why -- of course. 
GROUCHO You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...

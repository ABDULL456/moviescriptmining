PILLETTI Put on your blue suit... \nMARTY Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man. \nMRS. PILLETTI You not ugly. \nMARTY (his voice rising) I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY! \nMRS. PILLETTI Marty... \nMARTY Ma! Leave me alone! \nHe stands abruptly, his face pained and drawn. He makes half- formed gestures to his mother, but he can't find words at the moment. He turns and marches a few paces away, turns to his mother again. \nMARTY Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya want from me?! I'm miserable enough as it is! Leave me alone! I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom! I'll put onna blue suit and I'll go! And you know what I'm gonna get for my trouble? Heartache! A big night of heartache! \nSullenly, he marches back to his seat, sits down, picks up his fork, plunges it into the spaghetti, stuffs a mouthful into his mouth, and chews vigorously for a moment. It is impossible for him to remain angry long. After a while, he is shaking his head. \nMARTY Loaded with tomatoes...boy, that's rich. \nHe plunges his fork in again, starts to eat. Mrs. Pilletti watches Marty anxiously as we... \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN \nNEW YORK CITY, WEST FARMS SQUARE. NIGHT \nWest Farms Square is a big street in the Bronx, filled with stores, bowling alleys and bars. Cars push along between the pillars of the elevated subway structure. The NOISE of the subway trains ROARS by overhead every few moments. \nCAMERA FINDS and ESTABLISHES the Stardust Ballroom. It occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three-story building. It is a hot June night, and the windows are open for ventilation purposes. MUSIC manufactured by Dave Greenglass and His Band blends with the NOISES of the street. \nSTARDUST BALLROOM. ENTRANCE VESTIBULE/STAIRS. \nMUSIC plays in the background. CAMERA views CLARA, a plain girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, MILLIE, prettier; Millie's fiance ANDY, 30; and a second young man DR. KEEGAN, also 30, who is a resident at Fordham Hospital. They are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street door. \nANDY (in a low voice) I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl... \nDR. KEEGAN (extracting cigarettes from the machine) She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all. \nANDY I told you she wasn't attractive... \nDR. KEEGAN You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all. \nANDY Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I... \n", "test1_true": "They join the two girls waiting for them and start up the broad stairway to the second floor. They are halfway up, when two GIRLS come in at the top of the stairs and start down. Dr. Keegan, who is holding Clara's arm, looks up, nods. \nSTARDUST BALLROOM, ANTEROOM. \nThis is a small, carpeted lobby with TICKET TAKER in booth, a cloak room and rest rooms. Painted posters on the walls announce coming events and caution against smoking. There are also large blow-ups of musicians who had played this ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things. About six or seven PEOPLE congregate in the lobby, engaged in various indifferent activities. \nCAMERA ANGLES include the swinging doors, as Clara, Andy, Millie and Dr. Keegan come in. As they enter, the doors to the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a GIRL in a black dress, quite pretty, comes in. She starts across the anteroom toward the cloak room, when Dr. Keegan calls out suddenly to her. \nDR. KEEGAN Hey! \nThe girl turns. Recognition floods her face. \nGIRL Herbie! Wadda you doing here?! \nDR. KEEGAN I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody? \nGIRL I'm just here with another girl. \nDR. KEEGAN Where you going now? \nGIRL I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat. \nDR. KEEGAN I'll see you around. \nGIRL I'll see you. \nShe turns and continues on to the cloak room. Dr. Keegan turns to Clara. \nDR. KEEGAN That's a girl used to know. \nBALLROOM, LOUNGE. \nA fairly long room, lined on one side by a bar and on the other by cheap leatherette booths. It is brightly lit and crowded. There is a constant movement in and out of the lounge. At the far end of the lounge, there are two large iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out. Dance MUSIC from dance floor. \nClara, Dr. Keegan, Millie and Andy come into the lounge and form a little group in the midst of moving PASSERSBY around them. A kind of strange excitement has begun to enter Dr. Keegan. He stands with the others, but his attention is devoted to ogling the passing GIRLS, occasionally looking back to the doors leading to the anteroom. \nANDY Boy, it's packed in here. \nMILLIE (to Clara) Some of these kids are awful young. Aren't you afraid you'll bump into one of your students? \nCLARA (nervously looking at Dr. Keegan) I wouldn't think so. I teach out in Brooklyn. \nANDY You been up here before, Clara? \nCLARA Yeah, twice. \nMILLIE Shall we try to get a table and get something to drink or shall we just go in and start dancing? \nANDY Hey, Herbie... \nDr. Keegan doesn't seem to hear. \n", "test1_id": 633, "test2_input": "DR. KEEGAN No, I'm not kidding. \nMARTY You can't just walk off onna girl like that. \nDr. Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. Marty turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor. \nMarty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious, Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning position, following in their general direction. \nMarty moves through the crush of young men and women in the area around the dance floor. \nALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY. \nAs Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the booths. \nLOUNGE. \nClara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr. Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara and is going through some story about being called away on an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who will see to it that she gets home safely. \nClara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway. \nARCHWAY. \nFrom where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, and he catches their conversation. \nDR. KEEGAN ...in that case, as long as she's going home alone, give me the five bucks back... \nSTAG Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. I was willing. It's my five bucks... \nThey move past and away and Marty stares after them before he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen. \nClara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed. Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a sign over an exit that reads \"Fire Escape.\" Clara starts moving toward that door. \nMarty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction of the fire escape. \nLOUNGE. \nNear the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view. Background sounds continue steadily. \nMarty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops and stares off-screen. \nClara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape outside. \nMarty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold of the... \nFIRE ESCAPE. \nIt is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment before moving a step or two forward. \nClara doesn't turn. Marty tries to think of something to say. \nMARTY (finally) Excuse me, Miss, would you care to dance? \nClara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, her lips trembling. Then, in one of those moments of simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and Marty takes her to him. \n", "test2_true": "FADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nBRONX APARTMENT HOUSE, STAIRWAY. NIGHT \nMrs. Pilletti, in her hat and coat and carrying a purse, is making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing. She pauses to catch her breath on the landing. Then she moves down the hallway to... \nENTRANCE TO APARTMENT 4-B. \nMrs. Pilletti rings the bell. The SOUND can be heard as she waits. The door is opened by Virginia. \nVIRGINIA Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in. \nMrs. Pilletti enters the apartment. \nAPARTMENT. \nVirginia closes the door after Mrs. Pilletti enters, and they stand in a small narrow hallway, brightly lit. At the far end to the right is the living room in the background. \nMRS. PILLETTI (in a low voice as she pulls off her coat) Is Catherine here? \nVirginia helps her with her coat. \nVIRGINIA (nods, keeping her voice low) We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you? \nMRS. PILLETTI I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling. \nThomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an anxious smile on his face. \nTHOMAS Hello, Aunt Theresa. \nMRS. PILLETTI Hello, Thomas. \nTHOMAS I just this minute got the baby to sleep. \nHe comes down to Mrs. Pilletti and Virginia, lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \nTHOMAS Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see... \nMRS. PILLETTI Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing. \nA shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered conference in the hallway. \nCATHERINE'S VOICE (off-screen) Who's there?! Who's there?! \nMrs. Pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room, followed by Virginia and Thomas. \nMRS. PILLETTI (calling back) It's me, Catherine! How you feel? \nCATHERINE comes in at the end of the foyer. She is a gaunt woman with a face carved out of granite. She is tough, embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work ingrained into her features. \n", "test2_id": 634, "test3_input": "RALPH Marty, you don't wanna hang around with dogs. It gives you a bad reputation. \nANGIE Let's go downa Seventy-Second Street. \nMARTY I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty. \nANGIE (angry) Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog? \nMARTY Waddaya getting so sore about? \nANGIE I looked all over for you last night, you know that? \nHe turns away sulking. Marty doesn't pick up the phone but returns to his seat, upset. \nJOE Another book that I read by Mickey Spillane, I can't remember the name of it, but it was about this red- headed tramp he finds inna street, and he gives her some dough, because he's sorry for her... Wait a minute, I think that's the same book I was telling you about before... \nMARTY (to Angie) You didn't like her at all? \nANGIE A nothing. A real nothing. \nMarty lowers his head. Over this, Joe's VOICE DRONES on. \nJOE'S VOICE (off-screen) You know something...? \nCAMERA ANGLE HOLDS on Marty looking down, as Joe's VOICE continues. \nJOE'S VOICE (off-screen) ...I can't tell one-a those Mickey Spillane books from the other, but he's a real good writer, though... \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nSNYDER APARTMENT. NIGHT \nCLOSE ON television screen. Ed Sullivan is on, indicating the time is a little after half past seven. CAMERA PULLS BACK, disclosing Clara, Mr. and Mrs. Snyder in their living room. Apparently the Sullivan show is very funny at the moment, for the television audience roars with laughter. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON Clara. Another ROAR of LAUGHTER from the television that Clara watches, although her eyes are flooded with tears, several of which have already traced wet paths down her cheeks. Another ROAR of laughter. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. NIGHT. \nMarty, Mrs. Pilletti and Catherine are eating silently at the table. Catherine reads an Italian newspaper as she eats. \nMRS. PILLETTI So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty? \nMARTY I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch... \nSuddenly he pauses, sharply aware of the repetition in his life. Mrs. Pilletti is also aware of it. \nMARTY Maybe, I'll go out and see what Angie and the boys are doing... \nThey eat silently a moment. \n187TH STREET. BAR. NIGHT. \nCLOSE-UP of Marty leaning against the wall in front of the bar. A group of young men lounge about, killing time. \n", "test3_true": "LEO What time is it? \nJOE About eight o'clock. \nANGIE (to George) You don't feel like going downna Seventy-Second Street? \nGEORGE It'll take an hour anna hour back, and the whole evening's gone. \nJOE What's playing on Fordham Road? I think there's a good picture in the Loew's Paradise. \nGEORGE You guys feel like working up a game- a cards? \nANGIE Come on, let's go down Seventy-Second Street, walk around. We're sure to wind up with something. \nCLOSE-UP of Marty, his head down, his eyes closed. The group continues their dialogue back and forth. Their VOICES can be heard as Marty's head slowly comes up. \nJOE'S VOICE (off-screen) I'll never forgive LaGuardia for cutting out burlesque outta New York City... \nGEORGE'S VOICE (off-screen) There's a burlesque in Union City. Let's go over to Union City... \nANGIE'S VOICE (off-screen) Yeah, you're the one who don't even wanna take a ride onna subway for half an hour. Now, you wanna go alla way over to Union City... \nGEORGE'S VOICE (off-screen) I feel like playing cards.

Waddaya feel like doing tonight, Angie? \nANGIE'S VOICE (off-screen) I don't know. Wadda you feel like doing? \nJOE'S VOICE (off-screen) I don't know, Angie. Wadda you feel like doing? \nA fury rises in Marty's face. He cries out at them. \nMARTY \"What are you doing tonight?\"... \"I don't know, what are you doing?!\"... \nCAMERA ANGLES over to the others who, at this outburst, stare at Marty astounded. \nMARTY (continuing) The burlesque! Loew's Paradise! Miserable and lonely! Miserable and lonely and stupid! What am I, crazy or something?! I got something good here! What am I hanging around with you guys for?! \nHe has said this in tones so loud that it attracts the attention of the few PEOPLE on the street. A little embarrassed by the attention he's getting, he turns, opens the door to the bar, and goes into it. \nAfter a stunned moment, Angie hurries after him. \nINSIDE THE BAR. \nMarty marches the length of the room toward the phone booths in the rear. CAMERA ANGLES to disclose Angie right behind him. \nMarty is about to enter one of the phone booths, but he stops as Angie hurries up to him. \nANGIE Watsa matter with you? \nMarty pauses, one foot in the booth. \n", "test3_id": 635}

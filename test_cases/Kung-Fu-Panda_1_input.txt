Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the street. 
As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll. 
PO Lightning! 
Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river. 
Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the fireworks-filled sky. 
Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie- vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is shocked. 
TAI LUNG The scroll has given him power. (then) NOOO0!! 
He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting shockwave collapses the building. 
Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating punch. 
As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the impact crater. 
TAI LUNG (CONT'D) (out of breath) Finally... oh yes... the power of the Dragon Scroll... is mine! 
Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls. 
TAI LUNG (CONT'D) It's NOTHING!! 
Po stirs. 
PO It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either. 
TAI LUNG (disbelief) What? 
Po gets to his feet. 
PO There is no secret ingredient. It's just you. 
Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po. 
TAI LUNG RRRAAAH! 
PO AAAAGGGHH! 
Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling. 
PO (CONT'D) Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't! 
Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly. 
The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what he just did. 
Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY! He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground. 
Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant. 
TAI LUNG (heavy breathing) You... can't defeat me. You're just a big, fat panda! 
SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide. 
PO I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda. 
Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps. 
TAI LUNG The Wuxi Finger Hold!

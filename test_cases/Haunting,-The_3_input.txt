MARROW I don't know. 
NELL It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer. 
Nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, passionate woman.  She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, powerful.  Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at her as she comes to the overgrown end.  Nell reaches out to the hanging vines, pulls them aside... 
...and A FACE stares out.  Gastly.  White.  Nell takes an involuntary step back, a little gasp. 
The face is marble.  Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  It is a STATUE OF CRAIN.  Marrow comes over. 
It's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim.  The plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence from the greenhouse. 
NELL (cont'd) Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get away from him. 
She laughs a little at herself.  Marrow joins in.  He helps her pull the plants back to reveal more of it. 
She reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  Then daring, grins, and begins to hum her TUNE. 
Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow. 
MARROW What is that tune? 
NELL I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. (to the statue) Hugh Crain, would you care to dance? 
She hums another two notes, and BANG!  The door behind her SLAMS OPEN in a gust of wind, jolting Nell.  She stops and stares. Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring at her, he's been watching her dance.  The spell is broken.  Nell, embarrassed, can't bear to look at him. 
A beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door.  When he turns back -- 
-- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps echoing in the vaulted room. 
EXT. REAR LAWN - DAY 
Nell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at herself as much as she is spooked. 
In the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of paint cleaner an a ladder.  Nell stops, watching him.  He senses her, pauses, and smiles. 
Nell reacts.  Sees the ladder.  Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the House. 
Nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of -- 
EXT. FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 
-- the tiny Crain family cemetery.  Nell catches herself.  A small swinging gate bars the way.  She hesitates. 
Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.  Eight small headstones, one large one.  A half dozen unmarked stones in the grass: stillbirths. 
Nell is drawn into the graveyard.  The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S. The smaller ones are her children's. 
Nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names. One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is covered by growth.  She clears it away.  April 6th, 1874. 
NELL Only two days. 
There is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.  Nell kneels to read it. 
NELL (cont'd) The blest are the dead / Who see not the sight / Of their own desolation... 
Nell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the gravestone, turns to the next.  ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She clears it away: August 21, 1878.  The blasphemous epitaph here: 
NELL (cont'd) A father's joy unjustly snatch'd by a jealous God... 
Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away -- January 1, 1880.  And its graven commandment, so familiar, so comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise: 
NELL (cont'd) Suffer the little children unto me. 
There are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a day.  There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a cherub of death.  We've seen this image before.  Nell backs out of the cemetery, afraid. 
INT. MEZZANINE - DAY 
Nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the Red Parlor. 
INT. RED PARLOR - DAY 
She stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of books.  Nell is unsure of what she's looking for.  She looks at Crain's painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the ornate frame.  The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR.  Then recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN. Intuitively, she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and is able to push it open.  Inside a small stairwell... 
INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY 
Down the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room. Velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing through.  As her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a late-nineteenth century office, Crain's secret office. 
The bookcases filled with business ledgers.  The business ledgers are stamped with the cherub of death. 
At the end is an enormous desk.  Behind it a massive, carved chair covered with a sheet, only its lion-head arm rests protruding from underneath.  Nell realizes it's: 
NELL Crain's study. 
She moves for the desk.  An ENORMOUS MIRROR, its silver inner surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, and FOR A SPLIT SECOND, A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR.  Nell steps in front of it, blocking our view. 
And when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the chair, the natural shadow of the room. 
Nell goes around the desk, stands over it.  The chair sits silent behind her, shrouded.

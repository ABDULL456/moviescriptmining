{"test1_input": "EDWARDS Uh -- forty regular. \nZED Then let's put it on. \nEDWARDS Put what on? \nZED The last suit you'll ever wear. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nLike the rest of the place, the MIB locker room is all white. White walls, white floor, white ceiling, white lockers. ZED'S VOICE comes over: \nZED (O.S.) From now on, you'll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services. \nEDWARDS reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a BLACK SUIT hung from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a BLACK HAT and a pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nKAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. ZED'S VOICE continues: \nZED (O.S.) You'll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you, get approval for any expenditure over a hundred dollars. \nINT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY \nEDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth. \nHe holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints. \nZED (O.S.) You will have no identifying marks of any kind.  You will not stand out in any way. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nOne by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards. \nOn the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name. \nZED (O.S.) Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nPants come off the hanger. The white shirt is removed. \nMore letters are eliminated from his name. It reads \"JAMES DARREL ED...\" then \"JAMES DARR...\" \nZED (O.S.) You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't exist; you were never even born. \nThe coat is removed. The hat comes off the shelf. \nZED (O.S.) Anonymity is your name. Silence your native tongue. \n\"JAMES...\" \"JAM...\" \nZED (O.S.) You are no longer part of \"the system.\" We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it. \nFeet slip into black shoes. A belt is buckled. A tie pushed up. \nZED (O.S.) We're \"them.\" We're \"they.\" \nOn screen, all that's left is the letter \"J.\" \nAs the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve. Monogrammed on the cuff is, simply, the letter \"J.\" \nZED (O.S.) We are the Men in Black. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nLooking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS III -- or, rather, JAY -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at KAY. \nJAY The difference between you and me? \nHe slips on the sunglasses. \nJAY (CONT'D) I make this look good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING \nWe are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor. \nWe see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan. \n", "test1_true": "Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. \nWhile Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk. \nZED Okay, let's see. (to one of the monitors) Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet. \nBEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods. \nBEE Humanoid? \nZED You wish. Bring a sponge. (going through memos) What else -- everybody, we gotta keep Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system, he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat wants to reveal himself on \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" Bee, make sure he doesn't. \nHe turns a page, coming across a red memo. \nZED (CONT'D) Red-letter from last night -- we had an un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate New York farm country. Keep your ears open for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a galactic kegger down here. \nNext to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it. \nZED Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer. \nKAY (to Jay) Landed alien out of zone. (to Zed) Who is it? \nZED Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan but he's way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why don't you take Jay? This is a good one for him to warm up on. \nEXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY \nJAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters. \nJAY Yo, wussup with Zed? (imitating him) \"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger...\" \nKAY Zed was saving the world before you were born, son. Show some respect. \nAn MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door open. Jay sizes up the car. \nJAY We got the use of unlimited technology from the entire universe and we cruise around in this? \nKay glares at Jay. He's getting annoyed. \nINT. MIB LTD - DAY \nThey get in and slam the doors. Kay starts the car and the engine HUMS quietly. \nKAY Seat belt. \nJAY You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to people. You could be a little kinder and gentler. \nKay grits his teeth. \nKAY Buckle up, please. \nJAY Now did that hurt? \nKay shifts the car into reverse. The awesome power of the car kicks in and Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat. \nKAY Makin' fun of my ride... \nA LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats.  Jay's hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel. \nKAY Jay. The button? \nJAY Yeah? \nKAY Never push the button, Jay. \nJay jerks his hand away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY \nThe LTD is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it. Ahead of it, another car has pulled over. KAY gets out, JAY follows a moment later, shaky-legged. Kay walks up to the window of the car they've stopped. The DRIVER, a guy in his mid-thirties with a WIFE in her mid-thirties, rolls the window down. \nKAY License and registration, please. \nThe Driver hands over some documents. Kay flips through them. \nKAY (CONT'D) Other license and registration, please. \nThe guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over Kay's shoulder. \nThe photographs on the \"RESIDENT ALIEN ID\"cards are of two friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera, their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way. \n", "test1_id": 1527, "test2_input": "KAY What do you think? \nJAY (of Laurel) Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin' on. \nKAY Of the body. \nJAY Great body. \nKAY The dead body? \nJAY Not a clue. \nKAY All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to sound too dumb. \nACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay. \nLAUREL Dr. White. \nJay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) (louder) Dr. White. (still louder) Dr. White. \nHe still doesn't answer. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) (shouting) DR. WHITE! \nKay nudges Jay. \nKAY You're up, Slugger. \nJay turns and races across the room to rejoin her. \nLAUREL Look at this. \nJay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear. \nJAY What is that? \nHe reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft CLICK -- \n-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch. \nJay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull. \nA TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD. \nThough not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull. \nLAUREL Far -- freaking -- out. \nThey lean in closer. The Tiny Little Green Man (a BALTIAN) forces words out of his mouth. \nBALTIAN Must -- to pre -- prevent -- (searching for the word) -- contest? No...to prevent -- \nJAY It's all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle? \nLAUREL War? \nThe Baltian nods vigorously. That's it. \nBALTIAN (faltering) Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's -- (thinks) What is word? Be...? \nJAY Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt? \nThe Baltian nods again, falls, and dies. Jay and Laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other. \nJAY (CONT'D) \"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt?\"  The hell does that mean? (turns around) Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come here! \nKay begins over. Laurel looks at them. \nLAUREL \"Doctor Whatever\"? You're not with the Department of Public Health, are you? \nJay shakes his head -- but is now paying more attention to Kay, as he leads him toward the Little Man. \nJAY He's dead. \nKay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man. \nKAY Rosenberg. Damn. Good man. \nJAY You knew him? \nKAY One of the few I actually liked. Exiled High Prince. \n", "test2_true": "Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel. \nJAY He said \"to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt.\" \nLAUREL ... This make total sense. How else do you explain New York? The other night I'm in a cab, this guy... \nFLASH! Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out. \nKAY He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt? That makes no sense. \nJAY That's what he said. (to the dazed Laurel) Didn't he? Right after he -- (realizing) Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy thing already. \nLAUREL (as if awakening) Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid I'm going to need to see some ID if you're going to be in the morgue, okay? \nKAY Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go. \nFLASH! He neuralyzes her again. Jay slaps his hand. \nJAY Stop that -- \nKAY (to Laurel, ignoring Jay) Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life. \nJAY -- that thing probably gives you brain cancer! \nKAY Never hurt her before. \nJAY \"Never hurt her before\"?! How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?! \nKAY (evasive) Couple. \nJAY Aren't you worried about, you know, long term damage? \nKAY (more evasive) Little bit. \nJAY What the hell happened to make you such a callous son of a bitch? \nKAY I took this job. \nHe heads out. Jay follows. \nJAY Hey, you never flashed me with that thing, did you? \nKAY Nah. \nEXT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nJay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car. \nJAY Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in charge of the flashy memory thing department. \nKAY Not while I'm around, Slim. \nJAY Yeah, well you're a menace with that thing... \nAn MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and four men dressed in black suits get out. \nKAY (to an MIB Agent) We've got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard. Two PASSERSBY hear the racket and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved. \nBut an inhuman GROWL rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on their way. \nINT. ORKIN VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT \nInside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship, Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the rest of the box and SMACKS it with his right fist. Nothing doing. \nHe BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box. \nInside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty. \nEDGAR No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO! \nHe rips the box apart with his bare hands. There's nothing else there. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

The front of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay. \nThe Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head flying behind Jay. \nKay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers. \nThe other gun sails off into the darkness. \nThe ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor. \nHe calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay. \nJAY You son of a -- \nKay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number. \nKAY Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We have the galaxy. \nINT. MIB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nZed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. He glances over at the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. The red lights are coming back on. \nZED I think the word's already out. Our friends are coming back. (then) Got an authorized landing at Times Square. You and Jay check it out on the way back... And pick me up one of those soft pretzels, while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like celebrating. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \nKay flips the phone closed. \nKAY You were saying? \nJAY Getting eaten!? That was your plan!? \nKAY (shrugs) Worked. \nAs they argue, behind them, unseen, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG RAISES ITSELF UP on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready to lower itself onto Kay and Jay. \nJAY After I got the shit beat out of me! \nKAY And I almost got digested. It goes with the job. \nJAY You coulda told me what you were doing. \nKAY There wasn't time, sport! \nHISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads... \nBOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further. \nThey turn to see... \nLAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards. \nLAUREL Interesting job you guys got. \nON THE SKY. Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air. \nINT. A CAR ON THE ADJOINING FREEWAY - NIGHT \nThe driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield. He winces. \n-- AND THE BUG'S REMAINS SPLAT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD. \nThe driver grimaces at the mess. \nDRIVER Damn bugs. \nHe reaches down and hits a button. Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT \nKay's LTD is parked outside Men in Black headquarters. LAUREL leans her back against the car.  We see JAY and KAY walking away in the distance. \nJAY Look, I know we got rules, but she did just bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you don't have to flashy thing her. \nKay pulls out the neuralyzer. \nJAY Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people. \nKAY Not her. Me.

I never just look anymore and they're beautiful. \nJAY Kay, you're scaring your partner. \n", "test3_true": "JAY Oh no, I can't do this job by myself. \nLAUREL (walking towards them) Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment. We're not even on the right island. \nKAY Maybe you won't have to. \nKay starts dialing back the neuralyzer. \nKAY Days. Months. Years. Always face it forwards. \nHe hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put his glasses on. Jay resists. \nKAY I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach. That's one of a hundred memories I don't want. \nJay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses. \nKAY See you around, sport. \nJay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white. \nJAY No, you won't. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY \nCLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. Here's one: Mets' Centerfielder Says: \"UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!\" And here's another one: DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY! Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel And a third: MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA Returns to Girl He Left Behind \nA large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON, his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona. \nShe holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never gave her thirty years ago. \nJAY, who's reading the paper, smiles. \nAT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE, (formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better. \nELLE Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9 emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks -- Bulls game. \nJAY I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn planet. \nELLE Let's roll. \nBoth car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from the curb. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY \nThe LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block. \nFROM UP IN THE CLOUDS \nManhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl. \nFROM THE STRATOSPHERE \nThe east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land mass. \nFROM THE EOSPHERE \nNorth America is just a small portion of the planet Earth. \nFROM SPACE \nEarth is just a tiny ball in our solar system. \nFROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY \nOur solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field. \nFROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY \nThe Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy spirals. \nFROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE \nThere seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny ball -- \n-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red dirt. \nAn ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt, where it CLICKS into a dozen other big blue balls just like it. \nFADE OUT. \n", "test3_id": 1529}

{"train": "Men In Black \nby Ed Solomon \nEXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT \nA million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air. \nThe insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down the road. \nINT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT \nThe DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers, smearing the remains all over. \nDRIVER Goddamn bugs. \nHe squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road. \nHe bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled. \nDRIVER (CONT'D) Deja me hablar. (Let me do the talking.) \nEXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT \nThe van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with \"INS\" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window. \nThe DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs. \nAGENT JANUS Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where you comin' from? \nDRIVER I was fishing in Cuernavaca. \nAGENT JANUS Sure you were. What do you say we have a look at your catch? \nAT THE BACK OF THE VAN, \nthe Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head. \nAGENT JANUS Me, I woulda thrown 'em back. (to the passengers, in Spanish) Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina! (Let's go. Out. Form a line!) \nThey pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children. \nAGENT JANUS (CONT'D) What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna need -- \nHe stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several Agents pull their weapons. \nThe new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD. \nTWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents. \nKAY We'll take it from here. \nAGENT JANUS Who the hell are you? \nKay and Dee flash some form of ID. \nKAY INS Division 6. \nAGENT JANUS Division 6? I never heard of Division 6. \nKAY Really? \nKay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants. \nKAY (CONT'D) What're we thinking, Dee? \nDEE Tough call, Kay. \nHe walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish. \nKAY !Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey! (What's up, how are you?) No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos. (Don't worry grandma. Welcome to the United States.) (next) A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo, no? Buena suerta. (Where are you going? San Antonio?  Looking for work, aren't you?  Good luck.) (next) Es un placer verle aqui. (It's a pleasure seeing you here.) \nOne by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but: \nKAY (CONT'D) Que dices si te rompo la cara? (What do you say if I break your face?) \nThe Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the Guy's shoulder. \nKAY (CONT'D) No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol, verdad, amigo? (You don't speak a word of Spanish, right, friend?) \nAgain, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee. \nKAY (CONT'D) We got a winner. (to the others) Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense! (The rest of you are free to go. Scram!) \nKAY Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on you. \nHe takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does, Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the stars. \nThe other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions. \nKAY Okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. If you'll just give me your attention for a moment I'll tell you what happened. \nFrom over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch, figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the device up to \"08.\" \nKAY (CONT'D) This is called a \"neuralyzer.\" A gift from some friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for memory. \nBehind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them. \nKAY (CONT'D) Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80. \n2ND INS AGENT What in the hell is going on?! \nKAY Exactly the right question. And the answer lies right -- here. Pay attention. \nJANUS Who are you, really? \nKAY Really? I'm just a figment of your imagination. \nHe holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses -- \n-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly. \nKAY (CONT'D) God, we're a gullible breed. \nBehind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion. \nKAY (CONT'D) I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that. \nThe Agents look around, confused. \nAGENT JANUS What -- blast? \nKay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started. \nKAY Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms. \nHe jabs a finger into Janus' chest. \nKAY (CONT'D) Especially you. \nDee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him. \nDEE I'm sorry. About...back there. \nKAY Happens. \nDEE Didn't used to. \nHe holds up his hands, which tremble with age. \nDEE (CONT'D) The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of me... \nHe looks up, at the million stars shining overhead. \nDEE (CONT'D) They're beautiful, aren't they? \nKAY What? \nDEE The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore. (back to Kay) I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase. \nKay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it. \nKAY No. You won't. \nEXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT \nA shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN DOWN TO... \nA pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME. \nA new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up. \nEdwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt. \nEDWARDS Stop! NYPD! \nHe continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS, overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air. \nEDWARDS What are you?! \nThe Perp looks down. He decides. \n-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT \nEDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit across from him. \nINSPECTOR Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes? \nEDWARDS No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set. \nSERGEANT Sort of a low beam, high beam. \nINSPECTOR Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces? \nEDWARDS After, sir. \nINSPECTOR And why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events? \nEDWARDS 'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn't keep up, sir. \nSERGEANT Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am -- \nEDWARDS What do you mean? I am half the man you are. \nSERGEANT What the hell is your problem? \nEDWARDS My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time. \nSERGEANT I think he threw him off the roof. Ten minutes -- your best shot. \nINSPECTOR (cutting off the Sergeant) Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside. Now. \nEDWARDS You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT \nA woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him. \nLAUREL Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I believe you. I opened him up. Find me at the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I found. \nEDWARDS Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute. \nLAUREL (turning at the door) You have really pretty eyes. \nShe hurries to turn the corner, but is STOPPED by someone who remains just offscreen. \nVOICE (O.S.) Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office? Working on the John Doe? \nEdwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway. \nLAUREL Yes. That's right. \nVOICE (O.S.) Would you look right here, please. \nThe Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of Edwards's line of vision. \nLAUREL (O.S.) Look where? \nEdwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up -- \n-- when KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. Edwards rolls his eyes. \nKAY Some night, huh? \nEDWARDS Oh, yeah, some night. \nHe crosses to the door. \nKAY They were gills. \nEdwards stops. \nKAY Not eyelids. \nEDWARDS Who are you? \nKAY Did he say anything to you? \nKAY (O.S.) Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs. \nAt the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face. \nJEEBS H-hiya Kay, how are you? \nKAY The imports, Jeebs. Now. \nJEEBS You know I got outta that business a long time ago, Kay. \nKAY Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie. \nHe pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead. \nJEEBS Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here... \nKAY I'm going to count to three. \nEdwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine. \nEDWARDS He'll do it, Jeebs. \nKAY One. \nEDWARDS I've seen him do it. \nKAY Two. \nEDWARDS Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's like this. \nJEEBS He's always crazy. (to Kay) Take a cruise. Get a massage -- \nKAY Three. \nKA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor. Edwards is shocked. \nEdwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head. \nEDWARDS Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter! \nKAY I warned him. \nEDWARDS Drop the weapon! \nKAY You warned him. \nEDWARDS You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. \nKAY Will you relax? \nJEEBS (O.S.) (irritated) Don't do that. \nEdwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs' baby-soft new cheek. \nJEEBS (CONT'D) Do you know how much that hurts? \nKAY Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up another one. \nJeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- \n-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes. \nKAY Edwards? \nEdwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. \nEDWARDS Uh, this. This is what I saw. \nKay looks at Jeebs, pissed off. \nKAY You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid. \nJEEBS He looked all right to me. \nKAY A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target? \nJEEBS I don't know. \nKay raises the weapon again, threatening. \nKAY Jeebs! \nJEEBS I don't know! \nEDGAR (O.S.) You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck! \n-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts. \nEDGAR (O.S.) Stay here! \nThe silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground. \nEDGAR Figures. \nHe walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole. \nIN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights. Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across. \nBEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully. \nBEATRICE What is it, Edgar?! \nEDGAR (turns to her) Get your big butt back in that house! \nBeatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY VOICE comes from deep in the hole. \nVOICE (O.S.) Place projectile weapon on ground. \nEdgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole. \nEDGAR You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers! \nThere is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's. \nVOICE (O.S.) Your proposal is acceptable. \nA long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole. \nFrom deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to the truck. \nIt's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom. \nThe shotgun flies out and lands beside him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind him. He carries the shotgun. \nShe looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank. \nBEATRICE What on earth was it?! \nHe looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than before. More refined. \nEDGAR Sugar. \nPause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck. \nBEATRICE I've never seen sugar do that. \nEDGAR Give me sugar. \nPuzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. She holds it out to him. \nEDGAR (CONT'D) In water. \nFrightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of the sugar into it. \nEDGAR (CONT'D) More. \nShe puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling. \nEdgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck. \nBEATRICE Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just hanging off your bones! \nEdgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He reaches up -- \n-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her. \nEDGAR That better? \nBeatrice faints. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nThe next morning. A door opens on a garage and an ORKIN MAN steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas. The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place. \nThe Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank. \nORKIN MAN Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we? Think we own the place? \nHe unfurls a hose from the side of the tank. \nORKIN MAN (CONT'D) Got a little eviction notice for you, boys. \nHe raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose. \nVOICE (O.S.) Just what exactly do you think you're doing? \nThe Orkin Man turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully. \nORKIN MAN (shrugs) Takin' care of your pest problem. \nEDGAR \"Pest\" problem? \"Pest?\" \nORKIN MAN Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation. \nEdgar advances on him, slowly. \nEDGAR You know, I have noticed an infestation here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives. \nORKIN MAN Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of 'em? \nEDGAR In the worst way. \nEdgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with one hand -- \n-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other. \nTHE ORKIN MAN'S CAR KEYS drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them up. \nEXT. GARAGE - DAY \nA six-by-ten sheet of plywood THUDS to the driveway outside the garage. EDGAR raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin man's van -- now it's a ramp. \nHe walks off and we hear that familiar SCRAPING sound again. Edgar, GRUNTING with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into the back of the Orkin truck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY \nEDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he first came into yesterday. The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him. \nEDWARDS One thing you gotta know right now. \nEdwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY \nInside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues. \nEDWARDS All right. I'm in because there's some next-level shit going on around here, and I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize the skills. So as of now you can cease with all of that calling me \"son\" or \"kid\" or \"sport.\" Cool? \nKAY Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours, \nThe elevator doors -- \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \n-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters. \nKAY As of this moment, they don't mean much. \nIt's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers. \nKAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place. \nKay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien tongues. \nEdwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor. \nPASSPORT OFFICER Purpose of trip? \nARQUILLIAN Diplomatic mission. \nEDWARDS Uh -- forty regular. \nZED Then let's put it on. \nEDWARDS Put what on? \nZED The last suit you'll ever wear. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nLike the rest of the place, the MIB locker room is all white. White walls, white floor, white ceiling, white lockers. ZED'S VOICE comes over: \nZED (O.S.) From now on, you'll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services. \nEDWARDS reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a BLACK SUIT hung from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a BLACK HAT and a pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nKAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. ZED'S VOICE continues: \nZED (O.S.) You'll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you, get approval for any expenditure over a hundred dollars. \nINT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY \nEDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth. \nHe holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints. \nZED (O.S.) You will have no identifying marks of any kind.  You will not stand out in any way. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nOne by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards. \nOn the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name. \nZED (O.S.) Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nPants come off the hanger. The white shirt is removed. \nMore letters are eliminated from his name. It reads \"JAMES DARREL ED...\" then \"JAMES DARR...\" \nZED (O.S.) You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't exist; you were never even born. \nThe coat is removed. The hat comes off the shelf. \nZED (O.S.) Anonymity is your name. Silence your native tongue. \n\"JAMES...\" \"JAM...\" \nZED (O.S.) You are no longer part of \"the system.\" We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it. \nFeet slip into black shoes. A belt is buckled. A tie pushed up. \nZED (O.S.) We're \"them.\" We're \"they.\" \nOn screen, all that's left is the letter \"J.\" \nAs the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve. Monogrammed on the cuff is, simply, the letter \"J.\" \nZED (O.S.) We are the Men in Black. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nLooking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS III -- or, rather, JAY -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at KAY. \nJAY The difference between you and me? \nHe slips on the sunglasses. \nJAY (CONT'D) I make this look good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING \nWe are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor. \nWe see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan. \nKay hands them back. \nKAY (CONT'D) Your resident card has you restricted to the five boroughs only. Where do you think you're going? \nREDGICK It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look! \nKay leans down and looks in the window. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast. \nKAY Oh God. How soon? \nMrs. Redgick SCREAMS in pain. Real soon. For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous. \nKAY (CONT'D) Okay. All right. No big deal. (to Jay) You handle it. \nJAY Me? \nKAY Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch. \nMrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried. \nREDGICK Are you sure he knows what he's doing? \nKAY Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time. C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask you something. \nKay gives Jay a supportive SLAP on the back and leads Redgick away, to the rear of the car. Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door, tentatively. He leans down, into the car. \nJAY Oh God! I see it I see it I see it! \nA few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him. \nKAY Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town. \nREDGICK Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone. \nSuddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold. \nJAY Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see that?! \nKAY (still to Redgick) So? Who you meeting? \nREDGICK Well, it's -- a ship. \nKAY Really? I didn't see a departure clearance for today. \nREDGICK You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency. \nNow a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight. He GASPS, choking. \nJAY Guys -- guys -- \nKAY Doin' fine, Ace. (back to Redgick) What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden? \nJAY (choking to death) Help?! HELP! Hello?! \nHe starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to pull the baby out. \nREDGICK We just don't like the neighborhood anymore. Some of the -- new arrivals. \nRedgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away. \nKAY What new arrivals? This have anything to do with the crasher from last night? \nJAY (Screaming) Can you guys do this later?! \nBut in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires leverage, and RIPS the baby free. He falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest. \nJAY (CONT'D) Oh -- oh -- oh -- man. \nKay turns and claps Redgick on the back. \nKAY Congratulations! It's a lizard. \nJay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest. \nJAY (misty) Hey, you know, it is sorta -- \nIt vomits on him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY \nBack in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car. \nBEATRICE And they said to me, \"If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?\" And I must admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him. It was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit. \nA little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase, notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to skin a deer. \nJAY Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an alien... \nBEATRICE Sorry? \nKAY Go on. \nBEATRICE Anyway, when I came to, he was gone. \nKAY Did he say anything? \nBEATRICE Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember. \nKAY Sugar water. \nJAY Did you taste her lemonade? \nKay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to Jay. \nKay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him. \nKAY Ray Bans. (pulling off Jay's sunglasses) Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus -- \nJAY Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you give her a new one? \nKAY Standard issue neuralyzer. \nJAY And that's the best you can come up with? \nKAY On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off. \nJAY (butting in) Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked him out, and now that he's gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or something... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nKAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts colors.  Red. Then Yellow. \nJAY (from up outside the hole) Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those memory things? \nThe spectral analyzer turns blue. \nKAY When you're ready. (re: analyzer) Please -- not green. \nPurple. And then green. \nKay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. Above him, JAY leans over, staring down. Kay looks up at him. \nKAY (CONT'D) Do you know what alien life form leaves a green spectral trail? \nJAY Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the question on Final Jeopardy last night. \nAT THE CAR, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone. \nKAY (softly, into mic) Zed, we have a bug. \nHe turns off the radio and sighs. Jay stands next to him. \nJAY I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess that this is bad. Right? \nKAY Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species. \nJAY So basically you have a racial problem with all insect-based life forms? \nKAY Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun? \nJAY What do we do? \nKAY With a bug in town? Watch the morgues. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY \nROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. \nA moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. \nINT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY \nLater, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with COPS and flashing lights. THREE BODIES, now on stretchers and covered with sheets, are being loaded into the back of ambulances. \nROSENBERG'S CAT races out of a UNIFORMED COP's arms and leaps onto one of the stretchers, MEOWING mournfully. The Uniformed Cop turns to a POLICE INSPECTOR who is questioning the WOMAN from the diner. \nCOP What am I supposed to do with the cat? \nINSPECTOR I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let family claim it. \nThe Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its dead owner for the time being. \nThe doors of the wagon SLAM shut. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with \"City Morgue\" written across them. The words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors. \nINT. MORGUE - DAY \nThe city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body. \nCOP Where do you want contestant number three? \nThe coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand. \nLAUREL By the wall, I guess. (noticing) What's with the cat? \nCOP Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat. Sign here. \nLaurel signs his clipboard. \nLAUREL What's the problem with the cat? \nCOP Your problem. \nLaurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently. \nLAUREL Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up. (of Rosenberg) His is worse. \nShe sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) Okey-dokey. Shall we? \nINT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY \nLaurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from the overhead spot that illuminates her work. \nFascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her face a mixture of alarm and excitement. \nLAUREL Oh, my God. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nKay's LTD pulls up in front of the morgue. \nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTwo men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end. \nJAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission. \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nIn the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms. ROSENBERG'S CAT sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. Suddenly, the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently. \nLaurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her chair. JAY and KAY stand in the doorway, staring at her. Kay steps forward, holding out that black card again. It reforms into another kind of official ID, this time it says \"DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH\" \nLAUREL (into recorder) ...approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described as...well...as really... \nKAY (O.S.) Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White. \nShe looks up. Jay and Kay are standing there. \nLAUREL Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm going to need to see some ID. \nHe hands her his CARTE NOIR, which changes to read \"Dr. Menville, Department of Public Health.\" She hands it back. \nLAUREL (checking her watch) You boys must not have much of a home life. \nKAY We watch the morgues very carefully. You've got something unusual? \nKAY What do you think? \nJAY (of Laurel) Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin' on. \nKAY Of the body. \nJAY Great body. \nKAY The dead body? \nJAY Not a clue. \nKAY All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to sound too dumb. \nACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay. \nLAUREL Dr. White. \nJay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) (louder) Dr. White. (still louder) Dr. White. \nHe still doesn't answer. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) (shouting) DR. WHITE! \nKay nudges Jay. \nKAY You're up, Slugger. \nJay turns and races across the room to rejoin her. \nLAUREL Look at this. \nJay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear. \nJAY What is that? \nHe reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft CLICK -- \n-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch. \nJay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull. \nA TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD. \nThough not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull. \nLAUREL Far -- freaking -- out. \nThey lean in closer. The Tiny Little Green Man (a BALTIAN) forces words out of his mouth. \nBALTIAN Must -- to pre -- prevent -- (searching for the word) -- contest? No...to prevent -- \nJAY It's all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle? \nLAUREL War? \nThe Baltian nods vigorously. That's it. \nBALTIAN (faltering) Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's -- (thinks) What is word? Be...? \nJAY Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt? \nThe Baltian nods again, falls, and dies. Jay and Laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other. \nJAY (CONT'D) \"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt?\"  The hell does that mean? (turns around) Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come here! \nKay begins over. Laurel looks at them. \nLAUREL \"Doctor Whatever\"? You're not with the Department of Public Health, are you? \nJay shakes his head -- but is now paying more attention to Kay, as he leads him toward the Little Man. \nJAY He's dead. \nKay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man. \nKAY Rosenberg. Damn. Good man. \nJAY You knew him? \nKAY One of the few I actually liked. Exiled High Prince. \nJAY The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck from the picture! That's him! \nJay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar. \nKAY (picking himself up) Damn it. \nKay runs out after Jay. \nEXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nEdgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The engine ROARS. \nJay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into some pedestrians, while his SHOT... \nHits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly. \nEdgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire. \nJAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in the woman driver's face. \nWhen Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him. He yanks Jay out of the car. \nKAY We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public. \nJAY Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up the world if we don't... \nKAY There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it. \nKay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There's smoking rubble everywhere. \nKAY Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving town. We've got his ship. \nAfter gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone. \nKAY (into phone) Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nBack at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over, and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right. \nZED is in his office. \nZED Containment may be a moot point, my friend. The exodus continues. It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check. \nZed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor. \nZED You sorry little ingrates! \nKAY (O.S.) What about the Arquillians? \nZED We've only translated a part of the message so far: \"Deliver the Galaxy.\" \nKAY (O.S.) No, they don't want much, do they? \nZED Oh, it gets better... They're holding us responsible. \nHe looks up at the screen. It reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY. \nZED Another contestant has entered the ring. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE) \nAs Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay \nKAY All right, kid. The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We need help. A professional. Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY \nThe tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away, fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar. \nEDGAR Where do you keep your dead? \nVENDOR (thinks) I don't have any dead. \nEDGAR Where?! \nVENDOR I don't know, the city morgue! \nEdgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a postcard display marked \"LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA.\" Edgar stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out and picks up a color postcard. \nHe raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off. \nLAUREL Boy, when you want attention -- \nShe pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light. Laurel turns the name tag to face her. \nCLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD \"ORION.\" \nAs it is written across the collar of the cat. \nLAUREL (O.S) \"Orion.\" That's a pretty name. \nFrom out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING. \nLaurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened, translucent material, light green in color. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) What's this? \nShe peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement. \nINT. ICON - DAY \nIt's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed of light. \nINT. MORGUE - DAY \nLAUREL Wow. \nOutside, the bell DINGS again. Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out there, and not liking it. She SNARLS at the door and leaps off the desk, scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment. \nINT./EXT. LTD - MANHATTAN - DAY \nJay and Kay barrel through town. \nJAY So two galaxies have been fighting for years. And the only people who've been benefiting are a race of creatures called bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make peace...and the bugs send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops. \nKAY By killing the emissaries, and stealing the galaxy they've been fighting about. \nJAY And if we don't get it back before he leaves the planet...we're history. \nKAY We're not even history. 'Cause history implies there's someone around to remember it. \nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nOn a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand BANGS on a bell on a countertop, over and over. The hand belongs to EDGAR, who is carrying his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. The morgue attendant, TONY, emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged and a fly swatter. \nTONY Thank you for making sure the bell works. \nSuddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces. \nTONY (CONT'D) (to Edgar) What's up, Farmer John? \nEDGAR A man came in here earlier. A dead man. \nTONY And this means what to me? \nEDGAR He was a very dear friend of mine. And I believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. I would like it back. \nTONY I'll need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with -- \nWHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth. \nTONY (CONT'D) -- the deceased. \nEDGAR Don't -- do that. \nWHACK! Still another fly goes down. \nTONY Do what? \nTony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve. \nTONY (CONT'D) Shit! \nHe ducks under the counter -- \n-- and comes up with a can of Raid. Edgar's eyes bug out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MORGUE - DAY \nKay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out. \nJAY I'll handle this one, you wait outside. \nJAY Now slow down, you don't have to hit the gas like that. \nShe leans in and lowers her voice. \nLAUREL You don't understand. You really need to see this. \nJAY And I will. But we gotta get something straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not some kind of macho trip, it's just the way I'm used to doing things, okay? \nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nKay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp SIZZLE. \nKay furrows his brow. Odd. \nINT. MORGUE - DAY \nLaurel is at the end of her rope. \nLAUREL Look, Stud, I don't know how many more times I'm going to get to tell you this. There's something -- \nShe points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her. \nLAUREL (CONT'D) -- that you have to help me with. \nJay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out.  He starts to reach for his gun. \nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nKay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close, a BIG GLOB OF GOO drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the flame. \nKay looks up, sharply. \nAbove him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand. \nFrom inside the morgue, Laurel SCREAMS. \nINT. MORGUE - DAY \nKay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it. \nNow everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own. \nKAY Freeze it, Bug! \nJAY Don't shoot! Don't shoot! \nLAUREL (to Jay) CHRIST, are you THICK! \nJAY How was I supposed to know!?! \nLAUREL What did I have to do, SING it for you!?! \nJAY Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken prom date! \nLAUREL Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just -- \nEDGAR Everybody shut UP! \nKAY Let her go, Shit Eater. \nEDGAR Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?! \nKAY You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches to your left and I'll solve all your problems. \nORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth. Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. The cat squirms in his arm, the icon jangling. Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat away, across the morgue. The icon comes free, remaining in his hand. \nHe drops it into his mouth and swallows. He shoves the gun hard against Laurel's cheek. \nEDGAR That's better. Now put down your weapons. We're leaving. \nKay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. Standoff. \nEDGAR (CONT'D) Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly? \nEdgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she CRIES OUT in pain. \nEDGAR (CONT'D) Would you care to see the fly get even? \nKAY How far you think you'll get without your ship? If that's what you call that hunk of space crap we've got back at our office. \nEDGAR Put the weapons down! \nKAY Never gonna happen, Insect. \nFrom outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel. We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on. \nKAY Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I should quit. I've tried. Never took, though. I'm beginning to think I lack self-control. \nAnd they disappear out the other end of the tunnel -- \nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT \n-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat. \nKAY Well, back to work. \nHe flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left. \nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT \nApproaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window -- \n-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT \nEDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top. \nLAUREL Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I'm not trying to impress you with this, I'm just letting you know. It could start a war. \nEDGAR Good. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness. \nLAUREL You're a wonderful dad. \nAnd with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS HERSELF out, into the air. \nEdgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the air -- \n-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground. \nAbove, Edgar just keeps climbing. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \nOver at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds. \nAT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of latches, and opens it, revealing -- \n-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet. \nThree feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up the clip. \nJAY You know how to work that? \nKay pumps it once, with extreme confidence. \nKAY No idea whatsoever. \nHe SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their columns in the distance. \nKAY (CONT'D) Let's bag us some bug. \nAs if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin, faster and faster. The ship begins to rise. \nJAY Oh, shit. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT \nLaurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement. \nEXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT \nAt Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible. \nBut at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the ball is headed. \nAll eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops -- \n-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \nKay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay. \nKAY Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor -- \nKay starts walking after the Bug. \nKAY Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on that ship. \nJAY Where are you going? \nKAY Getting my gun back. \nJAY What!? \nKay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug. \nKAY (CONT'D) Hey, Bug! \nThe Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder. \nKAY (CONT'D) I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper? \nThe Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien hug. \nEXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT \nShe quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the woods. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT \nKay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's face. \nKAY You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me! \nThe Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth. \nThe Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS his way down into its abdomen. \nJAY looks on, in stunned horror... \nAS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nLaurel is still watching. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT \nJay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally defeated. But... \nHe can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach... \nCLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach, we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY! \nINT. BUG - NIGHT \nKay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \nJay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug. \nJAY Hey! Come over here and try that! \nThe concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just keeps moving. \nJay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug. \nJAY Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on your waxy, pointed ass! \nJay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole. \nINT. BUG - NIGHT \nKay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \nThe Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass. \nThe Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay -- \n-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the grass. \nJay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him. \nHe grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug's gut, when; \nKay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay. \nThe Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head flying behind Jay. \nKay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers. \nThe other gun sails off into the darkness. \nThe ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor. \nHe calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay. \nJAY You son of a -- \nKay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number. \nKAY Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We have the galaxy. \nINT. MIB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nZed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. He glances over at the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. The red lights are coming back on. \nZED I think the word's already out. Our friends are coming back. (then) Got an authorized landing at Times Square. You and Jay check it out on the way back... And pick me up one of those soft pretzels, while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like celebrating. \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \nKay flips the phone closed. \nKAY You were saying? \nJAY Getting eaten!? That was your plan!? \nKAY (shrugs) Worked. \nAs they argue, behind them, unseen, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG RAISES ITSELF UP on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready to lower itself onto Kay and Jay. \nJAY After I got the shit beat out of me! \nKAY And I almost got digested. It goes with the job. \nJAY You coulda told me what you were doing. \nKAY There wasn't time, sport! \nHISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads... \nBOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further. \nThey turn to see... \nLAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards. \nLAUREL Interesting job you guys got. \nON THE SKY. Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air. \nINT. A CAR ON THE ADJOINING FREEWAY - NIGHT \nThe driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield. He winces. \n-- AND THE BUG'S REMAINS SPLAT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD. \nThe driver grimaces at the mess. \nDRIVER Damn bugs. \nHe reaches down and hits a button. Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT \nKay's LTD is parked outside Men in Black headquarters. LAUREL leans her back against the car.  We see JAY and KAY walking away in the distance. \nJAY Look, I know we got rules, but she did just bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you don't have to flashy thing her. \nKay pulls out the neuralyzer. \nJAY Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people. \nKAY Not her. Me. (looking up at the sky) They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful. \nJAY Kay, you're scaring your partner. \n", "test1_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY \nSEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table. \nThere's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each other, at the blank walls... \nEDWARDS Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're doing here? \nMARINE (clipped, unquestioning) Looking for the best of the best of the best. \nEDWARDS (can't help but smile) Well, yeah, I know, but... \nAnd then .. suddenly -- \nThe two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously. \nThe Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last. \nThere's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards. \nZED The hell happened? \nEDWARDS Hesitated, sir. \nZed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl. \nZED May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die? \nEDWARDS She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time. \nZED And how did you come to that conclusion? \nEDWARDS Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's not his head. His head is that butt-ugly bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow, the girl's books were way too advanced for an eight-year-old's. And besides, from where I'm looking, she was the only one who appeared to have a motive. And I don't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it. \nSideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs. \nEDWARDS (CONT'D) Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision. \nZED He's got a real problem with authority. \nKAY So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed. On foot. Tenacity. That I can use. \nZED I hope you know what you're doing. \nZed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group. \nZed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off. \nZED (CONT'D) Congratulations, you're everything we've come to expect from years of government training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer, an eye exam. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nThe RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway. \nKAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night. \nEDWARDS You! Hey, what's goin' on? \nThe other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer, just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does. \nKAY Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet. \nAs they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket. \nZED Now, if you'll look directly at the end of this device. \nHe holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses. \nEdwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away, just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nAs KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs. \nHe hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger. \n", "test1_true": "Another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering in the night sky -- classic flying saucer shapes. \nKAY (CONT'D) There were nine of us that night. Seven agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road. \nYet another photograph, this one showing a young KAY, in a shirt and tie, holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed flying saucer. ALIEN SHAPES are visible within. \nEDWARDS You brought the aliens flowers? \nKay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first. \nKAY They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet.  Ever see \"Casablanca?\" Same thing, no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all evidence of their landing. \nAnother picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each. \nEDWARDS The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup? \nKAY Why else would we hold it in Queens? (another hallway) Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret. \nEDWARDS I see. Not to change the subject, but when was your last cat-scan? \nKAY Every six months; it's company policy. \nEDWARDS Well, thanks for the very amusing morning, but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came in?  'Cause this is where I go out. \nThey have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps inside. \nKAY Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee while we're right here. \nAs Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and he stares in wonderment -- \n-- at THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Tall, impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of Esperanto and microphone feedback. \nKAY (CONT'D) (to the aliens) Don't tell me we've only got that powdered shit for cream again? \nOne of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter. \nKAY (CONT'D) Oh. \nHe finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated, dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind him. He reaches up and gently pushes Edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth. \nKAY (CONT'D) For future reference, this is a better look for you. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY \nEDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk. \nKAY Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living. \nEDWARDS Cab drivers? \nKAY Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want one, either. They're happy. They think they've got a pretty good bead on things. \nEDWARDS Why the big secret? People are smart, they can handle it. \nKAY A person is smart. People are dumb. Everything they've ever \"known\" has been proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact, that the earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, they knew it was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow. \nEDWARDS So what's the catch? \nKAY What you'll gain in perspective, you'll lose in ways you're too young to comprehend. You give up everything. Sever every human contact. No one will know you exist. Ever. \nEDWARDS Nobody? \nKAY You're not even allowed a favorite shirt. There.  That's the speech I never heard. That's the choice I never got. \nEDWARDS Hold up. You track me down, put me through those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying to talk me out of it. I don't get it. \nKAY You got 'til sun-up. \nEDWARDS Is it worth it? \nKAY You find out, you let me know. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK \nAlmost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out. \nSlowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens. \n", "test1_id": 1527, "test2_input": "As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building. \nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING \nDespite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION ORION. \nJay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads for Zed. \nJAY Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around here? \nZED The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months -- you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a psychotic episode. \nHe points up at the screen with a laser pencil. \nZED Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky... (pointing) and here's Orion's belt -- \nHe indicates the three stars that make up the belt. \nJAY That's what the little guy was talking about, \"To prevent war, the galaxy's on Orion's belt...\" \nZED There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars. (switches off the laser pointer) You heard wrong. \nJAY You're attracted to me, aren't you? \nJay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone, tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word \"SEARCHING\" blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest. \nOn screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to \"SUBJECT ACQUIRED.\" \nThe image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind him. \nJay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at Kay's expression, then back at the monitor. \nJAY Pretty lady... \nKay clicks off the picture of her. Jay drags a chair and sits down. \nJAY (CONT'D) You were the guy with the flowers in the photo, (the night the aliens arrived.) (What, you were on your way to a dance or something and you got lost? And she never got those flowers, did she?] \nKay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight. \nJAY (CONT'D) Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She ever get married? \nKAY No. \nIt's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen: SUBJECT LOST Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at him: \"Is this me in thirty years?\" A moment goes by. Finally: \nJAY Well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have -- \nKAY Try it. \nZED (O.S.) Kay. \nJay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering LIGHT. \nSome lights are starting to go out. \nKAY (quietly, with dread) They're leaving. \nZED We've had twelve jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the beginning. \nJAY What do they know that we don't know? \nKay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out. \nKAY Why do rats desert the ship? (to the twins) Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan. \nON THE SCREEN New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern coast of the United States. \nKAY (CONT'D) Four hundred. \nNow there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual. \nKAY (CONT'D) Four thousand. \nNow we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see something that doesn't belong in this picture: \nA BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth. The words \"LEVEL FOUR\" flash in red letters on one side of the map. \nKAY (CONT'D) That's an Arquillian battle cruiser. \nJAY And we've got a dead Arquillian prince. \nA COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender. \n", "test2_true": "The communication continues. \nKAY (CONT'D) Speak of the devil. \nThe communication continues. \nJAY They sound pissed. \nZED (to the twins) Translate that and step on it! (to Kay) Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and see what you can turn up. \nKay and Jay walk away. \nZED (CONT'D) And Kay -- take a lot of fire power. \nIN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED HAND GUN. A small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious swirling gases visible through its walls. \nJAY I like that. \nKAY Series four de-atomizer. \nKay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN. \nKAY (CONT'D) Here. We call this the \"Noisy Cricket.\" \nJAY You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a \"Noisy Cricket?!\" (looks at the gun) I'm afraid I'm going to break it. \nJay follows Kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position, pointed down at the unwitting planet below. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nSMASH! The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses in a shower of glass. EDGAR reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing them one by one. He gets them all and steps inside. Out the window behind him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front. \nAll the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside. \nOutside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van and starts to hitch up. \nEdgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring intently at it. It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to Rosenberg. \nFrom outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the ground. \nEXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nEDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist. \nEDGAR That's my truck! \nDRIVER And make sure you tell them that at the impound. \nEdgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun. \nDRIVER (CONT'D) I got worse. \nHe keeps hitching up the van. Two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. We go with them, and realize that it's -- \n-- JAY and KAY. They stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and exchange a glance. Kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and they step inside. \nINT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY \nThey look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay furrows his brow. \nJAY Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels? \nKAY Someone who's not looking for jewels. \nJay moves behind the counter. On the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow. There are several PHOTOS OF A CAT on the wall. \nThere is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay picks up one of the COLLARS, inspects it closely, shaking his head. \nJAY This guy had a serious crush on his cat. \nJay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside, lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR. \nJay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face? \nSuddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the driver's shotgun. Before Edgar can shoot, Jay YELLS... \nJAY Kay! GET DOWN! \nAnd then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up. \n", "test2_id": 1528, "test3_input": "JAY WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?! \nZED Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond. \nJAY A galactic standard week? How the hell long is that? \nKAY One hour. \nJAY One hour? \nViewing the screen, it now reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED... SORRY \nZED To keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and whatever planet it's on. \nJAY You're talking about US! \nZED Sucks, doesn't it? \nKAY Pull up the locations of all land-based interstellar vehicles. \nZED They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the last ship on the planet. \nAs Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks back towards the center of the room, deep in thought. Over him we hear: \nKAY Atlantic City? \nZED Gone. \nKAY That landfill on the Jersey Shore? \nZED Gone. \nJAY Uh, gentlemen. \nKAY Epcot? \nZED Gone. \nKAY Miami Beach? \nZED Gone. \nJAY Fellas. \nKAY Hartford? \nZED Gone, thank God. \nJAY Hey. Old guys. \nKay and Zed both look up at once, scowling. \nJAY (CONT'D) Do those still work? \nThey follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by -- \n-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT \n-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her. \nEDGAR You're coming with me. \nLAUREL What?! Why?! \nEDGAR It's a long trip. I'll need a snack. \nAnd he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships. \nBehind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the front of the postcard he's been carrying around. \"FLUSHING MEADOWS, SITE OF THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR,\" it says, with a distinctive photograph of the spaceships. \nSo that's how he knew. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nThe LTD tears through the city. \nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT \nKay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel. \nJAY You're taking the tunnel?! \nKAY You know a better way to Queens? \nJAY It's usually jammed?! \nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT \nThe LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a few seconds, but then they round a bend -- \n-- and there's a traffic jam up ahead. \nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT \nKay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life. \nJAY I told you! \nKAY Jay. The button? \nJAY Yeah?! \nKAY Push the button, Jay. \nA LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats, and that red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again. Jay flips back the plastic cover and JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button. \nKAY (CONT'D) And you may want to throw on a seat belt. \nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT \nAs the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of endoskeleton pushes the \"normal\" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons. \nKay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from underneath it. \nInstead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below. \nIt keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel. \nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT \nJay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath. \nAs they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill. \nKAY Mind if I smoke? \nJAY What?!? \nKAY In the car, I mean. \nJAY I don't care!! \nKAY Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers some people if you smoke in a car. \nHe lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the wheel, just waiting out the tunnel.

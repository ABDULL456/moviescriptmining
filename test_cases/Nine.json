Your films did that. \nGUIDO (buoyed by her encouragement) I miss you. \nMAMMA I miss you, too. \nGuido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone in the car. \nGuido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone. \nEXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY \nThe convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto. \nAs soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at him. Guido moves quickly by them. \nDante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles Dante. \nAnd they hurry after Guido. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY \nA big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are in the room, and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background. \nRADIO REPORTER And we're just waiting for the arrival of Contini...any moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top? \nA few news cameras are filming.    There's a buffet, and a bartender. \nAnd Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the team follow him in. \nRADIO REPORTER (CONT'D) And here he is..! p. 11 \nDANTE Silenzio, per favore...Thank you, thank you... \nRADIO REPORTER Dante, Guido Contini's long time producer, is about to speak... \nDANTE I want to say a few words from my heart. I am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that I am producing Guido Contini's next film, Italia, which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, Claudia Jenssen... \nA stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement. \nDANTE (CONT'D) ...we start shooting in ten days time in Cinecitta. That makes it one week from Monday. (to Guido, handing over) Thank you, Maestro, thank you very much. This is our ninth film together. Guido Contini. \nGUIDO Thanks for coming, everybody. \nPretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses Dante on the cheek. \nHe returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their questions at once. The questions come on top of each other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman. \nDINARDO Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini. \nGUIDO Yes. \nDINARDO Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia... big title. \nAnother journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt. p. 12 \nGUIDO Actually, it's my shortest title yet. \nDINARDO But hardly a modest one. \nGUIDO Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles. \nDINARDO And might you tell the press what the film is about? \n", "test1_true": "LEOPARDI (In a loud aside to Dinardo) That was the problem. Nobody else did. \nGUIDO Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press. \nGeneral laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps in. \nDANTE Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream. \nLEOPARDI Is this true? \nGUIDO It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to see it. \nHe's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she wants him and he senses it. p. 13 \nSTEPHANIE Signor Contini. \nGUIDO Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is this year? \nGUIDO I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it. \nREPORTER ONE Signor Contini! You're a man of the world, yes? Educated in Britain, a home in Biarritz. With Italia is it fair to say that you've come home for good? \nREPORTER TWO (O.S.) (tries to interrupt) What do you think of the New Wave in the French Cinema? \nGUIDO For good? \nREPORTER FOUR It's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife, do you plan on casting her in this new film? \nGuido is spinning plates. \nGUIDO I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady. \nREPORTER FOUR But she hasn't worked at all since working with you. \nLaughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido again. Another REPORTER asks a question. \nREPORTER FIVE But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film? It's a serious question. What's the big deal? p. 14 \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nWe discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his unfinished set. A retreat into surreality. He sits on the same couch from the hotel suite. He slouches, arms folded, legs crossed, with his hat pulled over his eyes. \nGUIDO I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.

Every time we have to start again. \nGUIDO I'm trying to find it. \nLILLI You won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass. \nGUIDO Ashtray. \nShe produces one. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) Thanks. You were saying - my head is jammed up my ass. \nLILLI Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream up something entertaining, Guido? Something with music...with dancing... God knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here... \nGuido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her and sees... p. 38 \nFANTASY: \nINT.\"SOUNDSTAGE\" \n...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the same straw hat on her head. \nThe soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the 1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills the smoky atmosphere. \nLILLI (singing and performing in a french accent) LE CINEMA TODAY IS IN A CRISIS DIRECTORS ARE SO EXISTENTIALISTES. THE MOVIES ARE NOT WORTH THEIR ENTRANCE PRICES IF NO ONE SINGS A LOVE SONG WHEN HE'S KISSED. LOVE CANNOT BE LOVE WITHOUT \"LE SINGING,\" A STRING, A CLARINET, A SAXOPHONE TAKE A LESSON FROM THIS OLD PARISIENNE AND THE FINEST ENTERTAINMENT SHE HAS KNOWN. \nBehind a black scrim, ghostly images come to life. Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic SHOWGIRLS barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers. They descend the grand staircase. \nLILLI (CONT'D) FOLIES BERGERE- WHAT A SHOWING OF COLOR, COSTUME, AND DANCING! NOT A MOMENT IN LIFE COULD BE MORE ENTRANCING THAN AN EVENING YOU SPEND AUX FOLIES BERGERE. FOLIES BERGERE, NOT A SOUL IN THE WORLD COULD BE IN DESPAIR WHEN HE IS GLANCING AT THE FABULOUS STAGE DES FOLIES BERGERE \nThe showgirls disappear. Lilli comes down from the piano and crosses onto the stage. The scrim rises. From every corner, more showgirls begin to enter. p. 39 \nLILY                           SHOWGIRLS FOLIES BERGERE-               OOH LA LA LA MUSIQUE, LA DANSE, LE SON, LA LUMIERE!

Je suis la vedette des Folies Bergere. Vedette, it means 'star.' \nLilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage: \nLILLI (CONT'D) Let me tell you. Last night I looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now, and what did I see? A priest! And next to him? \nSuddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience. \nLILLI (CONT'D) Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini? What are you doing here at the Folies Bergere? You naughty boy! You're only nine years old! But I'm glad you've come. Would you like to join me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come, come. \nAnd she brings him onto the stage. The audience applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older Guido. \nLILLI (CONT'D) Feeling better? There's no room for hopelessness in here, is there, Guido? (to the audience) We must explain something to our young Guido. What do we want? Laughter! What do we want? Love! What do we want? Dreams! Let us not forget, Guido, mon cher -- That's our privilege - to entertain. p. 40 \nThe number kicks into full gear with a rousing can-can. Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's intoxicating world. \nLILLI AND SHOWGIRLS FOLIES BERGERE THE MUSIC, THE LIGHTS, AND THE LAUGHTER, THE ANSWER TO WHAT YOU ARE AFTER EACH NIGHT AT THE FOLIES BERGERE. FOLIES BERGERE \nLILLI BY THE HEAVENS ABOVE, YOU WILL SWEAR THERE'S NOTHING RARER! \nLILLI AND SHOWGIRLS THAN THE FOLIES BERGERE \nLilli crosses the proscenium.

GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT \nWe seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure on the top of the staircase. p. 41 \nHe moves round to the front of the model and places another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He knocks it over. \nUnconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of Claudia.   Guido looks at it. \nHe lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair. He starts to sign - \"TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... \" then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself. Claudia laughs. \nINT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY \nGrottos and tunnels are thick with steam.    Guido follows the Cardinal's Secretary. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY The Cardinal is right this way. \nThe Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area, where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of hot water. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY (CONT'D) Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here. \nThe Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to get into the tub with the Cardinal. Guido gets in the water. The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes his first pronouncement. \nCARDINAL I like Charlie Chaplin. \nGUIDO Me too. \nCARDINAL A genius. What can I do for you? \nGUIDO Do you believe in God? \nThe Cardinal's Secretary is shocked. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Signor Contini, please. \nCARDINAL No, no, it's an honest question.    Yes, I believe in God. p. 42 \nGUIDO So do I. \nCARDINAL Are you a Catholic? \nGUIDO Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying. \nCARDINAL Try harder. \nGUIDO Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your Eminence, I am not happy. I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair and -- \nCARDINAL (interrupting) I saw your films. Not the flops, the others, the good ones. But you think people need to see so much sex?   It's not necessary. We can all imagine. \nGUIDO (laughing) Excuse me - my films are what I imagine. \nCARDINAL Then your imagination has no moral training. \nGUIDO (nonplussed) How do you train the imagination? \nCARDINAL The imagination is God's garden; don't let the Devil play in it. Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores, don't make us look at filth and debauchery. Make us proud to be Italian... \nGuido's head disappears under the water.    The sound of the Cardinal's voice trails away... p. 43 \n", "test2_id": 2131, "test3_input": "CARLA What? What? \nGUIDO I can't breathe, I can't breathe. \nCARLA Guido, don't die on me! Can you imagine... poor Luigi! It would kill him. \nGUIDO (finding her ridiculous) If I die it would kill your husband? \nGuido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. Carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back. \nCARLA No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. Where are you going? \nGUIDO I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe. \nGuido stands up and picks up his shirt. He puts it on whilst they argue. \nCARLA Let me come with you. \nGUIDO It's impossible. \nCARLA Why? \nGUIDO Because it's impossible. Please. \nCARLA But why is it impossible? Look at your producer! He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why? Why won't you let me near you? \nGUIDO For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife. p. 48 \nCARLA See, you're playing with me. You're twisting everything... Please let me come with you. \nGUIDO No. \nGuido heads towards the door, still dressing. \nCARLA I'll be here waiting for you with my legs open. \nDisgusted with himself, he leaves. \nINT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT \nGlittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea. A pop band and a dance floor.   A slick Italian MALE SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance. The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner. Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas, struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia - \nGUIDO Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man... (pours himself a glass of wine) Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro. (to Lilli) Like the circus... \nDANTE Claudia is going to be amazing. \nBENITO It sounds like a masterpiece. \nFAUSTO (hissing at Dante) Dante, you see, he hasn't written a word... \nDANTE (defending his director) The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map. p. 49 \nGUIDO Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert. \nLILLI Guido. \nShe nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see his wife at the entrance looking for him... \nGUIDO Luisa! \nHe jumps up from the table and hurries towards the dance floor, genuinely happy. \nON THE DANCE FLOOR: \n", "test3_true": "GUIDO (CONT'D) I can't believe you came. \nLUISA The jungle drums said it was an emergency. \nGUIDO The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit. \nLUISA Not entirely. (with concern) You haven't been sleeping. \nGUIDO I was dying, until just now.    Come. \nHe pulls her into the middle of the dance floor.    They start to dance. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) And don't think I forgot your birthday. When you get home, the house will be full of flowers... \nLUISA Am I already going home? \nGUIDO I hope not. Happy Birthday, my darling. p. 50 \nThey move together, enjoying each other.   She kisses him. \nThey walk towards the table. \nAT THE TABLE: \nDANTE (Seeing Luisa) Here she is. At last.   Magnificent. You know Donatella? \nLUISA I do now. \nShe leans across to kiss Lilli. \nHe sits Luisa down, goes to grab a bottle of champagne. \nLUISA (CONT'D) (to Lilli) Thank you for calling. \nLILLI (confidentially) You're saving the movie. Give him a good idea, for God's sake. \nLuisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle of champagne. \nGUIDO Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday. \nLUISA (negating it) It was Monday. \nDANTE Happy Birthday! \nLUISA (not quite able to forgive him) Thank you. \nGUIDO Happy Birthday. \nJust then, the Cardinal's Secretary appears.   Heads towards the table. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Maestro. p. 51 \nGUIDO (standing up to greet him, then turning to Luisa) Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling, this is Don Mario. This is my wife, Luisa. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY A pleasure, Signora. \nLUISA Sit down, won't you, Don Mario? \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Oh no. \nLUISA Please. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY I was telling your husband how much I admire his movies. Publicly, you know the Church condemns them - we have to - but we all love them. (To Guido) Last year we did our own version of your Il Vicolo at the Christmas Party. \n", "test3_id": 2132}

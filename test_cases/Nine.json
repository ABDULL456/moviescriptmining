{"train": "NINE \nWritten by \nMichael Tolkin & Anthony Minghella \nFinal Script November 11, 2009 \nINT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference. \nGUIDO You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive. \nREPORTER (O.S.) So what's your favorite pasta? \nGUIDO Finally, a serious question. \nLaughter.   A word: \nNINE \nINT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT \nA huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a man into the stage, turns on a working light. \nSUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965 \nSTUDIO SUPERINTENDENT Good luck, Maestro. \nDeparting, he closes the soundstage door. \nAs the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard. GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the world. In front of him: \nAN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins. Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands. p. 2 \nGuido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane. \nGuido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas. \nGuido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed. \nTHE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES \nGUIDO (V.O.) Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing... \nIn the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An escape from his tortured reality. \nThe figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of GUIDO'S FANTASY. \nAs Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius. \nA grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance: \nLUISA, his wife \nCARLA, his mistress \nLILLI, his costume designer and accomplice \nGUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit \nSTEPHANIE, a fashion journalist \nPIERPAOLO There's no room on your desk. \n- into the main office - \nGUIDO Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so. \nPIERPAOLO (waving them at him) Some of these are urgent! \nGUIDO (to Pierpaolo) Get me a cigarette. \nJACONELLI (confidentially) We will never be ready to shoot in ten days. \nGUIDO Jaconelli - \nFAUSTO (at the same time) Not ready?! \nGUIDO (continues) Ascolta me. (MORE) p. 6 \nGUIDO (CONT'D) (he kisses Jaconelli on the cheek) Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank. \nGuido carries on moving through the office. \nDANTE He's not exactly from the bank, Guido. \nNow BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards Guido's office. \nBENITO Dottore, Dottore. You have actors waiting for you in your office. Auditions all morning. You should see what I've found. I found two sisters. Look, they're right... \nGuido turns through another partition, as they all besiege him with questions. Benito despairs. \nBENITO (CONT'D) Dottore, this way... \nGuido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him. \nDante blocks Benito. \nBENITO (CONT'D) Maestro! \nDANTE Not now. He's got the Press Conference. \nINT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY \nGuido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage. \nThey're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric. \nGUIDO I need a cigarette. \nDante comes in, closing the door behind him. p. 7 \nDANTE He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli. \nGuido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call. \nGUIDO I need a coffee and a cigarette. \nHe lies down. \nLILLI (unimpressed) Answer a question, I'll give you a coffee. Answer another question, I'll give you a cigarette. And so on. \nGUIDO Actually and an aspirin. \nDante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some drawings. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY \nLEOPARDI Signor Contini. Artists do their best work before they're famous. Now you're famous. Without wishing to be negative - but your last two films, they're not, they were... \nGUIDO Flops. \nLEOPARDI Your word. Flops. p. 15 \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nGUIDO AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS NEARING TEN. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY \nLEOPARDI I'm just asking if you're nervous? You seem nervous... \nThis stops Guido. He doesn't answer. We see a bead of sweat running down the back of Guido's neck. \nEveryone waits. \nGUIDO Excuse me? \nLEOPARDI What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you run out of things to say? \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nAs the number progresses, Guido gets up from his chair and begins to scale the enormous heights of his unfinished set, with great effort. \nGUIDO I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP, AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW MORNING, AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY? AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE HERE - ONLY ME I WANT TO BE YOUNG. AND I WANT TO BE OLD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, \"GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WE'LL ARRANGE IT.\" THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT. p. 16 \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY \nSTEPHANIE I was wondering if you think there's a limit to what you can show in a movie. \nGUIDO What would you like to see that I haven't already shown you? \nShe smiles, he smiles back, lighting his cigarette. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nGUIDO I AM LUSTING FOR MORE, SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS? I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS? ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET: THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY \nGuido turns to the mantle. He grabs a bottle of whiskey, looks up into the large gilded mirror at his reflection. We see two Guidos. \nGUIDO (V.O.) I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TO TRAVEL ALONG WITH MYSELF. I WOULD EVEN LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING A DUET WITH MYSELF. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nGUIDO I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE (SING ALONG WITH MYSELF IN A SONG) TO BE THERE (WALKING DOWN A LANE NOW), EVERYWHERE (EVERYWHERE) EVERYWHERE, THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS I WANT TO BE HERE (WITH A COUNTER-) HERE (MELODY IN THE) HERE (TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU GUIDO) GUIDO (GUIDO) GUIDO (GUIDO) GUIDO. ME (ME) ME! I WANT TO BE PROUST... p. 17 \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY \nAmidst the chaos, Guido notices a waiter with a tray of glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the wall. As the waiter passes, Guido slyly opens the door and sneaks out. \nGUIDO (V.O.) ...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED, BUDDHA BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD. AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART - IT'S THE END IF SOMETHING IMPORTANT DOESN'T START... \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nGuido continues climbing higher and higher. \nGUIDO ...I WANT TO BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD. WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND FURY THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, \"GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS, WE'LL ARRANGE IT...\" \nGUIDO (doleful) Please. \nDE ROSSI (suggesting a name) Signor Milano? \nGUIDO Why not. \nDE ROSSI (continuing to work) Needless to say, I love your films. Guilty pleasure. Those early films. \nGUIDO Not the flops. (anxious, confidential) I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible. \nDE ROSSI Consider it done. Please. p. 20 \nGUIDO (takes the key) And I need to place a call.   To my wife. \nGuido writes the number on a piece of paper on the desk. \nDE ROSSI You can take the call at the lobby phone over there. \nINT. TELEPHONE KIOSK, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY \nGuido heads into the elegant Art Deco booth, pulls the glass door shut. The phone rings. He picks up. \nINT. CONTINI HOME, ROME / TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY \nWe intercut between the phone booth and LUISA in their apartment in Rome... Luisa knows every move of Guido's. She manages him very well, calm, dry and funny. \nGUIDO Luisa, tesoro... \nLUISA There you are. \nGUIDO Is everybody mad at me? \nLUISA Well, I'm mad at you.   Where are you? \nGUIDO I had to escape from the Press Conference. \nLUISA I heard. Dramatic. \nGUIDO Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa. \nLUISA You're making a film. You make a film, you get sick. It's what happens. \nGUIDO No, but this time I'm really sick.      I can't breathe. p. 21 \nLUISA Are you by yourself? \nGUIDO Yes, of course I'm by myself. \nLUISA Then shall I come? \nGUIDO Yes, please come, that's why I'm calling, please come straight away. That would be wonderful. \nLUISA Okay. \nGUIDO Great. Marvellous. \nLUISA I don't know where you are. \nGUIDO I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I just kept driving. \nLUISA Well I can't come if I don't know where you are. \nGUIDO (suddenly claustrophobic) And, actually, it's hardly worth it. I'll be home in a day or two. \nCARLA GUIDO... \nDOCTOR ...the Roman emperors came here for the waters... \nGuido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up. It is CARLA, at the perfect wrong time. \nGUIDO (into the phone) Pronto. p. 24 \nDE ROSSI (V.O.) Signor Contini, it's the Signora. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY \nWE SEE ISOLATED IMAGES OF A SEDUCTIVE BODY: A LONG LEG IN SHEER BLACK STOCKINGS, A SHAPELY ASS, MAGNIFICENT BREASTS. \nCARLA I WAS LAZING AROUND MY BEDROOM WHEN YOU CALLED AND AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING ABOUT, GUIDO... \nGUIDO (coming back quickly to life) It's a very an important call, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private call. \nDOCTOR As you wish. \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nAn enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the scaffolding of Guido's unfinished set. Emerging from the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down the lush fabric. She wears stockings, heels and little else. Bathed in hot light, Carla reveals herself from inside the sumptuous folds of satin. \nCARLA WHO'S NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES? I'M NOT! MY DARLING, WHO'S AFRAID TO KISS YOUR TOES? I'M NOT! YOUR MAMA DEAR IS BLOWING INTO YOUR EAR, SO YOU'LL GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR, I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE ME HERE... AND HERE... AND HERE... \nINT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY \nThe Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's vital signs. p. 25 \nNURSE Doctor... His pulse... it's racing. \nDOCTOR (to Guido) Is something wrong? \nGUIDO What? Yes, yes. It's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm listening. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nCarla slides from the lush fabric onto a mirrored platform. As she sings, she writhes and undulates in a seductive display of sexuality. This is Guido's ultimate fantasy. \nCARLA COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE COO. I'VE GOT A PLAN FOR WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU, SO HOT YOU'RE GONNA STEAM, AND SCREAM, AND VIBRATE LIKE A STRING I'M PLUCKING- KISS YOUR FEVERED LITTLE BROW PINCH YOUR CHEEKS TILL YOU SAY \"OW,\" AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SHOW YOU HOW, GUIDO. \nINT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY \nGuido trying to hide the effects of this phone sex from the Doctor and Nurse. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nCarla grabs onto two satin-covered ropes, suspended from the ceiling. She wraps herself in them, swinging and gyrating. \nCARLA WHO WON'T CARE IF YOU COME TO ME TIRED AND OVERWORKED? I WON'T! BAMBINO, WHO KNOWS A THERAPY TO BEAT WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM ME? I DON'T! BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH FOR NOW, GUIDO, CIAO. (MORE) p. 26 \nCARLA (CONT'D) (spoken) I love you, Guido. \nCarla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes the steam from an arriving train. \nEXT. ANZIO, TRAIN STATION - DAY \nAnd out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her, pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She wears it with pride. \nCARLA Guido!    Ciao! \nGuido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it. \nCARLA I had a nightmare last night. We were in that little alley behind Piazza Navona, where I bought you that scarf, remember? The same one your wife bought you-- \nGUIDO (probably doesn't) Don't move, Carla. \nCARLA When you wear it, I never know if it's hers or mine. \nGUIDO (not really listening) Uh-huh. \nCARLA So we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi! (MORE) p. 29 \nCARLA (CONT'D) He would never do that! He's so sweet. He speaks Latin! He knows all the Roman Emperors. \nGUIDO (still intent on his makeup job) Good for him. \nCARLA Perhaps there's a job for him in the movie-- \nGUIDO Why not? \nCARLA You could work well together. \nGUIDO Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage. \nCARLA Yes. \nGUIDO (gesturing towards the door) Go, go. \nGuido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side table.. \nCARLA You think I am one of your actresses? \nGUIDO Hurry, please, Carla. \nCarla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror. \nCARLA Oh, Madonna! \nGUIDO I'll pretend to be asleep. \nCarla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's glasses and turns back to him. \nCARLA What if I really found the wrong room? Would you be jealous? p. 30 \nGUIDO Could you do such a thing? \nCarla teases him with a look that says, \"Why not?\" \nCARLA (coyly) Hm! Who knows? \nCarla goes into the hall and closes the door behind her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer. \nNow Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling for Guido to keep quiet. \nGUIDO What happened? \nCARLA (still giggling) It was the woman from the hotel. She wanted to give me towels. \nGUIDO Come here. \nCARLA Okay. \nGUIDO What? \nGUIDO (explaining) I'm in need of some guidance, some pointers... \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Do you think you could find a signed photograph of Signorina Jenssen? p. 33 \nGUIDO For His Excellency? \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Si. \nGUIDO I'm sure that would be possible... \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Truly?   What a pleasure. Arrivederci, Maestro. \nHe heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go, then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't turn round. He knows that voice. \nDANTE Guidino! \nGuido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors close. Guido is trapped. \nGUIDO I'm not going to ask how you found me. \nDANTE Please - it's my job. A producer needs to know where his director is at all times...even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying... \nGUIDO Oh God. \nDANTE I understand, Guido. Rome is absolutely unbearable. The pressure. It's no good. \nGUIDO Really?    You understand? \nHe takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell. \nINT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY \nDANTE Of course I understand.      Absolutely. \nGUIDO You're not going to drag me back? \nDANTE No. You're a genius and genius must be served. p. 34 \nGUIDO Thank you, my old friend. (Dante is guiding him) Where are we going? \nDANTE You can't be in Rome. Okay. (heading towards the ballroom) \nINT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY \nDANTE Rome will come to you! \nDante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT, CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots, everything all in place or being put into place. An absolute beehive of activity. Guido is staggered. \nDANTE (CONT'D) It's a fantastic place for you to focus. Everyone is here to help the movie. Everyone is here because they love you, Guido. \nHe stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a magnificent girl on his arm. \nJACONELLI (explaining his designs) Yes, with the flower and the glass and the arches of the Roman Empire... \nDANTE Guido...you remember Donatella. \nDONATELLA Ciao. \nGUIDO (he doesn't, she's new) Ciao. \nDANTE Donatella, you tested her. \nDONATELLA I was very nervous. He probably doesn't remember. I was quite nervous. p. 35 \nGuido picks up a straw hat. Puts it on his head playfully. \nLILLI Oh Guido, don't. That's death.     Every time we have to start again. \nGUIDO I'm trying to find it. \nLILLI You won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass. \nGUIDO Ashtray. \nShe produces one. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) Thanks. You were saying - my head is jammed up my ass. \nLILLI Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream up something entertaining, Guido? Something with music...with dancing... God knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here... \nGuido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her and sees... p. 38 \nFANTASY: \nINT.\"SOUNDSTAGE\" \n...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the same straw hat on her head. \nThe soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the 1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills the smoky atmosphere. \nLILLI (singing and performing in a french accent) LE CINEMA TODAY IS IN A CRISIS DIRECTORS ARE SO EXISTENTIALISTES. THE MOVIES ARE NOT WORTH THEIR ENTRANCE PRICES IF NO ONE SINGS A LOVE SONG WHEN HE'S KISSED. LOVE CANNOT BE LOVE WITHOUT \"LE SINGING,\" A STRING, A CLARINET, A SAXOPHONE TAKE A LESSON FROM THIS OLD PARISIENNE AND THE FINEST ENTERTAINMENT SHE HAS KNOWN. \nBehind a black scrim, ghostly images come to life. Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic SHOWGIRLS barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers. They descend the grand staircase. \nLILLI (CONT'D) FOLIES BERGERE- WHAT A SHOWING OF COLOR, COSTUME, AND DANCING! NOT A MOMENT IN LIFE COULD BE MORE ENTRANCING THAN AN EVENING YOU SPEND AUX FOLIES BERGERE. FOLIES BERGERE, NOT A SOUL IN THE WORLD COULD BE IN DESPAIR WHEN HE IS GLANCING AT THE FABULOUS STAGE DES FOLIES BERGERE \nThe showgirls disappear. Lilli comes down from the piano and crosses onto the stage. The scrim rises. From every corner, more showgirls begin to enter. p. 39 \nLILY                           SHOWGIRLS FOLIES BERGERE-               OOH LA LA LA MUSIQUE, LA DANSE, LE SON, LA LUMIERE!              OOH LA LA LES PETITS JOLIES SEINS DES BELLES BOUQUETIERES           OOH LA LA SUR LA BELLE PASSARELLE DES FOLIES BEREGERE,              OOH LA LA PAS DE MYSTERE- LE SPECTACLE EST TOUT A       OOH LA LA FAIT DECOUVERT. \"ET PAS TROP CHER\" VIENS CE SOIR AVEC MOI AUX FOLIES BERGERE. \nLilli crosses onto the passerelle, and speaks directly to the audience. \nLILLI (CONT'D) Ah, Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je suis la vedette des Folies Bergere. Vedette, it means 'star.' \nLilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage: \nLILLI (CONT'D) Let me tell you. Last night I looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now, and what did I see? A priest! And next to him? \nSuddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience. \nLILLI (CONT'D) Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini? What are you doing here at the Folies Bergere? You naughty boy! You're only nine years old! But I'm glad you've come. Would you like to join me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come, come. \nAnd she brings him onto the stage. The audience applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older Guido. \nLILLI (CONT'D) Feeling better? There's no room for hopelessness in here, is there, Guido? (to the audience) We must explain something to our young Guido. What do we want? Laughter! What do we want? Love! What do we want? Dreams! Let us not forget, Guido, mon cher -- That's our privilege - to entertain. p. 40 \nThe number kicks into full gear with a rousing can-can. Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's intoxicating world. \nLILLI AND SHOWGIRLS FOLIES BERGERE THE MUSIC, THE LIGHTS, AND THE LAUGHTER, THE ANSWER TO WHAT YOU ARE AFTER EACH NIGHT AT THE FOLIES BERGERE. FOLIES BERGERE \nLILLI BY THE HEAVENS ABOVE, YOU WILL SWEAR THERE'S NOTHING RARER! \nLILLI AND SHOWGIRLS THAN THE FOLIES BERGERE \nLilli crosses the proscenium. Her boa grows and grows until it stretches the length of the stage. \nLILLI AND SHOWGIRLS (CONT'D) FOLIES BERGERE THE STAGE OVERFLOWING, AND GIVING A MUSICAL REASON FOR LIVING EACH NIGHT AT THE FOLIES BERGERE. FOLIES BERGERE... \nCARLA What? What? \nGUIDO I can't breathe, I can't breathe. \nCARLA Guido, don't die on me! Can you imagine... poor Luigi! It would kill him. \nGUIDO (finding her ridiculous) If I die it would kill your husband? \nGuido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. Carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back. \nCARLA No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. Where are you going? \nGUIDO I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe. \nGuido stands up and picks up his shirt. He puts it on whilst they argue. \nCARLA Let me come with you. \nGUIDO It's impossible. \nCARLA Why? \nGUIDO Because it's impossible. Please. \nCARLA But why is it impossible? Look at your producer! He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why? Why won't you let me near you? \nGUIDO For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife. p. 48 \nCARLA See, you're playing with me. You're twisting everything... Please let me come with you. \nGUIDO No. \nGuido heads towards the door, still dressing. \nCARLA I'll be here waiting for you with my legs open. \nDisgusted with himself, he leaves. \nINT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT \nGlittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea. A pop band and a dance floor.   A slick Italian MALE SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance. The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner. Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas, struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia - \nGUIDO Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man... (pours himself a glass of wine) Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro. (to Lilli) Like the circus... \nDANTE Claudia is going to be amazing. \nBENITO It sounds like a masterpiece. \nFAUSTO (hissing at Dante) Dante, you see, he hasn't written a word... \nDANTE (defending his director) The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map. p. 49 \nGUIDO Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert. \nLILLI Guido. \nShe nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see his wife at the entrance looking for him... \nGUIDO Luisa! \nHe jumps up from the table and hurries towards the dance floor, genuinely happy. \nON THE DANCE FLOOR: \nLILLI That I would pay to see. \nGUIDO Luisa was in that film. \nLILLI She was the best thing in the movie. \nGUIDO It's true.   It was your first part. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh my Lord! \nLUISA I was. \nMusic begins. \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY You can't stop being somebody. \nLUISA Can't you? p. 52 \nCARDINAL'S SECRETARY Well there's a good catholic wife for you, Guido, that's what they do - sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it must be a very exciting life for you... \nLuisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido. \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nThe restaurant table as well as the production team are transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing herself from the scene. The other characters, with the exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre tableau. \nLuisa contemplates her life with Guido. \nLUISA MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM- HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC THEME. SOME MEN RUN BANKS SOME RULE THE WORLD SOME EARN THEIR LIVING BAKING BREAD. MY HUSBAND.... HE GOES A LITTLE CRAZY MAKING MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND SPINS FANTASIES, HE LIVES THEM, THEN GIVES THEM TO YOU ALL LIKE MICHELANGELO, HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME BUT CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT'S HIS WORK AND WHAT'S HIS HOME. SOME MEN SELL STOCKS SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD. MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR, MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD. \nAs the number progresses, the world around Luisa disappears into a black void, leaving only herself, with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase. \nLUISA (CONT'D) GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI: NUMBER ONE GENIUS AND NUMBER ONE FAN. (MORE) p. 53 \nLUISA (CONT'D) GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI: PASSIONATE WOMAN IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN LONG AGO - MANY YEARS AGO. ONCE WE TWO WERE- GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA HIS LOVER: ACTRESS WITH DREAMS AND A LIFE OF HER OWN, THEN WE HAD NO END OF WORLDS TO DISCOVER, SINGING TOGETHER ALL NIGHT ON THE PHONE LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO... \nMEMORY: \nINT. INSERT STAGE - DAY \nLuisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in scratched black and white. The music continues. \nCLAPPER LOADER (O.S.) Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino numero uno. Luisa Acari. \nThe clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley)    Her name: LUISA ACARI. \nA small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.   Luisa enters, younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn... \nLuisa sits on the chair. \nGUIDO (O.S.) Your name, it's Italian. \nLUISA My father's Italian. My mother's French. \nGUIDO (O.S.) What have you done before? \nLUISA (eyes twinkling) Oh, I've waited... \nGUIDO (O.S.) Waited? For this? \nLUISA Waited tables. (they both laugh) And, of course, I studied theatre and mime in Paris. But, mostly waited tables. p. 54 \nCARLA Well, she could have warned you. \nGUIDO The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me. \nHe walks over to the front desk, to the ubiquitous De Rossi. \nGUIDO O.S A taxi, please, for the Signora. \nDE ROSSI O.S. Right away. \nGuido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable Carla. \nGUIDO Carla, you have to wait outside. \nCARLA Will you wait with me? \nGUIDO I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues. \nCARLA So why do I have to wait outside? \nGUIDO (shamed) I'll find someone to escort you home. \nHe disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out from behind his desk, approaches her. p. 57 \nDE ROSSI (carefully) Signora, would you rather wait inside? \nCARLA I'm going to walk.   Please tell my friend I had to leave. \nShe walks away. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nCarla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling along. \nINT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT \nGuido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum. \nGUIDO Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station. \nLuisa doesn't move. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming. \nLUISA (without opening her eyes) Very plausible. \nGUIDO Because it's true. \nLuisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed. \nLUISA You told me it was finished. \nGUIDO It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin. \nLuisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly. p. 58 \nGUIDO (CONT'D) (smiles, insecure) What? What are you laughing about? \nLUISA Nothing. If you could see yourself. (raising herself up further) I couldn't live with it - the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat. It's exhausting, no wonder you've got no script, you're too busy inventing your own life. \nGUIDO It's finished. It's finished. (and he is exhausted) If it wasn't before, it is now. \nLUISA (lying back on her bed) Blah blah blah blah blah. \nSTEPHANIE (CONT'D) It's the Italian man in you: pays for your drinks, undresses you with his eyes... \nFLASH: A SUDDEN IMAGE OF A WOMAN'S HIP THRUST. \nGUIDO I hate that man. \nSTEPHANIE No! Style is the new content! It's what my readers love. They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto. They want to live in an Italian movie. \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nThe tiered levels of the unfinished set are covered with go-go girls in silver miniskirts. At the center of the stage, Italian male models in stylish suits and Ray Bans strut down a fashion runway. \nStephanie makes her entrance on the catwalk. p. 61 \nSTEPHANIE I LOVE THE BLACK AND WHITE! I LOVE THE PLAY OF LIGHT! THE WAY CONTINI PUTS HIS IMAGE THROUGH A PRISM. \nINT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT \nGuido lights Stephanie's cigarette. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nSTEPHANIE I FEEL MY BODY CHILL GIVES ME A SPECIAL THRILL EACH TIME I SEE THAT GUIDO NEO-REALISM \nINT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT \nGuido and Stephanie share a laugh as she steals a sip from Guido's glass. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nStephanie leads the men in a series of tight, rhythmic moves. \nSTEPHANIE I LOVE THE DARK AND HANDSOME GUYS WITH THEIR SKINNY LITTLE TIES DRESSIN' MOD, LOOKIN' OUTTA SIGHT! I LOVE TO WATCH `EM AS THEY CRUISE WITH THEIR POINTY LEATHER SHOES WEARIN' SHADES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. \nINT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT \nStephanie rubs her leg against Guido's. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nSTEPHANIE WHATEVER GUIDO DOES, IT MAKES ME SMILE HE IS THE ESSENCE OF ITALIAN STYLE. I LOVE THE GLAMOROUSLY LATIN WORLD THAT ONLY GUIDO CAN PORTRAY!!! \nCONTINI'S CINEMA ITALIANO! I LOVE HIS CINEMA ITALIANO! HE MAKES ME FEEL WITH CINEMA ITALIANO (MORE) p. 62 \nSTEPHANIE (CONT'D) MY LIFE IS REAL WITH CINEMA ITALIANO HE IS THE KING OF CINEMA ITALIANO! \nINT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT \nStephanie whispers into Guido's ear, as she drops her room key into his pocket. He watches her hips swing as she walks out. Guido plays with her room key, deciding whether or not to follow. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nA long line of chic women replace the men on the runway, joining Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE THOSE SCENES I LOVE TO SEE FROM GUIDO'S \"P\" \"O\" \"V\" THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WITH HIS UNIQUE DIRECTOR'S VISION. HIS ANGLES - WIDE AND TIGHT - EACH MOMENT FEELS SO RIGHT... DEFINES ITALIAN STYLE BY ONLY HIS DECISION! I LOVE THE SPEEDY LITTLE CARS THE HIP COFFEE BARS THE SLEEK WOMEN IN POSITANO... GUIDO'S THE ULTIMATE UOMO ROMANO! \nSTEPHANIE AND MEN CONTINI'S CINEMA ITALIANO! I LOVE HIS CINEMA ITALIANO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO! \nDRUM BREAK.   The number heats up. \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nGuido goes in with the Matron to find her DAUGHTER pressing a cold compress onto Carla's head as she lies, feverish in the bed. DOCTOR RONDI is packing up his things. \nCARLA (distant) You came. \nGUIDO (taking her hand) I'm here. \nDoctor Rondi is brisk.   He nods to Guido that they go outside. \nDOCTOR RONDI Signor Contini. \nAs Guido makes to leave - \nCARLA Come back. \nGuido reassures her with a gesture. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGuido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned. Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks. \nDOCTOR RONDI She took five or six pills, enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress. (Guido can't answer) This is a sordid business. You movie people, I suppose you don't consider yourself bound by morality... \nGuido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription, picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido leaning against the wall... \nMEMORY: \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nYoung Guido, alone and dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes. p. 66 \nMAMMA (O.S.) Guido? Dove corri? Where are you running to? \nINT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT \n... the door knob turns. Guido comes back into the room, indicates to the Matron and her daughter that they should leave. \nGUIDO Thank you.    I'm going to stay with her now. \nMATRON If you need us for anything, just call, okay? Francesca, andiamo. \nGUIDO Grazie. \nHe sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over hers. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) Carla, I should call your husband. \nCARLA No, he'll take me home. \nGUIDO What have you done to yourself?    I'm not worth dying for, Carla. \nCARLA Don't be angry with me. Everything I do, I just want you to love me. \nThis comes out with enormous tenderness, as if she suddenly understands herself. \nCARLA (CONT'D) When you're not here with me, I'm still here. When you're in your life, making your movies, dancing with your wife - I'm still here. \nGuido hears her.    Knows what she's saying is true.   She looks at him. \nGUIDO Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning... \nHe stands and pulls a sheet up over her. p. 67 \nCARLA (Clutching at him) Don't leave me. Don't leave me. \nCLAUDIA Yes, I can turn to my left. \nGUIDO Now just one slow turn for us. \nCLAUDIA (she turns around) Okay, one slow turn. \nGUIDO Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut. \nPIERPAOLO We've got it. Next costume please. \nMakeup artists and costume assistants immediately surround her, loosening her hair. \nDante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised.    She's a star, that's the long and short of it. p. 74 \nAnd she's warming up for a fight with her director. Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous. \nCLAUDIA Has anybody got a script? Script missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one script, title Italia. Can't make a film without it... \nLilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on Claudia, adjusts her hair. \nCLAUDIA (CONT'D) So interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you don't know what the part is. \nGuido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness. \nCLAUDIA (CONT'D) (shrugs off the coat) No! I'm going back to my hotel now. \nPIERPAOLO (anxious) But please, just a couple more costumes, Claudia. \nCLAUDIA (to Guido) I'm going back to my hotel now, my darling, and when I there is a script, I'll read it and then we'll take it from there. (calls over to Lilli) I love the costumes, Lilli. They are beautiful. (back to the guys, sweetly) Ciao Bello. \nGUIDO That's fair. \nDANTE Claudia! \nGUIDO (to Dante) That's fair. \nDANTE Fair? \nGUIDO I'll be back. p. 75 \nGuido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape. \nDANTE (calling to Guido) You've got dailies, Guido. \nGUIDO I'll be right back. \nDANTE (shouting) You've got meetings. \nEXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT \nGuido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the Star driving away with her Director. Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars. \nINT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT \nGuido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act. He's always inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her. \nGUIDO You look ravishing. \nCLAUDIA You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere hidden underneath. \nGuido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up, they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake a car, they speed after him. \nEXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT \nCLAUDIA When there's a camera between us. \nGUIDO No. \nCLAUDIA It's not a real person, Guido. (pointed) And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love. \nCLAUDIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I OWE WHAT I AM TO YOU. \nEXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT \nClaudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the fountain. p. 79 \nGUIDO There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about... \nGuido sits down at the edge of the fountain. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) ...and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened. \nCLAUDIA And why didn't you? \nGUIDO I don't know. I don't know. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nCLAUDIA SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE, SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU. HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU, ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL. IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE. \nEXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT \nClaudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to Guido. The music continues. \nCLAUDIA Maybe you should have knocked, maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal. I can't do this anymore. \nShe takes off her wig and diamond earrings. \nCLAUDIA (CONT'D) This is me.   And you have a wife who loves you. \nShe hands him the wig and the earrings.    She kisses him. \nCLAUDIA (CONT'D) I'll miss you. Wrong girl. \nThe music ends.   Claudia turns and walks away. p. 80 \nINT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT \nA screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically. \nGuido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up. \nDANTE (to Lilli) Great work, Lilli... Wonderful costume... \nLILLI Thank you. \nDANTE ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic. \nGuido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not Luisa. \nBENITO She has a beautiful profile. \nDANTE Two great profiles. \nFAUSTO She's a goddess. \nDANTE And the back isn't too bad. \nGUIDO It meant so much to us all.    That you came. (MORE) p. 83 \nGUIDO (CONT'D) (nothing from Luisa) What did you think? Did you like anybody or -? (nothing) Luisa? \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nTHE BEAT OF A STRIPPER'S DRUM. \nA gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain, beckoning. The curtain opens, revealing the silhouette of a figure bathed in red light. \nGuido sits in an audience of raucous men who have filled all the seats around him. They start to whistle as if they were at some sleazy club. Guido squirms, trapped. \nThe figure steps forward. It's Luisa, tricked out like a seedy nightclub stripper. \nLUISA YOU WANT MY LOVE? TAKE IT ALL YOU WANT TO WATCH IT ALL COME OFF? TAKE IT ALL COME ON NOW SHOW ME HOW YOU TAKE IT ALL... \nINT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT \nLUISA Thank you. \nGUIDO (encouraged) What for? \nLUISA Thank you for reminding me I'm not special. You don't even see what you do, do you? Even the moments I think are ours, it's just you working to get what you want. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nLuisa strips. p. 84 \nLUISA YOU WANT MY GLOVE? ARE YOU ENTHRALLED? YOU WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY AND WATCH IT FALL? OH WE KNOW IT'S YOUR SHOW SO TAKE IT ALL \nINT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT \nGUIDO (dawning on him) What are you talking about? \nHe stands up, leans on the chair back. \nGUIDO (CONT'D) The screen test? You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what I do, I direct. That's my job. \nGuido stands up straight. \nLUISA And this is our life. You think to create is to forgive yourself in public. Fine. But don't think I can forgive you in private, because I can't ever. \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nAs the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for Guido. Guido watches, humiliated. \nLUISA SO GO AHEAD TAKE IT ALL \nYOU WANT MY SOUL? TAKE IT ALL! \nIT'S TIME TO LEAVE. IF I'M TO LIVE. BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE... \nInstrumental. \nLuisa charges into the audience: she is mauled and assaulted by the men. p. 85 \nLUISA (CONT'D) I WATCH YOU RISE! I WATCH YOU FALL! WHILE I AM STANDING WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE WALL NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO FINALLY LEARN \nYOU HAD THE WORLD YOU HAD YOUR FLING YOU WANTED MORE THAN EVERYTHING YOU GOT YOUR WISH YOU GOT YOUR PRIZE NOW TAKE IT RIGHT BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS YOU GRABBED FOR EVERYTHING MY FRIEND BUT DON'T YOU SEE THAT IN THE END THERE WILL BE NOTHING! \nINT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT \nEXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON \nIt's the end of the season. Only a few customers left in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day, pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables. \nGuido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt. Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant. \nHe heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes - \nEXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT \nGuido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI. \nLuisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie. \nGuido watches from a distance. \nLuisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross and head down the street. \nEXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY \nGuido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass by occasionally. They talk - \nLILLI I'm glad she's acting again. I made her costumes for the play. She's funny. \nGUIDO She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody? \nLILLI Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her mother. I don't know. I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard. p. 89 \nGUIDO I like to get about without everybody pointing at me. \nLILLI And where are you getting about? \nGUIDO Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk. \nLILLI Are you seeing anybody? \nGUIDO No, no. Nobody. \nLILLI (teasing) Well, it sounds exciting. Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard.   I might come up here and join you. \nGUIDO Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is - \nLILLI - I know. \nGUIDO I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead. \nLILLI Luisa certainly thinks so. \nGUIDO (grasping at this) Does she? Did she really say that? \nLILLI Stop! I'm not going to act as a postman between you both. Come back to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work. \nHe sits.   Lilli joins him. \nGUIDO No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90 \nLILLI You're such a dope, aren't you? Making movies wasn't your problem. You were your problem.   Don't stop being a child. You'll never make another movie! Nobody wants that... especially Luisa. \nShe indicates the people who pass. \nLILLI (CONT'D) Guido - there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies. That's your gift. That's what you've been given. Use it. Just use it with some grace. For Chrissake. \nGUIDO (doubtful) The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife. \n", "test1_input": "MAMMA This is your Rome, Guido. The world sees Rome the way you invented it. Your films did that. \nGUIDO (buoyed by her encouragement) I miss you. \nMAMMA I miss you, too. \nGuido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone in the car. \nGuido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone. \nEXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY \nThe convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto. \nAs soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at him. Guido moves quickly by them. \nDante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles Dante. \nAnd they hurry after Guido. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY \nA big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are in the room, and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background. \nRADIO REPORTER And we're just waiting for the arrival of Contini...any moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top? \nA few news cameras are filming.    There's a buffet, and a bartender. \nAnd Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the team follow him in. \nRADIO REPORTER (CONT'D) And here he is..! p. 11 \nDANTE Silenzio, per favore...Thank you, thank you... \nRADIO REPORTER Dante, Guido Contini's long time producer, is about to speak... \nDANTE I want to say a few words from my heart. I am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that I am producing Guido Contini's next film, Italia, which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, Claudia Jenssen... \nA stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement. \nDANTE (CONT'D) ...we start shooting in ten days time in Cinecitta. That makes it one week from Monday. (to Guido, handing over) Thank you, Maestro, thank you very much. This is our ninth film together. Guido Contini. \nGUIDO Thanks for coming, everybody. \nPretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses Dante on the cheek. \nHe returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their questions at once. The questions come on top of each other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman. \nDINARDO Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini. \nGUIDO Yes. \nDINARDO Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia... big title. \nAnother journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt. p. 12 \nGUIDO Actually, it's my shortest title yet. \nDINARDO But hardly a modest one. \nGUIDO Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles. \nDINARDO And might you tell the press what the film is about? \n", "test1_true": "LEOPARDI (In a loud aside to Dinardo) That was the problem. Nobody else did. \nGUIDO Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press. \nGeneral laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps in. \nDANTE Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream. \nLEOPARDI Is this true? \nGUIDO It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to see it. \nHe's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she wants him and he senses it. p. 13 \nSTEPHANIE Signor Contini. \nGUIDO Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is this year? \nGUIDO I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it. \nREPORTER ONE Signor Contini! You're a man of the world, yes? Educated in Britain, a home in Biarritz. With Italia is it fair to say that you've come home for good? \nREPORTER TWO (O.S.) (tries to interrupt) What do you think of the New Wave in the French Cinema? \nGUIDO For good? \nREPORTER FOUR It's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife, do you plan on casting her in this new film? \nGuido is spinning plates. \nGUIDO I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady. \nREPORTER FOUR But she hasn't worked at all since working with you. \nLaughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido again. Another REPORTER asks a question. \nREPORTER FIVE But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film? It's a serious question. What's the big deal? p. 14 \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nWe discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his unfinished set. A retreat into surreality. He sits on the same couch from the hotel suite. He slouches, arms folded, legs crossed, with his hat pulled over his eyes. \nGUIDO I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.

BEACH - DAY \nSUPERTITLE:   Pesaro, Italy, 1926 \nYoung Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village. \nThe boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the war. \nThey reach into pockets and extract small change, hand it to Young Guido, already the ring leader. \nThey crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker... \nEXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY \n...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back. \nYOUNG GUIDO (not loud enough) Saraghina. (louder) Saraghina. \nNow all the boys join in. \nBOYS Saraghina!   Saraghina! \nYOUNG GUIDO (loudest) Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina! \nA shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back. \nAnd then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on Carla. \nShe looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them. \nShe takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand. p. 44 \nYoung Guido opens his hand with the coins. \nShe looks at the money.   Is it enough? \nBut she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins. \nShe stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the \"show.\" \nSaraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body... \nA dark vamp begins. \nFANTASY: \nINT. \"SOUNDSTAGE\" \nCurtains of falling sand fill the soundstage. \nThrough the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs. \nSARAGHINA So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you...and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood. \nEXT.

LIVE TODAY AS IF IT MAY BECOME YOUR LAST! \nThe whores dance. \nThe number ends. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nTwo PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks flapping. \nThe boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the priests. They catch him and carry him away from the beach. \nINT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY \nOff-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE. \nThe priests drag Young Guido through the school's chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate altar, into the Principal's office. \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY \nGuido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she appears the way he remembers her). \nMAMMA I am ashamed of you, Guido. \nYOUNG GUIDO But Mamma, what did I do. \nPRINCIPAL Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins, now and forever. \nThe Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries out as they punish him... \nINT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY \n...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe... Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately wanting to leave after the sex. p. 47 \n", "test2_id": 2131, "test3_input": "GUIDO Yes. \nLUIGI I'd like to take her home. \nGUIDO Of course. I'm sorry. (hapless) She loves you, you know that, don't you. \nLUIGI She's my wife. \nHe walks into the room. Guido stands outside for a second, then turns to go. \nINT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY \nThe door is open as Guido enters. He's confused, worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a closet. \nGUIDO Darling? \nDante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase. \nDANTE We're going back to Rome. \nGUIDO (anxious) Where's Luisa? \nDANTE Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with you. (different tone) And quite frankly, so have I. You drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear. (MORE) p. 70 \nDANTE (CONT'D) I can't protect you anymore. And Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start today. Remember? \nGUIDO (sits) I can't. \nDANTE You can't. You must. Don't sit down. \nGUIDO I need help. \nDANTE (still packing) You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure. \nGUIDO I'm not cured. \nDANTE (decisive, no arguments) That's enough! The movie calls, your star has landed. Fausto - take his things please. \nDante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall. \nDANTE (CONT'D) (impatient, at the door) Guido! Andiamo! \nEXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON \nGuido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced, ignoring the press. \nGUIDO (O.S.) I need more time. \nDANTE (O.S.) Forget the script. Claudia's here now. She'll inspire you to do what you do best, write with your camera. p. 71 \nEXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic, people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work, everybody and everything needing Guido's attention. \nGuido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist. \nGuido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido... \nPIERPAOLO Maestro, the screen tests are back from the lab. Will you watch them now? \nDANTE Tonight.   We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions. \nPIERPAOLO Design meeting? Production meeting? \n", "test3_true": "PIERPAOLO Tonight. \nDante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins them. \nLILLI Claudia says where are you? She's in fine form. Feisty. \nGUIDO (knows what that means) Okay. \nLILLI She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine. \nLilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a rack of costumes. p. 72 \nINT. INSERT STAGE, CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON \nA couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS. \nThe gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew, then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio telephone behind the flats. He dials. \nGuido waits. Luisa picks up the phone. \nLUISA Pronto. \nGUIDO Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. (she doesn't respond) I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything... \nINT. INSERT STAGE/CONTINI HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nINTERCUT, LUISA at home, listening, inscrutable. \nGUIDO Otherwise I won't be able to start, I won't know what I'm thinking... \nLuisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the same, needs him to start. \nPIERPAOLO Maestro. \nGuido nods, waves him away. \nGUIDO Are you there? Luisa? \nLUISA Go on. \nGUIDO I'm not asking you to let me come home, I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have, you always do. \nLuisa puts down the phone. p. 73 \nGuido is in a mess. \nINT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENING \nGuido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido. \nShe looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches Claudia. \nPierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director. \nPIERPAOLO Silence please. Se gira. And we are rolling. \nGuido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test. \nGUIDO Could you turn to the right please, Claudia. \nCLAUDIA Yes, I can turn to my right. \nGUIDO And can you turn to the left. \n", "test3_id": 2132}

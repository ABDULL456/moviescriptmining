{"train": "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK \nWritten by \nLawrence Kasdan \nand \nLeigh Brackett \nFrom a story by George Lucas \nEXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH \nA Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its underside. \nOne of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice- covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of impact. \nEXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY \nA weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance. \nEXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY \nA small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast. \nThe rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed. \nThe wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him. \nLUKE (into comlink) Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han, old buddy, do you read me? \nAfter a little static a familiar voice is heard. \nHAN (over comlink) Loud and clear, kid.  What's up? \nLUKE (into comlink) Well, I finished my circle.  I don't pick up any life readings. \nHAN (over comlink) There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I'm going back. \nLUKE (into comlink) Right.  I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here.  I want to check it out.  It won't take long. \nLuke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it. \nLUKE Hey, steady girl.  What's the matter?  You smell something? \nLuke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously. \nLUKE Aaargh! \nLuke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken. \nThe Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain. \nEXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY \nA stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous ice cave. \nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK \nRebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles. \nHe walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss. \nHAN Chewie! \nThe Wookiee grumbles a reply. \nHAN All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. \nChewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han leaves. \nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER \nA makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals. \nGeneral Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach. \nRIEEKAN Solo? \nHAN No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around. \nRIEEKAN Commander Skywalker reported in yet? \nHAN No.  He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. \nRIEEKAN (indicates radar screen) With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. \nHAN (to Chewie) Put them back together right now. \nTHREEPIO Might I have a word with you, please? \nHAN What do you want? \nTHREEPIO Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. \nHAN I turned it off.  I don't want to talk to her. \nTHREEPIO Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke.  He hasn't come back yet.  She doesn't know where he is. \nHAN I don't know where he is. \nTHREEPIO Nobody knows where he is. \nHAN What do you mean, \"nobody knows\"? \nHan glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet. \nTHREEPIO Well, uh, you see... \nHan jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him. \nHAN Deck Officer.  Deck Officer! \nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu... \nHan abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer approaches. \nDECK OFFICER Yes, sir? \nHAN Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? \nDECK OFFICER I haven't seen him.  It's possible he came in through the south entrance. \nHAN It's possible?  Why don't you go find out?  It's getting dark out there. \nDECK OFFICER Yes, sir. \nThe deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's mouth. \nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire what's going on? \nHAN Why not? \nTHREEPIO Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger. \nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL \nThe deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the tunnel. \nDECK OFFICER Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. \nHAN Not likely.  Are the speeders ready? \nDECK OFFICER Not yet.  We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. \nHAN Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. \nDECK OFFICER Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. \nHAN That's right.  And my friends out in it. \nASSISTANT OFFICER I'll cover sector twelve.  Have com-control set screen alpha. \nHan pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun. \nDECK OFFICER Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. \nHAN Then I'll see you in hell! \nHan maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night. \nEXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK \nThe jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs. \nExhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach. \nHe focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration. \nJust as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand. \nThe young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain. \nEXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK \nHAN (reeling from the odor) Whew... \nLUKE Dagobah... \nHAN This may smell bad, kid... \nLUKE (moaning) Yoda... \nHAN ...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke inside the carcass) Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside! \nThe wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter Hoth night. \nEXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN \nFour snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape. \nINT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT \nThere is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep from one of his monitors. \nZEV (into transmitter) Echo Base... I've got something!  Not much, but it could be a life form. \nEXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT \nThe small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new direction. \nINT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT \nThe pilot switches over to a new transmitter. \nZEV (into transmitter) This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two. \nThere is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice. \nHAN (filtered over Zev's receiver) Good morning.  Nice of you guys to drop by. \nZEV (switching transmitters) Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I found them.  Repeat, I found them. \nEXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY \nThe small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side. A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft. \nINT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER \nStrange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about, raving in delirium. \nINT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM \nLuke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the room. \nTHREEPIO Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. \nArtoo beeps his good wishes. \nTHREEPIO Artoo expresses his relief, also. \nHan and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting. \nHAN How are you feeling, kid?  You don't look so bad to me.  In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. \nLUKE Thanks to you. \nHAN That's two you owe me, junior. \nHan turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big, devilish grin. \nHAN Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. \nLEIA (haughtily) I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. \nHAN That's a good story.  I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight. \nLEIA I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain. \nChewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself, regards Chewie good-humoredly. \nHAN Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. \nLuke sparks to this; he looks at Leia. \nHAN She expressed her true feelings for me. \nLeia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han. \nLEIA My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder! \nHAN Who's scruffy-looking? (to Luke) I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? \nVader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base. Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance. \nVADER You found something? \nPIETT Yes, my lord. \nVADER (studying the image on the console screen) That's it.  The Rebels are there. \nOZZEL My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements.  It could be smugglers, it could be... \nVADER That is the system.  And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.  Set your course for the Hoth system.  General Veers, prepare you men. \nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY \nA captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the main transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in panic. \nREBEL CAPTAIN Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders.  As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. \nREBEL FIGHTER Right, sir. \nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK \nAlarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert stations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near the main entrance. \nIn the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the lifters of the Millennium Falcon. \nHan finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters. \nHAN (into comlink, to Chewie) Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off! Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off! \nSmoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han surveys the new damage. \nINT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER \nLuke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical droid stands by. \nMEDICAL DROID Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-forty- sevens. \nLUKE Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. \nMEDICAL DROID Take care, sir. \nLUKE Thanks. \nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK \nPilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before. \nLUKE Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? \nAs Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair droid when he sees Luke. \nHAN Hi, kid. (to droid) There's got to be a reason for it.  Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right? \nLUKE Yeah. \nHAN Be careful. \nLUKE You, too. \nLuke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps, he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, all difficult to verbalize. \nINT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM. \nAlarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer scan. \nCONTROLLER General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four. \nRIEEKAN Reroute all power to the energy shield.  We've got to hold them till all transports are away.  Prepare for ground assault. \nRieekan exits hurriedly. \nINT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE \nThe dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube. General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving Vader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks. \nVADER What is it, General? \nVEERS My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed.  Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system.  The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. \nVADER (angrily) The Rebels are alerted to our presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. \nVEERS He felt surprise was wiser... \nVADER He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. \nVEERS Yes, my lord. \nWEDGE One more pass. \nJANSON Coming around.  Once more. \nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD \nThe speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the cable behind it. \nINT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT \nJANSON Once more. \nWedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker. \nJANSON Cable out!  Let her go! \nWEDGE Detach cable. \nEXT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE \nThe cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable drops away. \nINT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT \nJANSON Cable detached. \nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD \nThe speeder zooms away into the distance.  The tangled legs of the enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial walker begins to topple.  It teeters for a moment, and then crashes onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying. \nEXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH \nThe troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker. \nAn officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen war machine. \nTRENCH OFFICER Come on! \nThe troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders flying overhead.  Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground. \nINT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT \nWedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the fallen walker. \nWEDGE (into comlink) Whooha!  That got him! \nINT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT \nLUKE (into comlink) I see it, Wedge.  Good work. \nINT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER \nLarge chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General Rieekan monitor computer screens. \nRIEEKAN I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. \nLEIA It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.  We have no choice. \nRIEEKAN (into comlink) Launch patrols. \nLEIA (to an aide) Evacuate remaining ground staff. \nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR \nMuffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of the hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the wings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient. \nHAN No, no!  No!  This one goes there, that one goes there.  Right? \nIn another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up into Luke's X-wing fighter. \nTHREEPIO Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear. \nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD \nThe fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base, firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions erupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.  Another blast destroys a ray gun. \nINT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT \nGeneral Veers studies various readouts on his control panel. \nVEERS All troops will debark for ground assault.  Prepare to target the main generator. \nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD \nLuke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to left and flying above the erupting battlefield.  Flak bursts all around them. \nINT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT \nLuke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision.  He flips several switches.  The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn. The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction. \nThe monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from the concerned Artoo. \nLUKE (into comlink) There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. \nArtoo beeps once again. \nLUKE (into comlink) We're not going to regroup with the others. \nArtoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, \"What?!\" \nLuke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel. \nLUKE (into comlink) We're going to the Dagobah system. \nLuke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence. Finally, Artoo chirps up. \nLUKE (into comlink) Yes, Artoo? \nArtoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles. \nLUKE (into comlink, chuckling) That's all right.  I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while. \nThe little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and continues on his course. \nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON \nThe Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters. \nAs it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized objects. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nInside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the ship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things at once. \nHAN (harried) I saw them!  I saw them! \nLEIA Saw what? \nHAN Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. \nThreepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit. \nTHREEPIO Sir, sir!  Might I suggest... \nHAN (to Leia) Shut him up or shut him down! (to Chewie) Check the deflector shield! \nChewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch. \nHAN Oh, great.  Well, we can still outmaneuver them. \nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS \nThe Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star Destroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star Destroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left. \nINT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen veering to the left. \nIMPERIAL OFFICER Take evasive action! \nAlarms sound all over the huge ship.  The two other Star Destroyers get closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes brushing contact with it. \nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS \nThe Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, still followed by four TIE fighters.  Laser bolts spark the pitch-black skies. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nThings have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive. The ship is buffeted by laser blasts. \nHAN Prepare to make the jump to light- speed. \nTHREEPIO But, sir! \nThe buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger. \nLEIA They're getting closer! \nHAN (with a gleam in his eye) Oh yeah?  Watch this. \nExpectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace, but just sit there. \nHan and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern. \nLEIA Watch what? \nHan tries again.  Still nothing. \nLEIA I take it back.  We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. \nThe group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window. \nHAN I'm not going to argue with that. \nTHREEPIO Pulverized? \nHAN I'm going in closer to one of those big ones. \nLEIA Closer? \nTHREEPIO Closer?! \nChewbacca barks the same word, only louder. \nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT \nThe Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized asteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock. The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid. The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship. \nThe TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep space. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nRattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in hysterics. \nTHREEPIO Oh, this is suicide! \nHan notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful Wookiee, pointing. \nHAN There.  That looks pretty good. \nLEIA What looks pretty good? \nHAN Yeah.  That'll do nicely. \nTHREEPIO (to Leia) Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? \nOut the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater. \nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER \nThe Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLEIA I hope you know what you're doing. \nHAN Yeah, me too. \nINT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER \nThe Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into it. \nEXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING \nThe tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.  Artoo, riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with some anxiety. \nINT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT \nLuke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the computer scope. \nLUKE (into comlink) Yes, that's it.  Dagobah. \nArtoo beeps a hopeful inquiry. \nLUKE (into comlink) No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. (getting a little nervous) I'm not picking up any cities or technology.  Massive life-form readings, though.  There's something alive down there... \nArtoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question. \nLUKE (into comlink) Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. \nEXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING \nThe X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud- covered planet. \nINT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT \nLuke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet. He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision.  An alarm buzzes in the background, Artoo beeps and whistles frantically. \nLUKE (into comlink) I know, I know!  All the scopes are dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... \nThe blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open. \nEXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK \nThe mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog. Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously. \nLEIA Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. \nHAN Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't got time for anything else. \nHan grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face. \nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK \nThe mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp. \nLuke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket. \nLUKE Ready for some power?  Okay. Let's see now.  Put that in there.  There you go. \nThe droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater. \nLUKE (sighs) Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists. \nNervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle. \nLUKE Still... there's something familiar about this place.  I feel like... I don't know... \nSTRANGE VOICE Feel like what? \nLuke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing is dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword. \nLUKE (looking at the creature) Like we're being watched! \nCREATURE Away with your weapon!  I mean you no harm. \nAfter some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest. \nCREATURE I am wondering, why are you here? \nLUKE I'm looking for someone. \nCREATURE Looking?  Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? \nThe little creature laughs. \nLUKE (Trying to keep from smiling) Right. \nCREATURE Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm. \nLUKE I don't think so.  I'm looking for a great warrior. \nCREATURE Ahhh!  A great warrior. (laughs and shakes his head) Wars not make one great. \nWith the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around. \nArtoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval. \nTheir tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from and takes a bite. \nLUKE Put that down.  Hey!  That's my dinner! \nThe creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face. \nCREATURE How you get so big, eating food of this kind? \nHe flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of Luke's supply cases. \nLUKE Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... \nCREATURE (teasing) Aww, cannot get your ship out? \nThe creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses patience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight. \nLUKE Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're making a mess.  Hey, give me that! \nCREATURE (retreating with the lamp) Mine!  Or I will help you not. \nClutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing closer to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature. \nLUKE I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. \nCREATURE Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is. \nArtoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it. \nArtoo beeps a few angry, \"Give me thats.\" \nCREATURE Ah, ah, ah! \nLUKE Oh, Artoo, let him have it! \nCREATURE Mine!  Mine! \nThen with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... very slowly. \nHAN You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. \nLeia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words. \nLEIA I happen to like nice men. \nHAN I'm a nice man. \nLEIA No, you're not.  You're... \nHe kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk. \nSuddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly. \nTHREEPIO Sir, sir!  I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. \nHan turns slowly, icily, from their embrace. \nHAN Thank you.  Thank you very much. \nTHREEPIO Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir. \nThe moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio. \nEXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD \nThe Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently seeking its prey. \nINT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE \nAsteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly. Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark Lord. \nNEEDA (in hologram) ... and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes.  Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. \nVADER No, Captain, they're alive.  I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. \nThe Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to Admiral Piett. \nPIETT Lord Vader. \nVADER Yes, Admiral, what is it? \nThe admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet. \nPIETT The Emperor commands you make contact with him. \nVADER Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. \nPIETT Yes, my lord. \nEXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER \nVader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars away from the rest of the fleet. \nINT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER \nThe Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure. He looks up and bows quickly. \nA twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before Vader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more frightening than Vader's. \nVADER What is thy bidding, my master? \nEMPEROR There is a great disturbance in the Force. \nVADER I have felt it. \nEMPEROR We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. \nVADER Yes, my master. \nEMPEROR He could destroy us. \nVADER He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no longer help him. \nEMPEROR The Force is strong with him.  The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. \nVADER If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. \nEMPEROR Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great asset.  Can it be done? \nVADER He will join us or die, my master. \nVader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away. \nEXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nTHREEPIO There it is.  Listen!  Listen! \nHAN I'm going out there. \nLEIA Are you crazy?! \nHAN I just got this bucket back together.  I'm not going to let something tear it apart. \nHe and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia follows. \nLEIA Then I'm going with you. \nTHREEPIO I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no. \nEXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON \nIt is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship. \nLeia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave. \nLEIA This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. \nHan kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave. \nHAN There's an awful lot of moisture in here. \nLEIA I don't know.  I have a bad feeling about this. \nHAN Yeah. \nChewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt. \nHAN (to Leia) Watch out! \nThe black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature. \nHAN Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.  They're chewing on the power cables. \nLEIA Mynocks? \nHAN Go on inside.  We'll clean them off if there are any more. \nJust then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence. \nTHREEPIO Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo! \nHan looks around the strange, dripping cave. \nHAN Wait a minute... \nHe unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave. The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle. \nChewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han. The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform. \nINT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA \nAs soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch. The ship continues to shake and heave. \nHAN All right, Chewie, let's get out of here! \nThe Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia hurries after. \nLEIA The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... \nHan rushes past her and heads for the cockpit. \nHAN (interrupting) No time to discuss this in committee. \nAnd with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship. \nLEIA (angry) I am not a committee! \nINT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nHan is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The cave-quake has greatly diminished. \nLEIA You can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field... \nHAN Sit down, sweetheart.  We're taking off! \nAs the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too. \nTHREEPIO Look! \nHAN I see it, I see it. \nSuddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward. \nFIRST CONTROLLER Yes, sir. \nPIETT Those Rebels won't escape us. \nA second controller interrupts. \nSECOND CONTROLLER Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. \nPIETT Right. \nThe group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle- scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit. \nVADER ... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.  You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive.  No disintegrations. \nBOBA FETT As you wish. \nAt that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement. \nPIETT Lord Vader!  My lord, we have them. \nEXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT \nThe Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a firing Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface. Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nThe ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches tensely out the window. \nTHREEPIO Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. \nChewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side. \nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD \nThe Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nHan corrects the angle of his ship. \nHAN Let's get out of here.  Ready for light-speed?  One... two... three! \nHan pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak bursts continue to rock the ship. \nHAN (frantic) It's not fair! \nChewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle. \nHAN The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! \nChewie puts his head in his hands, whining. \nLEIA (almost expecting it) No light-speed? \nHAN It's not my fault. \nTHREEPIO Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. \nHan pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever. \nHAN Turn her around. \nChewie barks in puzzlement. \nHAN I said turn her around!  I'm going to put all power in the front shield. \nLEIA You're going to attack them?! \nTHREEPIO Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... \nLEIA Shut up! \nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD \nThe Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the massive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts. \nINT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE \nThe tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes. \nNEEDA They're moving to attack position!  Shields up! \nNeeda and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.  At the last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight.  All is quiet. \nNEEDA Track them.  They may come around for another pass. \nTRACKING OFFICER Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. \nVader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than when he arrived. \nPIETT Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet. \nEXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET \nVader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nTHREEPIO Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? \nHAN (to Chewie) The fleet is beginning to break up.  Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. \nChewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin. \nTHREEPIO I really don't see how that is going to help.  Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances.  The Empire may be gracious enough... \nLeia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence. \nHAN Thank you. \nLEIA What did you have in mind for your next move? \nHAN Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. \nLEIA With the rest of the garbage. Then what? \nHAN Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.  Got any ideas? \nLEIA No.  Where are we? \nHAN The Anoat system. \nLEIA Anoat system.  There's not much there. \nHAN No.  Well, wait.  This is interesting.  Lando. \nHe points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen. \nLEIA Lando system? \nHAN Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian.  He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd like him. \nLEIA Thanks. \nHAN Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. \nLEIA (reading from the computer) A mining colony? \nHAN Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando conned somebody out of it.  We go back a long way, Lando and me. \nLEIA Can you trust him? \nHAN No.  But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. \nChewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window. \nHAN (into intercom) Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by. Detach! \nHan leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss. \nLEIA You do have your moments.  Not many, but you have them. \nEXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER \nAs the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars off into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races off into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's ship appears and moves after the Falcon. \nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY \nIn the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air. His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, looking for help. \nYODA Concentrate... feel the Force flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see.  Other places.  The future... the past.  Old friends long gone. \nLuke suddenly becomes distressed. \nLUKE Han!  Leia! \nThe two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then Luke himself tumbles over. \nYODA (shaking his head) Hmm.  Control, control.  You must learn control. \nLUKE I saw... I saw a city in the clouds. \nYODA Mmm.  Friends you have there. \nLUKE They were in pain. \nYODA (looks up) No.  There is another. \nEXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH \nLuke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and off into space. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY \nWithin the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in agitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the doorway. \nHAN The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. \nLEIA The sooner the better.  Something's wrong here.  No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. \nHan takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead. \nHAN Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. \nLEIA I don't trust Lando. \nHAN Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend.  Besides, we'll soon be gone. \nLEIA And then you're as good as gone, aren't you? \nNot speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM \nThe room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting Threepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from him to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY \nThe door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge. \nLEIA What happened? \nChewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation. \nHAN Where?  Found him in a junk pile? \nLEIA Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you think you can repair him? \nThe giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the princess and shrugs sadly. \nHAN Lando's got people who can fix him. \nLEIA No, thanks. \nThere is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando. \nLANDO I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting anything? \nLEIA Not really. \nLANDO You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. \nLEIA (coolly) Thank you. \nLANDO Will you join me for a little refreshment? \nHan looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of food and licks his lips. \nLANDO Everyone's invited, of course. \nLeia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando spots Threepio's remains. \nLANDO Having trouble with you droid? \nHan and Leia exchange a quick glance. \nHAN No.  No problem.  Why? \nHan and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY \nLeia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance behind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, pure-white columns. \nLANDO So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the Empire. \nLEIA So you're part of the mining guild then? \nLANDO No, not actually.  Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. \nThe group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end. \nHAN Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? \nThe cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter. \nLEIA Lando. \nHAN Get out of here, Lando! \nLANDO Shut up and listen!  Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. \nHAN Over to you? \nLANDO They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. \nLEIA What about Han? \nLANDO Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter. \nLEIA Vader wants us all dead. \nLANDO He doesn't want you at all.  He's after somebody called Skywalker. \nHAN Luke? \nLANDO Lord Vader has set a trap for him. \nLeia's mind is racing. \nLEIA And we're the bait. \nLANDO Well, he's on his way. \nHan's rage peaks. \nHAN Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? (spits it out) My friend! \nHan hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando stops them. \nLANDO Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. \nHAN Yeah, you're a real hero. \nLando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia and Chewie help him up. \nLEIA (dabs at his wound) You certainly have a way with people. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER \nFour armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader and Lando stand near the platform. \nVADER This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. \nAn Imperial soldier appears. \nIMPERIAL SOLDIER Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. \nVADER Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. \nThe soldier bows and leaves the chamber. \nLANDO Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it might kill him. \nVADER I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged.  We will test it... on Captain Solo. \nLando's face registers dismay. \nEXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING \nLuke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city. \nINT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT \nEncountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER \nThere is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special coffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack. \nTHREEPIO If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. \nHAN (to Lando) What's going on... buddy? \nLANDO You're being put into carbon freeze. \nBoba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader. \nBOBA FETT What if he doesn't survive?  He's worth a lot to me. \nVADER The Empire will compensate you if he dies.  Put him in! \nLuke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR \nLeia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention. \nThe guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers. Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia and one to Lando. \nLANDO Well done.  Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet.  Move. \nAs Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to undo Chewie's binding. \nLEIA What do you think you're doing? \nLANDO We're getting out of here. \nTHREEPIO I knew all along it had to be a mistake. \nChewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him. \nLEIA Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? \nLando tries to free himself from Chewie. \nLANDO (choking) I had no choice... \nChewie barks ferociously. \nTHREEPIO (to Chewie) What are you doing?  Trust him, trust him! \nLEIA Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie?  He had no choice. \nLANDO I'm just trying to help... \nLEIA We don't need any of your help. \nLANDO (choking) H-a-a-a... \nLEIA What? \nTHREEPIO It sounds like Han. \nLANDO There's still a chance to save Han... I mean, at the East Platform... \nLEIA Chewie. \nChewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back. \nTHREEPIO (to Lando) I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee. \nEXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP \nThe two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold. \nBOBA FETT Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. \nAnd with that, the door slams shut. \nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR \nLando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly. \nTHREEPIO Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you been? \nChewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend. \nTHREEPIO Turn around, you wooly...! (to Artoo) Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! \nWhistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing group. \nTHREEPIO Well, at least your still in one piece!  Look what happened to me! \nEXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY \nAn elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform. \nJust as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky. \nIn wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship. \nTHREEPIO Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind you! \nA laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the elevator. \nLeia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons. \nBut after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward. \nThey race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp. \nTHREEPIO Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow! \nChewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire. \nLANDO Leia!  Go! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR \nArtoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the Falcon. \nTHREEPIO I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.  Of course, I've looked better. \nArtoo beeps understandingly. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nChewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches over their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship begins to move. \nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK \nThe Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in pursuit. \nINT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT \nLuke moves along the railing and up to the control room. \nVader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet Vader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke backward toward the gantry. \nVADER You are beaten.  It is useless to resist.  Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. \nLuke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers. \nLuke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward. \nLuke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end.  Vader follows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to go. \nVADER There is no escape.  Don't make me destroy you.  You do not yet realize your importance.  You have only begun to discover your power.  Join me and I will complete your training.  With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy. \nLUKE I'll never join you! \nVADER If you only knew the power of the dark side.  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. \nLUKE He told me enough!  It was you who killed him. \nVADER No.  I am your father. \nShocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief. \nLUKE No.  No.  That's not true! That's impossible! \nVADER Search your feelings.  You know it to be true. \nLUKE No!  No!  No! \nVADER Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this.  It is your destiny.  Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.  Come with me.  It is the only way. \nVader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke. \nA calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall. \nINT. REACTOR SHAFT \nSuddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft. When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform. \nINT. EXHAUST PIPE \nLuke tumbles through the exhaust pipe. \nHe slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK \nUnable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the undermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane. \nLUKE Ben... Ben, please! \nLuke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down. He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust pipe. \nLUKE Ben.  Leia! \nThere is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below. \nLUKE Hear me!  Leia! \nINT.

Lando anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some switches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing on the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the shape. \nLEIA Star Destroyer. \nLANDO All right, Chewie.  Ready for light-speed. \nLEIA If your people fixed the hyperdrive. \nAnother explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the panel next to her flashes on. \nLEIA All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. \nChewie barks in agreement. \nLANDO Punch it! \nThe Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense, expectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets out a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship. \nLANDO They told me they fixed it.  I trusted them to fix it.  It's not my fault! \nChewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives Lando and angry shove as he storms past him. \nEXT.

HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH \nA Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the lumbering snow walkers. \nThe officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks into his comlink. \nTRENCH OFFICER Echo Station Three-T-Eight. \nINT.

HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD \nA speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other Rebel craft race just above the icy plain. \nA giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and sending it crashing in a ball of flames. \nINT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT \nGeneral Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward. \nLuke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine. \nINT.

A thin cable follows the projectile from the gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull. \nStill running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker. \nThe walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword. \nHe takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by - and just misses him. \nThe giant walker stops in mid-step.

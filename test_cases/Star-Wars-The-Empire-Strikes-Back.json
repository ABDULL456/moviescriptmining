She doesn't know where he is. \nHAN I don't know where he is. \nTHREEPIO Nobody knows where he is. \nHAN What do you mean, \"nobody knows\"? \nHan glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet. \nTHREEPIO Well, uh, you see... \nHan jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him. \nHAN Deck Officer.  Deck Officer! \nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu... \nHan abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer approaches. \nDECK OFFICER Yes, sir? \nHAN Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? \nDECK OFFICER I haven't seen him.  It's possible he came in through the south entrance. \nHAN It's possible?  Why don't you go find out?  It's getting dark out there. \nDECK OFFICER Yes, sir. \nThe deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's mouth. \nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire what's going on? \nHAN Why not? \nTHREEPIO Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger. \nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL \nThe deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the tunnel. \nDECK OFFICER Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. \nHAN Not likely.  Are the speeders ready? \nDECK OFFICER Not yet.  We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. \nHAN Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. \nDECK OFFICER Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. \nHAN That's right.  And my friends out in it. \nASSISTANT OFFICER I'll cover sector twelve.  Have com-control set screen alpha. \nHan pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun. \nDECK OFFICER Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. \nHAN Then I'll see you in hell! \nHan maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night. \nEXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK \nThe jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs. \nExhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach. \nHe focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration. \nJust as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand. \nThe young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain. \nEXT.

As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air. \nEXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE\t\t\t\t HANGAR - DUSK \nArtoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves stiffly over to him. \nTHREEPIO You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do.  And my joints are freezing up. \nArtoo beeps, long and low. \nTHREEPIO Don't say thing like that!  Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. (to himself) Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll be quite all right. \nThreepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully keeps his vigil. \nEXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK \nThe wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up, but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses. \nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nPrincess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors. \nA Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess. \nLIEUTENANT Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. \nTHREEPIO Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. \nLeia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought. \nDERLIN Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight.  The shield doors must be closed. \nHe turns to the lieutenant. \nDERLIN Close the doors. \nLIEUTENANT Yes, sir. \nThe lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps. \nTHREEPIO Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one. \nLeia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl. \nTHREEPIO Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll be all right.  He's quite clever, you know... for a human being. \nEXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK \nLuke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination. \nBEN Luke... Luke. \nLUKE (weakly) Ben? \nBEN You will go to the Dagobah system. \nLUKE Dagobah system? \nBEN There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. \nThe image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon. \nLUKE (groaning faintly) Ben... Ben. \nLuke drops into unconsciousness. \nHan pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him urgently. \nHAN Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. \nLuke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow. \nHan carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the Tauntaun expires. \nHAN Not much time. \nHe pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast. \nLUKE (moaning) Ben... Ben... \nHAN Hang on, kid. \nLUKE Dagobah system... \nHan ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass. \n", "test1_id": 2052, "test2_input": "WEDGE One more pass. \nJANSON Coming around.

Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground. \nINT.

REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR \nMuffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of the hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the wings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient. \nHAN No, no!  No!  This one goes there, that one goes there.  Right? \nIn another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up into Luke's X-wing fighter. \nTHREEPIO Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear. \nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD \nThe fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base, firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions erupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.

The speeder fills with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit. \nLUKE (into comlink) Hobbie, I've been hit! \nINT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER \nApart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is strangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing hallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the underground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a shambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and Threepio near one of the control boards. \nHAN You all right? \nLeia nods.  She is surprised to see him. \nLEIA Why are you still here? \nHAN I heard the command center had been hit. \nLEIA You got your clearance to leave. \nHAN Don't worry.  I'll leave.

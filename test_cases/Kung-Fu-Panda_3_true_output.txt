Po bumps the vase which falls and BREAKS. 
PO (CONT'D) Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna fix it. Do you have some glue? 
The vase debris screams as Po tries to pick up the pieces. 
PO (CONT'D) Ow! Ooh. Splinter. 
Po fumbles around. Shifu looks irked. 
SHIFU So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior. Hmmm? 
PO Uh...I guess so? 
Shifu smiles and shakes his head. 
SHIFU Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll. 
He points to a dragon on the ceiling with a single scroll in its mouth. 
PO (in awe) Whoa. (then) So how does this work? You have a ladder or trampoline or...? 
SHIFU You think it's that easy? That I am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power? 
PO No, I... 
SHIFU One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you. 
PO Someone like me? 
Shifu walks around Po - pointing out his weaknesses. 
SHIFU Yes. Look at you...this fat butt. 
Shifu HITS Po on the butt with his staff. 
SHIFU (CONT'D) Flabby arms... 
PO Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. 
Shifu SWATS Po on the arm with his staff. 
SHIFU And this ridiculous belly. 
Shifu HITS Po in the belly with his staff. 
PO Hey... 
SHIFU --and utter disregard for personal hygiene. 
PO (pointing at Shifu) Now wait a minute. That's a little uncalled-for. 
SHIFU Don't stand that close...I can smell your breath. 
PO Listen...Oogway said that I was the- 
Shifu pinches Po's outstretched digit. 
PO (CONT'D) (gasp) The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi Finger Hold! 
SHIFU (sly) Oh, you know this hold? 
PO DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna sty-- YES.

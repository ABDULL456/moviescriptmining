Marty and Clara have waited stiffly through this interruption, and now they look at each other and smile. 
MARTY Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then. 
CLARA Okay. 
Marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street door. 
OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT HOUSE. 
Marty stands a moment in the clear black night air, expressionless, but within him, a strange exhilaration is beginning to stir. He mosies away from the building along the sidewalk, CAMERA panning with him. 
He strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he knew where he was going. 
176TH STREET. 
CLOSER SHOT of Marty marching along 176th Street. He quickly reaches the Grand Concourse. Here he pauses a moment, a little at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he needs the uptown bus. 
He moves across the wide street to get to the other side of the boulevard. Again, he seems to lose track of which direction is homeward. 
He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming. 
Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot, then drops back into the stiff stride as he approaches... 
THE INTERSECTION OF THE GRAND CONCOURSE. 
The corner near the bus stop is deserted. Marty stops, leans against the pole of the bus stop sign. 
Abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further. 
SERIES OF INTERCUTS: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves back. The traffic moves by him. He stands in the wide street, then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises his arm and calls out. 
MARTY Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi! 
CLOSE-UP of Marty standing in the street, crying... 
MARTY Taxi!... Taxi!... 
FADE OUT. 
PILLETTI HOME, MARTY'S BEDROOM. DAY 
Marty is in his trousers and T-shirt. He whistles as he assembles his toilet articles for a shave. He starts out toward the living room, still whistling. Bright sunlight pours through the curtains on his window. 
SECOND FLOOR. 
Marty's whistling accompanies him to the second floor where he turns into the bathroom. CAMERA ANGLES to include Mrs. Pilletti's bedroom, disclosing her wearing an old faded batiste kimona, puttering around her room and cleaning. As Marty's toneless tune reaches her, Mrs. Pilletti turns her head and stares off, listening. 
THOMAS AND VIRGINIA'S APARTMENT. DAY. 
Catherine, in the living room, is packing her meager but neatly folded belongings into an old European carpet bag. She has regained her stiff, mordant crustiness. The mild WAIL of a baby can be heard. 
BEDROOM.

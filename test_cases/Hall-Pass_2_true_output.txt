FRED 
(BEING BRAVE) This is actually good--you know, that they're leaving. You don't need five hunters to bag two birds. 
RICK No, you do not. And I love those guys but, let's be honest, they're not exactly chick-magnets. 
FRED You can say that again. Yep, the steak always looks better if you trim away some of the fat. And let's face it, we are the steak. 
RICK Dream team, baby. The guys CLINK BEERS. Then: 
RICK (CONT'D) Maybe we should call the girls and ask them to come home. Fred glances at him, aghast. 
FRED What? 
RICK Who are we kidding, man? Do you really think we're going to be picking up any girls this week? 
FRED Why wouldn't we? 
RICK Because that's not us anymore. 
FRED Wait a second. You want to quit? 
RICK Fred, we're not the same guys we were fifteen years ago, back when we were single. We've changed. Fred stares at him, incredulous. 
FRED No, man, you've changed. All you care about is yourself--what about all the guys out there who are counting on us to make this thing work? 
RICK What are you talking about? 
FRED Don't you get it? 
(DRAMATIC BEAT) We're the chosen ones! Fred stands up and points at Rick. 
FRED (CONT'D) That's right--this thing is bigger than us! Our wives didn't give us this hall pass, the good Lord did! And what do we have to show for it? Nothing. 
RICK Come off it, Fred. Obviously hooking up isn't something we really want--if it was, we could've done it by now. 
FRED Could we have? Rick is taken aback by this. 
RICK 
(WANING CONFIDENCE) Well ...of course. I mean, if we'd really wanted to. 
FRED Guess what? I did want to. And you know how close I got? We're three days in and the only woman I've spoken to was our waitress at Outback. And she never even made eye-contact. 
RICK I don't really care if some waitress makes eye-contact. I want to go home--I miss my wife and kids. 
FRED Let me explain something to you: If Grace and Maggie find out we can't get laid on our own, they'll start thinking we need them to get laid. Do you know what that'll do to the balance of power in our homes? It'll destroy it! Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed. 
RICK Well, what if we just tell them that we did hook up? 
FRED We can't. Grace'll know. She always knows when I'm lying. 
RICK Hey, what about a massage parlor? 
FRED No! That's giving up. Fred glares at him. 
FRED (CONT'D) You don't get it, do you? A hall pass ain't all about sex. It's about being man enough to pick up a woman even though you may not be what--in the traditional sense--is considered... (makes quotes with 
FINGERS) .good-looking, or... (finger quotes again) .appealing. Rick seems stung by this news. 
FRED (CONT'D) Look, if we can't show that something positive can come from having a hall pass, then the whole concept is dead. Not just for us...but for all mankind. Rick thinks about this for a moment, then stands up with a 
RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE. 
RICK All right, let's get out of here. I know exactly where we should be. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT 
The party's in full swing. A hundred or so PLAYERS, PLAYER'S GIRLFRIENDS, and FRIENDS are in and out of the pool, drinking beer and rocking out to Arcade Fire on the boombox. 
ANGLE ON Maggie and Rick Coleman sipping beers while in the b.g. we see Grace PLAYING VOLLEYBALL in the pool (still in the shorts and t-shirt she wore that afternoon.) 
MAGGIE So how about you, Rick, do you have any children? 
RICK COLEMAN Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom keeps talking about hooking me up with your cousin Kate. Maggie LAUGHS. 
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) That's not a good sign. 
MAGGIE No, I hardly know her. She moved to Miami when I was eight. 
RICK COLEMAN That's what your mom said. I coach at the University of Miami. 
MAGGIE Then you should go out with her.

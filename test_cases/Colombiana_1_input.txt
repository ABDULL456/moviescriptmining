ROSS The Gemini cartel. Their crimes are self explanatory, if you can read. Now I know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. And since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? And since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? But with this last killing... 
He holds up a stack of folders from his desk. 
ROSS We have one. As we go to the video tape. 
He hits a button and the video replay of Cat walking the unconscious guard through the door. 
ROSS We can't see the assassin, but we can see... 
He freezes the tape. Points to the time mark on the tape. 
ROSS The time. 2 AM. Which means our perp was in the station at...I don't have to spell it out for you. 
He begins to hand the folders out. 
ROSS These are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two AM. Cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. Everyone. One of them is our target. I want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. I want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. Run down every lead. Check out every story. Our killer is out there. And we're going to find him. Before he kills again. 
THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
As an elevator train rumbles by below... 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
An elevator train rumbles by above. 
PAN DOWN TO 
A car parking. And DANNY DELANEY, preoccupied, a pleasant, easy going, good looker at 28, closes the door, and walks to the entrance of his low slung apartment building. He enters. 
INT. DANNY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Danny puts his key in the door, finds that it is unlocked. He pauses, then enters. 
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Danny enters his darkened apartment. Goes to turn on the switch... 
VOICE Don't move. 
Danny's hand freezes. He stands very still. 
VOICE Take off your shirt. 
DANNY Do I have to? 
VOICE Now. 
Danny complies. 
VOICE Turn around. 
He does. To darkness. And then, a match is struck, a candle is lit. Standing before him, in garters, thigh highs, a very sexy bra, and fuck me pumps is... 
CAT Hello Danny. 
DANNY Hello Jennifer. 
Cat closes to an inch of him. 
DANNY You should have called. 
CAT Why? 
DANNY I could have been out. 
CAT I have a key. 
DANNY I could have been late. 
She begins to kiss him, lightly around the mouth. 
CAT I've got nowhere to go. 
DANNY It's just... 
CAT Just what? 
She keeps kissing him, lightly on the neck... 
DANNY You show up whenever you want to... 
CAT And then we have the most incredible sex. (BEAT) Ever. 
DANNY I know. I'm just saying... 
He fumbles for the words. 
DANNY Wouldn't you like to go to dinner sometime? 
She keeps nibbling. 
CAT Uh-uh. This taste good enough. 
DANNY Or a movie? 
Licking him. 
CAT No. They put me to sleep. 
DANNY So let's pop in a DVD and you can spend the night here? 
She stops. Looks him in the eye. 
CAT Would you like the key back? 
DANNY No. I just want to get...I don't know...

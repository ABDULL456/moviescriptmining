{"train": "\"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE\" \nby \nCharles Randolph \nFIRST DRAFT \nMarch 1, 1998 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE \nA dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. \nShe runs, and runs. \nShe slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway. \nBoth in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. \nShe runs. Sees something. Stops cold. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OFFICE OF \"DEATHWATCH AUSTIN\" - SUNRISE \nA clock on the wall: 6:11. \nBeneath the clock a simple banner reads \"DeathWatch Austin.\" \nYOUNG MAN (O.S.) It's probably been about seven minutes... \nThe office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. \nAbout 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. \nFive people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. \nThe clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. \nCONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip. \nCOLLEGE GUY Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 6:12. Roughly eight minutes. (a beat as he records the time) Number 36 this year for the Great State of Texas. \nThey all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands. \nCONSTANCE David, don't start throwing things. \nA PHONE RINGS. David controls himself. \nDAVID I'm going home. Let's do the press fax tomorrow. \nAnother PHONE RINGS. Constance stands. \nCONSTANCE Go. I'll do it. \nHe nods to her, exits. \nShe walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male. \nThe wall clock reads 6:13. \nEXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE \nThe office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty parking lot to Volvo station wagon. \nAs the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance. \nINT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE \nDavid drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE \nDavid stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance. \nINT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE \nHe stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the reflection of the rising sun. \nBACK TO DAVID \nHe stares, then: \nDAVID Hey! \nBILL (V.O.) Meaning you've just spent a very public seven days in jail for a very public contempt of court citation. \nBITSEY Protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy. \nBILL (V.O.) And I, we continue to appreciate your decision. We're just concerned. A rapist slash murderer, five days before he's executed, demands a reporter known for protecting sexual deviants. A reporter who is also a very attractive woman -- \nBitsey and Kruger moan in unison. \nKRUGER This is disparate treatment. \nBITSEY I could go if I were an ugly blabby guy? \nBILL (V.O.) There's an agenda issue here which would be diffused with an older male... \nKRUGER I hear lawyers gleefully saying the words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc. \nBITSEY 'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex.' \nKRUGER You've gotta let her go now. \nBILL (V.O.) That's not quite what I meant. \nKRUGER He's gotta let you go. \nBITSEY 'Certain references were made -- ' \nBILL (V.O.) (interrupting) All right. All right. Enough. The intern is with you at all times? \nBitsey vehemently shakes her head \"no\" to this idea. \nKRUGER Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye. \nKruger hangs up the phone before he can respond. \nBITSEY I'm not baby-sitting. \nKruger reaches for a chip. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT \nZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel. We hear strained patience in her voice. \nBITSEY Gale was seen leaving the house. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 45 - NIGHT \nThe car's lights move past a sign: \"Huntsville 27 Miles.\" \nBITSEY (V.O.) His sperm was inside her. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT \nBITSEY His prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag. \nZack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor, hands handcuffed behind her. Over her head is an opaque white plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape. \nZACK Half-a-thumb print. \nBITSEY Okay, half-a-thumb print. \nZACK Could have touched it before it was a murder weapon. \nBITSEY Do you fondle your friends' garbage bags? \nZACK Yeah, I get very touchy around household plastics. 'Hello, everybody -- ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something. \nShe looks at him a beat. \nBITSEY Hey, Zack? \nZACK Yeah. \nBITSEY He did it. \nZACK But the murder's way too fucking clumsy. And this guy's a major intellectual. Top of his Yale class, a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books. He's an academic stud. \nBITSEY And, empirically speaking, a psychotic. \nZack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and son (Chase, 6). \nZACK Look at his wife, she's a regular Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father was Ambassador to Spain -- \nBITSEY (looking at the car's instrument panel) Shit! The light's on again. \nCLOSEUP - OVERHEAT LIGHT \nis on. \nBACK TO SCENE \nZACK Ignore it. It's a rental. \nBitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. She goes and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion by David Gale. \nBITSEY Little early, isn't it? \nZACK The non-smoking section's over there. \nBITSEY I meant the book. \nZACK Oh. \nBitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down. \nBITSEY What time is it? \nZACK 9:15. The waitress says the Ellis Unit is about fifteen minutes out of town, so we've got like five and half hours. I -- \nBITSEY Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food. \nZACK I was thinking we should drive to Austin, check out the crime scene. Could be some story stuff for us. \nBITSEY (without looking up) First, this isn't a story. It's an interview. We come, I listen, you watch, we go home. Second, there is no 'us' in the assignment. \nZACK Okay, what do I watch you do for the next five hours? \nBITSEY (closing the menu) Drive around looking for decent restaurant. \nZACK You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you justice. \nShe's unsure how to interpret his comment. He smiles. \nBITSEY My reputation got us invited here. I play by the rules. It's called objectivity. \nThey stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to read, affects a shiver. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY \nDrizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse is a sign: \"TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report.\" \nSUPERIMPOSE: \"DAY ONE\" \nThe rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY \nBitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella. \nZACK So where do we report? \nThree razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building with a sign: \"REPORT HERE.\" \nBitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the building. \nSomeone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty yards away. He watches them neutrally. \nCAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building. Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face. \nINT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE \nAs Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a wait-just-a-second finger. \nGROVER Well, I don't rightly know one fraternity from another. But if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute... You do that, Susan... Bye now. \nThe office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's). \nGrover hangs up. \nGROVER (to the Woman) Thank you, Margie. (turning to Bitsey and Zack) Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I presume. \nBITSEY Yes, hello. \nThey shake hands. \nZACK Stemmons. \nGROVER Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again. I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community relations. \nGrover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach, his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly. \nMARGIE (WOMAN) He's usually real good with names. \nGROVER (to Bitsey) And these days I always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.? \nBITSEY Bitsey. \nGROVER Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin' your umbrella. \nMARGIE Okey dokey. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE \nBitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows, turns his collar up. \nBITSEY This is Zack. \nBELYEU Pleasure. (turning) And this is the man of the hour. \nThey move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really loudly) interrupts: \nGUARD (V.O.) Sit down, Gale. \nAll wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed. \nDAVID Hello. \nBITSEY Hello. \nZACK Hi. \nBELYEU Now, why can't they turn that thing down? \nDAVID (to the microphone above him) My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume. \nA beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture. \nDAVID They're practicing being cruel and unusual. \nBELYEU Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit. \nBelyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag. \nBELYEU Now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two-hour sessions. Today, tomorrow and Thursday, all at three in the P.M. I'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. Furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind. (to David) You have my Gregg book? \nDAVID I need it for Billy's appeal. \nBELYEU (to Bitsey) My client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook. (takes out his planner) Now, I have some papers for which I need your Jo Ann Hancock. (handing her a business card) Come by my Austin office at your earliest convenience. Thursday mornin', say. \nBitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up at the microphone. She understands, nods. \nBELYEU Fine, till Thursday then. \nBelyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards. \nBELYEU Good luck, Miss Bloom. (to David) I'll come by later. We can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'. \nDavid waves \"get lost.\" Belyeu turns. \nBELYEU Bye, ya' all. \nThey watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking at the floor, caught in a thought. \nBITSEY So... \nDAVID Sorry. Have a seat. \nShe does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, sincere, charming, vaguely devilish. \nBITSEY He's a character. \nDAVID Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. We called it playing 'Execution.' \nDavid looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse. \nDAVID Since I grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family I have. \nBITSEY Where's your ex-wife? \nBitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen. \nDAVID We agreed minimal contact would be easier. Please don't mention her, or my son. \nBITSEY All right. Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' I'll take it to my grave. But then you know that about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. \nDavid smiles, nods. \nBITSEY (referring to the pen) Is this recording equipment? \nHe shrugs. \nDAVID How should we start? \nBITSEY I'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the magazine, the format. You chose me. \nShe sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation. \nBITSEY Go. \nDavid looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nShe affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex. \nBERLIN Any thing. \nHe checks the room, then comes over to her, close. \nDAVID Tell you what, I'll give you good grade, a really good grade, if you will... (leans down to her ear, whispers sensually) ...study. \nHe smiles, turns, walks away. As she watches, anger builds. \nINT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY \nDavid comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowded hall. \nCONSTANCE David! \nDAVID Hey. \nCONSTANCE The T.A. finished transcribing the Governor's radio and TV comments. Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The woman breathes in soundbites. \nShe hands him a copy. \nDAVID (pretends to read a quote) 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa.' \nCONSTANCE You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff. \nDAVID Tell me again why you aren't doing the debate. \nCONSTANCE Telegenics. You have a cuter butt. \nDAVID I hadn't noticed. \nCONSTANCE I know. \nDAVID That's not what I meant. \nEXT. U.T. CAMPUS - DAY \nDavid and Constance exit the building into the sun. \nCONSTANCE She's gonna do the whole mother thing. She empathizes with you completely, but experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And flirt politely. \nDAVID 'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year.' \nThey've come to a sidewalk junction, stop. \nCONSTANCE And watch your ego. Don't come across as one of those I-hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types. \nDAVID Anything else? \nCONSTANCE Yeah, don't fall into one of your brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting new federal stats from Amnesty tonight. \nDAVID I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them to Sharon's number at the house. \nShe looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses. \nCONSTANCE If you have a hang-over tomorrow -- \nDAVID (hangs up, walking away) Apropos playing Mother. \nCONSTANCE (calling after him) Ten o'clock! (beat) Bright-eyed and bushy tailed! \nEXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nThe house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, far better than what a university professor can afford. \nThe grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway, his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front sits a new VW Beetle. \nINT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT \nDavid's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David wears a t-shirt which says \"Evil-Doer & Curious Person.\" The room is over-decorated with boy stuff. \nDAVID Did you mark your calendar? \nCHASE (looking up at it) Yep. \nINSERT - KID'S CALENDAR \nhangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it. Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley face in an adult's. \nBACK TO SCENE \nCHASE (counting on his fingers) Only... three more Spain days. \nDavid puts the jeans and shoes away. \nDAVID Only three. That's great, huh? \nDavid comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table. \nDAVID What's he doing in here? \nDAVID The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. I think it's called schmuck. \nBERLIN Aren't we so fucking clever. \nROSS (standing, escaping) I suppose I should get us another. David? \nDAVID Black Bush. \nRoss walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads \"Sex is Power.\" \nBERLIN You were a jerk this afternoon. \nA beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward. \nDAVID For what it's worth, I didn't know about the suspension. \nBERLIN Is that supposed to be an apology? \nDAVID More like a conciliation. \nON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE \nRoss has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect. \nSAME SCENE - LATER \nThe table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles empty, the flowers in disarray. \"I'M TOO SEXY\" PLAYS LOUDLY in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from the table. \nCAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people now dance, and out onto the patio. \nA crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites. \nROSS (slurring a bit) All right. (clears his throat) As the poets have mournfully sung, Death takes the innocent young, The screamingly funny, The rolling in money, And those who are very well hung. \nLaughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: \"Gale! Gale! Gale!\" \nDAVID (feeling good but very much in control) There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom. \nLaughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks. \nBERLIN One more. C'mon, one more. \nDAVID Enough. That's enough. \nThe crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds. \nROSS Do you bow to the Queen? \nDavid looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds. \nFULL SHOT OF PATIO \nThe crowd is chanting: \"Ross! Ross! Ross!\" \nSAME SCENE - LATER \nThe crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse. Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS. Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it. \nINT. BATHROOM \nDavid is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom. \nDAVID I'm done. \nShe locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed. \nHe folds the towel. \nBERLIN I'm not a student anymore. \nDAVID Don't think I want to know what that means. \nDavid lays the towel down, leans back against the sink -- they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom. \nBERLIN There once was woman named Berlin, Who liked a bit now and again. Not now and again, But Now! And Again! And Again! And Again! And Again! \nHe laughs. \nBERLIN Cute, huh? \nDAVID Cute. \nBERLIN I have a secret. But I have to come over there to tell you. \nHe makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward him. \nBERLIN Here I come. \nShe comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter. \nBERLIN (whispering) I wasn't after the grade. \nBerlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax. \nShe scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nThe MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from the power button. He gestures \"that's-all-folks.\" \nINT. BATHROOM \nDavid and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nBLACK \nFADE IN: \nINT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nConstance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes into her bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nShe turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits. \nFADE TO: \nBLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY \nDavid and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. She has stacks of paper spread in front of her. \nCONSTANCE Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. Wouldn't matter. Corrections would let him go. Governor Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works.' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition. Just like happened in England. Are you okay? \nDAVID (coming out of it) Sorry. Yeah. \nHe makes an effort, plays the \"good listener.\" \nCONSTANCE But it hasn't happened, not since '76. And won't happen. \nDavid nods. \nCONSTANCE Dead men can't make a case. \nDAVID And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count. \nCONSTANCE Just keep it rational. The death penalty is expensive and ineffective. No one wants to see a murderer as a victim. \nDAVID Um-hum. \nCONSTANCE And stop that. \nDAVID What? \nCONSTANCE Active listening. I hate active listeners. Makes me feel like I'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. Did you bring the Amnesty fax? \nDAVID I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home. \nCONSTANCE I have a copy. \nShe looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is looking out the window, caught in a thought. \nCONSTANCE You want to tell me what's up. \nDAVID Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night. \nCONSTANCE (teasing) I hope you used a condom. \nA beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home. \nCONSTANCE Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of yours? \nA longer beat. He holds her eyes. \nDAVID It was Berlin. \nShe's stunned, then genuinely angry. \nCONSTANCE Oh, that's great, great. I can hear the grapevine now. They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience. \nHe looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched. \nCONSTANCE A power differential equals coercion. Great. You are so weak. \nDAVID Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God. \nCONSTANCE I know you can tell yourself it's a position I aspire to, but believe me, I would rather... \nShe moves toward her handlers. \nGOVERNOR HARDIN You folks keep up the good work. We need that opposition. \nConstance's and David's polite smiles follow her. \nEXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY \nConstance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the parking lot. \nCONSTANCE Your exact words were, 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work.' Now I'm telling you: Your ego's in the way of work. \nDAVID (indicating the station) Look, I wanted you to do this anyway. \nCONSTANCE You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate. \nDAVID What's that supposed to mean? \nCONSTANCE It means DeathWatch suffers because you're so anxious to finger authority, to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be. Learn to work without an audience. Try squeezing money from the donor list. Have you ever licked one single mail-out envelope? \nThey come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s). \nMAN #2 (SUIT) Mr. Gale? \nDAVID Look, guys, there's not much more to say -- \nMAN #2 Rameriz, Austin police. This is Officer Haslinger. \nThe officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine it more closely. \nDAVID What, arguing with the Governor is a crime? \nThe officers exchange a look. \nMAN #3 (SUIT) No, sir, rape is. \nConstance and David look at each other, stunned. \nOVERHEAD SHOT \nCAMERA QUICKLY CRANES UP and ROTATES. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY \nCAMERA CRANES DOWN and ROTATES, ENDING UPRIGHT BY Bitsey as she listens to David. \nGUARD (V.O.) (over the loudspeaker) Gale, time's up. \nThe speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over to the guard's booth. \nDAVID Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing. My skin was beneath her nails. It didn't look like anything but rape. Two days later she called the D.A., said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped. \nBITSEY Why'd she do it? \nA guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the back to be handcuffed. \nDAVID (shrugs) Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be. \nBITSEY Do you know where I can find her? \nDAVID First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't signed, but I suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power.' \nCuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened. \nBITSEY Anything written on it? \nDAVID Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you can know.' (exiting the cage) See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom. \nEXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nBitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms. Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the lot is wet. \nBITSEY Try phone records, a net search. \nZACK Fucking better than watching you work. \nThey walk a beat in silence. \nZACK You think he's telling the truth? \nBITSEY Don't ask me that. I don't know. There is no truth, only perspectives. \nZACK Can't say that. If you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth -- it's a logical contradiction. \nBITSEY Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack? \nShe takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish. \nGOTH GIRL She let him crash here sometimes. He was like constantly wasted. Drank Black Label religiously. \nBitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around. \nBy the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2). \nGOTH GIRL This is where the tripod was. My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. Gale must have buried them. These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later. \nZACK He's not exactly a serial killer. \nGOTH GIRL Whatever. \nShe moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6). \nGOTH GIRL She was like totally naked right here. The meter man saw her through the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better. (pointing) He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. They found sticky stuff from the tape on them. \nZack picks up the gloves. \nGOTH GIRL We ask folks not to touch the exhibit. \nZACK Right. \nHe puts them back. \nGOTH GIRL The totally sick part was where they found the key -- \nBITSEY We know, you can save that. \nZACK What? Where was it? \nGOTH GIRL It was in her stomach, dude. He made her swallow it before he bagged her. \nA beat. Zack's shocked. \nGOTH GIRL That's pretty much the highlight. \nGot questions? \nINT. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nBitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville. Zack smokes out the window. \nBITSEY It was in the case file. \nZACK Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder than Wisconsin. \nBITSEY (looking in the rearview mirror) Zack, open your vanity. \nZACK What? \nBITSEY The vanity mirror, pull it down. \nHe does so. \nBITSEY See that truck behind us? \nZACK Yeah. \nBITSEY Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area? \nThey look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup. \nZACK Same truck. \nBITSEY Weird coincidence, huh? \nZACK (turning) Coincidences are always weird, that's why they're coincidences. \nINT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY \nBitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking in hushed tones. \nA beat. \nDAVID Off-the-record? \nBITSEY Alright, we're off. \nDAVID Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew. \nBITSEY You're telling me someone's framing you? \nDAVID It's more than that. \nDAVID There was a tripod. \nBITSEY Right, facing her body. Are we on? \nDAVID (nods agreement) Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there. \nSHARON (cracking her window) Come on, Chase. \nChase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep and gets in. \nDavid watches them drive away. Chase's hand waves out the window until they are out of the parking lot. \nINSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN \nwith an e-mail message: \"David, I want a divorce. I'm sorry to say it so plainly, but that's how I feel it. I don't need time to think, this whole 'rape' thing has only forced...\" \nINT. DAVID'S U.T. OFFICE - DAY \nDavid sits in front of his computer, staring into space. \nThe office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls, fill the desk. \nThere's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass. There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters. \nCONSTANCE You could at least hide the bottle. \nDavid closes the e-mail. She collapses in the chair opposite his desk, exhausted. \nDAVID Well? \nCONSTANCE Officially, you're on sabbatical. Unofficially, they want you to look for another position. It was four to two. \nA beat as he absorbs the information. \nDAVID How did Ross vote? \nCONSTANCE You're not supp... Against you. \nDavid nods. \nDAVID And you? \nCONSTANCE Against my politics. \nDavid mouths a \"thank you.\" \nEXT. GALE HOUSE - DAY \nA Century 21 real estate agent is putting a \"For Sale\" sign in the front yard. \nINT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY \nDavid is having lunch with an IVY LEAGUE-LOOKING MALE in his fifties. Only water and bread are on the table. \nDAVID So, I wanted to get your feedback on the idea. \nThe Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread. \nIVY LEAGUER Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here, as I'm sure others have, and plead departmental cutbacks. Claim you need more publications, or I need a minority, whatever. All bull- geschichte. Your record's brilliant. You're an original voice worth -- in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil -- your weight in gold. Hell, it's not even the alcohol. It'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac. But, to speak plainly, if I hire you, in the eyes of the regents, alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a rapist. \nHe takes a bite of bread. \nIVY LEAGUER You're not politically correct, Dr. Gale. Welcome to the club. \nEXT./INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY \nDavid stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a- month apartment. Books are stacked everywhere. An Interstate runs nearby. He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area. \nDAVID'S POV \nA horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo) attempts to do Tai Chi. \nCHASE (V.O.) (on his mom's answering machine) We aren't home. Please, tell us a message. \nSHARON (V.O.) (cueing him in the b.g.) At the beep. \nCHASE (V.O.) At the peep. \nON DAVID \nDavid lets the PHONE BEEP, just stares down at the man, saying nothing. \nEXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - DAY \nAs David gets out of his Volvo, a SORORITY PLEDGE (funny clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches. \nShe takes his picture with a Polaroid camera. \nShe runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls sit. \nSORORITY PLEDGE I got it! I got it! \nShe jumps in the car and they speed away. \nINT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY \nThe office is Philip Stark chic with large window walls -- \nBACK ON SCENE \nCONSTANCE I've got a call with Hawkins tonight, and if national will commit emergency funds... \nShe lifts a small plant, moves to the porch. \nDAVID Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll only prove the system works. \nHe notices she has bruises on her arms. \nCONSTANCE But I'll save a life. \nDAVID (referring to the bruises) Where'd you get those? \nCONSTANCE Spring cleaning. \nEXT. CONSTANCE'S PORCH \nCONSTANCE She went up at 18, she's 26 now. \nShe sets the plant down among others. At the very back of the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden. \nDAVID (calling to the Cowboy) Hey! She ever not make you work when you come by? \nOLDER COWBOY (raising his spade in greeting) Mornin', David. \nDAVID (turning to Constance) What's her story? \nCONSTANCE I really want us to get behind this one. She's articul -- \nDAVID Constance, who did she kill? \nConstance looks at him a beat, sighs. \nCONSTANCE A cop. \nDAVID She admit to it? \nContance sheepishly nods. \nDAVID You're a crazy woman. Not your medium grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane. \nCONSTANCE You're mixing metaphors. \nDAVID A real danger to flora and fauna. \nCONSTANCE Are we gonna do this? \nDAVID (the smile) And how. \nHe kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised. \nDAVID You're burning up. \nEXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT \nDavid exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup- container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier. \nIn the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back, waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic DOOR-LOCK BUTTON. \nINT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT \nDavid enters carrying the coffee. The matron sits on a desk licking envelopes. The college guy is on the floor beneath a desk rewiring a computer terminal. \nCOLLEGE GUY (calling from beneath a desk) Howdy, Mr. Gale. \nDAVID Hello, folks. \nDavid goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet & Lows. \nMATRON Hello. My, this is service. Thank you. \nDAVID Gladly. \nHe takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy. \nDAVID Latte on your left, partner. \nDavid makes his way to the back office. The College Guy gives the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased. \nINT. BACK OFFICE - DAY \nConstance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls, though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director -- a social gathering is going on behind him. \nDIRECTOR (V.O.) ...and see what kind of resources the religious groups can deliver. \nDavid comes through the door. She waves him in. \nCONSTANCE I'm sure we can get some pulpit time, maybe cable. \nHe sets her coffee in front of her. Then sits across from her. \nDOCTOR How we doing? \nDAVID Fine. How's Constance? \nDOCTOR Sleeping. \nA beat as he collects himself, sits up. \nDOCTOR Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's condition is highly susceptible to external stress. While we don't want to totally restrict Constance's life -- \nDAVID What? \nDOCTOR Constance's illness requires a degree of regularity. \nDAVID Constance has leukemia? \nDOCTOR Acute. She was diagnosed last fall. \nA beat as the situation clarifies for both of them. David is stunned, the doctor embarrassed. \nDOCTOR Have I created a problem? \nDAVID No, no. \nThey sit in silence. The hospital intercom seems to say: \nGUARD (V.O.) Gale, time's up. \nCLOSEUP - DAVID \nCAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - CLOSEUP - BITSEY - DAY \nCAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. Bitsey stares at David, engrossed. \nDAVID When I asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape. \nHe stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed. \nDAVID Constance left the world better than she found it. (beat) It's a small, difficult thing. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nZack waits in the driver's seat, smoking. He looks nervously through the windshield toward the pens. Bitsey raps on the window, startling him. \nZACK Fuck. \nZack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out. Bitsey opens the door and gets in. \nZACK Hey. \nBITSEY (waving her hand at the smoke) For God's sake, Zack. \nZACK You're not a happy camper. \nBITSEY It's not a happy place. \nHe STARTS the CAR. \nZACK Talked to the Austin prosecutor. Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase, says Gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors. Gale stuck with him, though, all through appeals, despite major pro bono offers. \nBITSEY What else? \nZACK Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money in Houston tonight, overheat light came on twice, and you're about to get a surprise. \nBITSEY I don't want a surprise. \nZACK (pointing ahead) Too late. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY \nThe guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down. Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car. \nAll along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where another Highway patrol car is stationed. \nThe drive's right side is also marked off, though the only vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive. \nThe rental car ENTERS the FRAME. \nINT. RENTAL CAR \nCONSTANCE I'm sorry, David. \nShe reaches over and puts her hand on his arm. \nCONSTANCE I guess I just wish I would have risked more. \nShe has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a swig. \nCONSTANCE (making a face, swallowing hard) Uumm, also not enough sex. Should have had more sex. \nShe puts the bottle down beside her chair. \nDAVID How much... how many lovers have you had? \nCONSTANCE Including college? \nDAVID Including college. \nHer hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers. \nDAVID Well, it's... not every... yeah, you should have had more sex. \nShe laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off into the yard. He takes her hand in his. \nCONSTANCE You work hard not to be seen as a sex object. Before long, you're not seen at all. \nDAVID I see you. \nThey are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs' armrests. \nDAVID Want to make it five? Finish the hand? \nCONSTANCE A pity lay. No thanks. \nA beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one another. \nDAVID It wouldn't be pity. \nThey turn, their eyes meet, hold. \nINT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nConstance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one hand supports her head, the other strokes her face. \nThey tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently. \nDAVID Are you okay? \nCONSTANCE Don't worry. \nHe kisses her neck. \nCONSTANCE It's good. \nMoves up to her ear. \nCONSTANCE Talk to me. Let me hear your voice. \nDAVID (in her ear) I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy. \nHe kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm. \nHer moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless whispers, meld into one another. \nCONSTANCE Hold me tight. \nDAVID I'm here. \nCONSTANCE Tight... I'm scared. \nDAVID It's okay. \nShe's begun to cry. \nDAVID Okay. \nHe stops moving, kisses her tears. \nCONSTANCE Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay in me. \nHe moves again, slowly. \nDAVID Shhh. I'm staying. \nCONSTANCE I need to feel you inside. \nDAVID It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling out. \nCONSTANCE I'm so tired. \nDAVID I know, I know. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - BITSEY AND DAVID - DAY \nROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained. \nBITSEY But there has to be someone. Someone with a motive, who knew you both. Someone who visited that morning. \nDAVID If I could answer... we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's why I need you, why I chose you. You have my story, now... (mimicking her delivery) 'Go.' \nBITSEY There's not enough time. \nThe guard approaches. \nDAVID You'll find time. \nBITSEY You know that's not what I meant. You should have done this earlier. \nDAVID You're not here to save me. You're here to save my son's memory of his father -- that's all I want. \nA beat. \nBITSEY You're going to let them kill you. \nDavid moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed. \nDAVID We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why. (exits the cage) Goodbye, Bitsey. \nThe guard escorts him away. When he's out of earshot: \nBITSEY (softly) Goodbye, David. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY \nA guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door. \nGUARD Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here? \nBitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters flank the drive. \nBITSEY No thanks. \nShe turns and walks toward the highway. \nThe parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers. \nThe drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: \nThey cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs (\"Don't kill with my taxes!\", \"Mark 6:10,\" \"Murder doesn't Stop Murder!\"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey. \nThe right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: \"Rape and Suffocate Him!\", \"Thank Jesus for Justice,\" \"'Let's Do it'.\" A blackboard keeps a countdown: \"13 hours.\" \nAt the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: \"Save David Gale.\" It catches rain; its letters run. \nINT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, \"It's Simple: You Kill, You Get Killed.\" \nIn the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS at a table not far from theirs. \nJOURNALIST #1 I got it. I got it. You could have corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The David Gale Execution, brought to you by...' \nJOURNALIST #2 '...Hefty.' \nThey find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away. \nBITSEY What time is it? \nZACK (checking his watch) Nine hours, 52 minutes. \nA beat. \nEXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nPouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms, they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own. \nBITSEY Belyeu! \nHe turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over her head, Zack slouches. \nBITSEY Did you have Dusty Wright follow us? \nBELYEU I employ Mr. Wright from time to time. \nBITSEY You could have said something. \nBELYEU (opening her umbrella) That would have defeated the purpose. Apologies if I caused you unnecessary anxiety, but I'm paid to be suspicious. (handing it to her) Thought I'd return this. \nZACK What? \nBITSEY We're taking a tour. \nZACK Where? \nShe has the VCR. Grabs her purse on the way to the door. \nBITSEY Austin. Get the T.V. \nShe opens the door, exits. \nINT. HOUSE 3307 ENTRY HALL - NIGHT \nThe DOORBELL RINGS over BAUHAUS MUSIC. The Goth Girl, wearing only the Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, opens the door. \nBitsey barrages past carrying the VCR, Zack follows with the TV. \nBITSEY Wanna make a hundred bucks? \nGOTH GIRL What do I gotta do? \nINT. HOUSE 3307 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBitsey, Zack and the Goth girl enter. \nBITSEY We're going over the crime scene. \nBitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other exhibit pieces haven't changed. \nBITSEY And for the next hour I want you to do exactly what I say when I say to do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, all I want to hear from you is 'May I swallow.' \nGOTH GIRL You want me to suck his dick? \nZACK It's just a patriarchal figure of speech. \nBITSEY Is your boyfriend here? \nGOTH GIRL He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore. \nBITSEY Well is his video camera here? \nGOTH GIRL Yeah. \nBITSEY Get it. \nShe starts to leave, turns back. \nGOTH GIRL I gotta collect first. \nBitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse. \nCLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK \nreads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC DOWN. \nSAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER \nVideo: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or- less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter. \nZACK (O.S.) Move those index cards, too. \nShe picks up the index cards. \nZack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by- side. \nBITSEY Zoom in a hair. \nHe does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance). \nBITSEY Put the gloves on a dish rack. \nGOTH GIRL I don't have one. \nZack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over them. \nBITSEY Turn them inside out. \nHe does so. \nBITSEY Move the tape roll about a foot to the left. And get rid of the handcuffs. \nZack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the handcuffs. \nBITSEY Come check this, Zack. (to the Goth Girl) Could you... what's your name? \nGOTH GIRL Nico's cool. \nBITSEY Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter. \nZack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt. \nZack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag open. She sucks air. \nZACK (ripping at the tape) Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You okay? What if I'd've waited? \nShe tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs. \nZACK No more fucking experiments, all right? Just tell me what's going on. You okay? \nBitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something. \nShe takes his arm, looks at him. \nBITSEY (still breathing heavily) She... she did it herself. \nSAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER \nZack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking. \nNico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline, paces in front of them, thinking out loud. \nBITSEY She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. A murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel. \nZACK Maybe, all right, maybe. (indicating the cuffs) But why wear these? \nBITSEY They threw me. I forgot you have to have the key to put them on. But she needed them. She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in. \nNICO Fuckin' A, like when people hang themselves. At the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit. The police find their own skin beneath their nails. \nBITSEY And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. She made sure there was no way out. \nZACK Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang yourself, or take pills. Why take your fucking clothes off? Why make it look like a murder? \nA beat. Bitsey contemplates. \nBITSEY It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. The gloves. The damn tripod. \nZACK Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder? \nBITSEY I don't know. \nZACK Motive's like a major issue here. \nBITSEY Thanks, Zack. \nZACK It doesn't make sense. The woman's a bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why frame an innocent man? Why send Gale to the chair for what looks -- \nBITSEY What'd you say? \nZACK She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall. \nBITSEY Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's why! To prove it happens. To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents. \nZACK Get the fuck out of here. \nBITSEY No, that's how she thought. She lived for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, why not die for it? That's why the tripod was here. To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. That's why we got an out-take. \nZACK A dead woman put the tape in your room? \nBITSEY Of course not. She needed help, someone to keep it, release it. Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause... \nThey stare at each other a beat. The same thought: \nZACK (mimicking Belyeu) Thick as thieves. \nINT. DUSTY WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT \nDusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23. He sits fully dressed in his living room, listening to an OPERA. He closes his eyes. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK OUT of his window and into: \nEXT. WOODS BESIDE WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT \nBehind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and Zack hide watching him. \nZACK Hairy. \nBITSEY Come on. \nShe turns back into the woods. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nBitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car. \nThey walk and speak quickly in the light rain. \nBITSEY ...Because of the Berlin thing, Constance knew the police would go straight to Gale. In a way, he's perfect. A high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway. But... \nZACK She was in love with him. \nBITSEY I don't know. Something. They were close. She wouldn't want him dead. \nEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nZack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth, drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong to a car. He quickly hangs up. \nINT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT \nBitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson interview with Pavarotti. \nBITSEY Shit! \nShe reaches for another. \nEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nZack hugs himself in the waning drizzle. \nZACK Come on. Fucking come on. \nINT. WRIGHT CABIN \nBitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up on the screen. She hits eject. \nShe gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something. \nShe goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it. \nAfter the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer. \nIt's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to \"Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New York 10036.\" A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: \"Constance.\" The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring again. A beat of absolute silence. \nBitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water. \nON VIDEO \nConstance turns from the sink: \nCONSTANCE (V.O.) (her voice weak) Ready? \nThe response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She puts the glass in the sink. \nShe takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another small section, drops the roll on the floor. \nShe tapes the small section over her mouth. \nShe then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. She seals the bag around her neck. \nShe smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. \nShe feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them. \nShe sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her side, perfectly still, waiting. \nON BITSEY \nEngrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat. \nVIDEO \nA man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty. \nON BITSEY \nThis is what she's needed. \nVIDEO \nDusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands. \nHe picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat. We see only Constance's dead body -- then black. \nON BITSEY \nA hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around. \nIt's Zack, breathing hard. \nZACK He didn't show! Fuckin' move! \nBitsey hits the eject button. \nEXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT \nBitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods. \nThe pickup is nowhere to be seen. \nAs they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching. \nEXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE \nThe car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle has stopped. \n", "test1_input": "BITSEY Look. \nShe holds up the cassette. It has a label typed from an old typewriter: \"For Bitsey Bloom.\" \nEXT. MOTEL SIX RECEPTION - DUSK \nZack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms. \nINT. BITSEY'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK \nBitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in. \nZACK She says no one asked for you. And all the room keys are different. \nHe goes to the TV. \nZACK Just she and her husband have masters. \nBITSEY What did you tell her? \nZACK That you have a jealous boyfriend. \nHe starts to hook up the VCR. \nBITSEY Thanks. How about the V.C.R.? \nZACK She didn't ask. I think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous. I still say we should do this in my room -- this one's a fucking crime scene. \nBITSEY Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints. I have the remote. \nHe turns ON the TV. \nZACK Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try three. \nBITSEY (hitting the remote) They don't look for D.N.A. when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. Here. \nShe hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates, looks back at her. \nZACK You sure you want to see what's on here? \nBITSEY No. Start it. \nHe puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits beside her. They watch the black leader appear. \nBITSEY I hope this isn't what I think it is. \nCLOSEUP - TV \nAn image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera. \nAn opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her. She appears dead. \nBITSEY (O.S.) God, no. \nZACK (O.S.) Fuck. Is it her? \nBITSEY (O.S.) Turn it up. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThey stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail. He turns the sound up. \nINT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV) \nHi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged. \nKitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner of the screen is part of what looks like a towel. \nThe audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER. \nSuddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black. \nEXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK \nBitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon. \nAfter a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her. \nZACK Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow. Also said you were right about not calling the police. \nA beat, she keeps looking straight on. \nZACK Are you gonna be okay? \nBitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes. \nShe shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts his arms around her as she starts to cry. \nINT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nBitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes. The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they wait until she leaves. Hushed tones. \n", "test1_true": "BITSEY No, it's perfect. He knows News Magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it. Probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops. And, most importantly, knows I'll tell Gale tomorrow. \nZACK Why does he give a shit? \nBITSEY Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale. I mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. You kill the one person he has left. Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing. And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch. \nZACK That's a lot of hate. You're talking beyond sadism. \nBitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face. \nZACK Then why release it? \nBITSEY If the mouse dies the game's over. Maybe the cat's enjoying himself. Or... \nZACK Or? \nBITSEY (picks up the tape) Imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists. \nZACK The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath. \nBITSEY Yeah, but smart. \nEXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT \nThe storm batters the motel. We see Bitsey's dark front window. Lightning. A figure stands looking out. More lightning. It's Bitsey, intently watching the night. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: DAY THREE \nOn the back seat is an aluminum suitcase. Zack sits beside it looking out the back window. Bitsey drives. \nIt's still raining, hard. They're on the two-lane highway to Austin. \nZACK Why do they call it check-book journalism if we always pay cash? \nCLOSE ON DASH \nThe over-heat light is on. \nBACK TO SCENE \nZACK Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock! \nBITSEY Is it the truck? \nZACK'S POV \nThe cowboy's truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty yards behind them. \nZACK Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding. \nBitsey watches in the rearview mirror. Zack out the back window. \nZACK He must think we're idiots. You think he's our fucked-up feline? \nBitsey doesn't respond, just watches in the mirror, then: \nBITSEY Is he gaining? \nZACK No. Just sitting back there. \nBITSEY Can you see the license? \nZACK Too much mist. What the fuck does this guy want? \nINT. LAW OFFICE OF BENJAMIN BELYEU - DAY \nThe office has a view of the rain-soaked capital. \nExpensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets -- \nBelyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CLERK sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just outside his door. \nBELYEU (O.S.) Fine. Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's original when that's done. (entering, to Bitsey) Don't blame you for not watching that twice. \nHe goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers. \nBITSEY I couldn't sleep afterwards. \nBELYEU I understand. I generally tell folks I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper than I am of a Presbyterian on Mother's Day. But watching your tape... well. I had to keep tellin' myself 'that's not Constance' just to get through. (a beat) Unfortunately, others may argue the same. \nBITSEY Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her house. \nBELYEU Currently home to Weirdos Incorporated. Arguably, that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance for vulgarity. \nBITSEY But it will at least get us a postponement? \nBELYEU I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly hope so. But you've got to remember that there's a machine a runnin'. And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin' that machine wants to be fed. \n", "test2_input": "The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase. \nCLERK All here, Mr. Belyeu. \nBELYEU (to the Clerk) Thank you, Joshua. (to Bitsey) To add to our troubles, your own credibility may come into question. \nThe Clerk exits. \nBITSEY Why? \nBELYEU You've been fraternizin' with the condemned. In the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape. He's a persuasive man, you're a out-of-state woman -- it don't look good on paper. \nBITSEY But someone put it in my hotel room. \nBELYEU A fact for which we have no evidence. \nA very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey her video. \nBELYEU Thank you, Bobbi. \nBITSEY Thanks. \nBELYEU (standing) Well, let's not start readin' Kafka just yet. Could we find a sympathetic judge. I'll file within the hour. You headin' back over to Ellis? \nBITSEY (standing) Yeah. \nBELYEU Fine. I'll call over at the motel later and give you an update. \nINT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY \nBitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold \"Belyeu and Crane\" sign. She turns a corner. \nAt the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella. \nBITSEY Shit. \nShe heads back toward Belyeu's office. \nAs she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the Belyeu and Crane office. \nEXT. AUSTIN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nBitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental car parked in the loading zone. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nBitsey opens the door. Zack's in the passenger seat. She doesn't bother to sit. \nBITSEY Did you see the cowboy go in? \nZACK He went in Belyeu's building? \nBITSEY Into his office. Just saw him. \nZACK Fuck! \nBITSEY Follow him. Find out who he is, where he lives -- what he -- \nZACK How are you gonna get to Ellis? \nBITSEY A taxi. \nZack makes a face. \nEXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE - DAY \nA taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and press that now gather along the drive. \nINT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY \nBitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David. \nShe's upset. \nDAVID Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to sit. \nOver the loudspeaker: \nGUARD (V.O.) Visitors need to stay seated. \nShe sits. \nDAVID (to the microphone above) Sorry. (to Bitsey) Look at me. He's not your man. His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance. He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs don't mean shit.' They fired him. Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. The man adored her. \nBITSEY Then why was he following us? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane? \nDAVID He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court. Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you. \nBITSEY Why? \nA beat. David looks up at the microphone. \n", "test2_true": "BITSEY He would've said something. \nDAVID He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom. \nBITSEY Maybe Dusty was jealous because you were seeing Constance. \nDAVID I wasn't 'seeing' Constance. \nBITSEY She died... she had your sperm -- \nDAVID It's more complicated than that. \nTWO SHOT \nRotates. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ALLEY - MED. SHOT - DAVID - SUNRISE (ROTATING CAMERA) \nDavid sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in pain. He holds a child's drawing. \nINSERT - DRAWING \nHas Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon (\"Mommy\"), Chase (\"Me\") and a dark-haired man (\"Papa Jorge\"). Jorge is dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown. \nINT. DEATHWATCH AUSTIN OFFICE - SUNRISE (6:09) \nThe atmosphere is tense. Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it. \nThey look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer screen. \nIn the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman, she murmurs quiet affirmations. \nFinally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's occupants all exchange glances. \nDusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office. \nINT. BACK OFFICE - SUNRISE \nConstance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's shockingly anemic. \nDusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat, she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the marker in his hand. She looks away. \nCONSTANCE All I can feel is envy. \nDusty stands, goes to the alley window. \nDUSTY'S POV \nDavid's Volvo is parked just outside the window. David sits in a lawn chair behind it. David looks awful. \nEXT. ALLEY - SUNRISE \nIn the window, Dusty holds up the marker. David nods. \nEXT. HOUSE 3307 - CONSTANCE'S BACK YARD - DUSK \nDavid sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing. \nConstance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle, he sips his drink. \nCONSTANCE Remember those Kubler-Ross stages, the ones the dying go through? \nDAVID Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Where are you? \nCONSTANCE Denial. \nDAVID Denial's my personal favorite. \nCONSTANCE The whole idea of there being a process makes me tired. I'm not up to the job of Dying Person. Marveling at blades of grass. Lecturing strangers to relish every moment. \nDAVID Mending bridges. \nCONSTANCE Mending bridges. Confessing regrets. Uuuggh. \nDAVID No regrets? \nCONSTANCE Nope. \nA beat. \nCONSTANCE Take that back. I wish I had a child. \nDAVID Me, too. \n", "test3_input": "Kruger stands beside her. A few people congratulate her. \nShe attempts a smile and nods, though she doesn't look away from the TV. Kruger shushes the others to hear the story. \nROBERTS (V.O.) The footage appears to show Constance Harraway commit suicide. \nON TV \nROBERTS (V.O.) Bloom reports she received the tape Friday morning at a motel in Huntsville, where she was staying while conducting Gale's last interview. \nON FLOOR \nZack watches Bitsey from the other side of the room. She looks over at him, then quickly looks back at the TV. \nROBERTS (V.O.) The tape apparently had been in the possession of a former DeathWatch Director... \nON TV \nCamera pulls back to reveal that Roberts is standing in front of Wright's cabin. Other journalists and gawkers can be seen out front. Police vehicles are also visible. \nSuits and officers move in and out of the cabin. \nROBERTS (V.O.) (reading the name off a card) ...Dustin Emil Wright. As you can see, police and officials from the State Attorney's office have been in and out of his cabin all morning, looking for clues to his whereabouts. \nINT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT - DAY \nBelyeu enters a men's room. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nBelyeu walks to a row of sinks. He sets the case on the floor and starts to wash his hands. A businessman combs his hair to Belyeu's left. Belyeu looks in the mirror and sees Dusty approach from a stall. \nINT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - DAY \nThe room watches Roberts. \nROBERTS (V.O.) ...a fanatic in the movement to stop the death penalty. \nON TV \nROBERTS (V.O.) It appears Wright withheld the tape to make an obscure political point about the potential for error in capital cases. \nON BITSEY \nShe watches, trying to contain her emotions. \nZack watches her. She looks his direction. He smiles sadly, looks away. \nINT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT - MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nDusty washes his hands, looks down at the case. The businessman leaves. \nDUSTY All there? \nBELYEU Passport and ticket as well. \nINT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - ON TV - DAY \nGovernor Hardin is on the steps of the capital, journalists around her. \nGOVERNOR HARDIN (V.O.) Well, it's a tragedy for all of us. As to whether this will change policy, the people of Texas will have to decide. Right now, the prudent course is to put things on hold pendin' a procedural review, allow ourselves time to mourn. \nKruger leans toward Bitsey. \nKRUGER You bet she'll review. Capital punishment approval rates dropped 17 points. \nBitsey just looks at the TV, trying to make it through. \nINT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nDusty picks up the case. Belyeu straightens his tie. \nBELYEU What are you going to do? \nDUSTY (walking past him) Go to the opera. \nINT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - ON TV - DAY \nOld footage of David being led in chains from an Austin jailhouse to a waiting van. He wears the clothes he was wearing the day Constance died. \nROBERTS (V.O.) Of course, the ultimate irony is that David Gale, a man who became an unwitting martyr, may achieve in death what he worked for in life. \nON BITSEY \nShe bites her lower lip in a manner reminiscent of Constance. \nFADE TO: \nBLACK. \nFADE IN: \n", "test3_true": "Dusty walks along the Ramblan. He carries a duty-free bag and the aluminum suitcase. He comes to a building, checks its number against a piece of paper, enters. \nINT. BARCELONA APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY \nDusty ascends a staircase onto hallway. He walks a few steps to door number six. An OLD SPANISH WOMAN passes him. \nDUSTY Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui? \nOLD WOMAN Si. Si. \nDUSTY Gracias. \nThe old woman moves down the stairs. Dusty puts the aluminum suitcase on the doormat. From the duty-free bag he takes out David's Yale sweatshirt, lays it over the case. He RINGS the DOORBELL, turns and walks back down the hall. \nHe stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to answer before descending. Sharon (older than we've seen her) opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt. She looks around, but Dusty is gone. She picks them up. \nINT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - DAY \nBitsey sits at her neurotically neat desk, looking out the window. It's a sunny day in New York. For the first time, we see her wearing something besides a business suit. Framed on her cubicle wall is the latest News cover page: a picture of David with the headline \"The Executed Innocent.\" \nA MAIL GUY drops a Fed Ex package on her desk. \nMAIL GUY This just came. \nIt's from \"Belyeu & Crane/420 Congress Ave./Austin, Texas, 78710.\" She opens it, pulls out Cloud Dog and a handwritten note on Belyeu & Crane stationery. \nINSERT - NOTE \nreads: \"David wanted you to have this. He said it would be the key to your freedom. Regards, Benjamin Belyeu.\" \nINT. SHARON'S BARCELONA APARTMENT - DAY \nAt the breakfast table, a Spanish yuppie male sits with a newspaper in front of him. He watches Sharon open the case. Inside: money, stacks and stacks of money.

Want me to turn this off? \nVOICE (V.O.) No. \nDavid walks into frame. He goes a couple of steps toward Constance's body and stops, facing her. We see him only from behind.

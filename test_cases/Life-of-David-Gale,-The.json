OFFICE - DAY \nDavid sits in front of his computer, staring into space. \nThe office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls, fill the desk. \nThere's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass. There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters. \nCONSTANCE You could at least hide the bottle. \nDavid closes the e-mail. She collapses in the chair opposite his desk, exhausted. \nDAVID Well? \nCONSTANCE Officially, you're on sabbatical. Unofficially, they want you to look for another position. It was four to two. \nA beat as he absorbs the information. \nDAVID How did Ross vote? \nCONSTANCE You're not supp...

GALE HOUSE - DAY \nA Century 21 real estate agent is putting a \"For Sale\" sign in the front yard. \nINT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY \nDavid is having lunch with an IVY LEAGUE-LOOKING MALE in his fifties. Only water and bread are on the table. \nDAVID So, I wanted to get your feedback on the idea. \nThe Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread. \nIVY LEAGUER Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here, as I'm sure others have, and plead departmental cutbacks. Claim you need more publications, or I need a minority, whatever. All bull- geschichte. Your record's brilliant. You're an original voice worth -- in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil -- your weight in gold. Hell, it's not even the alcohol. It'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac. But, to speak plainly, if I hire you, in the eyes of the regents, alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a rapist. \nHe takes a bite of bread. \nIVY LEAGUER You're not politically correct, Dr. Gale. Welcome to the club. \nEXT./INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY \nDavid stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a- month apartment. Books are stacked everywhere. An Interstate runs nearby. He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area. \nDAVID'S POV \nA horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo) attempts to do Tai Chi. \nCHASE (V.O.) (on his mom's answering machine) We aren't home. Please, tell us a message. \nSHARON (V.O.) (cueing him in the b.g.) At the beep. \nCHASE (V.O.)

The phone's beside his ear and Chase's MESSAGE on his wife's MACHINE TWEAKS out of the receiver speaker. After the BEEP, David hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re- dial. The MESSAGE STARTS again. \nAfter the BEEP, he hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re-dial. \nINT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY \nDavid is in the office of an overdressed YUPPIE BLACK MAN (early 20s). David is doing his active listening thing. \nYUPPIE MAN (over-articulating) Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me three personal qualities you have that would make you a successful Radio Shack manager. \nEXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY \nDavid and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green. \nBELYEU Because divorce proceedings do not require her presence in the country. For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll have to return. \nDavid chooses a club. \nBELYEU But without successful completion of an alcohol treatment program, you'll be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'. \nDavid walks to the ball. \nDAVID So my chances of getting partial custody aren't good? \nBELYEU Roughly the same as you sinkin' that from here. \nDavid looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap. \nINT. PICTURESQUE MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nDavid's Volvo winds up the road, enters through a gate. A sign beside the gate: \"The Go lightly: A Recovery Clinic.\" \nFADE TO: \nBLACK. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - DAY \nIt's a beautiful day.

CONSTANCE'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY \nConstance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback. \nLooks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh. \nCONSTANCE I'm sorry. \nHe plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing. \nLONG SHOT - CONSTANCE AND DAVID \nShe hugs him as they laugh on the porch. \nINT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her hair is different. \nCONSTANCE You look good. \nDAVID I feel... washed. \nShe smiles at him maternally, touches his face. They hug again. \nCONSTANCE (lightly, in his arms) I need you. DeathWatch needs you, now more than ever. \nDAVID Nothing like I need you, both. You're all I have. \nCONSTANCE Look. \nShe moves from him, takes a photo from a case file on her kitchen table. \nCONSTANCE Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled. \nINSERT - PHOTO \nof a young black women -- pleasant, timid. \n", "test1_id": 3030, "test2_input": "BACK ON SCENE \nCONSTANCE I've got a call with Hawkins tonight, and if national will commit emergency funds... \nShe lifts a small plant, moves to the porch. \nDAVID Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll only prove the system works. \nHe notices she has bruises on her arms. \nCONSTANCE But I'll save a life. \nDAVID (referring to the bruises) Where'd you get those? \nCONSTANCE Spring cleaning. \nEXT. CONSTANCE'S PORCH \nCONSTANCE She went up at 18, she's 26 now. \nShe sets the plant down among others. At the very back of the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden. \nDAVID (calling to the Cowboy) Hey! She ever not make you work when you come by? \nOLDER COWBOY (raising his spade in greeting) Mornin', David. \nDAVID (turning to Constance) What's her story? \nCONSTANCE I really want us to get behind this one. She's articul -- \nDAVID Constance, who did she kill? \nConstance looks at him a beat, sighs. \nCONSTANCE A cop. \nDAVID She admit to it? \nContance sheepishly nods. \nDAVID You're a crazy woman. Not your medium grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane. \nCONSTANCE You're mixing metaphors. \nDAVID A real danger to flora and fauna. \nCONSTANCE Are we gonna do this? \nDAVID (the smile) And how. \nHe kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised. \nDAVID You're burning up. \nEXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT \nDavid exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup- container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier. \nIn the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back, waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic DOOR-LOCK BUTTON. \nINT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT \nDavid enters carrying the coffee. The matron sits on a desk licking envelopes. The college guy is on the floor beneath a desk rewiring a computer terminal. \nCOLLEGE GUY (calling from beneath a desk) Howdy, Mr. Gale. \nDAVID Hello, folks. \nDavid goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet & Lows. \nMATRON Hello. My, this is service. Thank you. \nDAVID Gladly. \nHe takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy. \nDAVID Latte on your left, partner. \nDavid makes his way to the back office. The College Guy gives the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased. \nINT. BACK OFFICE - DAY \nConstance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls, though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director -- a social gathering is going on behind him. \nDIRECTOR (V.O.) ...and see what kind of resources the religious groups can deliver. \nDavid comes through the door. She waves him in. \nCONSTANCE I'm sure we can get some pulpit time, maybe cable. \nHe sets her coffee in front of her. Then sits across from her. \n", "test2_true": "David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then animatedly licks and seals it. He then, literally, pats himself on the back. \nDIRECTOR (V.O.)

Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around, is he? \nConstance hesitates, looks at David. He shakes his head no. \nCONSTANCE No. \nDIRECTOR (V.O.) Good, keep it that way. His relationship to DeathWatch is over, terminated. Last thing we need is this rape thing coming back to bite our butts. \nConstance is not sure how to react. David just stares at her. \nDIRECTOR (V.O.) These guys don't stay on the wagon for very long. \nDavid stands up and leaves the room, quickly. His coffee spills. Constance can only watch. \nDIRECTOR (V.O.) I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from the premises. I realize you two... \nEXT. DEATHWATCH OFFICE (AUSTIN) - NIGHT \nConstance comes anxiously out the front door. \nCONSTANCE'S POV \nDavid's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot. \nBACK TO SCENE \nShe stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily. She winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk. \nEXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT \nThe Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street: There's a liquor store. \nCLOSEUP - RECEIVER \nat his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS. \nBACK ON DAVID \nHe speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP. \nDAVID Sharon, pick up. For once just pick up the goddamn phone! If you keep him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging you. He's my son! Please! Please.... Please. \nDavid starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand bleeds. \nEXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY \nConstance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks. David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy drunk. \nDAVID We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge. \nCONSTANCE Come on, come inside. \nShe opens the door as he stands. \nDAVID We fell off our wagon. \nINT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nDavid enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of the couch, holding the sheep. \nDAVID Know why Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes? 'Cause his real name was Judas. There were two Judases, Judai, the saint guy and the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, and tried to kiss him. Medievalers wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear of getting bad Judas on the line by mistake. Ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate. That's why. Then they changed his name. \nShe's not in the room. \nDAVID Constance? \nHe looks back toward the entry hall. A small flyer lightly blows along the floor into the living room. \nDAVID Your mail's blowing. \nHe looks in the entry hall. \nENTRY HALL \nConstance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door. The mail is scattered about her. \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY \nDavid sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM can be heard throughout the scene. \nA female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes his shoulder. He wakes, groggy. \n", "test2_id": 3031, "test3_input": "EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nZack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth, drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong to a car. He quickly hangs up. \nINT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT \nBitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson interview with Pavarotti. \nBITSEY Shit! \nShe reaches for another. \nEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nZack hugs himself in the waning drizzle. \nZACK Come on. Fucking come on. \nINT. WRIGHT CABIN \nBitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up on the screen. She hits eject. \nShe gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something. \nShe goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it. \nAfter the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer. \nIt's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to \"Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New York 10036.\" A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: \"Constance.\" The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring again. A beat of absolute silence. \nBitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water. \nON VIDEO \nConstance turns from the sink: \nCONSTANCE (V.O.) (her voice weak) Ready? \nThe response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She puts the glass in the sink. \nShe takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another small section, drops the roll on the floor. \nShe tapes the small section over her mouth. \nShe then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. She seals the bag around her neck. \nShe smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. \nShe feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them. \nShe sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her side, perfectly still, waiting. \nON BITSEY \nEngrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat. \nVIDEO \nA man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty. \nON BITSEY \nThis is what she's needed. \nVIDEO \nDusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands. \nHe picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat. We see only Constance's dead body -- then black. \nON BITSEY \nA hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around. \nIt's Zack, breathing hard. \nZACK He didn't show! Fuckin' move! \nBitsey hits the eject button. \nEXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT \nBitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods. \nThe pickup is nowhere to be seen. \nAs they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching. \nEXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE \nThe car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle has stopped. \n", "test3_true": "Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book. \nShe's almost in tears, yelling. \nBITSEY Everyone! Wake up New York, the warden, the Governor, the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk! How far is it? \nZACK Took me 30 this afternoon. You've got 26, maybe more. \nBITSEY I'll make it. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE \nThe rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist. \nEXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE \nThe rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring stop signs. \nEXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE \nThe rental car flies past a \"Huntsville City Limit\" sign and disappears into the fog. \nINT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE \nThe overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on. \nShe punches scan. \nBITSEY (to the radio) Give me the time. Give me the goddamn time. \nEXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE \nThe highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork reads: \"TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles.\" \nINT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE \nBitsey smells something. \nEXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE \nThe rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand. \nShe doesn't close the door. Starts running. \nBitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. \nShe runs, and runs. \nA car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on. \nShe runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past a sleepy farmhouse. \nShe runs, and runs. \nShe slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway. \nBoth in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. \nShe runs. Sees something. Stops cold. \nComing toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. They rise on hill and then fall behind another. \nThey appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked \"Texas Department of Corrections\" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot hear her. We HEAR NOTHING. \nINT.

{"test1_input": "Rebel Without A Cause \nREBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE \nby \nStewart Stern \nCAST OF CHARACTERS \nJIM'S FAMILY \nJIM'S GRANDMA: A chic, domineering woman in her sixties who has made her son Frank dependent upon her for every breath he takes.  She is the irritant in the household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of Frank's marriage. \nJIM'S FATHER: Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been able to have fun.  He is anxious to be a real father to Jim, but has never learned how. \nJIM'S MOTHER: Tense and immature, she has never found the husband she married.  Upset by the presence of her mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on her son. \nJIM: The angry victim and the result.  At seventeen he is filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because of his \"nowhere\" father, he does not know how to be a man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness. \nJUDY'S FAMILY \nJUDY'S FATHER: a junior partner in a law firm.  Boyish, attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only recourse is to criticize her. \nJUDY'S MOTHER: Self-centered and frightened by the coming of middle-age.  She feels that Judy's blossoming youth is threatening her wifely position as the desirable object of the husband's attentions. \nJUDY: The victim and the result.  At sixteen, she is in a panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her to invite the attention of other men in order to punish him. \nBEAU: Judy's brother.  Because he is very young he is a danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily-- certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable in giving it. \nPLATO: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a traveling mother--he feels himself the target of desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute family for himself so that he need no longer feel cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly protection and warmth he needs and cannot find. \nBUZZ: A sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was probably rejected by both parents and must constantly court danger and must constantly court danger in order to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth. \nTHE KIDS \nHELEN, CRUNCH, MOOSE, GOON, CHICK, COOKIE, MIL: All searching for recognition in the only way available to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order to bear the chaos they feel inside.  They are soldiers in search of an enemy. \nFADE IN. \nA deep night sky.  Matte shot.  Camera searches slowly upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is heard sounding the strokes of midnight. \nOn the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky Way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of Easter singing to arise.  The hymn is sung by the crude, unmatched voices of children.  Camera pans down to include: \nSpire of a church.  Camera continues its downward pan as the singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the source of the singing.  Camera pans off window to show-- \nLong shot.  City.  Night.  Suddenly revealed--crisp and sparkling with lights.  Camera pans down and over: \nA lonely street full of parked cars.  The singing diminishes but a thread of it remains.  A car has just parked.  The headlights snap off.  A MAN emerges whistling the same melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat.  He slams the door and starts down the street in the direction of a house with bright windows.  He must pass an empty lot full of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two street lights. \nAs the MAN walks by the lot, still whistling, a GROUP OF FIGURES rises silently from the grass, figures who have been lying in concealment until now.  They step noiselessly onto the pavement and follow the MAN.  At the sound of their boots the whistling stops. \nThe MAN glances behind him and sees the figures walking after him, filling the pavement.  A street light shows them to be boys and girls and all quite young.  The MAN moves on more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases.  He begins to run toward the lighted house and the following steps run too.  Suddenly he stops under the next street light and turns to face the figures.  They are upon him and around him quickly.  Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of the boys grins.  His name is BUZZ.  He is big and filled with an awareness of his own masculinity. \nBUZZ (friendly, cool) That was pretty what you were whistling.  Whistle some more. \nThe MAN whistles a nervous phrase, trying to make a joke of the situation which he doesn't understand. \nBUZZ (continuing; suddenly) You got a cigarette? \nMAN Oh, I think so-- \nThe MAN fumbles in his pocket, finds a pack and drops it in his nervousness.  The FIGURES wait until he picks it up.  He offers one to BUZZ. \nMAN (continuing) Filter tips. \nBUZZ (smiling, encouraging) You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad. \nSmiling uncertainly, the MAN puts the cigarette in his mouth. BUZZ, still smiling, takes out a packet of wooden matches. \nBUZZ (continuing) I'll light it for you, Dad. \nBUZZ ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a second, searching it.  Then he ignites the whole box under his nose.  The MAN shrieks, and his packages fall.  BUZZ slaps him sharply, his smile gone. \nThe camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its wrappings.  It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then runs down. \n", "test1_true": "SUPERIMPOSE TITLE: \"REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE\" STARRING ____ as siren rises piercingly close, and JIM looks up, we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nClose shot.  Throbbing light of police car.  Night.  The siren screaming wildly, then dying.  The sound of brakes. Camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the entrance of a Precinct Station.  Two officers dismount, bearing between them the struggling JIM.  They bear him up the steps and in through the double doors. \nInside precinct station. Reception area.  A large open space onto which several corridors converge.  In the middle is a Sergeant's desk, really a quadrangular counter in the center of which the SERGEANT stands.  There are a few glass-walked interviewing rooms which open off the area, and several benches lining the walls.  The scene is one of confusion, activity and waiting.  Phones ring.  The arrested pass in custody of officers.  Present among others at JIM's entrance are: JUDY, who is blonde and sixteen.  She sits on a crowded bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness.  On a bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty little Mexican children without shoes or socks.  The oldest is a BOY of four who is protecting his little SISTER who in turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her. Standing at a corner of the desk is a docile, undersized boy of fifteen named JOHN \"PLATO\" CRAWFORD.  He is shivering. With him is a large NEGRO WOMAN, his maid.  JIM comes through the doors and is led to the desk.  One of the officers presents a brief report to the SERGEANT, who examines it. \nSERGEANT Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth Street? \nOFFICER No.  Plain drunkenness. \nSERGEANT This says he was picked up there. \nOFFICER They had him on the carpet for an hour at Headquarters.  He's clear. Plain drunkenness. \nSERGEANT Young squirt.  All right--You want to lean him against something? Stand him over there. \nThe officer leads JIM to JUDY's bench and stands him against the wall beside it. \nJIM is frisked, a look of prayer on his upturned face.  The OFFICER finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take it, but when JIM asks to keep it, the OFFICER hands it back and moves away.  Another officer enters and leads the prisoner who is sitting next to JUDY into another room.  JIM sits beside her.  He smiles at her but receives only a chilling look.  He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing on the floor, but she is not amused.  Camera pans to show others reacting to the monkey with pleasure.  We see PLATO look up and smile a little.  Camera stops on the MEXICAN CHILDREN who are smiling too.  A bald JUVENILE OFFICER named GENE, squats before them, smiling. \nGENE You going to tell me your name now? \nThe little boy shakes his head. \nLITTLE BOY (touching GENE's bald pate) Where's your hair? \nGENE It's all gone. \nLITTLE BOY Did you get a haircut? \nGENE No--it just fell out! \nLITTLE BOY (sympathetically) Aw-- \nGENE laughs as another Juvenile Officer enters and pauses to look at the children.  His name is RAY. \nRAY What gang does he belong to? \nGENE Give him a couple of years. \nRAY Where's your mamma, honey? \nLITTLE BOY I don't know. \nRAY and GENE exchange looks, then RAY moves across to JUDY-- camera following.  He looks down at her, consults the file in his hand. \nRAY Judy--we're ready for you now. \nJUDY (a mumble) He hates me. \nRAY What? \nJUDY He hates me. \nShe rises.  RAY leads her to one of the glass-walled offices. Camera moves with them.  JIM watches them go. \nRAY What makes you think he hates you, Judy? \nJUDY I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he-- \nRAY leads her into the office. \nInside small office as JUDY comes in, RAY following.  He indicates a chair for her while he sits down behind a desk. \nJUDY (continuing) He doesn't like anything about me-- he calls me--he calls me-- \nShe starts to cry.  She doesn't hide it, but keeps wiping the tears with the palms of her hands. RAY He makes you feel pretty unhappy? \nJUDY (crying) He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father! \nRAY Do you think your father means that? \nJUDY Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he-- \n", "test1_id": 1191, "test2_input": "SERGEANT What's the charge? \nOFFICER Assault with a deadly weapon. \nJIM Listen-- \nSERGEANT (annoyed) He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you? \nJIM My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here. \nSERGEANT Come back tomorrow. \nJIM I'll wait for him. \nSERGEANT Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? (to hoodlum) Ever been booked before? \nJIM turns away, notices a phone on the wall--puts in a coin, asks for a number. \nBedroom of JUDY's parents.  Through an open door we hear a radio playing-- a late disc-jockey show for teenagers in which numbers are dedicated by request.  JUDY'S MOTHER and FATHER are in bed, FATHER has phone in his hand. \nJUDY'S FATHER Who wants her?  Who?  Jim who? Never heard of you. \nHe hangs up phone, looks at his wife.  She rolls over in bed. The FATHER turns off the bed lamp, then sits up, worried in the dark. \nJUDY's bedroom.  It is her radio we have heard.  She turns off light, opens the door a crack, and looks out toward her parent's room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTraveling shot.  PLATO.  He is coming up the walk to his house.  When PLATO has come a few feet, somebody whistles. PLATO and camera stop.  Short, quiet whistles come from the boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk.  PLATO turns and starts to run, camera following.  He gets to his door, tries the key, but in his panic it will not go into the lock.  Suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around. CRUNCH stands above him.  GOON closes in from the other side. All very tense and hotted up! \nPLATO What do you want! \nCRUNCH You know what we want.  We want your friend. \nGOON We got eyes for him. \nPLATO Listen, you guys ought to go home. The cops are cruising every-- \nGOON Where does he live? \nPLATO reaches up swiftly and rings the bell.  GOON grabs him. CRUNCH cracks him. \nCRUNCH You better tell us and I'm not kidding. \nPLATO My old man's got a gun. \nGOON His old man's got a gun.  What do you think of that! (drives a hard blow at PLATO's belly) Your friend talked-- (belts him again) Now you talk!  Talk! \nThe door opens and the NEGRO WOMAN is there.  CRUNCH sends PLATO spinning into the house past her.  He falls. \nNEGRO WOMAN (yelling) What you doing!  What you doing to him!  You clear out of here 'fore I call the police! \nShe swings at CRUNCH who faces her, challenging. \nNEGRO WOMAN Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now! \nMOOSE Let's go, Crunch. \nThey turn and move past camera.  PLATO gets up off the floor. We hear the sound of a heap starting.  The NEGRO WOMAN closes the door. \nInside PLATO's foyer as NEGRO WOMAN bolts the door. \nNEGRO WOMAN Why you like to mix with bad boys like that?  Why you get in trouble all the-- \nPLATO I have to go out.  I have to warn him. \nHe starts up the stairs.  She follows him heavily. \nNEGRO WOMAN You not going anywhere!  You staying home while your mama's away. \nBedroom of PLATO's mother, a lacy affair with imported dolls on the pillows.  PLATO rushes in, opens the drawer of the night-table and pulls out a gun.  He checks to see that it is loaded.  The NEGRO WOMAN appears in the door and stares at him, turns on the light which illuminates the bed-lamp. \nNEGRO WOMAN John!  What you doing with that! You leave that be!  Put it down before you hurt yourself.  Hear me? \nBut PLATO moves past her and out of the room.  She turns after him. \n", "test2_true": "The slam of a door is heard below. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJIM's garage.  Night.  JUDY waiting inside.  JIM's car pulls in, a radio going softly.  He turns the motor off and is about to turn off the radio when we hear the announcer: \nANNOUNCER Coming up now another request--this time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to you--from Buzz. \nJIM stares at the radio, then turns it off. \nAnother angle. \nJUDY They'll be looking for you. \nJIM They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself? \nJUDY It doesn't matter to them. \nJIM You were looking for me, weren't you? \nJUDY (a small voice) No--I was just--maybe-- \nJIM I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so. \nJIM Want some milk? \nJUDY comes forward. \nJIM That's all I can do when I'm nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a slug. \nShe shakes her head.  He takes a sip. \nJIM You still pretty upset? \nJUDY I'm numb. \nShe is shuddering a little. \nJIM You cold? \nJUDY Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold. \nJIM I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again. \nJUDY Neither can I. \nJIM No?  Why not? (no answer) You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb? \nJUDY No. \nJIM Every day I look in the mirror and say, \"What?  You still here?\" Man! \nThey laugh a little. \nJIM Hey!  You smiled! \nJUDY shakes her head--beginning to warm to him. \nJIM Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing. \nJUDY I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere. \nJIM Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything. \nJUDY If you knew me you wouldn't say that. \nJIM I don't think you trust anybody, do you? \nJUDY Why? \nJIM I'm getting that way, too. \nJUDY (looks at him) Have you ever gone with anyone who-- \nJIM Sure.  Lots of times. \n", "test2_id": 1192, "test3_input": "JUDY So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful? \nJIM (smiling) Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time. \nShe looks up.  He kisses her forehead. \nJUDY Why did you do that? \nJIM I felt like it. \nJUDY Your lips are soft when you kiss. \nJUDY rises. \nJIM Where you going? \nJUDY I don't know, but we can't stay here. \nJIM Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo. \nJUDY I'm never going back. \nJIM Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium (rises) Would you go with me? \nJUDY hesitates. \nJIM You can trust me, Judy. \nJUDY I feel as if I'm walking under water. \nThey start out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInside bathroom.  JIM's house.  The water is running in the sink and JIM's father is fixing a stomach settler.  Gradually he grows aware of a heavy pounding which insinuates itself above the splash of water.  The FATHER pauses, then turns off the tap.  The pounding continues.  JIM'S MOTHER appears at the bathroom door.  She is seen in the mirror tying her robe. \nMOTHER Frank?  I'm frightened. \nFATHER What's that pounding? \nMOTHER I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but-- \nFATHER He's home.  I heard the car. \nMOTHER Are you going down there? \nFATHER Look--just relax, will you? \nThe pounding ceases. \nFATHER See?  It stopped. \nMOTHER I still think you should go down. \nHe goes out of the bathroom, into the hall. \nFoyer.  JIM's house as the FATHER comes down the stairs, turning on the light as he comes.  He reaches the door and pauses.  The MOTHER stops midway down the stairs. \nFATHER (through the door) Who's there? (silence) Anyone there? \nMOTHER (low; at balustrade) Open it. \nThe FATHER opens the door and looks up sharply. \nClose shot.  Door.  FATHER's head in f.g. as he stares at it. Nailed to the door by its outstretched wings, its head hanging in an attitude of crucifixion, is the freshly killed carcass of a chicken.  Low whistles are heard from outside. The FATHER, frightened, looks out into the night. \nFull shot.  Front lawn and street.  Shooting over the FATHER's head.  The whistling continues. FATHER (hoarsely) Who's out there? \nVOICE Where's your son? \nFATHER What? \nANOTHER VOICE Where's your baby boy gone to, Daddy?  We want him. \nSuddenly the FATHER slams the door and rushes past us into the house. \n", "test3_true": "FATHER Look in his room! \nThe MOTHER disappears. \nFATHER Jim!  Jim! \nThe FATHER dashes into the living room, then into the hall again and down through the kitchen door. \nBack yard as the FATHER comes out.  He closes the door quietly and calls in a low voice: \nFATHER Son? \nHe stares around the yard, then hurries to the garage. JIM's car is missing.  He looks up suddenly. \nReverse shot.  JUDY'S FATHER seen across the alley wall.  He is standing in his own back yard. \nJUDY'S FATHER Is anything wrong?  I'm your neighbor. \nMed. shot.  JIM'S FATHER.  He smiles feebly. \nFATHER Oh, no, thanks.  I just wanted to-- to be sure my garage was closed. \nJIM'S FATHER closes his garage door and walks back toward his house. \nMOTHER (O.S.) Is he there? \nFATHER No, honey.  No, he's not here. \nHe starts for the house again after a quick look in the direction of JUDY'S FATHER. \nFull shot.  JUDY's back yard.  JUDY'S FATHER watches MR. STARK disappear, then... \nJUDY'S FATHER (softly) Judy? \nThe alley by JIM's house.  PLATO drives up on scooter.  He checks the garage, sees JIM's car is gone, is about to take off in confusion, hears door slam in JIM's back yard, shuts off engine, fixes tie, combs hair, goes in the fence gate to JIM's back yard. \nFull shot.  JIM's back yard.  JIM'S FATHER is coming toward him.  JIM'S FATHER and PLATO simultaneously say: \nFATHER What are you doing? \nPLATO Where's Jim? \nFATHER I don't know.  Do you--do you know where he is? \nPLATO No.  No, I don't. \nCloseup.  PLATO remembers about the mansion--then almost to himself: \nPLATO I know where-- \nBack to full shot.  FATHER and PLATO. \nPLATO Hope I didn't bother you.  Goodnight. \nHe runs to scooter. \nFATHER Hey, come back here.  Who are you? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSplit screen montage.  It begins with a telephone ringing alone in the corner of the screen.  As camera moves back we see that the phone is in an office at Juvenile Hall.  RAY is standing by, trying to make sense out of the incoming reports. \nThe other part of the screen lights up and becomes: \nBedroom of PLATO'S MOTHER where the NEGRO WOMAN is speaking hysterically into the phone. \nBedroom of JUDY's parents.  The FATHER is on the phone. BEAU has awakened and is crying.  His MOTHER tries to divert him. \nJIM's bedroom.  JIM'S FATHER sits disconsolately on the bed, the phone in his hand.  He is talking earnestly. \nDuring this the sound of the telephone ringing has increased to become the sound of many and this has been submerged in a deep rising riot of sirens whose wail mounts higher and higher until: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFull shot.  Planetarium.  Moonlight.  A lone siren wails in distance.  Aside from this, all is very still.  Camera pans past the dome and settles on an isolated mansion set high on a hill nearby.  Stone balustrades drop down to sunken gardens where the grass has gone to seed around a waterless fountain. \n", "test3_id": 1193}

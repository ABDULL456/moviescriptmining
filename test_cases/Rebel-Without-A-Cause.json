{"train": "Rebel Without A Cause \nREBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE \nby \nStewart Stern \nCAST OF CHARACTERS \nJIM'S FAMILY \nJIM'S GRANDMA: A chic, domineering woman in her sixties who has made her son Frank dependent upon her for every breath he takes.  She is the irritant in the household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of Frank's marriage. \nJIM'S FATHER: Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been able to have fun.  He is anxious to be a real father to Jim, but has never learned how. \nJIM'S MOTHER: Tense and immature, she has never found the husband she married.  Upset by the presence of her mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on her son. \nJIM: The angry victim and the result.  At seventeen he is filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because of his \"nowhere\" father, he does not know how to be a man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness. \nJUDY'S FAMILY \nJUDY'S FATHER: a junior partner in a law firm.  Boyish, attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only recourse is to criticize her. \nJUDY'S MOTHER: Self-centered and frightened by the coming of middle-age.  She feels that Judy's blossoming youth is threatening her wifely position as the desirable object of the husband's attentions. \nJUDY: The victim and the result.  At sixteen, she is in a panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her to invite the attention of other men in order to punish him. \nBEAU: Judy's brother.  Because he is very young he is a danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily-- certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable in giving it. \nPLATO: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a traveling mother--he feels himself the target of desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute family for himself so that he need no longer feel cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly protection and warmth he needs and cannot find. \nBUZZ: A sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was probably rejected by both parents and must constantly court danger and must constantly court danger in order to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth. \nTHE KIDS \nHELEN, CRUNCH, MOOSE, GOON, CHICK, COOKIE, MIL: All searching for recognition in the only way available to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order to bear the chaos they feel inside.  They are soldiers in search of an enemy. \nFADE IN. \nA deep night sky.  Matte shot.  Camera searches slowly upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is heard sounding the strokes of midnight. \nOn the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky Way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of Easter singing to arise.  The hymn is sung by the crude, unmatched voices of children.  Camera pans down to include: \nSpire of a church.  Camera continues its downward pan as the singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the source of the singing.  Camera pans off window to show-- \nLong shot.  City.  Night.  Suddenly revealed--crisp and sparkling with lights.  Camera pans down and over: \nA lonely street full of parked cars.  The singing diminishes but a thread of it remains.  A car has just parked.  The headlights snap off.  A MAN emerges whistling the same melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat.  He slams the door and starts down the street in the direction of a house with bright windows.  He must pass an empty lot full of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two street lights. \nAs the MAN walks by the lot, still whistling, a GROUP OF FIGURES rises silently from the grass, figures who have been lying in concealment until now.  They step noiselessly onto the pavement and follow the MAN.  At the sound of their boots the whistling stops. \nThe MAN glances behind him and sees the figures walking after him, filling the pavement.  A street light shows them to be boys and girls and all quite young.  The MAN moves on more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases.  He begins to run toward the lighted house and the following steps run too.  Suddenly he stops under the next street light and turns to face the figures.  They are upon him and around him quickly.  Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of the boys grins.  His name is BUZZ.  He is big and filled with an awareness of his own masculinity. \nBUZZ (friendly, cool) That was pretty what you were whistling.  Whistle some more. \nThe MAN whistles a nervous phrase, trying to make a joke of the situation which he doesn't understand. \nBUZZ (continuing; suddenly) You got a cigarette? \nMAN Oh, I think so-- \nThe MAN fumbles in his pocket, finds a pack and drops it in his nervousness.  The FIGURES wait until he picks it up.  He offers one to BUZZ. \nMAN (continuing) Filter tips. \nBUZZ (smiling, encouraging) You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad. \nSmiling uncertainly, the MAN puts the cigarette in his mouth. BUZZ, still smiling, takes out a packet of wooden matches. \nBUZZ (continuing) I'll light it for you, Dad. \nBUZZ ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a second, searching it.  Then he ignites the whole box under his nose.  The MAN shrieks, and his packages fall.  BUZZ slaps him sharply, his smile gone. \nThe camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its wrappings.  It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then runs down. \nRAY That one? \nJUDY Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house. \nRAY Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning? \nJUDY I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it. \nRAY You weren't looking for company, were you? \nJUDY No. \nRAY Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? (she is silent) Do you enjoy that? \nJUDY No.  I don't even know why I do it. \nRAY Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that? \nJUDY I'll never get close to anybody. \nRAY Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy. \nJUDY You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there! \nRAY Would you like to go home if we can arrange it? (no answer; to WOMAN OFFICER) Did you notify the parents? \nWOMAN OFFICER She wouldn't give me their number. \nRAY What's your number, Judy?  We'll see if your Dad will come and get you. \nJUDY looks up hopefully. \nRAY Unless you really don't want to go home. (silence) Would you rather stay here? \nCamera moves close on JUDY.  She looks up and speaks very quietly. \nJUDY Lexington 05549. \nThe wail of a siren is heard.  JUDY looks off through the glass wall toward JIM.  RAY is heard dialing. \nMed. shot.  JIM's bench.  JIM sits with his head back, eyes closed.  As the siren mounts louder, JIM opens his mouth and imitates it--a long, forlorn wail. \nMed. shot, PLATO and NEGRO WOMAN.  PLATO smiles faintly and moves out toward JIM, NEGRO WOMAN following.  Camera pans with them.  PLATO sits by JIM.  She stands over them.  JIM's wailing continues. \nMed. shot.  JIM, PLATO, NEGRO WOMAN.  An OFFICER moves into shot. \nOFFICER Hey! \nJIM continues for a moment. \nOFFICER (continuing) Hey!  That's enough static out of you. \nJIM Want me to imitate a stupid cop? \nOFFICER Cut it out now.  I'm warning you. \nJIM Yes, ma'am. \nThe OFFICER moves out.  The NEGRO WOMAN bends over PLATO who is shivering violently. \nNEGRO WOMAN You shivering, John?  You cold? \nPLATO shakes his head.  JIM notices him. \nJIM Want my jacket? \nPLATO looks up at JIM. \nJIM (continuing) You want my jacket?  It's warm. \nPLATO wants it but shakes his head \"no.\" \nFull shot.  JUDY's office.  RAY and JUDY seated as before. JUDY is still gazing through the glass. \nRAY Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy-- \nNEGRO WOMAN She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house. \nGENE Where's your mother tonight, Plato? \nPLATO She's away. \nNEGRO WOMAN Seems like she's always going somewhere.  She got a sister in Chicago and she go for the holiday. She says her sister is all the family she has. GENE Where's your father? \nPLATO is silent. \nNEGRO WOMAN They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now. \nGENE Do you hear from him, son? \nPLATO looks up as JIM and his family move into the next office.  JIM smiles at PLATO, who returns it feebly, then looks away--embarrassed. \nGENE You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist? \nPLATO (smiling a bit) Head-shrinker? \nNEGRO WOMAN (laughing) Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them! \nGENE Well maybe she better start. \nOther office.  JIM, his parents, GRANDMA and RAY are gathered in the small room.  JIM is humming THE RIDE OF THE VALKRYIES to himself as if he had absolutely no interest in what is happening around him.  RAY suspects this is something more than mere disinterest, so lets the humming go on, in order to discover its real purpose.  GRANDMA watches everything like a tennis match, reacting with soft little sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy.  No one pays any attention to her.  For a moment no one talks.  RAY watches JIM as he hums.  Then the FATHER shakes his head and looks up. \nFATHER I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink. \nRAY You don't? \nFATHER No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa-- \nRAY He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink. \nFATHER (chuckling) Say, listen-- \nMOTHER (to JIM: in intimate, half-humorous disapproval) Jim--don't hum. \nJIM merely rolls his eyes at her, then away--but continues his humming. \nFATHER I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too. \nMOTHER Really, Frank?  When was that? \nFATHER Listen--can't you wait till we get home? \nRAY Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but-- \nFATHER Sorry. \nRAY What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself? \nJIM stops humming and shrugs. \nRAY Not interested, huh? \nJIM shakes his head. \nMOTHER Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow? \nFATHER He's just loaded, honey. \nMOTHER I was talking to Jim. \nFATHER (to RAY) Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and-- \nJIM Tell him why we moved here. \nFATHER Hold it, Jim. \nJIM You can't protect me. \nFATHER (to JIM) You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face? (to RAY) I try to get to him--what happens? (to JIM) Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car-- \nJIM You buy me many things.  Thank you. \nJIM And they think they are protecting my by moving. \nRAY You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it? \nJIM Mess that kid up? \nRAY just nods. \nJIM (continuing) He called me chicken. \nRAY And your folks didn't understand? \nJIM They never do. \nRAY So then you moved? \nJIM They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine. \nRAY But you don't think that's a solution. \nJIM is silent; he picks at his nails. \nRAY (continuing) Things pretty tough for you at home? \nJIM She eats him alive and he takes it. \nJIM stares at his family through hole in door. \nJIM What a zoo! \nRAY What? \nJIM A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die. \nRAY Pretty mixed up? \nJIM If he could-- \nRAY \"If he could\" what?  You mean your father? \nJIM I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him. \nRAY (interrupts) Chicken? \nJIM I bet you see right through me, don't you? \nRAY shrugs. \nJIM How can anyone grow up in this circus? \nRAY You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water? \nJIM (as RAY gets a cup of water from cooler) Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place. \nRAY (giving him water) Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks. \nJIM Okay-- \nRAY Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now? \nJIM (smiling) You serious? \nRAY smiles and opens the door. \nRAY's office as JIM comes towards his MOTHER and forces himself to kiss her. \nJIM I'm sorry. \nMOTHER All right, darling. \nShe rises and takes his arm.  They start out through the door into the hall, followed by GRANDMA and FATHER. \nGRANDMA (to RAY) This was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry-- so we're not going to have any more trouble.  He's always been a lovely boy-- \nJIM Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell another lie you're going to turn to stone. \nFull shot.  JIM's backyard as JIM comes out of the kitchen door into the early sunshine. \nJUDY (O.S.) Come out of the alley, Beau!  This is the last time I'm going to call you. \nJIM blinks, pauses and sees JUDY.  He takes off his tie and puts it in his pocket.  Then he starts across the backyard, camera panning with him to: \nFull shot.  The Alley with JIM coming out his gate, JUDY and BEAU visible beyond.  He stops again. \nJUDY Beau!  All right--go to school alone! \nShe starts down the alley.  BEAU skips after her and starts tightrope-walking the gutter gravel. \nJIM (calling) Hey! \nJUDY glances at him briefly, but continues.  JIM follows a few yards, but on his side of the alley. \nJIM (continuing) Hey, didn't I see you before some place? \nJUDY ignores him, but something self-conscious happens to her walk.  JIM runs across the alley. \nMed. shot.  JUDY stopping as JIM enters.  BEAU tight-rope walking on down the hill. \nJIM Hi.  I saw you before. \nJUDY Bully for you. \nJIM You don't have to be unfriendly. \nJUDY Now that's true! \nJIM (smiling) See? \nJUDY \"Life is crushing in on me.\" \nJIM (smiling) \"Life can be beautiful.\" Hey, I know where it was. \nJUDY Where what was. \nJIM Where I saw you. (no answer) Everything going okay now? (no answer) You live around here? \nJUDY (relieved) Who lives? \nJIM See, I'm new. \nJUDY Won't mother be proud. \nJIM You're really flipped--aren't you. \nJUDY looks up a little surprised. \nJIM (continuing) Where's Dawson High School? \nJUDY You going there? \nJIM Yeah--why-- \nJUDY Dig the square wardrobe! \nJIM (defensively) Yeah.  So where's the high school? \nJUDY (softer) University and 10th--Want to carry my books? \nAn auto horn, stuck, in the distance. \nJIM I was just getting my car.  I could take you. \nThe horn approaches, loud. \nJUDY The kids take me. \nJIM Oh. \nAnother angle.  JIM and JUDY as the car, horn blowing, wheels into view above them and comes careening into the alley.  JUDY sees it and moves a step away from JIM. \nJUDY I'll bet you're a real yo yo. \nThe strident music of the students diminishes.  The ringing of the bell stops.  There remain only JIM's footsteps. \nLong shot.  JIM moving off down the corridor.  PLATO is in f.g. looking after him.  He slams his locker and starts after JIM, moving at the same speed and hovering near the wall.  The footsteps of the two boys echo stonily.  They are alone.  JIM stops at a bulletin board near a bend in the corridor.  PLATO stops too. \nBulletin board.  JIM looking at the notices.  PLATO drifts in several yards away and hangs near the wall watching JIM who doesn't see him.  JIM reads: \nInsert: Bulletin board, \"Attention All Juniors and Seniors\"-- Planetarium field trip--2 pm--Sharp!\" \nAnother angle.  JIM and PLATO as JIM turns from bulletin board and starts away. \nPLATO (clearing his throat) Hi. \nJIM Hi there. \nPLATO You remember me? \nJIM No.  I don't think so-- \nPLATO I'm sorry--I made a mistake. \nJIM starts toward camera as PLATO after another look, turns in the opposite direction and walks away from us, smashing his fist against the wall as he goes.  JIM stops, full in camera.  His face clouds, trying to remember.  He turns full around to look after PLATO, then turns back and continues on his way.  The footsteps fade. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFull shot.  Planetarium seen from the parking lot--a great dome crowns it--the city lies below.  Camera picks up JIM's car maneuvering through the crowded lot.  In b.g. a few other late-comers are dashing up steps to Planetarium.  JIM drives into a small lot behind observator, parks, then runs to observatory entrance. \nFull shot.  Lobby as JIM runs through, opens door of theater and passes inside. \nLong shot.  Sky full of stars seen past JIM's head. Darkness.  This is not our sky.  It is a replica of it projected onto the dome of the Planetarium.  The stars slide their tentative ways in an ever-changing pattern.  One of them is much larger than the rest and increases in size as we watch.  Music of the spheres is heard--a high threatening tremolo. \nLECTURER (O.S.) For many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly bright and increasingly near. \nJIM looks around for a seat and passes down aisle.  Seen beyond him is the projector, moving slowly, its great dumb- bell head sparkling with pin-points of light.  JIM takes a seat in front row.  PLATO, in the row behind him, moves over a seat to be nearer.  They exchange looks. \nFull shot.  Normal students watching intently. \nLECTURER (O.S.) As this star approaches us, the weather will change.  The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer. \nLow angle.  LECTURER.  A dry, elderly man in a stiff white collar.  He is seated at a desk, the light from the reading lamp spilling upward onto his face. \nLECTURER The last of us search the heavens and stand amazed.  For the stars will still be there, moving through their ancient rhythms. \nAngle shot.  Students.  Some watching, some taking notes. An OLD LADY TEACHER in f.g. taps the heads of two kids in the row before her.  They stop their whispering.  She smiles at them. \nLECTURER (O.S.) The familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise. \nMed. shot.  PLATO staring upward. \nLECTURER (O.S.) Orion, the Hunter. \nPLATO looks off. \nMed. shot.  JIM (from PLATO's angle).  JIM is seated in the row ahead of PLATO.  His lips are parted as he looks up. \nJIM Boy! \nPLATO (leaning forward) What? \nJIM (surprised) Once you been up there, you know you been some place! \nLECTURER (O.S.) Gemini, the Twins. \nTwo shot.  JUDY and BUZZ.  BUZZ has his arm around her.  He is nuzzling her ear.  She is blandly watching the dome. \nLECTURER (O.S.) (continuing) Cancer, the Crab. \nBUZZ pokes JUDY who looks at him.  He curves his wrist toward her, opening and closing his first two fingers like the pincers of a crab. \nBUZZ I'm a crab! \nShe laughs.  So do the others. \nMed. shot. JIM (PLATO behind).  Seen from JUDY's angle.  JIM turns at the sound of the laughter, and smiles. \nLECTURER (O.S.) Taurus, the Bull. \nLong shot.  JUDY and group.  Seen from PLATO's angle through windshield.  They are standing idly in a loose line near BUZZ's car.  They are looking back toward Planetarium. \nMed. shot.  Front of bus, seen from within.  PLATO turns suddenly and pushes his way past the kids who are boarding. \nPLATO Excuse me.  Excuse me. \nFull shot.  Parking lot.  Bus in f.g.  Beyond it JUDY and the group are visible.  PLATO squeezes out. \nMALE TEACHER John, where you going? \nPLATO I forgot something.  I'll get a hitch. \nPLATO moves quickly past the teacher who climbs in.  The door slams, the bus moves away.  PLATO stops and looks after it.  The last cars are clearing the lot.  Only JIM's and BUZZ's remain.  PLATO looks at the small, waiting group. \nMed. shot.  The group seen from the rear.  PLATO in the distance facing them. \nBUZZ What you looking at? \nMed. shot.  PLATO wild-eyed with fear. \nPLATO Nothing. \nHe runs off, camera panning with him.  His goal is the Planetarium Entrance, visible beyond.  He races toward it frantically. \nMed. shot.  The group looking off after PLATO.  BUZZ, nearest camera, pulls a switch-knife from his pocket and pops the long blade open.  JUDY stares at it, then looks up at BUZZ apprehensively.  CRUNCH sits down on the bumper and lights a cigarette. \nDisplay lobby.  Planetarium as PLATO rushes in, out of breath, stops and looks around.  In distance he sees JIM leaning over the pendulum pit, smoking quietly.  PLATO doesn't move.  JIM hasn't even looked up. \nPLATO (screaming as if he were yelling \"fire!\") What's your name! \nJIM Jim.  What's yours? \nPLATO (a little quieter) Plato.  It's a nickname. \nJIM nods.  PLATO goes over to him, camera following, until they are close together, both leaning over the rail. \nPLATO Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you. \nJIM I know.  That's why I came back. \nPLATO You scared? \nJIM I just don't want trouble. \nPLATO He has a knife. \nJIM I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops? \nPLATO No.  It's perpetual motion. \nJIM Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go! \nPLATO walks cautiously to the door and starts outside, camera following. \nLong shot.  Kids (corner of Observatory) with PLATO leaning out of door, seeing them, pulling back quickly. \nInside display lobby as PLATO pulls back through the door. JIM seems to have disappeared.  PLATO stares around frightened. \nPLATO Jim? \nJIM is looking at another exhibit whose mechanical voice is heard. \nJIM I'm here. \nPLATO (coming with him) They're still there! \nJIM nods.  They watch the exhibit a while longer. \nPLATO Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night? \nJIM No.  In the morning. \nPLATO looks up questioning.  JIM smiles and shrugs. \nJIM I just have a feeling. \nClose shot.  PLATO watching anxiously. \nMed. shot.  BUZZ with JUDY watching above him.  JIM enters shot until he is close to BUZZ's face.  He looks up at JUDY. Camera closes in until we are tight on the three.  The heads are nearly touching. \nJIM (softly to JUDY) You always at ringside?  You always travel in this rank company? \nBUZZ clutches JIM's hair and jerks his head up.  He cracks JIM smartly across the face with the palm of his hand. \nClose shot.  JUDY looking at JIM.  Her eyes clear in recognition. \nAnother angle.  The group and JIM as JIM tears free and comes at BUZZ, slugging.  But BUZZ, with a laugh, leaps onto the parapet and turns, the knife in his hand again.  JIM stops short.  The group and PLATO move in around him. \nJIM I thought only punks fought with knives. \nBUZZ Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game. \nHELEN Les jeux de courage! \nClose-up.  CRUNCH.  He is smiling.  His arms are around the shoulders of the kids who flank him. \nCRUNCH (wetting his lips) Machismo.  Machismo. \nMed. shot.  Group. \nJIM Machismo? \nBUZZ Somebody find him a knife. \nClose shot.  PLATO seen between heads of MIL and COOKIE. COOKIE holds up a switch knife and tosses it over into the circle. \nPLATO Jim! \nFull shot.  Circle as the knife falls at JIM's feet.  JIM stoops and picks up his weapon, then faces BUZZ.  Then he springs his blade. \nBUZZ You know the action?  No cutting. Just sticking--jab real cool. \nBUZZ hops from the parapet.  They begin stalking each other. BUZZ slides his knife from hand to hand trying to hypnotize JIM.  Suddenly he pokes out and pricks JIM's shirt.  The group sighs \"Ole!\" JIM makes no effort at self-defense. Silence.  BUZZ pricks JIM again, \"Ole!\" \nBUZZ (as he maneuvers) What you waiting on, Toreador?  I thought you wanted some action! \nJIM cuts out half-heartedly. \nBUZZ Big brave bull.  Hah!  Toro!  Hah! Hah! \nGOON Moo! \nBUZZ Come on--Fascinate us.  Impress us. What's happening?  Let's go! \nJIM I don't want trouble. BUZZ (furious suddenly) You crud chicken!  You're wasting our time! \nBUZZ viciously slaps JIM across the face.  JIM lashes out and misses.  BUZZ hops back. \nBUZZ Yeah--that's pretty close.  How about a little closer, Toreador? Cut off a button and you get to join the club! \nOutside entrance of parking lot.  A uniformed GUIDE of middle-age stares past camera.  Cries of \"Ole,\" are heard in the distance. \nGUIDE (turning) Mr. Minton!  Mr. Minton!  Trouble! \nThe LECTURER appears running.  He stops short at what he sees, and blinks in the sunlight. \nGUIDE Look.  There's your audience. \nLECTURER Oh, I don't think so.  From the school? \nInside circle.  JIM is covered with sweat and about to drop. He is getting the worst of it, still refusing to defend himself. \nClose shot.  PLATO.  He is looking on in despair. \nGROUP Ole!  Ole! \nSuddenly, with a cry, PLATO pushes through. \nInside circle as PLATO comes through.  His eyes are wild. He holds a tire chain in his hand. \nMIL Buzzy!  Look out!  He's got a chain! \nPLATO Are you really going to meet them? \nJIM Who knows.  Plato? \nPLATO What? \nJIM What's a chickie-run? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDownstairs hall.  JIM's house.  A single light is burning. JIM steals in from the kitchen, peers cautiously into the living room, then starts up the stairs.  A crash is heard above.  JIM stops, undecided whether to go or stay, then moves quickly up the stairs, no longer trying to be quiet. \nUpper hall.  JIM's house as JIM rises into view at the top of stairs.  He sees a figure on hands and knees mopping something off the rug.  Leaklight from the staircase dims details.  An apron is tied around the figure's waist and its bow sticks bravely in the air. \nJIM Mom? \nThe figure straightens and turns around, smiling.  It is the FATHER.  He is neatly dressed in his business suit but wears a Mary Petty apron. \nFATHER Hiya, Jimbo. \nJIM leans against the wall, shaking his head and trying not to laugh.  The FATHER laughs unhappily, trying to make it all seem a joke. \nFATHER You thought I was Mom? \nJIM Yeah! \nFATHER It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper. \nJIM (giggling) And you dropped it? \nFATHER (laughing too) Yeah!  Shh! \nJIM That's funny! \nFATHER I better clean this up before she sees it. \nHe starts dabbing among the spilled dishes with a wet cloth. JIM watches him. \nJIM Let her see.  What could happen. \nThe FATHER continues dabbing. \nJIM Dad-- \nThe FATHER looks up at him. \nJIM Dad--don't.  Don't. \nJIM touches his FATHER's elbow, bringing him to his feet. They look at each other a moment then JIM goes to his bedroom.  The FATHER goes back to mopping up the mess. \nInside JIM's room as he comes in, shuts the door and throws himself miserably on his bed.  He writhes as if the pain he feels were physical.  Outside, radios are heard in the night--tuned to different stations.  He feels under his jacket and holds up his hand to the moonlight.  There is blood on it.  He reaches up and takes his alarm clock and is setting it as camera glides to his window and holds over the rooftops. \nFull shot.  JUDY's backyard.  Moonlight.  JUDY stands near camera looking up at the moon.  The radios seem louder out here.  One breaks through. \nANNOUNCER Time now for the seven o'clock news. Friends, the next time you go shopping. \nJUDY'S FATHER (O.S.) Judy. \nShe wheels around. \nLong shot.  The FATHER standing erect on back porch, silhouetted against a window. \nJUDY'S FATHER What are you wishing for, Judy? \nMed. shot.  JUDY.  She hasn't moved. \nJUDY (softly) I wasn't wishing.  I was looking at the moon. \nFull shot.  Backyard featuring the FATHER.  We see him now as a tall and handsome man.  There is something boyish and appealing about him. \nJUDY'S FATHER (singing lightly) \"Man in the Moon, how came you there-- Up in the sky where you are shining-- Floating so high in the frosty air--? Oh, say--Man in the Moon!\"-- \nJUDY comes forward, stands below him on the step.  Her look is adoring. \nJUDY (astonished) How did you know that? \nRear view.  Edge of the bluff as the two cars go over. There is NO human sound. \nClose shot.  JIM as he stops rolling. \nBUZZ's car in flight. (Special effects).  The car soars through the night, the vehicle of a terrible journey. \nMed. shot.  BUZZ. (Process).  Surprise has gone.  He rides lightly on the thrill of his last moment--then suddenly, his face twists in a spasm of protest and loss. \nThe kids staring at his flight. \nJIM unaware of the disaster--glad he made it. \nLow angle.  Edge of the bluff.  With headlights blazing, both cars dive down. \nMed. shot.  JUDY standing frozen as the spectators shove past and around her. \nWide angle.  Edge of the bluff as spectators swarm to it, stand looking down. \nJIM on hands and knees, trying to rise.  Legs rush by him, knock him onto his face. \nLong shot. (Special effects).  Both cars plunge into the ocean below. \nJIM at edge of bluff.  He is pushing through spectators. \nJIM (a harsh whisper) Where's Buzz!  Where's Buzz! \nPLATO working his way through the crowd. \nPLATO (calling) Jim!  Jim! \nCRUNCH.  CRUNCH looks up as he hears JIM's repeated cry. JIM enters behind him, continuing blindly on his way. \nCRUNCH (tight fury) Down there!  Down there is Buzz! \nJIM looks over the edge. \nRear view.  Spectators.  A siren wail approaches.  The kids wheel and scatter, panicking past the camera. \nClose shot.  MOOSE.  Looks at JIM.  Runs. \nClose shot.  GOON.  Turns.  Runs. \nMed. shot.  JIM seen between legs of hurrying kids.  The sirens and the pounding of their feet on the hard turf.  JIM is sitting on the edge of the bluff.  PLATO rushes in, stops short as he sees him. \nPLATO Come on, Jim!  We got to get out of here! \nJIM doesn't move.  PLATO grabs his arm and yanks. \nPLATO Get up!  Get up!  Come on! \nJIM stands.  PLATO pushes him. \nPLATO Go on!  Move! \nThey start away, PLATO still pushing from behind. \nMed. shot.  JUDY.  She is standing alone in the wind on the emptying plateau.  JIM and PLATO move past in the distance. JIM sees her and stops. \nClose shot.  JUDY.  She is shuddering violently but there are no tears.  She seems not to see or hear or be aware of anything around her. \nFull shot.  JIM and PLATO watching JUDY.  JIM moves toward her, camera panning with him and leaving PLATO behind.  JIM stands before JUDY until she notices him.  He shakes his head for all the sorrow he feels, but no words come. Tentatively he offers her his hand.  After a moment, she takes it.  She knows only that help is being offered and that she will accept it with trust.  JIM leads her away toward the car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHigh long shot.  JIM's street.  Night.  There is no movement anywhere.  In the house bordering the street a few lights still burn.  JIM's car approaches out of distance and slows when it reaches the alley. \nMed. shot.  JIM's car as it slows and stops.  JIM, JUDY and PLATO in the front seat.  JUDY has the door open before the car even stops.  She is shaking, agitated and withdrawn. \nJUDY (hardly audible) This is fine-- \nShe gets out and starts away, leaving door open. \nJIM (calling quietly) Judy.  Will you be okay? \nPLATO looks at him.  JUDY hesitates.  JIM raises a hand to her in a shy farewell.  She smiles vaguely, then hurries away from them. \nJIM I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed. \nMOTHER Good Lord! \nJIM I can't keep it to myself anymore-- \nFATHER Well, just get it off your chest, son. \nJIM That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another. \nFATHER You're absolutely right! \nJIM Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight? \nFATHER You what? \nMOTHER No! \nFATHER Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything? \nJIM I don't think so-- \nFATHER Well-- \nMOTHER What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police? \nJIM What's that got to do with it? \nMOTHER Why should you be the only one. \nFATHER Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's-- \nMOTHER Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon? \nFATHER I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out! \nMOTHER That's right! \nJIM Except yourself! \nFATHER Will you wait a minute? \nJIM You don't want me to go. \nMOTHER No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved! \nJIM But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen! \nFATHER You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it? \nJIM No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off? \nMOTHER He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer! \nJIM Just tell a little white lie? \nFATHER You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim. \nJIM I don't want to learn that! \nMOTHER Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving. \nJIM No!  You're not tearing me loose any more. \nMOTHER Do I have to spell it out? \nJIM You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. (silence) Dad? \nFATHER Son--this is all happening so fast-- \nJIM You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something (stops as he sees the emptiness in them) Mom? \nMOTHER Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life. \nJIM Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me? \nJUDY So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful? \nJIM (smiling) Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time. \nShe looks up.  He kisses her forehead. \nJUDY Why did you do that? \nJIM I felt like it. \nJUDY Your lips are soft when you kiss. \nJUDY rises. \nJIM Where you going? \nJUDY I don't know, but we can't stay here. \nJIM Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo. \nJUDY I'm never going back. \nJIM Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium (rises) Would you go with me? \nJUDY hesitates. \nJIM You can trust me, Judy. \nJUDY I feel as if I'm walking under water. \nThey start out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInside bathroom.  JIM's house.  The water is running in the sink and JIM's father is fixing a stomach settler.  Gradually he grows aware of a heavy pounding which insinuates itself above the splash of water.  The FATHER pauses, then turns off the tap.  The pounding continues.  JIM'S MOTHER appears at the bathroom door.  She is seen in the mirror tying her robe. \nMOTHER Frank?  I'm frightened. \nFATHER What's that pounding? \nMOTHER I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but-- \nFATHER He's home.  I heard the car. \nMOTHER Are you going down there? \nFATHER Look--just relax, will you? \nThe pounding ceases. \nFATHER See?  It stopped. \nMOTHER I still think you should go down. \nHe goes out of the bathroom, into the hall. \nFoyer.  JIM's house as the FATHER comes down the stairs, turning on the light as he comes.  He reaches the door and pauses.  The MOTHER stops midway down the stairs. \nFATHER (through the door) Who's there? (silence) Anyone there? \nMOTHER (low; at balustrade) Open it. \nThe FATHER opens the door and looks up sharply. \nClose shot.  Door.  FATHER's head in f.g. as he stares at it. Nailed to the door by its outstretched wings, its head hanging in an attitude of crucifixion, is the freshly killed carcass of a chicken.  Low whistles are heard from outside. The FATHER, frightened, looks out into the night. \nFull shot.  Front lawn and street.  Shooting over the FATHER's head.  The whistling continues. FATHER (hoarsely) Who's out there? \nVOICE Where's your son? \nFATHER What? \nANOTHER VOICE Where's your baby boy gone to, Daddy?  We want him. \nSuddenly the FATHER slams the door and rushes past us into the house. \nCloser shot.  Mansion.  Night.  A Mediterranean villa with a large domed solarium which is connected to the main building by a low enclosed arcade.  A crash and the falling of splintered glass is heard. \nLong shot.  Promenade.  Shooting through pillars of the main entrance portico, down the long promenade outside arcade. Two figures, seen in the distance, are disappearing through a window.  Camera tracks down promenade until it reaches a broken window through which JIM is just disappearing.  When he gets inside, he reaches back and takes his leather jacket which has been spread on the sill to protect them from splinters, shakes it out and puts it on.  Running footsteps are heard approaching.  JIM looks out nervously.  PLATO bursts in, out of breath. \nPLATO Jim! \nJIM Who's that! \nPLATO It's me! \nJIM How'd you find me?  What's happening? \nPLATO They're looking for you!-- \nJIM Yeah? \nPLATO Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you. \nJIM We know. \nPLATO They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there? \nJIM Judy. \nPLATO Help me in! \nJIM gives PLATO a hand over the windowsill. \nInside arcade.  JIM and JUDY are seen in an entering shaft of moonlight.  PLATO hits the floor and disappears into darkness. \nJIM Hey where'd you go? \nPLATO I'm here.  Shut up. \nJIM Come out come out wherever you are! \nPLATO Shut up.  Are you nuts? \nJIM No.  I'm scared. \nA match flares and lights a candle on an antique Spanish candelabra.  PLATO is revealed bending over it.  He lights the other candles through the following: \nPLATO We're safe here.  I hope. (holds up candelabra) What do you think? \nJIM (gazing around) Wow!  Well now-there-then! \nHis wonderment is justified.  The floor of the arcade is marble and there are marble benches and neo-Roman busts lining the walls. \nPLATO Isn't it crazy? \nJIM Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer. \nJUDY Oh, Jim! \nJIM No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear? \nJUDY (laughing) You decide, darling.  Remember our budget. \nPLATO Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month! \nJUDY Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone... \nJIM Why don't we just rent it for the season? \nJUDY You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die! \nJIM Well--we're newlyweds. \nJUDY There's just one thing.  What about-- \nPLATO Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree? \nJUDY Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear? \nJIM Of course.  Drown them like puppies. \nJIM lies back with his head in JUDY's lap.  She strokes his hair and smiles at him.  PLATO looks away. \nJIM No.  Seriously.  What's your trouble? \nPLATO hesitates a moment, then leans back, cuddling between the two of them. \nPLATO I don't know but whatever it is, it's gone now.  I mean I'm happy now.  Here. \nJIM puts his arm under PLATO's chin. \nPLATO I came here before. \nJIM When was that? \nPLATO When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back. \nJIM Who? \nPLATO Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight. \nJIM You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday. \nJUDY Plato, where's your father now? \nPLATO He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York! \nPLATO I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference? \nJUDY It's all right. \nJIM Sure. \nPLATO closes his eyes.  JUDY hums a lullaby as she strokes JIM's lips with a finger.  He snaps at it.  Then he kisses her hand, looks at her palm.  They whisper. \nJIM (continuing) You have a long life-line. \nShe takes his palm and examines it. \nJUDY So have you. \nShe kisses it, holds her cheek against it. \nJIM Ever been in a place like this before? \nJUDY Not exactly.  It's certainly huge. \nJIM How many rooms do you think there are? \nJUDY I don't know. \nJIM Should we explore? \nShe looks at PLATO.  JIM shrugs--tests to see if the boy is awake, but there is no reaction. \nCarefully, they crawl to their feet.  JIM supporting PLATO's head with his hands as they do so.  JIM takes the other blanket and covers PLATO with it.  JUDY kneels on the other side and tucks it in.  They look at each other across him and smile.  Then suddenly JUDY bends down and kisses PLATO's cheek very softly.  JUDY and JIM rise. JIM takes a candle from the candelabra and leads JUDY along the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond.  Silence except for their footfalls on the flagstone.  In the distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through. When they close again, a sob comes from PLATO. \nHigh angle closeup.  PLATO lying as they left him, but his eyes are open and he is crying.  Camera booms up as PLATO throws off the blanket and looks after them.  Camera booms higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure sitting by himself.  The pool echoes his weeping. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInside library.  Mansion.  Night.  The door opens slowly and JIM appears with the candle.  JUDY lingers at the door.  The flickering light reveals a formerly lavish room, paneled in oak.  There is a tapestry couch, empty bookcases, some dim portraits, a leather table and several chairs around a great stone fireplace. \nJIM Hey!  Will you look at this room! (looks behind him) Judy? \nShe comes forward.  JIM drips wax on the table-top and sticks the candle on it.  His hand shakes.  JUDY sits on the couch. \nJIM (continuing) Want to read any books?  Take your pick! (sits beside her) Isn't this the craziest? \nJUDY Hi. \nJIM Hi. \nHe takes her hand.  She looks at him and smiles. \nJIM (continuing) What? \nOFFICER We just zeroed three kids in a heap. Crest Drive and Observatory.  Looks like house-breaking.  Send us some help.  They may be armed.  Over. \nClose shot.  PLATO asleep on the blanket.  Only a single candle burns in the candelabra.  The same low whistles heard earlier come from all around him and rise in volume. Suddenly his eyes open.  He doesn't move, but he has come suddenly awake. \nLow shot.  PLATO lying in f.g.  Next to his face are a pair of booted feet.  He looks up.  Camera pans up to show CRUNCH. He is smiling.  He holds a tire chain in his hand which he swings. \nCRUNCH Good morning. \nFull shot.  The swimming pool.  GOON and MOOSE are behind CRUNCH.  They too are armed with tire chains.  They all laugh.  PLATO rolls away from them and runs toward the deep end of the pool. \nCRUNCH Moose!  Take the steps!  Goon!  The other side. \nThe boys run to their assigned places.  PLATO sees no exit. He flings himself down the ladder and into the pool.  He feints this way and that, the boys responding as if they were fencing.  CRUNCH swings down the ladder and his boots make a loud report as they hit the pool.  MOOSE advances down the steps at the shallow end.  GOON climbs onto the pool bottom at the opposite side.  The feinting continues, wordlessly, as the circle closes around PLATO.  The only sounds are the stamping of their boots as they try to distract him from side to side, and the animalistic grunts they make to scare him.  Suddenly PLATO sees an opening and plunges past MOOSE, pushing him over, and stumbles up the steps. \nCRUNCH Come on!  Let's make it! \nThey stream out of the pool after PLATO.  He reaches the glass doors first, streaks though, and bangs them shut behind him. \nTraveling shot.  Arcade.  PLATO's face is visible only when the moonlight strikes him through the passing windows.  The sound of running steps behind him. \nFull shot.  Main room.  A pattern of moonlight on the bare floor as PLATO dashes in and through it.  He falls over a piece of furniture and comes scurrying in to camera, wheels around on hands and knees to face the door.  The boys plunge into the moonlit square and stop.  PLATO tries not to breathe.  A match is struck.  CRUNCH looks around, but can see nothing.  That match goes out.  The boys start up the stairs, whispering.  Immediately, PLATO crawls forward, under the piano.  He hears a murmur of voices from behind the oak door of the library--next to the piano.  He moves to it stealthily. \nClose shot, PLATO at door listening through it, on hands and knees.  His confusion mounts.  He shakes his head to clear it.  Then, suddenly he rises and tries the knob.  The door is locked.  He beats on it. \nPLATO Save me! \nThe boys run across the room.  As they hit the moonlit square.  PLATO spins and fires.  Somebody drops and starts moaning.  JIM opens the door. \nPLATO (shrieks) What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for? \nJIM Plato! \nThere is a rush of boys coming forward. \nPLATO (with hate) I don't want you for my father! \nJIM Your father! \nPLATO fires at JIM.  JIM leaps at PLATO with a cry and knocks him down. \nJIM (in rage) You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut! \nPLATO (screaming) Get away from me! \nHe rolls away from JIM and runs to the main door. \nJUDY Jim! \nMain door, from inside.  PLATO falls upon it, fumbles with the bolt and swings the door wide.  He steps out into the waning moonlight and we see him running down the lawn.  JIM rushes into the doorway and stops short. \nFull shot.  Mansion.  The OFFICERS are moving away from us toward it.  PLATO runs wildly toward them. \nOFFICER (sharply) Halt! \nPLATO stops, confused. \nOFFICER (continuing) Come here. \nJIM runs out on the promenade and starts over the balustrade. \nJIM Plato! \nClose shot.  PLATO.  His face is working desperately in growing panic. \nOFFICER (O.S.) Come here, son. \nPLATO No! \nJIM (O.S.) Plato! \nOFFICER (O.S.) Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble. \nPLATO runs out. \nClose shot.  JIM as he screams. \nInside planetarium as PLATO lands.  He is cut and bleeding. \nOFFICER (O.S.) Come out of there. \nPLATO wheels and skitters backward across the floor of the observatory on his hands and knees until he comes to the door of the planetarium theater. \nReverse shot.  Main entrance.  Seen from inside.  The OFFICER in b.g., PLATO in f.g.  The OFFICER appears in the entrance, then moves quickly to one side to be less of a target.  He reaches in to unlatch the door. \nOFFICER You're making it tough on yourself, kid.  Come out quietly now.  You didn't kill anybody yet. \nPLATO fires at him, then opens the door of the planetarium theater and runs inside.  The door swings shut behind him. \nOutside planetarium.  The OFFICER is hugging the outside wall.  Another siren wails and a spotlight catches the OFFICER who runs out into the light. \nOFFICER (running) Need a little help here! \nFull shot.  Parking lot as the CHIEF's car wheels to a stop. It is followed by a civilian car and a cab. \nCHIEF's car. \nCHIEF We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone? \nOFFICER We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier. \nCHIEF How'd he get in? \nOFFICER Smashed the front door. \nCHIEF Any other entrance? \nOFFICER (leaving) Down in back. \nMed. shot.  Bushes bordering planetarium as JIM climbs through them and stops short, staring in amazement.  JUDY is in b.g. \nFull shot.  Parking lot.  JIM seen in f.g. hiding in the screen of leaves.  Beyond we see the full activity--the crowd, the cars, searchlights playing on the planetarium entrance, police moving in under direction of the CHIEF. \nCHIEF (loud on speaker) Silence.  Please maintain silence. Keep back and stay off the pavements.  Keep back and stay off the pavements.  There will be emergency vehicles coming through. This warning is for your own protection. \nRAY's prowl car come in.  JIM's parents climb out, curious. RAY hurries to consult with an officer who briefs him, then hurries to the chief's car. \nParking lot.  Several patrol cars now line the parking lot. The NEGRO WOMAN in her nightgown and overcoat pushes forward from a cab and accosts an OFFICER. \nNEGRO WOMAN What's going on? \nOFFICER I don't know, lady.  Some kid's in trouble.  Stand back, please. \nNEGRO WOMAN I got to know.  My boy run off tonight.  He had a gun with him, too. \nMed. shot.  CHIEF's car as RAY hurries in. \nCHIEF Hello, Ray--Know anything about this? \nRAY As much as you do--Loan me your mike, will you? \nCHIEF (handing it to him) Help yourself. \nRAY (into mike) I am addressing the boy in the planetarium.  I am speaking to the boy inside.  This is Ray Framek from the Juvenile Division-- \nClose-up JIM as he reacts to RAY's name.  He rises and looks off. \nRAY (O.S.) (over speaker) You are now surrounded.  You are surrounded by many armed police. Whoever you are, drop your weapon and come outside. \nMed. shot.  JIM'S FATHER standing by RAY's car, gazing off with interest.  His wife comes out and stands beside him, looks at him questioningly. \nRAY (O.S.) (over speaker) Come outside.  Clasp your hands over your head and come outside quietly-- \nThe FATHER's gaze has traveled over the scene.  Suddenly he sees his son followed by JUDY, run into the planetarium. \nMOTHER Frank! \nFATHER Stay here. (goes over to RAY) That was my son! \nRAY You sure? \nFATHER I think I know my son. \nJIM takes off his jacket and holds it out to PLATO. \nPLATO Can I keep it? \nJIM What do you think? \nJIM gives him the jacket--PLATO puts it on. \nJIM You want to give me your gun now, Plato? \nPLATO My gun? \nJIM In your pocket.  Give it to me. \nPLATO I need it. \nJIM You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second. \nPLATO hands him the gun.  JIM removes the cartridges and puts them in his pocket. \nPLATO You promised to give it back. \nJIM Friends never break promises, do they? (gives him back the gun) Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out. \nPLATO Why? \nJIM They like you.  Okay? \nPLATO Come on! \nJIM opens the door for PLATO, then follows him out.  JUDY joins them. \nJUDY Hi, Plato! \nPLATO Hi. \nObservatory as JIM, JUDY and PLATO come to the entrance. PLATO sees an OFFICER. \nPLATO Who's that? \nJIM Just a guard. \nPLATO I shot at one of them. \nJIM But you didn't hurt anybody. \nOutside observatory as PLATO and JIM come forward into the early dawn.  PLATO stops and looks off, scared. \nSlow pan shot.  The crowd.  It has grown enormously. Silence.  There are armed officers everywhere--all waiting, alert. \nMed. shot.  NEGRO WOMAN.  Her eyes are moist.  Her lips move in silent prayer. \nMed. shot.  JIM's parents.  The FATHER looking on anxiously. The MOTHER is crying against the car. \nMed. shot.  JIM and PLATO. \nPLATO Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away. \nJIM (tense; calling past camera) Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back? \nSuddenly PLATO bolts.  JIM wheels after him. \nJIM (yelling) Plato!  Don't be a fool! \nFull shot.  Planetarium as PLATO dashes to the stairway leading to the balcony. \nJIM'S FATHER and MOTHER.  Their faces reflect panic as they see PLATO running in JIM's coat. \nMOTHER It's Jim! \nFull shot.  Balcony.  Shooting down the stairs as PLATO rushes up.  JIM closes behind him.  Camera pans with PLATO as he climbs the ladder to the ledge of the small dome.  JIM stops at the foot of the ladder. \nJIM Plato! \nPLATO Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore! \n", "test1_input": "She starts out.  The FATHER rises and follows after her. \nJUDY'S FATHER (softly) Hey, hey, Glamorpuss.  I'm sorry. \nShe leaves the room, interrupting the joke he was going to make.  He turns back to the table and sits down.  The MOTHER rises and comes to him. \nJUDY'S FATHER (continuing) I don't know what to do.  All of a sudden she's a problem. \nThe mother stands behind his chair.  She tips his head back against her body and kneads his neck and shoulders. \nJUDY'S MOTHER She'll outgrow it, dear.  It's just the age. \nBEAU (in a sudden burst) The atomic age! \nThe door slams. \nJUDY'S MOTHER (kissing her husband's hair) It's the age when nothing fits. \nInside JIM's room.  We see him lying on his bed as before. His eyes are open.  The alarm clock goes off.  JIM starts as if shot, then stops the wild ringing.  The time is seven- forty-five.  He makes no move to leave the bed.  There is a light tap on the door, then it opens and the FATHER is there, seen in light from the hall and still wearing the apron. \nFATHER You awake? \nJIM Yes. \nFATHER Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say? \nJIM I'm not hungry. \nThe FATHER turns away. \nJIM Hey--I want to ask you something. \nFATHER (happily) Shoot, Jimbo. \nJIM Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it? \nFATHER (laughing) Is there some kind of trick answer? \nJIM What would you do, Dad? \nFATHER (evading) I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject. \nThe FATHER turns on the light and looks at JIM who is now sitting on the edge of the bed.  He removes his jacket and the bloody shirt is revealed.  The FATHER stares. \nJIM Blood. \nFATHER How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in? \nJIM The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now? \nFATHER Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons-- \nJIM We don't have time. \nFATHER We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice-- \nHe goes out, to the study next door.  JIM rises. \nJIM What can you do when you have to be a man? \nFATHER Well, now-- \nJIM Just give me a direct answer! (pause) You going to stop me from going, Dad? \nFATHER You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again. \nJIM Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now! \nFATHER I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important-- \nDuring this, JIM has kicked off his shoes and put on his boots and jacket and goes out. \nLiving room featuring stairs.  JIM comes running down the stairs and out the kitchen door. \nFATHER (O.S.) Jim?  Will you listen?  You can't go out till we--Jim! \n", "test1_true": "FATHER Jim?  Jim! \nHe goes to kitchen door, calls again, gets no answer, comes back into the living room, sees he is still wearing the apron.  He rips it off and throws it down--then starts for the stairs. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe Plateau.  Moonlight.  Wind shrieks over the exposed plateau, which is several hundred yards long.  It cuts into the darkness like the prow of a ship and ends in empty air. A dozen cars are scattered about, defining a sort of runway in the center.  There are twenty kids present, but very little talk.  Most of them belong to BUZZ's group but there are a few whom we have not met before.  They stand in small clots, murmuring and smoking.  The atmosphere is strung tightly, like the moments before a dawn attack.  In b.g. near the cliff's edge, are two cars of similar make and model.  They face away from camera toward the edge of the plateau.  There are no headlights anywhere...blackout conditions. \nMOOSE, a boy in a leather jacket and cheap yachting cap stands guard between the cars, his back to us.  His hands are on his hips.  His legs are spread.  Some girls drift in. \nAnother angle.  Plateau featuring PLATO as he wanders through the crowd searching for JIM.  He passes BUZZ's car where BUZZ, JUDY and the rest are eating hamburgers.  They have all changed into fighting wardrobe. \nBUZZ (calling out) Hey, Chicken-Little. \nPLATO stops. \nBUZZ Where's Toreador?  He beg off? \nPLATO He's not scared of you. \nBUZZ (laughing) Yeah? (to GOON) Goon!  You seen that adolescent type anywheres? \nCOOKIE He won't show. \nGOON Well, you going to wait all night? I'm getting nervous, man!  We got to do something! \nCRUNCH (looking off) Hey, Buzz! \nBUZZ What? \nCOOKIE Over there. \nBUZZ snaps on the spotlight again and swings it off. \nFull shot.  JIM's car as JIM gets out and PLATO runs to him. \nJIM How'd you get here? \nPLATO I hitched. \nJIM Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging. \nPLATO My personality's showing again. Should I leave? \nJIM No.  It's okay. \nBUZZ enters. \nBUZZ Come on.  Let's see what we're driving. \nJIM gets out; PLATO starts to follow. \nBUZZ Just him. \nJIM Stay there. \nThe two boys move away.  PLATO looks after them, hurt, then goes to side of JUDY and stands. \nDolly shot.  JIM and BUZZ as they come forward. \nBUZZ What you say your name was? \nJIM Jim Stark. \nBUZZ Buzz Gundersen. \nJIM Hi. \nBUZZ Glad to meet you. \nThey shake hands briefly as they walk.  They come to MOOSE and stop. \nMOOSE Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy. \nBUZZ Flashlight? \n", "test1_id": 1191, "test2_input": "MOOSE produces one and hands it to BUZZ who goes to one of the guarded cars, motioning JIM to come, too. \nCloser shot.  BUZZ, JIM and MOOSE seen as hood is raised, revealing their faces beneath it.  BUZZ explores the motor with the flashlight. \nBUZZ Looks good. \nMOOSE Clean as a whistle.  They both got plenty breeze. \nBUZZ Look good to you? \nJIM Sure.  It's fine. \nBUZZ Okay. \nHe closes the hood.  Group moves across to other car. \nJUDY and PLATO.  The other kids are behind them.  JUDY looks to see that their attention isn't on her, then speaks quietly to PLATO. \nJUDY Is he your friend? \nPLATO Yes.  My best friend. \nJUDY What's he like? \nPLATO Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere. \nJUDY Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so? \nPLATO Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more. (laughing) People he really likes--he lets call him \"Jamie.\" \nJUDY Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite. \nPLATO Okay. \nFull shot.  Guarded cars.  JIM is close in f.g. at wheel of his car.  BUZZ is beyond, at wheel of his.  Both boys are gunning their engines, listening critically.  JIM lets his idle. \nJUDY, GOON and group.  They watch in silent anticipation. PLATO starts away from them. \nTraveling shot.  PLATO hurrying away from the group.  He stops, looking off. \nJIM and BUZZ.  PLATO in distance. \nBUZZ Better try the doors.  Jump out. \nJIM opens his door. \nBUZZ No--quick, man!  You got to break quick. \nJIM shuts his door and tries again.  So does BUZZ.  Then both boys walk forward to the edge.  Neither says a word. BUZZ puts his hand on JIM's shoulder. \nHigh angle.  The edge of the bluff (process).  JIM and BUZZ are directly below us.  Under them the plateau falls steeply away in a sheer drop of a hundred feet to the ocean below. \nTwo shot.  JIM and BUZZ.  JIM is staring below.  He is beginning to perspire.  He lights a cigarette.  Without taking his hand from JIM's shoulder, BUZZ borrows the cigarette from his lips, takes a drag and hands it back. JIM takes another puff then tosses it into the abyss. \nBUZZ (quietly) This is the edge, boy.  This is the end. \nJIM Yeah. \nBUZZ I like you, you know? \nJIM Buzz?  What are we doing this for? \nBUZZ (still quiet) We got to do something.  Don't we? \nLong shot.  JIM and BUZZ with PLATO in f.g.  JIM and BUZZ appear to him as two close friends.  Suddenly they break and go, without speaking further, to their cars.  They back up to the opposite end of the plateau, headlights dark.  PLATO follows them with his gaze. \nGroup shot.  GOON and others looking up as the cars glide by. \nMed. shot.  JUDY waiting as BUZZ and JIM move into starting position next to her.  JUDY goes to BUZZ.  JIM is in b.g.-- looking on. \nJUDY Feel okay? \nBUZZ Give me some dirt. \nShe bends out of sight for a moment as BUZZ goes on talking, then hands him the dirt.  He rubs it into his palms. \n", "test2_true": "JUDY and BUZZ kiss, without much interest. \nBUZZ What's happening? \nJUDY Good luck, Buzz. \nShe starts out, without kissing him again. \nJIM (calling softly) Judy. \nMed. shot.  JIM's car as JUDY comes to him. \nJIM Me too. \nShe looks at him a moment then bends and hands him some dirt. Their heads touch for an instant. \nJIM Thank you. \nShe breaks the look and hurries away. \nLong shot.  The cars.  They are lined up in two rows-- headlights facing each other.  JUDY comes into shot.  When she gets near camera, she stops and turns back to face them. \nBUZZ Hit your lights! \nSuddenly the headlights of all the cars come on full. \nReverse shot.  JUDY.  She is in the center of the glare. Behind her we see the other kids filing out of their cars, hurrying toward the edge of the bluff.  The sound of the two motors revving then dying and revving again. \nInside JIM's car.  JIM grips the wheel firmly, relaxes his hands to rub his palms together and crack his knuckles.  He grips the wheel again.  Steps on the accelerator, winding his engine into a roar.  He lets up, looks tensely at-- \nBUZZ in his car.  His chin juts forward.  He lets go of the wheel, starts to comb his hair. \nSlow pan shot.  Spectators staring off at the cars.  A boy has his arm around the girl in front of him, his cheek against hers.  Both are looking off.  Some of the kids smoke. All are involved in the blasting of engines. \nPLATO among the spectators near edge of the bluff.  He is chewing his lip.  Camera pans down to show that the fingers of both his hands are tightly crossed. \nClose shot.  JUDY staring tensely into the glare.  Suddenly she raises her hands high above her head. \nClose shot.  JIM sweating it out.  He leans forward, squinting, ready. \nClose shot.  BUZZ.  He puts his comb between his teeth and clamps it hard.  He settles himself for the run. \nLong shot.  Plateau.  The cars are in close, seen from the rear.  JUDY is a small distant figure, arms stretched high. The exhaust blasts.  Now she drops her arms.  The cars leap ahead. \nMed. shot.  JUDY.  She whirls to see the cars snap by, then begins running up the center of the plateau between the lines of spectators. \nFull shot.  Spectators.  Shooting over their shoulders as the cars approach and scream past. \nPit shot.  Cars.  As they approach, gaining speed, and thunder over the camera. \nInside JIM's car. (Process).  He is tense. \nInside BUZZ's car. (Process).  His hands hard on the wheel. The comb is still between his teeth.  He begins edging toward the door on his left. \nMoving close shot.  JUDY biting hard on her finger, as she runs forward. \nClose shot.  PLATO.  Both hands cover his mouth.  The fingers are still crossed. \nInside JIM's car. (Process).  As he edges to his left.  He is driving with one hand.  He opens the door, gets set for his jump. \nInside BUZZ's car. (Process).  He reaches for the door handle and misses.  As he raises his arm to reach again, the strap of his windbreaker sleeve slips over the handle.  He looks down in panic, then back at the drop ahead.  He tugs but cannot get the sleeve loose. \nCloseup.  PLATO staring.  He shuts his eyes tight and keeps them shut. \nShooting at backs of the two cars as they race through the row of lights toward the edge. \nInside JIM's car. (Process).  His face is soaked.  He looks once toward BUZZ--then ahead.  His eyes widen in fear.  He shoves left and flings himself forward, and out. \nOutside JIM's car as he sprawls forward--into camera. \nInside BUZZ's car. (Process).  BUZZ leans way forward now. He seems to rise in his seat.  His mouth opens and the comb falls out. \nFull shot spectators staring in disbelief.  Suddenly a youth ducks his face into the neck of his girlfriend so he cannot see.  At the same instant-- \nCROWD (in a single breath) Oh! \n", "test2_id": 1192, "test3_input": "SERGEANT What's the charge? \nOFFICER Assault with a deadly weapon. \nJIM Listen-- \nSERGEANT (annoyed) He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you? \nJIM My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here. \nSERGEANT Come back tomorrow. \nJIM I'll wait for him. \nSERGEANT Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? (to hoodlum) Ever been booked before? \nJIM turns away, notices a phone on the wall--puts in a coin, asks for a number. \nBedroom of JUDY's parents.  Through an open door we hear a radio playing-- a late disc-jockey show for teenagers in which numbers are dedicated by request.  JUDY'S MOTHER and FATHER are in bed, FATHER has phone in his hand. \nJUDY'S FATHER Who wants her?  Who?  Jim who? Never heard of you. \nHe hangs up phone, looks at his wife.  She rolls over in bed. The FATHER turns off the bed lamp, then sits up, worried in the dark. \nJUDY's bedroom.  It is her radio we have heard.  She turns off light, opens the door a crack, and looks out toward her parent's room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTraveling shot.  PLATO.  He is coming up the walk to his house.  When PLATO has come a few feet, somebody whistles. PLATO and camera stop.  Short, quiet whistles come from the boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk.  PLATO turns and starts to run, camera following.  He gets to his door, tries the key, but in his panic it will not go into the lock.  Suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around. CRUNCH stands above him.  GOON closes in from the other side. All very tense and hotted up! \nPLATO What do you want! \nCRUNCH You know what we want.  We want your friend. \nGOON We got eyes for him. \nPLATO Listen, you guys ought to go home. The cops are cruising every-- \nGOON Where does he live? \nPLATO reaches up swiftly and rings the bell.  GOON grabs him. CRUNCH cracks him. \nCRUNCH You better tell us and I'm not kidding. \nPLATO My old man's got a gun. \nGOON His old man's got a gun.  What do you think of that! (drives a hard blow at PLATO's belly) Your friend talked-- (belts him again) Now you talk!  Talk! \nThe door opens and the NEGRO WOMAN is there.  CRUNCH sends PLATO spinning into the house past her.  He falls. \nNEGRO WOMAN (yelling) What you doing!  What you doing to him!  You clear out of here 'fore I call the police! \nShe swings at CRUNCH who faces her, challenging. \nNEGRO WOMAN Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now! \nMOOSE Let's go, Crunch. \nThey turn and move past camera.  PLATO gets up off the floor. We hear the sound of a heap starting.  The NEGRO WOMAN closes the door. \nInside PLATO's foyer as NEGRO WOMAN bolts the door. \nNEGRO WOMAN Why you like to mix with bad boys like that?  Why you get in trouble all the-- \nPLATO I have to go out.  I have to warn him. \nHe starts up the stairs.  She follows him heavily. \nNEGRO WOMAN You not going anywhere!  You staying home while your mama's away. \nBedroom of PLATO's mother, a lacy affair with imported dolls on the pillows.  PLATO rushes in, opens the drawer of the night-table and pulls out a gun.  He checks to see that it is loaded.  The NEGRO WOMAN appears in the door and stares at him, turns on the light which illuminates the bed-lamp. \nNEGRO WOMAN John!  What you doing with that! You leave that be!  Put it down before you hurt yourself.  Hear me? \nBut PLATO moves past her and out of the room.  She turns after him. \n", "test3_true": "The slam of a door is heard below. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJIM's garage.  Night.  JUDY waiting inside.  JIM's car pulls in, a radio going softly.  He turns the motor off and is about to turn off the radio when we hear the announcer: \nANNOUNCER Coming up now another request--this time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to you--from Buzz. \nJIM stares at the radio, then turns it off. \nAnother angle. \nJUDY They'll be looking for you. \nJIM They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself? \nJUDY It doesn't matter to them. \nJIM You were looking for me, weren't you? \nJUDY (a small voice) No--I was just--maybe-- \nJIM I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so. \nJIM Want some milk? \nJUDY comes forward. \nJIM That's all I can do when I'm nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a slug. \nShe shakes her head.  He takes a sip. \nJIM You still pretty upset? \nJUDY I'm numb. \nShe is shuddering a little. \nJIM You cold? \nJUDY Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold. \nJIM I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again. \nJUDY Neither can I. \nJIM No?  Why not? (no answer) You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb? \nJUDY No. \nJIM Every day I look in the mirror and say, \"What?  You still here?\" Man! \nThey laugh a little. \nJIM Hey!  You smiled! \nJUDY shakes her head--beginning to warm to him. \nJIM Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing. \nJUDY I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere. \nJIM Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything. \nJUDY If you knew me you wouldn't say that. \nJIM I don't think you trust anybody, do you? \nJUDY Why? \nJIM I'm getting that way, too. \nJUDY (looks at him) Have you ever gone with anyone who-- \nJIM Sure.  Lots of times. \n", "test3_id": 1193}

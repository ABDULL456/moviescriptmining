Ethan sits back, heavily. 
SWANBECK (cont'd) - Hunt, are you listening?.. 
Slowly looking up: 
ETHAN If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight? 
SWANBECK You were there. 
Swanbeck clears his throat.  He turns back to the computer and punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.  File open to computer scans of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat, as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image. 
ETHAN 
slowly looks up at Swanbeck. 
SWANBECK When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times? 
ETHAN Twice. 
SWANBECK What did you think of him? 
ETHAN You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that? 
SWANBECK Not necessarily. 
Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain. 
SWANBECK Airline record list Captain Harold Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.  as far as the media and all governmental agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the flight, but in fact he missed it.  He did, however make the next flight - in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size. 
Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially obscured by a ring of police and customs officers. 
SWANBECK (cont'd) Someone on that flight planned an operation designed to down the plane and make it look like an accident.  Someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch but - they don't always get your luggage on the plane, even when you fly first class. 
ETHAN So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't. 
SWANBECK Then you do think it was Ambrose. 
Ethan barely nods. 
SWANBECK (cont'd) And you're not surprised. 
Ethan gives Swanbeck a look. 
ETHAN Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it. 
SWANBECK Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers? 
Ethan smiles. 
ETHAN Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground. 
SWANBECK The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying? 
Ethan rises and moves to the window. 
ETHAN Right now only Ambrose knows that. 
SWANBECK In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us. 
ETHAN In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it. 
SWANBECK - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts. 
ETHAN 'Terrorists?' 
SWANBECK Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business. 
ETHAN If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that - 
SWANBECK - is where Miss Hall comes in. 
ETHAN (blindsided) Excuse me? 
SWANBECK Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him. 
ETHAN (acidly) And then what? 
SWANBECK Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.

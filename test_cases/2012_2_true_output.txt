NENG (in Chinese) Almost there, Lin... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY 
THE WAVE FINALLY HITS! 
All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water. 
They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers they're resting on, keep them anchored. 
INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open stern gate of the American ship. 
The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec and Oleg. 
INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura, Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor, as the vessel undulates back and forth. 
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Water has penetrated the stern! 
Laura looks unsure. 
LAURA What now? 
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time. 
Adrian looks at him. 
ADRIAN Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber? 
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER If we don't hurry, we won't be able to. 
Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow. 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry. 
Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin. (CONTINUED) 
Kate shouts across to Tamara. 
KATE Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah. 
Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother. 
Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost tearful with relief to see him. 
KATE (CONT'D) I was so worried about you. 
Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off. 
Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family. 
LILLY Mummy! 
Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level continues to rise. 
INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor, in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew approaching. 
But between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly. 
TAMARA Lilly run! 
Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar. 
Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she looks down and is too scared to jump. 
TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D) Lilly! Take him. 
Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar above the quickly narrowing gap. 
In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground. 
(CONTINUED) 
Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in. 
INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY 
Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her. Adrian realizes they are too late. He turns to the rescue crew. 
ADRIAN Is there any way to talk to them? 
Lilly is close to tears. 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with his unconscious brother. 
JACKSON We have to move him higher. (looks around) Over there! 
Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance, pitching them into the water. 
EXT. LAUNCH PILLAR/UNDER WATER - DAY 
In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's launch towers. 
Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other launch towers follow like dominos. 
The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting sideways, rudderless. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Chaos. Fear. Everybody holds on for dear life.

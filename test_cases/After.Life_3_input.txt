TOM You didn't believe him did you? 
PAUL No.   Of course not. Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts hypnotically across the screen. 
PAUL It's just... I'm having these... 
TOM What? 
PAUL Nothing.   Forget it. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY 
Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her slab watching Eliot work. 
ANNA'S POV Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris. 
PREP ROOM Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end. 
ANNA (O.C.) What's that for? Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip. 
ELIOT His mouth.   To keep it closed. Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs. 
ELIOT Now his eyes. He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together. 
ANNA Is this how you'll prepare my body? Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly. 
ELIOT No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful. 
ANNA Does he have family? 
ELIOT Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body. 
ANNA My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me? 
ELIOT (shakes his head) I'm sorry. 
ANNA And Paul? 
ELIOT It's not important anymore. 
ANNA I need to know. 
ELIOT 
(HESITATES) No.    He didn't cry. We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes. 
ANNA I knew he wouldn't.     He always got upset when I cried.     He said crying never helped. Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily against the slab. As if she's about to fall. 
ELIOT You should rest. He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down. 
ELIOT You're getting weaker.    It's almost time. Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him. 
ANNA Can I ask you something? 
ELIOT Yes.   Of course. 
ANNA Why do we die? A long beat. 
ELIOT To make life important. Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More ominous. Claustrophobic. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back. Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.

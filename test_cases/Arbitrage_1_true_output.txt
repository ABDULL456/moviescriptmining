EXT. FIELDS - DEAD OF NIGHT 
Robert walks and walks through tall grass. 
In the distance behind him, A MASSIVE EXPLOSION lights up the sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches, incinerating the car and its contents. 
INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM 
Robert cleans himself up in the sink, applying soap and water to his cut stomach, scrubbing frantically, He takes all the paper towels and puts them in his pocket. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 28. 
EXT. GAS STATION - LATER 
Robert picks up a PAYPHONE by the bathrooms, cradling it to his ear with his sleeve and dialing with his other finger through his shirt fiber. 
ROBERT (INTO PHONE) Yes, I wanna make it collect... 
OPERATOR Your name, sir? 
ROBERT Lawrence Grant. 
RINGING, then... 
JIMMY (O.S.) Who the fuck is this? 
ROBERT Jimmy, it's me. 
JIMMY (O.S.) Robert? 
ROBERT I want you to listen to me very closely... 
EXT. CAR WRECKAGE SITE 
POLICE CARS flash lights. An EMT unloads Julie's charred CORPSE into a BODY BAG. INVESTIGATORS sift through rubble. 
DET. MICHAEL BRYER (43) sits in a TAN SEDAN, drinking a cup of deli coffee. Barely awake, he stares out the window at a bunch of STATE TROOPERS arguing with his partner, MILLS. 
MILLS breaks away from the uniforms and approaches, shaking his head. Bryer gets out of the car. 
BRYER You gotta be fucking kidding me. 
MILLS Catching detective wants us to rule before he calls it. 
BRYER We've been having the same fuckin' argument for twenty years. (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 29. BRYER (CONT'D) They can't handle one drunk motorist kills herself? 
MILLS I'm not so sure about this... 
Bryer heads over to the car, his interest piqued. 
Mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side. 
MILLS (CONT'D) Car roll had multiple impacts, but she was here (POINTS) and her feet (POINTS) were down there. 
Bryer immediately sees what he means-- dented metal, even in the burnt door. 
BRYER ... So who kicked out the door? 
Bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side, looking off into the distance of the path Robert took just moments before. 
EXT. GAS STATION 
About twenty yards down the road, a BLACK SUV hums, waiting. Robert opens the passenger door and gets in.

Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black. 
ROBERT Let's go. 
They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty banged up. 
JIMMY You gonna tell me what this is?

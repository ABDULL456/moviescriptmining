He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost violence. 
DEANNA No... 
SHINZON I can feel your desire, Deanna... 
She forces herself to concentrate... to resist telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing... bending... 
And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has actually traveled. 
She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes. 
On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna: 
SHINZON I can feel your hunger to know the Reman ways... the old ways. 
Then the world changes again... 
Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her, whispering: 
SHINZON Don't fear what you desire... 
She forces him away from her and -- 
She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with emotion. 
INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING 
The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame. Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head. 
VICEROY The bond is broken. 
SHINZON Find her again. 
VICEROY No -- this is wasting time. 
SHINZON Do as I tell you! 
A Reman officer interrupts on comm: 
REMAN OFFICER (V.O.) Praetor, we've received the transponder signal. 
SHINZON (to comm) On my way. 
He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness overtaking him. 
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's chest.  His mind... probing. 
Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim. 
VICEROY It's accelerating.  You have no more time for games. 
SHINZON Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be on the bridge. 
He goes. 
INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY 
Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS. 
SHINZON Transport. 
An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes! 
SHINZON Welcome home. (to Engineers) Begin the download. 
Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck, begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port we saw earlier. 
(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is actually Data pretending to be the B-9.) 
Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders: 
SHINZON Tea, hot. 
A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY 
Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch, concerned. 
BEVERLY Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.

OSBOURNE Let's be fucking honest... 
Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... This is a crucifixion! This is political! Don't tell me it's not! 
He storms out the door. 
OSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... I have a drinking problem! 
The door slams.   Palmer Smith looks at Olson.     Olson arches an eyebrow. 
4   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                            4 
OSBOURNE 
Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter. 
His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray. 
Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne. 
KATIE You're home. 
Osbourne continues making himself a drink. 
OSBOURNE Hang on to your hat, honey.    I have some news. I---- 
KATIE Did you pick up the cheeses? 
OSBOURNE Huh? 
KATIE Were they ready? I didn't know you were coming home this early. 
OSBOURNE (blank) The cheeses. 
Katie rolls her eyes. 
KATIE I left a message for you to stop at Todaro's. The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming over. 
OSBOURNE The Pfarrers? Ugh.    I----what did Kathleen say? 
KATIE What? 
OSBOURNE When you left the message? 
KATIE She said.    She would give you.   The message. 
OSBOURNE Well she, I don't know, I guess we had bigger news today. My day didn't revolve arou---- 
KATIE So you didn't get the cheeses. 
OSBOURNE Well, since I didn't get the message, no, I didn't get the cheeses. But hang on to your hat, I---- 
KATIE Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I have to go out again? All right, well, you better get dressed. 
OSBOURNE Honey, we have to talk. 
KATIE Not right now. They'll be here in, what, less than an hour. 
5   INT. COX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                            5 
A hand hovers, hesitates. 
VOICE Is this a, uh, goat cheese? 
OSBOURNE (OFF) Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese. 
Pink Revision 8/14/07 6. 
Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full swing. Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer (who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties, rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug and Tina Magruder. 
Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler. 
HARRY Because I have lactose reflux.    But I can---- 
OSBOURNE You're lactose intolerant? 
HARRY Yes, but I can---- 
OSBOURNE Or you have acid reflux?    They're two different things. 
Harry looks at him coldly. 
HARRY I know what they are. 
OSBOURNE Then you misspoke yourself.    So I---- 
HARRY Thank you for correcting me. 
KATIE You should try the chevre, Harry. It's very good. 
HARRY Yeah.   I can eat goat cheese. 
He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... I was just explaining to your husband here, I have a condition----

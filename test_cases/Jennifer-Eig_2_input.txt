BERLIN wipes a thought through his hair with fingers. "I don't know what that means." Walks past into the bedroom. Everything taken apart. Every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes. 
BERLIN ... he's either here to take something .. or leave some- thing .. I don't find nothing .. 
146:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. 
BERLIN pours last of the whisky. Looks totally snuffed out. He and HELENA sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a mile apart. A yellow pad on the table covered in notes. BERLIN swallows scotch and reads to himself "I guess we all got lucky?" 
HELENA You gotta stop drinking, darling. 
Another mouthful of scotch & she hears the glass hit the table. 
He's glad you're drinking. Every drink you take you're helping him. 
BERLIN He doesn't need my help. 
HELENA I know about alcohol, John. 
BERLIN You do? 
HELENA I'm blind because my father drank. 
That's what she knows about alcohol and he'd prefer to be dead. 
I lost everyone I ever loved .. I lost my hopes .. my future .. I'm in love with you, John .. I don't want them to take you away from me .. 
147:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. 
St ANNE is close enough to kiss BERLIN. Right into his space & talking right into his face. And today he's not in a good mood. 
St ANNE He humiliated you. In front of every one .. In front of a bunch of secret- aries? .. Well, that would piss any- one off? ... That would piss me off .. I'd be real mad if a guy did that to me, & called himself a friend .. Coz that ain't a friendly thing to do? .. You side with "friends" .. You don't go bitchin on them behind their back? 
And he suddenly switches gear. And whispers like it's a secret. 
He wasn't much of a "friend" at all? 
BERLIN Ross was my best friend. 
St ANNE Did you shoot your "best friend?" 
BERLIN No. 
St ANNE The next time I ask you that quest- ion, you're gonna tell me the truth. 
St ANNE shunts back in his chair. Expands the frame as he goes. Sergeant TAYLOR sits on a chair with his back to the wall. Cig- arettes and ashtray on the table next to his. St ANNE lights a Pall Mall and as if it's an after-thought he snaps the Sony on. 
[TAPE] .. "Just be careful now, coz I'm coming up." .. [Footsteps on cast iron stairs] "Is that you, John? .. Answer .. Now .. or I blow this fucken staircase to pie- ces." [Sound of someone breathing hard] 
BERLIN already looks devastated. He's about to got annihilated. 
"Me, Freddy." .. [Just the gale] "What the hell's going on up there, Brother? I been calling ton minutes." .. [Lungs heave for air) "Hey, c'mon, John, talk to me?" [Just the sound of breathless- ness] "Jesus Christ .. What are you do- ing? What the fuck are you doing? It's me - Holy shit - John - John - Not you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard! [2 shots] 
St ANNE clicks the Sony off & BERLIN is too stunned to breathe. 
St ANNE That's second degree - you wanna stop at that? Will you give me that, John? 
BERLIN gives him nothing but silence. A knock on the door "Come in." And the ASSISTANT hands St ANNE a note. Reads it and excus- es himself. Leaves the silence for BERLIN. But TAYLOR breaks it. 
TAYLOR He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it .. 
BERLIN He ain't offerin me shit. 
TAYLOR lights a cigarette and exhales. Something of a real red- headed fuck about him. And BERLIN would like to break his neck. 
You're letting it show, King Jay. 
TAYLOR I don't like you. But don't kid yourself .. I don't take no ple- asure sitting in on another cop .. 
He rolls ash off his cigarette and pushes it round the ashtray. 
Your an alcoholic, aren't you? (BERLIN stares) It's written in your file .. 
The phone rings and TAYLOR answers. Puts his red eyes at BERLIN. 
They want you to look in the mirror. 
BERLIN has to find every strength for this one. Humiliation com- pounds. Gets up and stares at his own haunted face in the glass. 
148:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. 
The MYOPIC peers into BERLIN's face. St ANNE stands close with his toilet roll. Light refracts in the MYOPIC's lenses "I seen him up there quite a lot." St ANNE blows his nose "Is that the man you saw that night?" He stares again at the tormented face. 
MYOPIC Well .. I dunno .. it could be? 
St ANNE Alright, thank you, Mr Dawson .. 
He's escorted to the door and his space is occupied by CITRINE. 
CITRINE What's all this "deal" business? 
St ANNE on his way to the door now. He pauses for the question.

PUMPKIN In the bag. 
Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase. 
PUMPKIN What's in that? 
JULES My boss' dirty laundry. 
PUMPKIN You boss makes you do his laundry? 
JULES When he wants it clean. 
PUMPKIN Sounds like a shit job. 
JULES Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing. 
PUMPKIN Open it up. 
Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase. 
JULES 'Fraid I can't do that. 
Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer. 
PUMPKIN I didn't hear you. 
JULES Yes, you did. 
This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong. 
HONEY BUNNY What's goin' on? 
PUMPKIN Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst. 
HONEY BUNNY Shoot 'em in the face! 
JULES I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me. 
PUMPKIN You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last. 
MANAGER (on the ground) Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here. 
JULES Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business! 
PUMPKIN I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One... 
PUMPKIN ...two... three. 
JULES You win. 
Jules raises his hand off the briefcase. 
JULES It's all yours, Ringo. 
PUMPKIN Open it. 
Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit. 
HONEY BUNNY What is it? What is it? 
PUMPKIN (softly) Is that what I think it is? 
Jules nods his head: "yes." 
PUMPKIN It's beautiful. 
Jules nods his head: "yes." 
HONEY BUNNY Goddammit, what is it? 
Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. 
Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin. 
Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction. 
HONEY BUNNY Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad! 
JULES (to Pumpkin) Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool! 
PUMPKIN Chill out, honey! 
HONEY BUNNY Let him go! 
JULES (softly) Tell her it's gonna be okay. 
PUMPKIN I'm gonna be okay. 
JULES Promise her. 
PUMPKIN I promise. 
JULES Tell her to chill. 
PUMPKIN Just chill out. 
JULES What's her name? 
PUMPKIN Yolanda. 
Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin.

BASIL EXPOSITION Peters! 
CAPTAIN PETERS Yes, sir? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Any word from Austin? 
CAPTAIN PETERS We've picked up his signal, but the lunar base seems to self-destructing. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (on microphone) Austin, if you can hear me, use the time portal! There's no time to get to the lunar module! Use the time portal! 
INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE 
Austin stumbles. Felicity looks at him. 
FELICITY Austin, you have to get to the time portal! 
AUSTIN Come with me, Felicity! It's the only way out! 
FELICITY Austin, will I fit in the Nineties? 
AUSTIN If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby! 
The TIME PORTAL is fifty feet away. Austin and Felicity run towards it. In the foreground, are a stack of conveniently placed barrels. As they run behind the barrels, an obvious AUSTIN STUNT DOUBLE and an obvious FELICITY STUNT DOUBLE emerge in their place. 
The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic flips and stunts. 
The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place and run through the TIME PORTAL. The TIME PORTAL reads "1999". 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - 1999 - DAY 
It is the most up-to-date modern apartment you've ever seen in your life. There is a large screen TV, a DVD player etc. 
Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other accouterments of moving. Felicity puts a CD on an old style turntable. 
SFX: SCREEEECH!! 
FELICITY Sorry! 
AUSTIN Don't worry baby it takes some getting used to. Let me ask you Felicity, do you feel any side effects from the time travel? 
Felicity smiles broadly, revealing that she now has TERRIBLE TEETH like Austin's. 
FELICITY I'm as healthy as a horse. 
AUSTIN I love you, Felicity. 
FELICITY And I love you. 
AUSTIN Do you want to get married? 
FELICITY Absolutely not. 
AUSTIN Thank God. 
They kiss. 
FADE TO BLACK.

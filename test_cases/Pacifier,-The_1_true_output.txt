Bill and Julie, looking jet-lagged, sit across a desk from a SWISS BANKER. He seems to be about 100 years old. He's reading a HUGE stack of paperwork with a magnifying glass, mouthing along in FRENCH. It's taking him a LONG time. They wait patiently -- til their patience runs out. 
BILL As we discussed, this is an urgent matter. 
The Banker puts up a finger to "shush" him. Then looks back to the paperwork, then licks his finger to turn the page. He licks his finger again, but can't get the page to turn. 
He feebly gets up, and shuffles across the room to a WATER COOLER. He fills a paper cup with water and shuffles back to his desk. He dips his finger in the water to turn the page. 
JULIE Can't you call somebody? Do something to get us around all this paperwork? 
BILL Sorry. Not in Switzerland, I can't. 
Bill can't stand it anymore. He jumps to his feet. 
BILL (CONT'D) This is absurd. If we can't get some faster service, we're going to have to file a complaint. 
The Banker looks at him blankly. 
BANKER Marcel! 
Another Banker, MARCEL, enters. 
MARCEL Oui. 
BANKER Je ne comprende pas. 
MARCEL (to Bill and Julie:) I'm so sorry, the chief does not speak English. But I can tell you -- you will have access to the box tout-suite. As soon as your background checks clear. 
JULIE Thank you. How long is that? 
INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Helga, suitcases in hand, heads to the door -- Shane tries to block her path. Peter's in the aquarium. The duck flies around, QUACKING. 
HELGA AGGH!     These brats!   Sugi Pula! 
SHANE Red Leader, remain calm -- 
HELGA I am calm. I QUIT, that makes me calm! 
SHANE Let's not be hasty. 
Suddenly, RING! Amid the chaos, Shane moves for the phone. Helga takes the opening and runs for the door. He grabs her suitcase. As she tries to wrestle it away, Shane picks up the receiver. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Hello--- (sees Helga crawling away) Don't even think about it. 
The suitcase handle breaks off, and Helga dashes for the door. Shane dives, grabbing her foot. He DRAGS her back. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Ah, Mrs. Plummer. (covering the phone, so Julie can't hear the struggle) No no -- everything's fine. You're gonna be gone how much longer? 
here's a pause, the camera DOLLY/ZOOMS as he says it: 
SHANE (CONT'D) Five business days? 
elga's shoe comes off -- Helga falls forwards, and Shane falls back, against the counter. 
SHANE (CONT'D) That is not a problem. Just doing my... 
He picks up his hand, that landed on a diaper. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Duty. 
Helga's at the door. Shane body-checks it closed. Helga struggles to get him off. CRUNCH. Helga chomps down on Shane's hand... 
SHANE (CONT'D) Ah! Things are GREAT!!! You do what you have to do. 
Shane lets go. Helga scampers out the door. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Take care, Mrs. Plummer. 
Shane hangs up the phone, as Helga makes a dash down the path to a waiting cab. 
EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Shane chases Helga to the cab. 
SHANE Red Leader! I command you to come back! That is a direct order! You can't leave a man behind!! 
Helga jumps in the cab. 
SHANE (CONT'D) (SCREAMING) I don't know the Peter Panda song!! 
As the cab pulls away, in the rear window, Helga glares back, then does an obscene Romanian hand gesture.

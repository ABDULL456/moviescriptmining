MARCUS Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him? 
MORRISON Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret. 
LISA makes a connection, we hear CONNOR'S VOICE, the same one we heard on the car radio. 
CONNOR'S VOICE --hello-- standing by-- 
LISA Sir, we can hear you, sir, working on a visual, sir... 
INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY 
MARCUS' FACE pops to life on a VIDEO MONITOR. We're in a Spartan, windowless space, it feels like it's underground. 
CONNOR Not what I expected... 
JOHN CONNOR leans INTO FRAME, studies the screen. He wears a dark sweater, nothing like a uniform. Connor is 40ish now, but looks older, prematurely grey, years of war have taken a toll. There's an ever-present sadness in his eyes. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT.   OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY 
MARCUS listens to the disembodied VOICE, unimpressed.    The OTHERS almost stand at attention. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CONNOR'S VOICE It does seem lifelike-- is the face able to mimic emotions--? 
MARCUS rolls his eyes, makes an angry FACE at the CAMERA. 
MARCUS This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me? 
CONNOR (STUNNED) I-- I need to know what you are. 
MARCUS So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit-- maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go. 
CONNOR This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet. Unless... were you sent here from the future? 
MARCUS (very confused) What? 
CONNOR Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions. (SADLY) I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins... 
Marcus takes this in for a sober moment. 
MARCUS You're out of your mind, aren't you? 
This earns outraged glares from the others, but Blair stifles a smile. Barnes moves to strike him, Morrison stops him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CONNOR'S VOICE Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand by for further instructions. 
The CONNECTION goes dead. 
INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY 
Densely marked MAPS on a CONFERENCE TABLE. CONNOR is now flanked by a couple of SENIOR ADVISORS, older military men-- along with KATE BREWSTER, late 30s, now his wife-- and visibly PREGNANT. She's poring over FAXES of the X-RAY IMAGES. (Like Connor, all military personnel here favor casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.) 
KATE He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton. 
CONNOR Besides, the first T-800s won't be manufactured until `26. 
ADVISOR #1 Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment. 
ADVISOR #2 Let's hope. If there are more out there like him, we're in serious trouble. Christ, a terminator with attitude... 
KATE Where did they find him? 
ADVISOR #1 East-central Texas, near an area of heavy Skynet concentration. The outpost where they're holding him is reasonably secure, but it's not much more than a commune. 
CONNOR I want him extracted. 
ADVISOR #1 Done.   What then? 
CONNOR picks up the FAXES, disturbed by them. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CONNOR Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull, crack his CPU at all costs. 
THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X- rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against her pregnant belly.

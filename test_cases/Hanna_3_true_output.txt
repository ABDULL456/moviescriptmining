42 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT 42 
The HEAD OF OPS waves TWO SPECIAL OPERATIVES forward. The rest of the forces surround the cabin, but at a distance. The two men approach the cabin. One opens the door and the other steps in. Then the first follows close behind. Both are engulfed by darkness. The rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal. The HEAD of SPECIAL OPS looses patience and picks up the radio. 
HEAD OF OPS McCullum? Do you read me? No response. 
HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D) I repeat, do you read me? The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the cabin. Guns at the ready. The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin. 
43 INT. CABIN DINING AREA. 43 
Through night vision we see the cabin interior. Then the two SPECIAL FORCES, dead on the floor. Necks broken. Then find HANNA sitting quietly, looking timid and unsure. Just a little girl, her eyes shining in the dark. 
44 INT. LANGLEY. VIRGINIA. 44 
MARISSA is walking through long concrete corridor as her phone rings. She answers quickly. 
MARISSA What is it? 
LEWIS (O.S.) Ma'am, this is Lewis. MARISSA affects a âbusiness as usualâ tone. 
MARISSA Go ahead. 
LEWIS (V.O.) The target escaped. 
MARISSA How did that happen? 
LEWIS (V.O.) We're thinking maybe he got away in the snow, in the thick snow, or... But he's in the wind and I have two men down. 
MARISSA 
(URGENT) Find him, Lewis. Find him and take him out. 
LEWIS Ma'am. There's more. They found a child, his daughter. MARISSA turns pale.

46 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL. 46 
HANNA lies on the cot. She's been cleaned up and is wearing an army regulation jump suit. The metal door drags open. A Doctor, BURTON, closes the door behind him. He walks up to 
HANNA. 
BURTON Hello Hanna. Hanna lies motionless. 
BURTON (CONT'D) My name is Dr. Burton. Would you like to talk to me? BURTON'S voice has been trained to engender a state of peace and security. HANNA sits up and hangs her legs off the side of the cot. 
HANNA I was told by my father to gain the upper hand. 
BURTON Really. Interesting. What else did your father tell you? 
HANNA Where am I? 
BURTON You're in holding. 
HANNA I see.

PLUMED DWARF Good of you, mate. 
BOY (to Merrick) Good luck. 
MERRICK But... but... 
BOY I'll be alright. 
The small band moves away through the wagons. The boy watches the lantern light receding in the darkness. He turns and looks to the wagon, the poster of the Elephant Man, and the dying fire. He moves to the fire quickly collecting a few blankets and belongings. Then taking one last look at the garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into the darkness. 
CUT TO: 
WOODS - NIGHT 
We see the beams of the lanterns moving through the trees like will-o-the-wisps. 
They help Merrick along, the plumed Dwarf directing them from time to time. As they move along we see them pass a small still pond. 
CUT TO: 
DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
The intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road. They go around the corner and before them stands a small train station, a train sitting amongst the steam by a platform. The freaks stop just outside the light of the station and the plumed Dwarf's instruction get Merrick into his disguise. The female pinhead, who has carried his stick, hands it to Merrick, squeezing his hand. 
MERRICK Thank you, my friends. 
The plumed Dwarf relays the message and the freaks respond to Merrick in their language. 
PLUMED DWARF I'll go in with you, you'll need a ticket. 
He turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle through their pockets and produce some coins. Then he and Merrick walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving. 
ON THE PLATFORM 
The train is about to leave. At a barrier two ticket collectors are taking tickets of a few last-minute passengers, who hurry off. 
The Plumed Dwarf and Merrick appear and walk to the barrier. The Plumed Dwarf hands over the ticket. 
PLUMED DWARF I'm just going to help my friend on board. 
They walk off down the platform. The collectors stare after them. 
The Plumed Dwarf, his arm around Merrick, is helping him down the platform, as fast as possible, his ark trailing behind him. As they pass the windows of the first-class carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome people on their plush seats. 
The Plumed Dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the door. 
PLUMED DWARF This'll do. 
He looks down the platform. The Ticket Collectors are watching them with great interest. 
Merrick climbs laboriously aboard. 
The other people on board see Merrick, react, and move away from him as far as they can in the cramped, 3rd class carriage. 
The Plumed Dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people with contempt. 
PLUMED DWARF I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had. 
MERRICK Oh no, my friend... 
PLUMED DWARF Say hello to London for me. I miss her. 
MERRICK Oh, yes. 
PLUMED DWARF You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction. 
He grins. The whistle blows and the train slowly begins to move off. The Plumed Dwarf still holding the door open, walks along with it. 
PLUMED DWARF Luck, my friend, luck. Who needs it more than we? 
Merrick nods "yes", and holds out his hand. The train is moving a little faster. The Plumed Dwarf grabs his hand and they shake. 
He shuts the door. As the carriage passes, Merrick's mask is pressed up against the window. The Plumed Dwarf waves to him as the train moves away. 
He looks at the train for a moment, then walks back down the platform. 
THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - INTERIOR 
Merrick is in the corner, facing into the carriage. He looks slowly around. 
The other passengers have moved away, forming almost a moat of space around him. We see the whole carriage now; the cowering people and Merrick at the far end. Seeing their silent, horrified stares, he moves to the opposite seat, facing the back wall. Merrick looks around for a moment, then sees his reflection in the window. He stares at himself. 
THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE 
The carriage is dark now, and empty except for Merrick. He looks out the window at a sign above a station platform that says "Oostende", and at the few people still walking about. 
OOSTENDE STATION PLATFORM (NIGHT) 
We see the side of the carriage. Merrick, inside the darkened car, is not visible. A CONDUCTOR walks to the end of the carriage and turns a valve. He opens the door to Merrick's compartment. 
CONDUCTOR I'm sorry, you'll have to leave now. 
Merrick is motionless, reluctant to leave the security of the darkness.

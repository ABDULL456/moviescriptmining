LUCINNIUS Of course. 
HECTOR This is the worst it's been. 
37   EXT. COURTYARD - DAY                                           37 
Hector is in   the inner courtyard of the house, beside the kitchen. He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that he lost. Today there is an air of distraction about Hector. Understandable, considering his scheduled death. The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk. 
HECTOR But even if it's round you can still fall off the edge. Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make his point. GALLUS No... it's not round like that... it's round like this. Gallus sees his playball.     He picks it up. 
HECTOR Do you believe everything that Greek tells you...? 
Gallus ignores this tease, intent on the ball. GALLUS Rome must be right in the middle... here... and we must be out here somewhere... Hector becomes more interested.

37   CONTINUED:                                                37 HECTOR So, where is my home? 
GALLUS How many months did they march you here? 
HECTOR Seven. Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers,      * as if there is serious calculation.                            * GALLUS It must be about here.                            * 
His fingers stop on the other side of the ball. GALLUS But then you'd be upside down... HECTOR I wasn't upside down... and how                   * could you see the sun round there ... I saw the sun at home... every day... Gallus is stumped for answers.                                 * 
GALLUS I'll ask him tomorrow...                          * Hector remembers that he and the boy's father are              * supposed to die that night. He looks on Gallus with a          * new tenderness. HECTOR Yes, tell me tomorrow... I'd like to know... because my children are round there and I want to know that they're getting the sun... ask him something else, too... where are the gods if the whole thing is round? 
GALLUS I think I know that... they're out here, and all around... that's how they can look down and see everything... 
38   INT. ALTAR - NIGHT                                        38 Lucinnius is at it again. In the lamplight, a live chicken stands on the altar. (CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:                                                   38 Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended on it. Perhaps they do. 
LUCINNIUS If he eats the grain it means yes. 
He scatters some grain on the table.     The chicken at once begins to peck them up. HECTOR It's saying yes... there's a way... 
LUCINNIUS No, it's saying yes, we should die. 
HECTOR But you asked it if we had to die, or if there was another way... it's saying yes, there is... LUCINNIUS No, it's saying yes, we should die. The bird is certainly enjoying his food. HECTOR Maybe it's just hungry... The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be. 39   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                     39 A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also there, serving her mistress. Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what. She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook from the kitchen. DALMIA Solus! 
The kitchen slave quickly appears. DALMIA Solus... I'm eating chicken again. I ate chicken yesterday and the day before... will I be eating chicken again tomorrow? Why am I always eating chicken? 
(CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                                  39 SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and Hector, but they offer him no help. 
SOLUS It's what we have to hand in the kitchen, ma'am... I always try to use the fresh stuff... the chickens have just been turning up... He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she was before. 
A SLAVE interrupts them. 
SLAVE Two men have come to see you. From Cyprian. Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a moment of hope. They might be coming with good news, perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart. 
40   INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT                                 40 The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of the godfather's foot soldiers. They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that they would break his back at the whim of their master. VISITOR Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian asked us if we could be of any                      * assistance... in the business that you have to conduct tonight... to make that business as...                            * comfortable... as you could wish... Lucinnius sighs, as his last hope expires.

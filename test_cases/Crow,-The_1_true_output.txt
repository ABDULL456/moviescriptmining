ERIC (O.S.) They couldn't do anything for me. 
ALBRECHT (O.S.) How 'bout the morgue? 
ERIC (O.S.) No.  I have one more thing to do. 
EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT 
Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted. 
ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING 
ALBRECHT You're gonna kill somebody else. (beat; no response) We're gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids? 
Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious. His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a lot out of him.  He needs to recharge. 
ERIC I have to prepare for an anniversary.  This coming night. 
HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY 
High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit. 
INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY 
The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens, one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other scattered research and inconcubula. 
ANGLE - GRANGE 
Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk, he DRAWS BACK. 
GRANGE What... the hell is that? 
LAO (calmly) This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real. 
NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE 
Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in his hands.  The killing blade is nearby. 
GRANGE That thing is poisonous. 
LAO Extremely so. (beat) You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow. 
Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra. 
GRANGE Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko... 
LAO I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury. GRANGE Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet. 
Lao chuckles indulgently. 
LAO Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course. 
GRANGE Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip. 
LAO Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his. 
GRANGE Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary... 
ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body. He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes like a dark pimento. 
LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT. Off Grange's stunned expression. 
LAO (CONT'D) ...all the dying tonight will be done by the former Eric Draven. 
Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all. 
LAO (CONT'D) Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me. 
GRANGE Kill a dead guy? 
Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased. 
LAO Truly kill him.  So I may crush his skull and smoke it. 
Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it. 
LAO (CONT'D) Let it suffice that I need him... and to get to him, we'll need his little friend. 
Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 
INT. LOFT - DAY 
Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques, photos of himself and Shelly.

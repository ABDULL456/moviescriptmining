love. I'm not some hired fuckin' gun who is out to make her life miserable. While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror; his gaze never leaves it. 
FRANK'S POV - BLACK TOYOTA appears in the rearview mirror. BACK TO SCENE TONY I do things the way she likes. Her happiness is everything to me. 
Frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror. FRANK No problem. I'd like to know how you handle things, Tony. TONY I handle things fine, Frank. You watch me and you'll learn something. FRANK (to Henry) Turn left. HENRY Is that him? Frank shakes his head, he's not sure.   Tony reacts. TONY Hey, what's going on? FRANK Shortcut. FRANK'S POV - TOYOTA IN REARVIEW MIRROR As the limo turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn. ANGLE - FRANK whispers to Henry. FRANK Slow down, very slow. HENRY You want me to do a one-eighty? 
FRANK No, just slow down. The car slows. ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACK 
They look up from some papers. SPECTOR Why are we stopping?    Are we here? Behind them, THROUGH the rear window, the 4 X 4 can be seen. Sensing something, it makes a sudden TIRE- SCREECHING left turn, disappearing behind them. 
41   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  41 The limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a large fence. 
42   INT. LIMO - DAY                                           42 Frank speaks to Henry. FRANK Stop here... Take them to the house. Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn and work area. ANGLE - TONY, RACHEL AND SPECTOR As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across the property. TONY What's with him? 
43   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  43 As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to accelerate. As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end of the property. Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation. CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off. 
A retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road to the slope. Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath, Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road. The 4 X 4 ROARS PAST just   missing him and turns a corner. Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs into a crouched upright position. But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone. 
44   INT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  44 The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws, install electrical  wiring, test alarms. As Frank watches over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a SURV KIT communications  system. FRANK Keep this loose. Fletcher comes to take a look too.   He peers up at Frank, expectantly. FLETCHER Tell me about the car? FRANK Toyota.     Black. FLETCHER Four wheel drive? Late model? Frank nods.   Fletcher looks pleased. FRANK One snag though. Fletcher's face falls. FLETCHER What? FRANK 360,000 of them in Los Angeles.    I checked. Nice work, though. FLETCHER (shrugging) Well, nobody's perfect, Frank. Are they? (gesturing to the SURV KIT) Can I try that? 
45   EXT. MARRON ESTATE POOLSIDE - DAY                          45 Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a Walkman. 
There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells toward the house. RACHEL Shut up you assholes!

DUSSANDER Milk. 
Dussander disappears into the kitchen.  Todd stands alone in the living room. 
He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has been putting up for Dussander.  He knows he has crossed into dangerous territory from which there is no going back.  But after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear him in the kitchen.

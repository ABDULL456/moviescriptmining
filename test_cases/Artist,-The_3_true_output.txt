A little later in the night, still at the controls, the man is fighting not to fall asleep. Behind him, the women is sleeping, the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and bursts into laughter.

From the moment they parked the car onwards, we become absorbed by what's happening around the screening of end of this film. 
Behind the screen, we've seen the actor who plays the hero - his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions of the audience. He was standing close to his dog, motioning to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack. 
In the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely the producer.

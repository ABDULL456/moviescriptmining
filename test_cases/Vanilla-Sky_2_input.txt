EXT. CLUB STREET/SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing. 
HIS MIND Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height. David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car, unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he manages to run further. David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out, mouth agape. The empty street visible in the b.g., his hand loosens its grip on the mask. 
FADE TO BLACK 
WOMAN'S VOICE Open your eyes... open your eyes... 
EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT -- EARLY MORNING 
David is passed out, the mask is still clutched in his hand. A Butterfly crosses frame. A hand enters, resting on his shoulder. 
WOMAN'S VOICE This is a cheap ploy for sympathy. David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie Gianni. 
JULIANNA Boo! He recoils. His vision sharpens. In the morning shadows, with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia. 
DAVID No, I'm okay - 
DAVID POV Sofia examines him with a look of concern and understanding. Everything takes on a clear and sharp focus. Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky. 
SOFIA And it worked. Get up. 
DAVID Ugh - 
SOFIA (helping him up) That's right. I agree. Ugh. 
DAVID This is a joke. 
SOFIA (touches his cheek) David. I'm not going to lie to you. I liked the way you looked. But if you don't pull it together, I'll forget the other guy. You know that. other guy - YOU? 
DAVID (groggy) I'm still that guy. I'm still that guy. Sofia speaks with rapid-fire conviction, as if she might change her mind if she thought about it too much. 
SOFIA I don't. have a mother-savior bone in my body. It's not about that. You're coming inside. But if this 
turns out to be a big mistake, I do have the ability to fall out of love with you - (snaps fingers) - like that. She helps him up. 
DAVID I am still that guy. 
SOFIA Shut up. 
DAVID   (V.0.) We created our own world together. Us vs. Them - 
DAVID Where's Brian? 
SOFIA He went with you, didn't he? 
DAVID (shaking head at his own paranoia) I thought you guys hooked up. She stops in profile with him. She's astonished at his jealousy. Then: 
SOFIA (raw truth) I wish you hadn't gotten in the car with that girl. 
DAVID (a long apology is coming) Sofia... I'm... She covers his mouth, nose and face. Only his eyes remain. 
SOFIA Your eyes apologized better. Come on. Portrait of the two, her leading him to the door, the crisp glycerine morning overhead. 
SOFIA Holy God, this is going to change my life in a zillion different ways... I must be nuts. 
DAVID   (V.0.) - and we were quite a pair.   Her believing in me. Me believing that I deserved it. We hear the sound of voices, human voices howling like dogs.

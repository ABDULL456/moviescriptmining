LIVING ROOM There's nobody. They go into the kitchen KITCHEN. Nobody. The look under the kitchen table, in the pantry. Nobody. 
DOCTOR: Rudi? Where are you? Again the STAIRWELL. The doctor doesn't know whether to be angry or to laugh about the whole matter. He goes to his wardrobe to take his off his jacket. Because of the sling, Xenia has to help him. That's when she notices the toilet. She tells her father with a smile. As Xenia hangs up the doctor's jacket, he goes to the toilet door and tries to open it. It's locked. The Doctor stops in front of it. DOCTOR (quiet): Hello, Rudi. Don't you want to say hello to your father? No? PAUSE: I heard you even wanted to visit me at the hospital. And now you lock yourself in? PAUSE. The doctor looks shortly at Xenia who's carrying the luggage upstairs. Then he keeps on talking to Rudolph: All right. Then, I don't want to see you either. I'm going away now. You can stay in the toilet, if you want. He goes down the few steps to the entrance, waits a moment and then leaves the house. 
39. PROPERTY THE DOCTOR'S EXT/DAY BACK TO THE scene. 
The doctor steps out of the door, and wanders through the garden. He goes over to the trees, where the wire had been strung. He examines the traces of the wire on the bark. He lights a cigar, then looks out at the mowed fields. After a while Xenia comes over to him. He glances at her, then again at the fields. Both remain silent. After a while XENIA   says:  Everything  is   ready  in   your practice.   Mrs.   Wagner  prepared   everything yesterday. 
PAUSE then 
DOCTOR: Why do you tell me that? 
Xenia looks at him, surprised, shrugs her shoulders. XENIA: I don't know. I just thought you might want to know. PAUSE. DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you? XENIA: Yes. PAUSE. The doctor turns to Xenia: DOCTOR: How old are you now? XENIA: Fourteen. The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes his head. Again he looks out on the fields. After a while he says: DOCTOR: It's amazing how much you look like your mother. Xenia remains silent. Suddenly she whispers: 
XENIA: Dad.

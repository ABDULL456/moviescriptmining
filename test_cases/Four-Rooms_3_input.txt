DISSOLVE TO: 
HOURS LATER 
Athena reads from a huge leatherbound book, The Book of Shadows, full of potions and spells. Four discouraged witches pack their bags. The room has been restored to its worldly under-splendor. Kiva uses the remote on the TV... so much for witchcraft. The slab of rock remains a slab. 
ATHENA I don't understand what went wrong. 
ELSPETH I say Eva pulled one over on us. 
EVA What? 
JEZEBEL Honey -- Eva was wearing the face of someone just fucked good... and the best actress in this world, or any other, can't fake a thing like that! 
ELSPETH Exactly -- if she was fucked so good, how could she save his come? 
RAVEN It could be done... 
ATHENA Girls, knock it off. (she looks up from the book) Maybe... maybe it needed to be the sperm of a virgin male. 
EVA (dreamily) He was no virgin! 
The witches sadly collect their things. Athena, deep in thought, strokes the slab. 
ATHENA Let's leave her here, with the sword, until dawn. I will come back for her before checkout time. I just... feel too sad to carry her away before the sun comes up to warm her. 
They all agree. They pick up their bags and head out. 
JEZEBEL (cuddling her cat) I can't believe we have to carry our own bags out! My mama would have a hissy fit! 
KIVA (flirtatiously) I'll carry your bags. 
ELSPETH (firmly) You're carrying my bags! 
They leave the room. Jezebel's cat leaps from her arms as she hoists her luggage. Eva walks out satisfied, thought perhaps a little sore -- "ouch," she says, and smiles. Athena takes one last look at their goddess slab. 
ATHENA Next year, we try again -- with virgin sperm. 
She closes the door on the Honeymoon Suite (till next New Year's Eve!). 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FOUR ROOMS 
FADE UP ON: 
INT. MON SIGNOR LOBBY--NIGHT 
Ted behind the desk, on the phone. We only hear his side. 
TED Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? Do you want milk and cookies, or do you not? (pause) I can't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents. (pause, he checks his computer) That's not what the machine tells me. (pause) You be good and you'll get milk and cookies, but for now leave me alone, please. I'll be up later to put you both to sleep. 
He hangs up. 
TED (to himself) Goddamn kids. 
SUPER: 1:00 a.m. 
The phone rings again. 
TED Room Service. 
INT. ROOM 404--NIGHT 
A small party is going on. A long-haired Yuppie Scum type in on the line. Music BLARES. People dance in background. 
YUPPIE SCUM What room am I in? 
INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT 
BACK AND FORTH 
TED This is the front desk, sir. 
The Yuppie turns away from the phone and speaks to Real Theodore. 
YUPPIE SCUM What room are we in? 
REAL THEODORE How should I know? I just got here. 
YUPPIE SCUM (into phone) You know, don't you have one of those light things?

BREN (sensing tension) Why don't you girls go upstairs for a while? I think Mac's gonna blow. 
Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs. 
MAC Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault? 
BREN I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out. 
MAC I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop. 
BREN You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope. 
MAC (conspiratorially) Did you see it coming when she sat us down here? 
BREN Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs. 
MAC That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him. 
BREN Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea. 
Mac shrugs in agreement. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - DAY 
Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING'S HANDS preparing the house for Juno's arrival -- 
Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS. 
Straightening a FRAMED PHOTO of the Lorings. 
Dusting off a table with one of those WETNAPS for furniture. 
Lining up a shelf of BOOKS. 
EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - DAY 
The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb. 
EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY 
Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them. 
VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in her early thirties. Very Banana Republic. 
VANESSA Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa. 
JUNO Vanessa, right? 
MAC Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home. 
VANESSA Oh no. Thank you. Come on in. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home. 
VANESSA Can I take your coats? 
JUNO Sure. 
She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench. 
JUNO Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know? 
VANESSA You found us in the Penny Saver? 
MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly attractive guy in his mid-thirties.

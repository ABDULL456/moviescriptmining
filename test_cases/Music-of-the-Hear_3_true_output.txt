JANET I took this off a second-grader this morning. I'll help you Roberta -- but I can't hold your hand here. 
Janet starts to walk away, then turns. 
JANET A word of advice? When you're picking up your students, go to Alice's classroom first. 
Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
The nine children hold their violins in position as Roberta addresses them. 
ROBERTA So pretend you're driving a car and I'm the policeman and I say STOP! Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat palm. Now you be policemen, but turn your hand and make it say stop to yourself. 
ON THE CHILDREN, attempting this. She walks around and helps. 
DE SEAN (to himself) You're under arrest. 
Some kids crack up and start joking and chatting. 
ROBERTA Knock it off, De Sean! (to all) If you kids can't take this seriously, I don't want you here. I'm teaching you a difficult instrument because I respect you and have faith that you can learn it. But none of that matters if you don't have respect for yourself. 
Some of the children think about what she's saying. A couple, uncomfortable with the intensity, hold back giggles. 
ROBERTA Now turn your wrist so it's flat against the fingerboard, and that's how you'll set up your hand... 
Roberta sees Guadalupe struggling. 
ROBERTA Guadalupe! You've got the violin in the wrong hand! How did that happen? 
Embarrassed, Guadalupe corrects her position. 
INT. BRIAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
At the small kitchen table, Nick does homework and Lexi puts stickers in a sticker book. Roberta's cooking dinner; she grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the oven. The PHONE RINGS and she answers it. 
ROBERTA Hello? 
CHARLES (O.S.) Hello, Bobbi. 
Her face falls as she hears the voice. She holds onto the counter to steady herself. 
ROBERTA Where are you? 
CHARLES (O.S.) (calm, detached) I'm back in the States. I'm at my parents. 
Roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage. 
ROBERTA Are you still with her? 
A beat. 
CHARLES (O.S.) No. 
We watch Roberta's body collapse into a sense of overwhelming relief. FOLLOW HER as she steps into THE HALLWAY, then stretches the phone into: 
INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
She half-closes the door, leans against the sink and starts to cry. 
ROBERTA (through tears) We've missed you so much, Charles. The boys... they can't wait for you to come home... I know we'll have a lot to work out and it won't be easy right away, but we're gonna get through this, you know? We're a family and we belong together and -- 
CHARLES (O.S.) (more emotive than before) Bobbi -- stop, O.K.? Just stop. 
Roberta looks as if she's been slapped. A beat. 
CHARLES (O.S.) I want a divorce. 
ROBERTA What? 
Silence. 
ROBERTA But you said... you and Lana... you said it was over. 
CHARLES (O.S.) It is. (beat) It's over between us too, Bobbi. 
HOLD ON ROBERTA, devastated. ANGLE on NICK, watching her through the door. 
INT. BRIAN'S HOTEL ROOM, TEXAS - NIGHT 
Brian's on the phone with Roberta. He's in a t-shirt and sweats, and his papers are scattered on the bed. 
ROBERTA (O.S.) He wouldn't even talk about it! No explanations, no discussion... 
INTERCUT 
Roberta in Brian's living room. She's extremely agitated and her eyes are puffy from crying. 
BRIAN I can't believe you were still holding out hope. The guy hasn't called you or the kids in three months -- I thought you'd moved on.

LOS ANGELES - DAY \nThe whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and wake me up. \nEXT.  LAX - DAY \nThe traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly with stretch limousines. \nINT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY \nInside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit \nA planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears. \nThey get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER: \nREPORTER (to TV CAMERA) Eager to mend its tarnished image, Los Angeles has really put out the welcome mat for tomorrow's summit. The city promises quite a party as leaders from Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, the U.S. and others begin talks for the largest free-trade treaty in history. \nThe SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries arriving. \nThen, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city. \nREPORTER (VO) (continuing) The one sour note is North Korea, the only Pacific Rim country not participating. There are rumors of secret meetings with North Korean representatives, but U.S. officials insist the North must first hold democratic elections, and halt its nuclear weapons program -- as they claimed to have done back in 1995. \nWe CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL. \nThen ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ. \nThe SCENE returns to LAX. \nREPORTER (VO) (continuing) Tensions remain high since last year's skirmishes between North Korea and the U.S. So any chance of the communist North joining the Pacific Partners seems highly unlikely. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY \nAn exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nA Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought- iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean, next to the entranceway: \nConsulate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \nThe driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted windows and diplomatic license plates glides out. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nAn alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS. He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes. \nEXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY \nFrom atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place. \nHIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS \nas the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray. \nJaval takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to a van with a phone company logo on it. \nEXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY \nThe Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns into the heavy morning traffic. \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nIt is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis. \nThe DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun. \nA HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged Scandinavian GOVERNESS. \nSAM I can't stand it -- half an hour to get to the stupid school every morning... with no music... (Korean; subtitled) [Just our damn Nanny...] \nEXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY \nJaval's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nMIRANDA (hasn't heard a thing) Be right with you... \nAs Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them. \nCarson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington; Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina.\" \nINT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY \nMiranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes, is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter. \nCarson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast and a magazine article: \"American Expatriates in New Zealand.\" \nMIRANDA (looks him over) Have you gotten any sleep lately? \nCARSON (ignores the question) Shop's gonna tow the car in -- goddamn ignition's trashed. \nMIRANDA Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane. \nCarson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the rose bushes. \nCARSON You ask me, those suckers are a lost cause. \nShe continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading. \nMIRANDA It's not for you. \nCARSON You mean it's not for you. \nMIRANDA I don't chase car thieves in my underwear. C'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved. \nCARSON I'd die of shock, from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place. Even for what it's worth now. \nMIRANDA Lots of people bought at the top of the market... \nCARSON That sure cheers me right up. \nMIRANDA I don't know why we even talk about it. The city's not the problem. So we move. It wouldn't matter. What's that saying: \"Wherever you go, there you are.\" \nCarson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces from the cut in his side. \nMIRANDA (continuing) I hope you're current on your tetanus booster. Was it worth it? \nCARSON One cut... two assholes in the hospital... Yep. \nCarson glances at his watch and gets up. \nCARSON (continuing) Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people... \nHe grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229, 9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker. Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI. \nMIRANDA Ask for a transfer. \nCARSON They're not gonna transfer me. You know damn well why I was bumped down to guard duty... (as he's leaving) My outstanding people skills. \nMiranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she sadly watches him go. \nEXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY \nA look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus. \nHe then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street. He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket. \nThe parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM. \nCARSON I hate this fuckin' town. \nCarson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960. \nAs he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy bears on the other, and \"Arms Are For Hugging\" in between. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nThe Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside. \nMrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt SWEARING: \nANGRY VOICE (OS) Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a shit... \nTHEIR POV \nIn the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible. The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in the car with her schoolbooks in her lap. \nJOY \nturns to Mrs. Han: \nJOY Can we give Lisa a ride? \nINT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY \nIt pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes. \nLISA Hey, Joy... Sam... \nJoy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears. \nLISA (continuing) Excellent -- I can't hear him! \nUnder the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS. \nINT.  MERCEDES - DAY \nThe GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks. \nEXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY \nThe Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car. \nJittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun. \nHe SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium. \nThe Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of BURNING magnesium shrapnel. \nWIDER \nThe other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards. Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic. \nThe Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car. \nSam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs. Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away. Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down. \nHe turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it. \nHe spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action. \nJaval SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the entire front of his car burst into FLAMES. \nMrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors. \nJAVAL You see that I'm serious in my intention, yes? (she nods) If you cooperate, you and your children will be home for dinner tonight. \nHe tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nHe grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs. Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other handcuff to Lisa. \nJaval hops in his seat and drives away on Washington. \nEXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY \nSeveral people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground. \nHis hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nColonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out. ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house. \nINT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nRobbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate. Dave follows. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nAmbassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face. \nCOLONEL LEE (Korean; to Ambassador Han) [You must stay here.] \nAmbassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them: \nAMBASSADOR HAN Someone took my family! \nThe agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it. \nSABATINI You got no jurisdiction outside this property! \nColonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber pistol in her face as he's opening the car door. \nSABATINI (continuing) Shit! (to Ambassador Han) Yank his fuckin' leash! \nAMBASSADOR HAN My men are going! \nColonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost running Sabatini over. \nAMBASSADOR HAN (continuing; to Sabatini) It's a white telephone van, driving west on Washington Boulevard. \nThe agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government Dodge is blocking theirs. \nROBBINS Keys! \nDave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded. \nSABATINI You're ridin' shotgun. \nINT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nDave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION. \nROBBINS Cherry? \nDAVE Under the seat. \nSabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard. \nCarson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nHe still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic. \nHIS POV \nAs Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government- issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo. \nJAVAL \ngrins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas. \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nPissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nDriving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under the plastic tarp it's wrapped in. \nJoy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it. \nJaval pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a deafening round through the roof of the van. \nJAVAL I need to concentrate! \nEXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY \nDuring a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket... \nAround the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a vial of crack. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car. \nEXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY \nJaval turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a one-block lead on Carson and the others. \nThen, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nJaval hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up. \nAcross from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the same direction as Javal is driving. \nJaval slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and then quickly backs up into the garage. \nINT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nAs he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap- buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed. \nJaval reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED. \nThen, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly- constructed remotes: \nINT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY \nSteel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid. \nA set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine; \nEngage the transmission; \nAnd supply fuel to the carburetor. \nEXT.  ALLEYWAYS \nThe duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal. \nThe alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and the rear walls of buildings... \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCARSON (into radio) He's gonna wrap it around something! \nEXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY \nIndeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley. \nUp ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster. \nCARSON (OS) Oh, shit... \nThe duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES. \nNEW ANGLE \nCarson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van. Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick. \nColonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face. \nCOLONEL LEE You should not have interfered! \nCOLONEL LEE The hostages are citizens of the People's Republic of Korea -- \nCARSON -- Hey, do I go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job? \nWALTHER All right, you're outta here! Is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at Beverly Thrift? \nCarson glares coldly at Walther. \nCARSON I'll coordinate the drop. \nAMBASSADOR HAN Perhaps that is better. Inspector Carson knows the terrain -- \nCOLONEL LEE -- Then he can come with me. \nWalther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent. \nWALTHER (firm; to Carson) It's settled. \nCARSON It sucks. \nMIRANDA But it means we can get on with it. \nThe Americans leave the room. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY \nStill fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside. \nMIRANDA (sotto) Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther. If the Bureau had listened to Pete, Beverly Thrift never would've happened. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY \nHands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on. \nJaval flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.\" He suppresses a gleeful giggle. \nJAVAL That's more like it... \nHe checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills. He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves. \nEXT.  P\u00edY\u00b3NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY \nSUPER: P\u00edy\u00dangyang. Capitol of North Korea. \nPoster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling, gray, stifling, hopeless. \nINT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY \nIn the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly- decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS. \nSour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA sits up front and listens passively. \nAn ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out the door. \nEXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY \nCrouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer. \nOPERATIVE (into uplink device) ...They've got the Premier agreeing to the hard-line position -- \nHe hears footsteps approaching (OS). \nOPERATIVE (continuing; sotto) More to follow... \nHe angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING... \nAfter it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it into a false bottom in his attach\u00c8 case. He disappears just before a GUARD rounds the corner. \nEXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY \n\"Welcome Pacific Partners\" banners hang everywhere. \nWORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested. \nINT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nDave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes. \nDAVE I wanted to be home by now, take the kids to the rally in Boyle Heights. \nSABATINI We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now, L.A. was supposed to be a brown blotch in the rear-view mirror. \nShe's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags into two larger bags. \nRobbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife. \nHe puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him. \nMIRANDA He'll expect a homing device -- \nCARSON -- I expect him to expect it. He'll check the cash with an RF detector... (re larger transmitter) Meaning he'll find this one. (re smaller transmitter) This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect. (turns off receiver) And I doubt the asshole will have an X-ray machine or a metal detector. \nMIRANDA Why must you always refer generically to criminals as \"assholes?\" \nCARSON Gosh, you're right. It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation. \nMIRANDA You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again? \nCARSON (Cont'd) (checks watch) Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers at the Bowl. Have them clear the area of civilians. \nMIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) Remember, Pete... we're dealing with a customer with a lot of rage. \nCARSON (to himself) Must've bought a house same time we did. \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY \nRobbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland near Hollywood Blvd. \nElsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc. \nA BIKER CLUB \nof twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn from the Boulevard onto Highland. \nEXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY \nCarson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a sign atop it: \"Jesse Lasky Famous Players.\" \nINT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nStill disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a Summit-related concert is being readied. \nJaval watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying. \nINT.  MERCEDES - DAY \nColonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the pavement. Carson looks around. \nCARSON (into radio) There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here... So spread out. \nColonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs a left onto Highland, going back the way he came. \nINT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nDave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel, smacks his arm and points ahead: \nEXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY \nJaval's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above the bags of money. \nDAVE (into radio) Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream truck! \nEXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY \nSabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nJaval, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE. \nINT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY \nThe van pulls away. \nDave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving. He looks up... \nTwo of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement. \nDAVE Son of a bitch! (into radio) He found the bleepers -- both of them! \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCARSON (into radio) Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck. Which way's he heading? \nDAVE (VO) (thru radio) Toward the freeway. \nCarson hangs a U-turn. \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY \nAt the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101, Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp. \nSabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it. \nSuddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave. \nPeeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes. The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off... blocking Sabatini's way. \nJaval drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101 North on-ramp. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMiranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while anxiously clutching her two-way radio. \nMIRANDA (into radio) What happened? \nCARSON (VO) (thru radio) We're made! Gotta grab him! \nMIRANDA (beat; into radio) All right... Carefully... \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCarson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his AMD-74 machine gun. \nCARSON Watch it! We need him alive! \nas he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle, abandoned, lying on its side... \nAnd then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead. \nCarson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside. \nHIS POV \nThe casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is hanging through the broken window. \nCarson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below. \nCARSON (into radio) He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower! \nBut just as Carson is about to climb down the hose... \nEXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY \nJaval spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away. \nEXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY \nCarson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up. \nCARSON (into radio) Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo! \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY \nIn the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin. \nBehind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane. \nOn the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as they all try to catch up to Javal. \nThe helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill below Franklin. \nEXT.  VINE STREET - DAY \nJaval hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset. \nCarson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo. \nSuddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill. It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level. \nJaval FIRES at the copter with his Beretta. \nColonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo. \nCarson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness! \nINT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nColonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter. \nEXT.  VINE STREET - DAY \nEveryone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way. It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo. \nJaval tries to move away, but one of its landing runners SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself against the inside of the Geo's roof. \nSnared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it. \nINT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nThe wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere. \nThe Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading... \nEXT.  VINE STREET - DAY \nThe copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it. \nThe impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the bottom of the hill. \nINT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nJaval, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS. \nEXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY \nThe copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12 floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash. \nThe Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner. \nCLOSER \nFrom the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long. \nThe Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out. \nANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW \nIn the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse... anything to get away from the area below the impact. \nJAVAL \nreacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door. \nColonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow. Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones. \nCARSON South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen? \nColonel Lee pulls the phones away from him. \nCarson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand. \nCARSON (continuing; re hand) Shitcan that thing, will you?! \nShe looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a wastepaper basket. \nCARSON (continuing; to Colonel Lee) Got a digital scanner? \nCOLONEL LEE Analog. \nCARSON (looks equipment over) You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade. (into radio) Dave -- get in here. Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls. \nDAVE (VO) (thru radio) On my way... \nHe's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment. \nMIRANDA (to Colonel Lee) Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows. \nColonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone. \nCARSON (into phone) This is Carson in L.A. There's a set of prints coming over. Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and bombers first. We need an answer in fifteen minutes. \nEXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY \nFBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g. \nINT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY \nA TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high- resolution computer monitor. \nFINGERPRINT TECH (into phone) That yellow air out there finally rot your brain?! It's impossible! \nCARSON (VO) (thru phone) Dazzle me. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nCarson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number: \nCARSON (to Walther) We got one of the best sound guys right here in town... (into phone) Newman in Audio Analysis... \nDAVE (OS) Newman's gone. \nWIDER \nDave comes into the room. \nDAVE He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a bed and breakfast in Wyoming. \nCarson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone. \nDAVE (continuing; looks around) Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like to see the fight tonight. \nCARSON Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada. \nDAVE Enchilada -- you saying that because I'm Mexican? \nCARSON No... 'cause you're fat. \nMIRANDA (picks up Javal's fax) Photo enhancement... Isn't there some amazing tech with the LAPD -- \nDAVE -- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle PD a month ago. \nCARSON Jesus H. Christ... \nSABATINI I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA earn their keep. \nCARSON Do it. \nCarson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the dust on her fingertip. \nMIRANDA Given his behavior, this orange residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg. Amphetamines. \nCARSON Any significance? \nMIRANDA It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: A handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in. (beat) We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is. \nCARSON (to Sabatini) Get the Bureau on it. \nMIRANDA Forget it. It's a waste of manpower. \nCARSON Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now. \nSabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table. \nCARSON (continuing) He grabbed the family at 8:30. The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the Consulate at 9:30. \nMIRANDA That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb. \nCARSON He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive... (sotto; re Koreans) ...So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. I say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them. \nHe draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown, Hollywood to Inglewood. \nDAVE Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your average high-school student if they're so inclined. My guess is our perp used off-the-shelf equipment for everything except the C-4, and that's only slightly harder to get than crack or heroin, if you know who to ask. \nEXT.  PARKER CENTER - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY \nLAPD headquarters. \nINT.  PARKER CENTER - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY \nEveryone who can be spared, even moth-eaten SUPPORT PERSONNEL, hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars. \nEXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY \nFrom up here, it looks like the city is one big block party. Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant. \nBOBBI (VO) Please, L.A., I know we're about to have quite a party out there, but don't forget the Golden Rule on the roadways... News time is 3:59... \nINT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nBobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity. \nBOBBI This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky... back to you, Brent... \nThe red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot. \nBOBBI (continuing; furious) Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that entire segment! (as if to a child) Keep... the sun... to my left!! \nThe Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other. \nBOBBI (continuing) What's new on the kidnapping rumor? \nCAMERAMAN Nada. Total news blackout. \nBOBBI Go back over the hill. \nNEWS PILOT We got the valley traffic report in fifteen -- \nBOBBI -- \"Stalled vehicle! One lane closed! Sig alert..!\" I'll improvise! \nShe takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She takes a huge swig and grimaces. \nBOBBI (continuing; to Cameraman) What are you lookin' at? I was the morning anchor in Houston! And I'm one break away from getting out of this stupid fuckin' whirlybird! \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY \nThe Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy carefully turns to her mother. \nJOY Why us? \nMRS. HAN You heard him -- for money. \nJOY What if something goes wrong? \nMRS. HAN (firmly) It won't. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nCarson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair. \nCARSON I'm going to the kidnapping site. \nMIRANDA I want to talk to the witnesses. \nColonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him. \nCARSON Great, we'll hire a bus. \nThey leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand. \nDAVE (into phone) ...I know it's privileged information, goddammit! Lemme talk to a supervisor... You are a supervisor... Lemme talk to your goddamn supervisor... I told you, I'm with the FBI... (to Sabatini) Cellular company says he was using a phone with a cloned number. \nSABATINI Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of the numbers called on the account. \nDAVE That's what I'm trying to get. They're saying I need a subpoena. (into phone) Don't put me on hold... Don't... (pulls phone from his ear) I'm listening to Michael fuckin' Bolton! \nSABATINI Walther! Get on the horn to Justice and deal with this! \nEXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY \nSUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles. \nWe FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some Asian \"FISHERMEN\" crank in and stow their nets. \nINT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY \nComing closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow. \nTwo MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders... \nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY \nRobbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote- control boxes. He picks up his radio. \nROBBINS (into radio) A lot of the components are made by the same manufacturer -- a car security company. \nCARSON (VO) (thru radio) Jump a copter to the Consulate. See if the manufacturer sells to the public. Find out what shops use their stuff; put people on the phones with a description of the perp. \nEXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY \nGeneral Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the others leave the room before General Kai picks it up. \nINT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY \nBehind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY \nThe Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device. \nOPERATIVE (urgently; into device) ...Missile heading to L.A. has a Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is Kipchak equipped! It was switched by order of -- \nA GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the \"transmit\" button on the uplink device before dying. \nOn screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then another GUNSHOT destroys it. \nAngry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative over with his foot. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY \nMrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry. \nMRS. HAN He asked you if you had to go... \nThe family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level meters all begin to creep upward... \nEXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY \nA team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers -- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY \nThe SOUND is getting louder, and louder... \nJOY Oh, my God... \nThe meters are hovering just below the red... \nSAM \npivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest. \nHe begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing... \nHe moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with a small piece of the gum. \nAnd his meter drops to zero. \nWIDER \nSam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other... \nHe FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it. \nMeanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash... \nMrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half, and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy. \nJoy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO... \nAll three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light stops flashing. \nSam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory. \nINT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK \nThe clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President, still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw. \nPRESIDENT (thru video link) So what the hell does \"Kipchak\" mean? \nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER Uh, it's a code name... for weapons using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus... \nHe really doesn't want to be the one telling the President about this. \nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER (continuing) Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347 they attacked a Genoese fort, and catapulted infected corpses over the walls. The Genoese who survived carried the disease back to Europe... and it killed half the population. \nPRESIDENT (thru video link) Get to the goddamn point, Major. \nThe Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief. \nCIA CHIEF Seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the Pneumonic Plague. \nThe President goes nuts. \nPRESIDENT (thru video link) The Black Plague?! Every time I talk to you fuckin' guys it gets worse! What happened to this \"limited retaliation\" shit? \nSECRETARY OF STATE The North Koreans insist the missile carries a conventional payload. They say we're trying to trick them into aborting the attack. \nSECRETARY OF DEFENSE Especially since the uplink from our Op in P'y\u00dangyang was unencrypted. \nCIA CHIEF We think one of the Hard-liners switched the warhead without the Premier's knowledge. But he's not about to take our word for it, and he's too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down. \nPRESIDENT (incredulous; thru video link) They use a biological weapon on American soil, they have to know we'll respond! \nSECRETARY OF STATE Maybe they don't think we got the guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause they think they can whip us, like what happened in 'Nam. Look who we're dealing with: a teetering, outlaw regime, and inside it, some wild-ass renegades working their screwy agenda! \nCARSON Everyone shut up! (into phone) Guy on vacation, the Canadian -- \nINSTALLER #1 (VO) (thru speakerbox) -- Yeah, Javal... \nCARSON (into phone) Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes? \nINSTALLER #1 (VO) (thru speakerbox; laughs) Zombie Eyes! You know the man? \nCarson and Miranda look at each other. Bingo! \nCARSON (into phone) I need a full name, address, anything you got! \nINSTALLER #1 (VO) (thru speakerbox) Paul Javal... hang on, we'll look it up... This an immigration thing? Shit, he's our best installer. \nNEW ANGLE \nOne of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on Colonel Lee's desk, listens, then hits the hold button. \nESPIONAGE AGENT Inspector Carson, extension 666... \nCARSON That's appropriate... (to Dave) In 30 seconds you're gonna give me Paul Javal's shoe size. \nCarson hurries over, grabs the phone. We SEE him punch the button for x666. \nCARSON (continuing; into phone) Carson... \nEXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nEDWARDS (VO) Edwards, Sound Lab... \nINT.  FBI SOUND LAB - DAY \nEDWARDS, headphones around his neck, sits in front of a wall of audio analysis equipment. \nCARSON (VO) (thru phone) Whatta you got? \nEDWARDS (into phone) Ambient background sound is normal city stuff, but there's a distinct echo pattern. Your people are in or near a high-rise that's at least eight floors tall. And there are other high-rises nearby. \nCARSON (VO) (thru phone) How high up are they? \nEDWARDS (into phone) No way to extrapolate that from the sample you gave us. (refers to notes) One more thing: There's an emergency siren approaching at 17 seconds into the second call, passing the location at 33.5 seconds. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nCarson hangs up the phone. \nCARSON Okay -- high-rises in our search area. Eight stories or higher. \nMIRANDA Downtown, Century City, Westwood corridor, Museum Row, Mid- Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip there's a few... \nCARSON Sabatini! What about that billboard? \nSABATINI Nothing yet! Everyone's left their goddamn offices already! \nCARSON (to Robbins) LAPD will have a record of all emergency vehicles running Code 3 at 9:32 AM. Get their starting point and their destination. \nMIRANDA And have them narrow their foot- searches to areas around high-rises. \nCARSON (to Dave) Where's that fuckin' address?! \nDAVE I'm still holdin'! \nMeanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable. \nDAVE (continuing) He's on our hit parade. Interpol passed us his records when he entered the country. (reads) French by birth... looks like a total scumbag. \nSABATINI Isn't that redundant? \nDAVE (reads from computer) Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe; served some short stretches, petty shit... arrested for kidnapping, no conviction. Did four years in France for blowing bank vaults. Moved to U.S. last year. Clean since then. \nCARSON Get his Driver's License number; Social; bank accounts; charge cards; club memberships... find out what movies he rented.  Get whoever's closest to the Auto Shop to get in there, interview everybody. \nMIRANDA This sure was a ballsy move for a car-alarm installer. \nCARSON Hey, he watched the news... Everyone knows the U.S. will do anything to avoid trouble with a mad-dog country. \nThey turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard. \nMIRANDA Ambassador -- \nCARSON -- Quit apologizing for me! \nMIRANDA Quit giving me reasons to! \nAMBASSADOR HAN (to Carson) On occasion, my wife has been known to kick my ankle under the table. \nMiranda gives Carson a \"your turn to be gracious\" look. \nCARSON Sounds like her aim's a little low. \nNot exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a piece of paper. \nDAVE Address, according to the Auto Shop. \nCARSON (looks at paper) Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise! Sabatini -- you're with us. (off Robbins' disappointed look) She's got the field experience. \nCarson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops. \nSABATINI (pissed) 'She's got the field experience'... To park the fuckin' car! \nEXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY \nA boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties. \nINT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY \nCarson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel Lee rush into the lobby. \nCarson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d, but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is ajar... He pushes it open... \nAnd finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles. \nThree SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor. \nCARSON (pulls out his i.d.) Whoa... FBI..! \nThey lower their weapons. \nCARSON (continuing) How the hell you get here so fast? \nSWAT TEAM #1 They're shootin' a cop movie down the street. We're workin' as extras. \nCARSON Terrific. Who else is here? \nSWAT TEAM #1 Three officers on the roof, next building over, and two in the tenth- floor hallway. \nCARSON Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.

MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY \nSabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane. \nINT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY \nThe fire door opens next to an elevator with the number \"10\" on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out. \nCarson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing. \nHe moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly unlocks the door. \nINT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY \nThe shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark. \nAs Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN. \nThe first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer. \nWOMAN What the fuck..! \nHer friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and shows them her FBI shield. \nMIRANDA Sorry... \nCarson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot- wide, ornamental balcony. \nCARSON (to Miranda) Wait here. \nShe begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her. \nEXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY \nThe SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the curtains into the window of Javal's apartment. \nHe swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty... the balcony SLIPS a little... \nHe leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open. \nINT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCarson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline. \nCarson cautiously goes into the living room -- \nIt's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes, and three flower pots in macram\u00c8 ceiling hangers by the living room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them. \nCARSON (into radio) I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight while I look around. \nCarson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes. \nINT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY \nThe clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed. \nMIRANDA I like what you've done with the place... \nINT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY \nThe elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand. \nCARSON (into radio) Miranda..! \nMIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) I heard. I'm in the copter. \nCARSON (into radio) I want you to get out of here... \nINT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nMiranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is beyond nightmarish.

NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nSweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking. \nDAVE (into radio) I can't... My kids... \nMIRANDA (VO) (thru radio; calmly) Listen: the best way to help them is to stay at your computer. If any information comes in, holler. Okay? \nHe squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat: \nDAVE (into radio) Okay... \nEXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nSeveral large military helicopters approach -- troop contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin. \nThe big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES and ARMY INFANTRY. \nOthers, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries. \nEXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY \nPeople flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria. \nWe hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's. Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic... \nEveryone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones. \nThis is the mother of all rush hours. \nEXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY \nColonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English. \nHe swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads -- in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down. \nCarson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake. \nINT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY \nBobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps off her mic and yells at her Cameraman: \nBOBBI Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull back... show the other copters around us... this is fuckin' great... \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nAmbassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets. \nCARSON ...The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone. Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb. But what's in it for 'em? \nAMBASSADOR HAN There are men in my government whose power depends on North Korea staying as it is: Socialist, repressive, isolated from the world. They'll resort to anything, even war, to keep it that way. They have the Hitler Syndrome: if their country cannot exist the way they want it, they would rather see it destroyed. \nEXT.

And we need the bastard alive!! \nVREELAND (VO) (thru radio) We've got the situation in hand. \nINT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY \nColonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate. \nINT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nThe SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher. \nVreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel Lee, but there's no time... \nVREELAND (to Pilot) Shit! Pull back! \nEXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY \nColonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED. \nINT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nColonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers, angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them. \nEXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY \nThe windows on the Mercedes glide open.... \nCarson hurries to catch up to it... \nColonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents through the passenger's side. \nThe ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air. \nThe bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing a portion of it. \nColonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning wreckage. \nThe other drivers really give him wide berth now... \nEXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY \nApproaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north. \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nTraffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes. Carson catches up to it. \nDAVE (VO) (thru radio) ...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to arm, so stay tight on his ass. \nCarson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him. \nCARSON That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses you'd like to tell me about? \nAMBASSADOR HAN I don't think so -- they said it was solid as a rock. \nCARSON (looks at his crumpled car) No shit... \nAs Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through. \nCarson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel Lee STRAFES the Volvo. \nCarson looks up just in time to see... \nA pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder. \nCarson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck. \nThe Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat: \nAMBASSADOR HAN (dazed) I can't believe I'm still alive... \nCARSON This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be. \nAmbassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open. \nEXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY \nA red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out. \nCARSON Get me out of here... \nThey pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around. \nCARSON (continuing; into radio) Anybody see him? \nMIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) Still heading north on the 110. \nThe Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea... \nCARSON (into radio) Dave... You're sure those rockets are heat-seeking? \nDAVE (VO) (thru radio) Classic IR, reflective optical system. How come? \nCARSON (into radio) Just keep working your leads... \nCarson climbs into the back of the ambulance. \nINT.

Carson yanks him out of his ambulance. \nMIRANDA Sorry... \nINT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCarson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side.

She grabs Carson's arm. \nCarson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero. \nWIDER \nThe FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa into the rescue harness. She's terrified. \nCARSON You'll be over in five seconds... \nShe nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so his sister can go. \nANGLE ON BOMB \nOne minute... fifty-nine seconds... \nCARSON \nsends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs. Han into it... \nCARSON Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line. \nHe pushes her across.

Carson tries to free the hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing. \nFifteen seconds to go... \nCarson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away. \nCARSON (shouts) Release the cable from your side!

BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY \nQuick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.

Call the police. \nCARSON Yeah, right. \nHe races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad, its LCD reading \"ARMED.\" \nHe grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand. Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING. \nCARSON (continuing) Shit! \nMIRANDA \npulls the pillows over her head and sighs. \nMIRANDA Not again... \nEXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCarson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by the streetlight -- \nWhere two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop. \nCar-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard. \nAsshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a crowbar. His partner keeps working. \nNEW ANGLE \nAsshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice. \nCarson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS. \nSurprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS. \nAs he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out. \nCarson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over. \nCarson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm breaks, and Carson tosses him aside. \nSeeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet. \nWIDER \nCarson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street -- \nAnd NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned. \nCarson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it. \nThen, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble with their sidearms. \nWESTEC GUARD Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On the ground! \nAsshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards. \nCARSON Asshole was trying to boost my car! \nANGLE ACROSS STREET \nCarson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him. \nCARSON Mike -- call 911! \nNEIGHBOR Been trying... (has a cordless phone) It's busy. (to Guards; re Carson) He's the good guy, you schumcks. \nThe Guards seem to get it.

He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit. \nMrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders. \nAmbassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the \"Nirvana\" logo on his T-shirt. \nAMBASSADOR HAN (Korean) [Go change.] \nAmbassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy. \nAMBASSADOR HAN (continuing) [You smell like a fireplace.] \nA BUTLER appears with a phone.

You may go now... \nHe speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors. \nJaval grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess' upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest. \nHe drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief. \nINT.

(beat) The cash will be here in an hour. (to Miranda) Any thoughts on the kidnapper's thoughts? \nMIRANDA Everything indicates he's working alone.

You can't keep living as such a raw nerve, never sleeping -- \nCARSON -- Those kids were ten years old! (sotto) Same age as the Han boy... \nHe turns away. She takes his hand. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY \nThe family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY \nTheir CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders, construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc. \nA warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads: \nThis Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nThe mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther, then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting. \nCARSON C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank records? What about cross-referencing possible aliases? We got 33 minutes! \nHearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off. \nSuddenly, Miranda looks at him: \nMIRANDA Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry! (reaches for phone) Where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies? \nROBBINS Parker Center's making those calls. \nINT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nBobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly: \nBOBBI Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!! \nCAMERAMAN Maybe it's true... probably is true. That's why they got a news blackout! \nBOBBI I'll rip your miserable eyeballs out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!! \nHe sighs and turns the CAMERA on. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY \nThe Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified... \nBOBBI (on TV) ...A warning was radioed to U.S. Intelligence that a biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles. While unconfirmed, the President and other leaders are all late in arriving... \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nThe TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report. \nCarson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a long column of telephone numbers. \nDAVE Finally got the call list from Javal's phone. Most aren't his; they're from the legit user who didn't know his number was cloned. \nCARSON Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours. \nDave jumps to the bottom, points at a number. \nDAVE Here's the call to the Consulate -- (while scrolling) The rest are dupes... all from the other guy... \nCARSON Wait... go back... the one at seven this morning... \n", "test3_true": "WIDER \nCarson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk. \n(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE \nfrom when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button. \n(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP \non the label showing the phone's extension number: \"x666.\" \nBACK TO SCENE \nAcross the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently. \nCarson turns to look at him. They make eye contact. \nTime stands still. \nRealization. \nFeeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster. \nColonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk. \nCARSON Get down! \nColonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door. \nThe BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console. \nCarson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor, while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction. \nRobbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first. Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder. \nMiranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk. \nCARSON (continuing) MIRANDA! \nColonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door. \nGunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda. Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them. \nDave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY. \nCarson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open. She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is mushroomed against the vest. \nShe awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him. Carson is overwhelmed with relief. \nThen he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head. \nOS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson... \nMIRANDA Go..! \nEXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY \nThe city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a drive in the country. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nCarson bursts through the door just as the second armored Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes. \nCarson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one. \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY \nAs Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and Ambassador Han gets in. \nCARSON Get the fuck out of here! \nAmbassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson sighs and tears out of the driveway. \nEXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY \nColonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane, zooming past the snarl of cars. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nIn the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF. \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCarson looks around at the chaos around them. \nCARSON Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out here! \nThen he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO: \nFM NEWSCASTER (VO) (thru car radio) ...These words, which have terrified the city: \nRECORDING OF BOBBI (VO) (thru car radio) ...A biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles... \nStunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his face in his hands. \n", "test3_id": 461}

LOS ANGELES - DAY \nThe whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and wake me up. \nEXT.  LAX - DAY \nThe traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly with stretch limousines. \nINT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY \nInside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit \nA planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears. \nThey get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER: \nREPORTER (to TV CAMERA) Eager to mend its tarnished image, Los Angeles has really put out the welcome mat for tomorrow's summit. The city promises quite a party as leaders from Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, the U.S. and others begin talks for the largest free-trade treaty in history. \nThe SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries arriving. \nThen, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city. \nREPORTER (VO) (continuing) The one sour note is North Korea, the only Pacific Rim country not participating. There are rumors of secret meetings with North Korean representatives, but U.S. officials insist the North must first hold democratic elections, and halt its nuclear weapons program -- as they claimed to have done back in 1995. \nWe CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL. \nThen ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ. \nThe SCENE returns to LAX. \nREPORTER (VO) (continuing) Tensions remain high since last year's skirmishes between North Korea and the U.S. So any chance of the communist North joining the Pacific Partners seems highly unlikely. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY \nAn exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nA Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought- iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean, next to the entranceway: \nConsulate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \nThe driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted windows and diplomatic license plates glides out. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nAn alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS. He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes. \nEXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY \nFrom atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place. \nHIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS \nas the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray. \nJaval takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to a van with a phone company logo on it. \nEXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY \nThe Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns into the heavy morning traffic. \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nIt is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis. \nThe DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun. \nA HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged Scandinavian GOVERNESS. \nSAM I can't stand it -- half an hour to get to the stupid school every morning... with no music... (Korean; subtitled) [Just our damn Nanny...] \nEXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY \nJaval's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \n", "test1_true": "EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY \nTraffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows. \nThe thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to \"11\" cruises by. \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nEven 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence. The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts on his blinker to take the 405 South exit. \nEXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY \nThe van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nAs they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a switch on his radio-control unit... \nCLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS \nSix small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately, scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT... \nWIDER \nCausing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction PILE-UP you can imagine. \nDozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still coming onto the overpass. \nBrakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy, glass shatters. \nAnd then it gets really nasty... \nA Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant. \nIt SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail... \nAlong with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans. \nThey plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below. \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nSam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything. \nDRIVER (Korean) [Stay in the car.] \nEXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY \nA nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic. \nINT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY \nJaval slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it. \nANGLE WITH JAVAL \nas, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and rolls under the Mercedes. \nThe undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it, then rolls back toward the van. \nINT.  MERCEDES - DAY \nOblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nSweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks another radio unit. Working. \nEXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY \nThe CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by, Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the Mercedes onto the 405 south. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nJaval drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit. \nJaval fingers the radio unit, itching to use it... \nBut he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway. \nINSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES \nJaval's device is armed, and waiting... \nFADE TO: \nEXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single- family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards. \nEvery house on the block except the one we're in front of has a \"For Sale\" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the signs, they've been there for quite a while. \nINT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly. \n", "test1_id": 459, "test2_input": "CARSON (Cont'd) (checks watch) Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers at the Bowl. Have them clear the area of civilians. \nMIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) Remember, Pete... we're dealing with a customer with a lot of rage. \nCARSON (to himself) Must've bought a house same time we did. \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY \nRobbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland near Hollywood Blvd. \nElsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc. \nA BIKER CLUB \nof twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn from the Boulevard onto Highland. \nEXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY \nCarson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a sign atop it: \"Jesse Lasky Famous Players.\" \nINT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nStill disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a Summit-related concert is being readied. \nJaval watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying. \nINT.  MERCEDES - DAY \nColonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the pavement. Carson looks around. \nCARSON (into radio) There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here... So spread out. \nColonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs a left onto Highland, going back the way he came. \nINT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nDave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel, smacks his arm and points ahead: \nEXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY \nJaval's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above the bags of money. \nDAVE (into radio) Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream truck! \nEXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY \nSabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees. \nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY \nJaval, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE. \nINT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY \nThe van pulls away. \nDave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving. He looks up... \nTwo of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement. \nDAVE Son of a bitch! (into radio) He found the bleepers -- both of them! \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCARSON (into radio) Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck. Which way's he heading? \nDAVE (VO) (thru radio) Toward the freeway. \nCarson hangs a U-turn. \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY \nAt the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101, Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp. \nSabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it. \nSuddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave. \nPeeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes. The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off... blocking Sabatini's way. \nJaval drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101 North on-ramp. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMiranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while anxiously clutching her two-way radio. \nMIRANDA (into radio) What happened? \nCARSON (VO) (thru radio) We're made! Gotta grab him! \nMIRANDA (beat; into radio) All right... Carefully... \nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCarson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his AMD-74 machine gun. \nCARSON Watch it! We need him alive! \n", "test2_true": "Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out. \nThe van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping against the cars around it. \nCarson pulls up closer... \nSuddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open... \nAnd Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the back of the machine. \nHe straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a maniac back the way he came. \nCarson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving away from him. \nCOLONEL LEE Turn around! \nBut Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy traffic, until he spots what he was looking for: \nThe Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead. \nCarson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars, wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it: \nCARSON FBI. Call our office, they'll take care of you. \nMeanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend. They pull guns, knives, chains... \nThey're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5 machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way: \nBIKER I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn dentist! \nCOLONEL LEE \ngets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around. \nJAVAL \ncontinues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes, driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland, leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake. \nWIDER \nWhen everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit. \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY \nJaval rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets into the southbound lanes. \nHe just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out. \nCARSON Just don't kill yourself, you piece of shit... \nCarson fishes out his two-way. \nCARSON (continuing; into radio) Helicopter or two would be nice! \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nListening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action. \nMIRANDA (into radio) Love to be in the loop on this... \nEXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY \nSpeeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic. \nCARSON (to himself) Not just now, dear... \nSeeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson. \nCarson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art- deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue shatters into a million FLAMING fragments. \nCARSON (continuing; grumbling) I coulda had a ranch... maybe some horses... but no, we moved to L.A. \nJAVAL \nspeeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun. \nA HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him. \nThen, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace. \nEXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY \nCarson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter. \nCarson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs. \nNEW ANGLE \nJaval has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique, outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story concrete tower. \nHe jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate. \nJaval comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose. \nANGLE WITH CARSON \n", "test2_id": 460, "test3_input": "MIRANDA Pete -- \nCARSON -- \"Should've.\" Shit, there's a familiar word. (long beat) That day... I was there soon enough. We should've rushed 'em, before they could finish setting up... \nMIRANDA The Bureau never would've let you. They want it by the book: talk them out. \nCarson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY \nCarson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to: \nA BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball. \nThe OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges. \nBoth Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed to protect themselves... \nThe front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES. \nCarson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nCARSON Twelve bodies -- only the hostages. \nMIRANDA You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your decision. You can't keep living as such a raw nerve, never sleeping -- \nCARSON -- Those kids were ten years old! (sotto) Same age as the Han boy... \nHe turns away. She takes his hand. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY \nThe family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY \nTheir CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders, construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc. \nA warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads: \nThis Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting. \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nThe mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther, then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting. \nCARSON C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank records? What about cross-referencing possible aliases? We got 33 minutes! \nHearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off. \nSuddenly, Miranda looks at him: \nMIRANDA Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry! (reaches for phone) Where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies? \nROBBINS Parker Center's making those calls. \nINT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY \nBobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly: \nBOBBI Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!! \nCAMERAMAN Maybe it's true... probably is true. That's why they got a news blackout! \nBOBBI I'll rip your miserable eyeballs out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!! \nHe sighs and turns the CAMERA on. \nINT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY \nThe Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified... \nBOBBI (on TV) ...A warning was radioed to U.S. Intelligence that a biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles. While unconfirmed, the President and other leaders are all late in arriving... \nINT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nThe TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report. \nCarson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a long column of telephone numbers. \nDAVE Finally got the call list from Javal's phone. Most aren't his; they're from the legit user who didn't know his number was cloned. \nCARSON Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours. \nDave jumps to the bottom, points at a number. \nDAVE Here's the call to the Consulate -- (while scrolling) The rest are dupes... all from the other guy... \nCARSON Wait... go back... the one at seven this morning... \n", "test3_true": "WIDER \nCarson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk. \n(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE \nfrom when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button. \n(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP \non the label showing the phone's extension number: \"x666.\" \nBACK TO SCENE \nAcross the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently. \nCarson turns to look at him. They make eye contact. \nTime stands still. \nRealization. \nFeeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster. \nColonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk. \nCARSON Get down! \nColonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door. \nThe BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console. \nCarson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor, while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction. \nRobbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first. Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder. \nMiranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk. \nCARSON (continuing) MIRANDA! \nColonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door. \nGunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda. Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them. \nDave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY. \nCarson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open. She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is mushroomed against the vest. \nShe awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him. Carson is overwhelmed with relief. \nThen he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head. \nOS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson... \nMIRANDA Go..! \nEXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY \nThe city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a drive in the country. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nCarson bursts through the door just as the second armored Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes. \nCarson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one. \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY \nAs Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and Ambassador Han gets in. \nCARSON Get the fuck out of here! \nAmbassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson sighs and tears out of the driveway. \nEXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY \nColonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane, zooming past the snarl of cars. \nEXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY \nIn the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF. \nINT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY \nCarson looks around at the chaos around them. \nCARSON Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out here! \nThen he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO: \nFM NEWSCASTER (VO) (thru car radio) ...These words, which have terrified the city: \nRECORDING OF BOBBI (VO) (thru car radio) ...A biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles... \nStunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his face in his hands. \n", "test3_id": 461}

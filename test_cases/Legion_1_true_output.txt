Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling, gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help. Percy races for the back. 
BOB (catching Percy by the 
ARM) Where you going?! 
PERCY To get my bible! 
BOB The hell you need that for?! 
PERCY Well somebody's gotta start prayin'... Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING. Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the 
SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK 
STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT. Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm. Apocalyptic. No one breathes. 
CUT TO: 
A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to the bone. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey watches from a distance with grim fascination. 
PERCY (raises a bottle of 
ALCOHOL) Okay, hold `em steady. 
CHARLIE (nods, peakish, to 
HERSELF) Oh god, please don't throw up. Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound. Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook. Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body -- just in case. Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from Percy's frying pan. 
BOB She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours. Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth. 
KYLE Well, I don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out. 
BOB I don't get it.    Why don't they come closer? 
KYLE How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin' pestilence. A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped to the ground. 
JEEP (holding up the keys) You guys! 
GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer inside the car. 
BOB You see anything?

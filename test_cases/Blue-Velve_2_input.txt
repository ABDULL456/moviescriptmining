Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared. 
JEFFREY (to himself) Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in even more trouble with Frank. I hope not. I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out more about Frank. 
133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY 
Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching. 
A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps. Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures. 
We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man. 
JEFFREY Damn! 
He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.

Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says 
As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and disappear within the old dark structure. 
JEFFREY Wow.

135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY 
Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00. 
JEFFREY (out loud to himself) Fifteen more minutes. 
Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks, but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment. 
The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his. Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off.

They drive through town. 
137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY 
. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25". 
JEFFREY You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll. 
He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase. 
138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the end of the alley he turns left and stops short. 
139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY 
He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head. 
On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock. Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to them. 
JEFFREY What happened? 
GUY #1 He was blown away man. can't you see? 
GUY #2 That cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city, brother. the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe. It's a speedball heaven in there. 
JEFFREY Oh yeah? What about the woman? 
GUY #1 Probably just a whore he happened to be with at the time. 
JEFFREY Man oh brother. 
GUY #1 This is the way the world is my man. take a good look. 
Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off. 
CUT TO:

Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her. 
SANDY (looking beyond the car) GO ON!!!. GO! 
Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey. Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off. 
SANDY Oh great.

HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir, excuse me, Chicago calling sir. 
GATSBY Now now. Keep it open. For a personal call... 
HERZOG A personal call? Of course. 
The GARDENER comes to the foot of the steps. 
GARDENER I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. 
GATSBY Not today. It's so beautiful. (TO NICK) You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer? 
Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs... 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Let's go for a swim. I'll have the phone transferred to the pool... 
As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch... 
NICK Jay, I've got to go. I have to work. 
GATSBY I understand... Well, I'll walk you out. 
Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate... 
NICK I'll call you up. 
GATSBY Do, old sport, please do. (A THOUGHT) I suppose Daisy'll call too. 
NICK I suppose so... Well... Goodbye. 
Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls: 
NICK (CONT'D) They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together! 
First Gatsby nods politely, and then his face breaks into that radiant and understanding smile. 
NICK (V.O.) I was always glad I said that... It was the only compliment I ever paid him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PROBITY TRUST BUILDING - NICK'S OFFICE - DAY 
CLOSE ON: Nick, tired, sick-looking. 
NICK (V.O.) That morning, Wall Street boomed, its usual golden roar... But I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work. I waited for Gatsby to call with news... 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - DAY 
Gatsby heads for the pool, ready to swim... 
NICK (V.O.) While he waited for Daisy... 
SPLASH! Gatsby dives gracefully into the pool. 
We see Gatsby from below, body gliding through clear water. 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAISY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A white telephone on a ivory plinth. 
REVEAL: Daisy, considering the phone... 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GROUNDS - DAY 
A gun dangles from a hand. 
Wilson's scarecrow shadow ripples across the lawn. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - CONTINUOUS 
Gatsby's head breaks the smooth, green surface of the water. 
SUDDENLY! BRRRING!!! The phone rings... 
Gatsby smiles and gazes across toward the green light, toward Daisy. 
PULL FOCUS: Atop the monumental stairs, Wilson, raises a gun. 
THE CRACK OF A GUNSHOT! 
CLOSE ON: Gatsby - a moment of strangled, startled, wonder... His lips form a final, breathless... 
GATSBY Daisy... 
Then his face hardens as he slowly falls backwards... SPLASH! 
Placing his gun in his mouth Wilson pulls the trigger. 
BANNNGG! 
INT. PROBITY TRUST BUILDING - NICK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
A SILENT IMAGE of Nick screaming into the phone. 
INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAISY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Daisy's hand rests on the phone... She never called. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - DAY 
Gatsby's body descends through a cloud of blood... 
NICK (V.O.) After all these years, I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day as an endless drill...

Members of the team exchange looks of surprise and disbelief. 
JIM Hold your horses.  What kinda source? 
BILL (grins) The anonymous kind, Chief. 
OSER I think I remember this guy Ferrie speaking at a meeting of some veteran's group.  Ranting against Castro.  Extreme stuff. 
NEWSMAN 1 We go back now to the basement of police headquarters where they're about to transfer Oswald to County Prison... 
TELEVISION IMAGE: The basement of the Dallas police headquarters - waiting.  Men mill around as Oswald is led out of the basement by two deputies.  Jack Ruby rushes forward out of the crowd - and into history - putting his sealing bullet into Oswald.  Total chaos erupts... 
The camera is on the staff, looking.  We hear gasps. 
ANNOUNCER He's been shot!  Oswald's been shot! 
VARIOUS VOICES Goddamn!  Look at that... Look at that... I don't believe this... Right on TV!  What is going on?  Who is this guy... oh Jesus. 
Jim is silent. 
LOU Seventy cops in that basement.  What the hell were they doing? 
NEWSMAN 1 Jack Ruby... Who is Jack Ruby?  Oswald is hurt. 
We see images of Oswald being lifted onto the stretcher, into the ambulance, and the newscaster crouching, whispering. Everybody in the room is stunned still. 
LOU Well, no trial now.  Looks like somebody saved the Dallas D.A. a pile of work. 
They look to Jim.  There's a pause.  He is deeply disturbed. 
JIM (quietly) Well, let's get Ferrie in here anyway. 
GARRISON OFFICE - NEXT DAY - DAY(1963) 
The portable television plays to Jim alone, sitting in his chair smoking a pipe.  We see searing images of the funeral - crowds of mourners, the casket being driven through the streets, the honor guards, the horses, the dignitaries walking behind, Jackie veiled... the faces of De Gaulle, MacMillan, Robert Kennedy.  We intercut briefly to Lyndon Johnson sitting down earlier that day with the Joint Chiefs of Staff... and then a future cut to Johnson in the Oval Office (staged). The shots are very tight, uncomfortable - noses, eyes, hands - very tight. 
As the door opens following a knock, David Ferrie is brought into Jim's office by two police officers and Lou Ivon.  Jim stands up, cordial. 
LOU Chief... David Ferrie. 
Ferrie suffers from alopecia, a disease that has removed all his body hair, and he looks like a Halloween character - penciled eyebrows, one higher than the other, a scruffy reddish wig pasted on askew with glue, thrift store clothing. His eyes, however, are swift and cunning, his smile warm, inviting itself, his demeanor hungry to please. 
JIM (shakes hands) Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee? 
FERRIE Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember? 
JIM How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression. (on intercom) Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee? (Ferrie laughs; pause) I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small... (Jim points to the pictures on his wall) I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war. 
Ferrie glimpses the low-volumed TV - and images of the funeral.  He looks away, jittery, and takes out a cigarette. Sharon brings the coffee in. 
FERRIE Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison? 
JIM (holds up his pipe) How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby. (on each name, watching Ferrie's reaction) We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well. 
FERRIE That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy. 
JIM But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager. 
FERRIE No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know. 
JIM (hands him a current newspaper) I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name? 
FERRIE No, I never saw him before in my life. 
JIM Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us. (puffs on pipe, Ferrie looks relieved; images of the funeral continue on the TV) There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday. 
FERRIE Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston. 
JIM What was so appealing about Houston? 
FERRIE I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating. 
JIM Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory? 
FERRIE Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad. 
JIM I see.  And where did you drive? 
FERRIE We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there. 
JIM Why Galveston? 
FERRIE No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere. 
JIM And then Sunday? 
FERRIE In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond. 
JIM Did you bag any geese on this trip? 
FERRIE I believe the boys got a couple. 
JIM But the boys told us they didn't get any. 
FERRIE (fidgeting, lighting another cigarette) Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds. 
JIM Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?

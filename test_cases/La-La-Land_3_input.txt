MIA "Curt"? 
SEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision                       18. 
MIA Ok. 
SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. 
MIA My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? 
SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. 
MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? 
SEBASTIAN Why? 
MIA Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. 
SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything? 
MIA Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. 
SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. 
SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. Second set. 
Sebastian looks at Mia. She smirks. Pleased. The Singer walks off. 
SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. 
MIA He just told you what to do. 
SEBASTIAN I let him. Revision                          19. 
A beat. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? 
MIA Mia. 
SEBASTIAN Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. 
He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: 
SINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 
36   EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT 
The party's finished. Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys, as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in the back, waiting, is Mia. She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- 
CARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. 
Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. 
CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded. 
MIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! 
Sebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised. 
SEBASTIAN You again. 
MIA Did you just get your keys? 
Sebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off -- 
SEBASTIAN ...Yeah. Revision                       20. 
MIA Can you grab mine?

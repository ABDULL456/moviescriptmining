SANDRA (nervously) Of course, but I... I don't know how I... how much help I can be to you.  This is the sort of thing... someone saying you're a communist... it can ruin your career. 
Pete sees where this is going.  She's edging toward the door. 
PETE Will you help me, Sandy? 
SANDRA I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go... 
And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye.  Pete looks at the Guard. 
PETE So nice to be a pariah. 
The Guard turns away.  Pete moves back toward the boxes. Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels with barely one swig left.  He regards the bottle for a moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't), pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it.  He looks at it thoughtfully as we 
CUT TO: 
A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop. 
WIDER 
INT.  THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT 
The bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly getting stewed.  The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive, dimly lit and full of character and characters.  It's a quiet night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of the bar.  Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. Good boy, he got most of it in the glass. 
JERRY Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough? 
PETE Bought the bottle, didn't I? (raises the shot) To the United States of America. Long my she wave. 
He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another. 
PETE (trying to light a smoke) Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something. 
JERRY What. 
PETE You tight with J. Edgar Hoover? 
JERRY (helps Pete light his cigarette) The G-man? 
PETE (thickly) Zackly. 
JERRY Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him. 
PETE Too bad.  He says I'm a communist. 
JERRY (glancing around) You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening. 
PETE You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer? 
JERRY Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender? 
PETE This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike. 
Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar.  He watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it.  Pete reaches for the bottle, but Jerry is faster. 
JERRY Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy? 
PETE (laughs) Sandra Sinclair. 
JERRY Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up. 
PETE Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist. 
JERRY I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her. 
Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills on the bar and grabs his hat. 
PETE Nope.  Can't.  We're through. 
JERRY Then I'll call you a cab. 
PETE I'll save you the trouble. (beat) I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself. 
Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his condition. 
PETE 'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer. 
JERRY Pete... 
And he's out the door. 
EXT.  FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT 
Pete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath, then totters briskly towards his car.  He hauls the door open and sits inside heavily. 
INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably be a good idea. 
PETE (mumbling) Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too drunk to drive. 
He looks at his watch. 
PETE One-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go home yet. 
He turns the key and hits the starter.  The engine hums to life.  Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze and puts the car in gear. 
The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt and stalls.

1 INT. GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER - RIGHT (SEPTEMBER) 1 
Electric' doors zip open. ALEC NEWBERRY, a handsome possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain- smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper, dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are in their freshman year of life. Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze. Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS. 
ALEC Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks? They were in a car accident? 
ELECTRIC DOORS zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES), another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and the Cops. 
JULES They're dead, aren't they? Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops. 
ALEC Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with Congressman Langston's office. Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk. 
LESLIE I think they're okay. 
JULES Thank God. 
(BEAT) Are you aware there's a three- hundred-pound man walking around naked? 
(CONTINUED) 
1 CONTINUED: 1 WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead. 
HER FRIENDS Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you all right??? 
WENDY I'm fine. It's the car my father gave me for graduation that's totalled. 
ALEC 
(TO KEVIN) Find Billy. See if you can sober him up. Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile, Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse. 
WENDY How much do I owe you? 
JULES He almost killed you. Destroyed your car, and you're paying...? 
LESLIE Jules, please. As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date who hovers in the distance. 
WENDY Is that your date? The naked man wanders past them. 
JULES No, that's my date! As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as the Cops approach her. 
COP # 1 You pressing charges? 
WENDY No. 
KI RBO 'I'm Mr. Hicks' legal counsel and he's not required to take any tests. 
(CONTINUED) 
1 CONTINUED: (2) 0 
COP 1 You're a little late, Counselor. He's in the van giving blood right now. The Cops start toward the electric doors as Kirbo and Alec follow. Leslie helps Wendy with the bill. CAMERA FINDS Jules whispering dramatically to her Date. 
JULES I'll have to be with her all night. They don't know if she's going to make it. 
DATE She looks fine. 
JULES Shock. She could black out at any second... I'll call you... Jules joins Leslie and Wendy. 
LESLIE He's cute. 
JULES Too young... and don't you both start on your father complex theory. 
2 EXT. MEDICAL CENTER 2 
Alec and Kirbo follow the Cops toward a mobile van. 
KIRBO We're dealing with a first offender here, and since Ms. Beamish doesn't want to press charges, whaddya say we just let this one slide, Officers? They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see BILLY HICKS, a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone, wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin, who is trying to give him black coffee.

ON TED 
As he starts to read, slowly, carefully, so that Billy can absorb it. 
TED "My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has gone away. Sometimes in the world daddies go away and mommies bring up their little boys. But sometimes a mommy can go away too, and you have your daddy to bring you up." 
As Ted continues to read, Billy starts turning up the sound on the television, using the remote control device. 
TED (raising his voice so he can be heard) "I have gone away because I must find some interesting things to do for myself in the world. Everybody has to, and so do I. Being your mommy was one thing, but there are other things and this is what I have to do. I did not get a chance to tell you this, and that is why I am writing you now." 
By now the volume from the television is so loud that Ted has to shout to make himself heard over it. 
TED "I will always be your mommy and I will always love you. I just won't be your mommy in the house. But I will be your mommy of the heart. And I... " (he looks up, about to tell the child to lower the volume) Billy. 
HIS POV 
Billy sits, watching television with an almost ferocious intensity on his face, doing his best to block out Ted's voice. 
ON TED 
He watches his son for a second, then carefully refolds the letter, puts it away. 
TED (as he reaches across, turns down the sound on the T.V.) It's okay... It's okay. We'll talk about it some other time.

CLOSE ON THELMA 
Reading Joanna's letter. 
THELMA Oh, God... OhmyGod... 
She finishes the letter, looks up at Ted. 
THELMA What are you going to do? 
TED I don't know, Thel... This whole thing has happened so... Pow, like that. 
THELMA I mean, what are you going to do about Billy? 
TED (stiff) I'm gonna keep him, why? 
THELMA Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it. 
TED Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child. 
THELMA (backing off) All right... Okay... But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand? 
REVERSE ON TED 
He nods. 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
THELMA I'm not going to have you calling every fifteen minutes just because you can't find a hot water bottle, understand? 
Ted nods. 
THELMA I've got enough trouble raising my own kid. I don't need another one. Got it? 
TED Got it. 
THELMA You're on your own, understand? 
TED I understand. 
THELMA You're sure? 
TED I'm sure. 
ON THELMA 
A long pause, she looks at him with all the warmth of a top sergeant facing a raw recruit. Then: 
THELMA All right. Who's Billy's pediatrician? 
ON TED 
He hasn't the foggiest idea. 
THELMA (machine-gun delivery) Ed Davies. 230 East 76th Street. 472- 8227. Fifty bucks a house call, thirty for an office visit. Write this down: I'm not telling you twice. What's the nearest hospital? 
ON TED 
As he grabs a piece of paper and starts writing frantically. 
TED Wait a minute! Wait a minute! 
THELMA (not waiting) Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park and Lex. The emergency number is 327- 
TED Slow down... Slow down...

INT. TED'S BEDROOM  DAY 
WIDE SHOT 
Ted stands in the middle of the room, sorting out a huge pile of dirty clothes. Thelma sits on the edge of the bed, watching. 
THELMA Colors in one pile, white things in another and shirts in a third.

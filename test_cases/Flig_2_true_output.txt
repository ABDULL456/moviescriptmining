EVANS Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700 feet per minute, out of 7,000. I SEE NOTHING BUT HOUSES! 
WHIP OK! Here's what we're going to do! (TO EVANS) When I say, you retract the gear, retract the flaps and trim both ailerons. But every things gonna be opposite, so be sure to trim down. Margaret... 
EVANS Trim down?! What are you gonna do?! 
Whip takes Margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle levers. 
WHIP When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it? (MARGARET NODS) What's your son's name? 
MARGARET Trevor. 
WHIP Say "I love you Trevor." 
EVANS You mean trim up?! Right? You want me to trim up? 
MARGARET Why? 
WHIP The black box. 
MARGARET I love you Trevor. Be a good boy. Mommy loves you. 
EVANS What are we doing?! Why would I trim down?! 
WHIP We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control. 
EVANS (TERRIFIED) WHAT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ROLL IT?!! 
WHIP Just a little barrel roll. Don't panic. Relax. Let it roll. 
WHIP's body is fully extended as he pulls back on the yoke and turns into a steep bank. 
WHIP (CONT'D) EVANS, FLAPS! 
EVANS FLAPS UP! 
WHIP MARGARET FULL POWER! EVANS, TRIM US! GEAR UP! 
The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console. 
EVANS I CAN'T REACH THE GEAR! 
WHIP Margaret! Can you reach it? 
Margaret bends forward and pulls the lever. 
WHIP (CONT'D) WHAT'S OUR ALTITUDE? 
EVANS 3,000...I think. 
WHIP Let it roll. I got it! 
Whip quickly retracts the speed brakes, then PUSHES HIS YOKE FULL FORWARD! The clumsy liner does a slow, ungraceful roll. 
INT. PLANE CABIN - SAME 
WE WATCH as the PASSENGERS scream as the plane rolls over and they are suspended upside down. 
EXT. SKY OVER ATLANTA - SAME 
The JR-88 finishes its barrel-roll, skimming over suburban rooftops and trees. A CLOUD-TRAIL of Jet-A SPEWING from its wings. 
As the INVERTED PLANE ROARS overhead the CAMERA PANS to find - 
NICOLE 
Being rushed out of her apartment on a stretcher. The TWO PARAMEDICS and Fran (the landlord) instinctively duck as the jet SCREAMS over. 
FRAN (at the sight of the jet) Jesus Christ! What the Fuck!? 
INT. FLIGHT DECK - SAME 
THE PLANE IS COMPLETELY INVERTED!! 
THRU THE WINDSCREEN -- THE PLANE LEVELS OFF -- IT'S INVERTED NOSE RISES TO MEET THE HORIZON. 
EVANS hangs in his harness straps as dust and smoke swirl around him. The inverted wings make an EERIE WHISTLING SOUND as the plane SHUDDERS violently side-to-side. 
EVANS Oh Lord Jesus! We're inverted! 
WHIP reaches over and pulls the throttles back. He suddenly seems strangely calm, comfortable with his fate... 
WHIP We're level. We can maintain altitude like this. 
MAIN CABIN -- WE WATCH OVER TRINA'S SHOULDER AS SHE HANGS 
TRINA struggles to stay in her seat as she looks at the passengers hanging. She watches as a YOUNG BOY loses his grip and flops to the ground. 
TRINA unhooks and flops to the ground. We follow her as she runs on the ceiling of the cabin towards the BOY. She gets there and starts lifting him towards his FATHER. 
COCKPIT -- SAME TIME 
The ATC voice now plays loudly through the entire cockpit. 
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. I see your position 4 and a half miles southeast of the airport. Descending out of 1,800. Are you OK? 
It takes Whip a second to find the mic key on his inverted yoke... 
WHIP Uh, Atlanta...we're inverted. 
There's a very pregnant pause...

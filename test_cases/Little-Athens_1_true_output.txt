PEDRO Gracias! 
As Older Man and Older Woman proceed toward the diner, Pedro opens the door to his Tow Truck, and reaches in to hit the control which lifts the Mustang. 
EXT. DINER -- MOMENTS LATER 
Through the window we see PATRONS eating. Pedro drives by in his Tow Truck with the Mustang hitched to the back. 
INT. DR. COOK'S OFFICE, EXAMINING ROOM -- DAY 
HEATHER is sitting on the examining table, topless, holding her breath as DR. COOK runs a STETHOSCOPE on different areas of her back. Heather's BLOUSE and PURSE are lying on the examining table beside her. 
DR. COOK Breathe out. 
Heather lets her breath out. 
DR. COOK (CONT'D) It's official. You're as healthy as you were last week, and last week you were as healthy as an ox. 
HEATHER Are you sure you're using that thing right? I feel this ache (indicating her chest) Right here, like I'm being crushed between two boards. 
DR. COOK Nobody's crushing you.     Honest. I'm sure. It's all in your head.     I know a couple quacks... 
HEATHER I don't need a head doctor! 
DR. COOK I was just kidding there. 
Heather reaches into her PURSE and lights a CIGARETTE. Dr. Cook sighs - they've had a discussion about Heather's smoking before. 
DR. COOK (CONT'D) Heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up. 
Heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about-face. She is gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half- naked. 
HEATHER Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is that so outrageous?! 
Dr. Cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with Heather while her breasts are exposed. 
DR. COOK Heather... 
HEATHER I just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid... 
DR. COOK Heather, there's nothing wrong with being concerned about your health. Please put your blouse back on. 
Heather grabs her Blouse from the table and puts it back on. 
DR. COOK (CONT'D) So I'll see you next week then. 
HEATHER (suddenly friendly again) Okay, yeah, see you next week. 
Heather leaves and shuts the door behind her. 
EXT. DEREK'S HOUSE -- DAY 
The sound of panting can be heard. Two people are having sex. There are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high- pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain. 
INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
LOW ANGLE MEDIUM on ALLISON bent over the bed, mouth agape. She buries her face in the mattress, revealing DEREK thrusting from behind. Derek climaxes. Allison pops up from below. 
ALLISON I'm two pounds heavier I think. 
Derek lies back to put his head on the pillow. 
DEREK Sorry. 
Allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest. 
ALLISON It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than I thought. Does Heather... like it? 
DEREK She never let's me do it. 
ALLISON She doesn't?    Why not? 
DEREK I don't know. She does shave though.    How come you don't shave? 
ALLISON I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you love her? 
DEREK I don't know. 
ALLISON How can you not know? 
DEREK She's got problems. 
ALLISON I don't understand you. Why do you even cheat on her with me? She's so pretty. So much prettier than me. 
DEREK She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I don't   know why you do it. You should have a man   of your own - we say it all the time,   me and Heather. 
ALLISON Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather introduced me to last time? 
DEREK He outranks me. He's a good guy. 
ALLISON Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I can do is a guy that looks like that? 
DEREK No.

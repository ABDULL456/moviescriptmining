"A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY." 
FADE IN: 
EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH. 
CLOSER 
We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY 
Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized bales speed along the narrow road. 
EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY 
The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire. The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel ashes into the pot to cool the solution. 
INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash. 
INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags. 
EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY 
A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel bags and the plane takes off. 
EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT 
The Cessna touches down. 
EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers, working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long way from being the boss. 
INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
George stands in line to register for college, wearing his Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair. The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees. Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy. 
REGISTRATION WOMAN Next. 
It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own reflection. 
GEORGE (V.O.) I was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know?  And then I looked around the room and it hit me.  I saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna live, what type of car I'd drive, who my neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I didn't want it.  Not that life. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a lunch box. 
GEORGE There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it. 
FRED That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family. 
GEORGE I know. 
FRED Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word. 
GEORGE No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... 
It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like him. 
FRED What are you going to do? 
GEORGE I'm going to California. 
EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968 
George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags. Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA GONZALES, 21.

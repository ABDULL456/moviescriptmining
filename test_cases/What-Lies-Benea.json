{"train": "WHAT LIES BENEATH \nby \nClark Gregg \nJune 14, 1999 \nFADE IN: \nMoving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance. Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera. We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water, arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING GREEN EYES, which blink closed... \nMORPH TO: \n...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side, reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being pulled. \nINT.  BATHROOM - DAY \nA HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound. \nA steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer starts whirring again. \nShe clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant- looking woman around forty. \nClaire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY \nClaire, now dressed, presses her face against a door, listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence. She quietly pushes open the door. \nINT.  ROOM - DAY \nClaire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a window, then pulls the curtains to reveal: \nA LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A 24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake. \nThe sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE still shrouded by covers. \nClaire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp. \nShe gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly. \nCLAIRE Morning, beauty. \nCaitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly. \nCLAIRE Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time. \nFrom out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice. \nCAITLIN (muffled) I'm totally ready. \nClaire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes. \nCLAIRE Come on, I'll make you some waffles, maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the mall. (beat) Caitlin... \nClaire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's behind. \nCAITLIN Mother... \nClaire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box. Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow. \nCAITLIN You're such a morning person. \nClaire turns at the door. \nCLAIRE It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic. \nShe starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out. \nCAITLIN (O.S.) Blueberries! \nClaire smiles as she closes the door behind her. \nINT.  HALLWAY - DAY \nClaire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  When she stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She gazes down, transfixed. \nANGLE \nThrough a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door. Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD. \nA TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck. He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below. \nNORMAN They at it again? \nClaire nods. \nClaire smiles. \nCLAIRE Sweetheart, I've known this day was coming for a long time.  I've got your father and the garden and the new house. You really don't have to worry. \nCaitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some concern.  Claire takes her hand. \nCLAIRE Really. \nShe nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Her eyes close. \nCAITLIN (V.O.) Mother... \nEXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY \nClaire's frozen in the hug. \nCAITLIN (beat) Mom. \nHer eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on the college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the background. \nCAITLIN I have'ta go. \nAfter a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed this overt display of maternal affection. \nCAITLIN I'll call you. \nClaire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her daughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS. \nCLAIRE Come home anytime. \nCaitlin looks at Norman. \nNORMAN Really gonna leave me, huh? \nShe nods.  They share a tender look. \nNORMAN Be good. \nShe throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bit overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of Caitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back... \nCAITLIN Bye. \n...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old Columbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals which reads: \n\"WELCOME CLASS OF '04.\" \nClaire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Her eyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a Kleenex. \nCLAIRE (smiling) I almost made it. \nThey turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last look over her shoulder. \nANGLE \nCaitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile. \nINT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nClaire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton nightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes. \nShe gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him and starts reading.  After a moment: \nNORMAN Whatcha reading? \nCLAIRE (reading the cover, sexy voice) Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms. \nNORMAN (slight smile) How is it? \nClaire snuggles up. \nCLAIRE Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell. \nNORMAN (lost in his book) Nice. (beat) Almost done. \nShe pulls slightly away. \nCLAIRE If you have to work... \nNORMAN No, no.  I'm just about... (beat) There. \nHe places his book on the bedside table and turns to her. \nNORMAN How are you? \nCLAIRE Fine. \nNORMAN It's okay if you're not. \nCLAIRE'S POV \nShe drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer. Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES, STUFFED ANIMALS. \nShe brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in the smells.  She stares down at the word \"Juilliard.\" \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT.  BASEMENT - DAY \n\"JUILLIARD\"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's wearing it and she's much younger.  It's an old photograph in an album.  Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his arm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her. \nClaire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at other photos. \n-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux with a very wide bow-tie. \n-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.  A tiny Caitlin rests on her hip. \nClaire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob. \nEXT.  FRONT YARD - DAY \nHer face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN. \nThe yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly, she hears something coming from next door. \nShe cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered. \nShe places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers her nerve and calls out... \nCLAIRE Hello... \nThere's no reaction. \nCLAIRE Mrs. Feur? \nThe sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blue shape vanishes from view. \nCLAIRE Wait a minute.  I just want-- \nSomething bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  She hears heavy breathing. \nMRS. FEUR (sniffling) Who are you? \nCLAIRE It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything-- \nMRS. FEUR You're the flower lady. \nCLAIRE Um...yes. \nMRS. FEUR I've seen you.  From the window. \nCLAIRE Is everything alright? \nClaire leans closer to the tiny crack.  She sees a fleshy blur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response, just the breathing. \nCLAIRE Hello? \nMRS. FEUR I'm not... \nShe seems on the verge of losing it again. \nMRS. FEUR He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath... \nCLAIRE Who?  Your husband? \nMRS. FEUR And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of... \nShe trails off. \nCLAIRE What?  What are you afraid of? \nMRS. FEUR I can't, no, no, I can't... \nClaire edges closer to the crack. \nCLAIRE Tell me.  Please. \nMRS. FEUR That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear. \nBeat.  Claire's taken aback by this admission. \nCLAIRE Tell me.  I can help you. \nMRS. FEUR How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life... \nCLAIRE That's not...It's not like that. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nShe glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves into: \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nShe dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through the phone. \nCLAIRE (straining to be heard) Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer. She's in 314...Well, could you check? \nShe plugs one ear. \nCLAIRE Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse me, how can you study with that? \nThe noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a classical music station. \nINT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nShe walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then hears a different set of musical notes from the computer. She stares at the screen, stunned. \nANGLE \nThe game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN! \nCLAIRE Oh.  Kay. \nWithout warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish rock and roll. \nCLAIRE Jesus... \nShe bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.  She follows him. \nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT \nThe foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire nervously walks out and looks around. \nCLAIRE Cooper! \nPOV - THE GARDEN \nNo sign of the dog. \nClaire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly into the study. \nCLAIRE Hello...?! \nThe whispering stops. \nINT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT \nClaire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD STUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt and tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming some unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness. She stops by the door to watch him. \nNORMAN ...and then what...Courtney? \nAn intense ASIAN GIRL answers. \nCOURTNEY We administer the Halothane. \nNORMAN Dosage? \nShe glances at her notes. \nCOURTNEY Three point five cc's. \nNORMAN Excellent.  Properties?  Andrew from downtown... \nAndrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this. \nANDREW An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent, which when administered in aerosol form temporarily renders the subject immobile. \nNORMAN Nothing but net. \nHe measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep. \nNORMAN Prudence here's an old friend. \nHe moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheep suddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around and begins a brief procedure. \nNORMAN I try to stay on her good side because I owe her my career and most of our grant money.  Why else? \nHe completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly. \nNORMAN Always do unto others as you'd have others do unto your ewe. \nGroans, laughter.  He stops Claire. \nNORMAN That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday! \nNORMAN He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us... \nCLAIRE Wow. \nHe nods, Claire passes the joint back. \nNORMAN And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, \"Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work...\" \nCLAIRE Well, that's nice. \nNORMAN \"...especially Spencer's Theorem...\" \nCLAIRE (overlapping) Oh, no... \nNORMAN \"...of Perpetual Distances.\" (beat) Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  \"I'm afraid you've mistaken me,\"  I say... \nCLAIRE (overlapping) That's... \nNORMAN \"...for my father.\" \nCLAIRE I'm so sorry. \nNORMAN Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe. \nCLAIRE That's just mean. (indicating joint) Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some. \nNORMAN (quickly glancing over) Did you tell her? \nCLAIRE What?  No.  No. \nNORMAN You didn't? \nCLAIRE (with a smile) Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't. \nHe takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom. \nNORMAN (O.S.) Cause that would be really-- \nShe lays back on the bed.  Sounds of flushing. \nCLAIRE I didn't. \nHe reappears without the joint. \nNORMAN Sorry.  You understand. \nCLAIRE Did you call about the Feurs? \nNORMAN Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly. \nCLAIRE Huh. \nClaire ponders this.  Norman turns off the light and joins her on the bed.  He kisses her knee. \nNORMAN Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more. \nThen starts working his way up her thigh. \nNORMAN And speak up. \nClaire smiles. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nClaire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in position.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound. \nClaire takes another deep breath, then launches into a beautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, very good.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as her left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck. \nShe reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seems almost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, and again falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again, this time failing completely. \nShe sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as an afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At the end of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can just make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone. \nShe sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Each time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finally she plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoes with a distinct, unsettling shriek. \nCRASH! \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK \nClaire walks in and sees: \nINSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE. \nThe caption announces that he's being promoted to the \"distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS.\"  Through the spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side. \nClaire kneels down to gather the picture.  A single shard of glass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctive knot in the wood floor. \nShe notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when she moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of broken glass on the frame and stands. \nJODY Know what I think? \nCLAIRE What? \nJODY Seance. \nCLAIRE Jody, no... \nJODY Telling you... \nCLAIRE (overlapping) ...no...no...no... \nJODY Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija. \nCLAIRE Please.  That's all I need. \nJody shrugs, \"Have it your way.\"  Beat. \nJODY Hey, look. \nCLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake. \nJODY So pretty. \nCLAIRE'S POV \nA FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study. \nCLAIRE Someone's there. \nJODY What? \nCLAIRE In the window.  Norman's at work. \nJODY I don't... \nClaire looks over at Jody. \nCLAIRE (pointing) There.  In the study.  Don't you see-- \nShe looks again-- nothing. \nCLAIRE Wow.  I'm losing it. \nJODY No, you're not. (beat) But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. \nClaire stares back at the house. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nClaire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind your pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them, then freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots. \nCLAIRE Oh boy... \nINT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT \nClaire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a pair of BINOCULARS. \nPOV - BINOCULARS \nClaire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON DOWNSTAIRS. \nThe tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for one.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring straight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer. \nJust then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her. \nNORMAN What are you doing? \nShe glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing at the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling Norman with her. \nCLAIRE (shrill whisper) Get down!  He'll see. \nNORMAN (also whispers) What's going on, Claire? \nCLAIRE Shhhh. \nShe peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away from the window.  She takes Norman by the hand and leads him downstairs. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nShe leads Norman in. \nNORMAN (still whispering) Why am I... (full voice) Why am I whispering in my own house? \nClaire turns. \nCLAIRE He killed her. \nShe looks at his watch. \nCLAIRE Fashionably five minutes late. \nShe bolts up the stairs. \nINT.  NORMAN'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT \nThey drive across the bridge. \nNORMAN (concerned, exasperated) When you do this, I swear... \nCLAIRE (overlapping) ...Don't get all... \nNORMAN ...like it never even happened... \nCLAIRE Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just... \nHe pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number. \nCLAIRE What are you doing? \nNORMAN Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late. \nCLAIRE Five minutes? \nThe phone flashes...\"NO SERVICE.\" \nCLAIRE You're not at the center. \nNORMAN (overlapping) I know I'm not at the center of the bridge. \nCLAIRE We're going to be fine. \nThey near the far side of the bridge.  Norman looks down at the cell phone, which now reads, \"ROAM.\"  He presses a button. \nNORMAN There we go. \nCLAIRE Well, that's a relief. \nHe shoots her a look. \nINT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA cozy, candlelit Italian place in town.  Claire and Norman arrive at the table.  STAN rises.  The chair next to him is empty.  He kisses her cheek. \nCLAIRE Hi Stan.  Sorry we're late. (too earnest) It was my fault. \nShe greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties. \nSTAN We just got here. \nClaire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman. \nCLAIRE Where's the new squeeze? \nA VOICE speaks out from behind her. \nVOICE Here I am. \nClaire turns to find A TALL, ELEGANT BRUNETTE standing behind her.  The woman's face registers some shock. \nSTAN I'd like you to meet... \nCLAIRE Elena? \nELENA Ohmigod... \nThe two women embrace, then beam at each other. \nCLAIRE Wow. \nELENA This is... \nCLAIRE (to Norman) We know each other. \nNORMAN Hope so. \nLATER \nPost meal.  Several empty wine bottle decorate the table. \nELENA We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki, something.  He had these ridiculous bangs. And he'd sweep them off with his baton every minute or so, and it drove us insane, remember? \nClaire nods. \nCLAIRE He looked like one of the Monkees. \nVOICE (O.S.) Claire... \nINT.  BATHROOM - DAY \nCLAIRE'S POV - A FACE sharpens into focus hovering above her...Norman. \nINT.  BEDROOM - DAY \nClaire sits on the bed.  Norman dabs the blood from a tiny cut on the back of her head. \nCLAIRE I don't need a shrink. \nNORMAN (gently) Harvey says he's amazing. \nCLAIRE Norman... \nNORMAN What can it hurt to talk to someone? \nShe goes to her dresser and gets a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and starts to open it.  Norman gently places a hand on her arm. \nNORMAN Please. \nShe shoots him a look... \nNORMAN You promised. \n...and puts the pills down. \nNORMAN (gently) Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong. \nCLAIRE I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some \"symptom\" of something... \nNORMAN I never said... \nCLAIRE ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up. \nBeat. \nNORMAN Are you lonely? \nCLAIRE No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist! \nINT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY \nClaire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in her lap, arms crossed. \nDR. DRAYTON (O.S.) (a smooth, mellifluous baritone) Who's idea was it? \nCLAIRE Mine.  His.  We both...thought... \nShe trails off.  Camera slowly pulls back to reveal, DR. TIMOTHY DRAYTON, a stocky, light skinned black man in his late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes. \nCLAIRE I didn't want to come. \nDR. DRAYTON Then why did you? \nCLAIRE Because he was worried about me. \nDR. DRAYTON Your husband? \nCLAIRE Yes. (beat) I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace. \nDR. DRAYTON Do you really think so? \nCLAIRE No. \nThere's a pause. \nDR. DRAYTON Why is he worried? \nCLAIRE Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... (beat) Why is this so hard? \nDr. Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red FIREBALLS next to his chair.  He proffers it to Claire. \nDR. DRAYTON Fireball? \nCLAIRE You're joking. \nHe shakes his head.  She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it into her mouth. \nDR. DRAYTON It's hard because I'm a complete stranger and what we're talking about is incredibly personal.  Besides, the first time most people come here, a part of them is wondering if I'm gonna think they're crazy. \nShe sucks on the fireball and slowly nods. \nDR. DRAYTON Don't worry, I'm required to have at least three sessions in order to commit. \nHer eyes get a little wider. \nCLAIRE The planchette? \nJODY This. \nJody indicates the wooden pointing device.  Each woman grasps an edge. \nJODY (in a low voice) We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. (to Claire) What's her first name? \nCLAIRE I don't know. \nJody closes her eyes.  Claire follows suit. \nJODY I call forth the entity that is haunting this house. \nThey look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved. \nJODY Mrs. Feur? \nThere's still no movement. \nCLAIRE Nothing's happening. \nJODY Shhh. \nJody focuses intently. JODY Reveal yourself to us. \nA long moment passes.  It's starting to seem like a bust. Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.  Even Jody seems startled. \nJODY (to the spirit) Who...who are you? \nAt first, nothing happens.  Then, slowly, the planchette starts to move across the board. \nCLAIRE Are you doing that? \nJody shakes her head. \nCLAIRE I'm not doing that. \nThe planchette comes to rest on the letter \"M.\"  Moments later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on \"E.\" \nCLAIRE Oh... \nJODY M-E... \nIt starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space between \"E\" and \"F.\"  The planchette stops on \"F.\"  Jody removes her fingers from the device. \nJODY Mef?  What's Mef? \nCLAIRE It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her. \nSuddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F... \nJODY Shit... \nJody stumbles backwards, gasping. \nJODY Did you see that? \nClaire leans in. \nCLAIRE (to ghost) What happened to you? \nThe CANDLE GOES OUT. \nJODY Oh God... \nJody bolts.  Claire follows. \nEXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT \nClaire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the work room.  She holds onto her arm. \nJODY I have to go. \nCLAIRE Jody, wait. \nCooper's growling in the work room.  They look in. \nJODY Claire, this is...this is... \nClaire, transfixed, walks in. \nINT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nShe stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with letters at an amazing speed. \nMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF... \nCLAIRE No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. \nShe turns on a heel and walks toward her car. \nEXT.  CAMPUS - NIGHT \nNorman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of the concert hall next door. \nNORMAN You're overreacting. \nShe turns on him. \nCLAIRE Don't tell me how to react! \nNorman glances around at the crowded sidewalk. \nNORMAN Keep your voice down. \nCLAIRE I will NOT. \nSome of the bystanders stop to watch. \nCLAIRE (still loud) Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind... \nNORMAN (looking around) Claire, please... \nClaire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her intensity. \nCLAIRE ...But what if I'm not?  What if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can't move on while that's unresolved.  Can't you just... \nSomething behind him catches her eye.  She trails off. \nCLAIRE Wow... \nClaire walks past him toward the parking lot. \nNORMAN Claire, please... \nThere's a dangerous energy to her walk.  People step out of the way. \nEXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nClaire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's after.  MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his old Buick. \nCLAIRE (walking up) You! \nHe looks up at her. \nCLAIRE You think you're smart, don't you?  You think you got away clean.  Well, I know you killed her.  You drowned her in the bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and I'm gonna find her, you murdering sonofabitch. \nMr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.  Norman arrives at her side. \nMR. FEUR Who? \nCLAIRE (scoffing) Give me that shit.  Your wife. \nMR. FEUR I didn't kill my wife. \nNORMAN (to Mr. Feur) I'm sorry... \nCLAIRE (over Norman) Then where is she? \nHe stares at both Spencers for a moment.  Then calls past them. \nMR. FEUR Honey... \nClaire and Norman turn.  A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the passenger seat.  She turns.  IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS SEEN.  Claire looks sucker punched. \nINT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY \nClaire sits back in the chair.  She looks drained.  A soft rain taps against the windows. \nCLAIRE And his face...it seemed so gentle, and I knew...in that second I knew that I'd imagined the whole thing. \nDr. Drayton takes this in.  She seems genuinely frightened. \nCLAIRE What's happening to me? \nDR. DRAYTON Well, that's what we're here for. \nHe watches her calmly, some empathy on his face. \nDR. DRAYTON Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern. \nCLAIRE Yes, but... \nDR. DRAYTON Your friend saw them. \nClaire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher. She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes. \nMRS. FEUR Your house is so beautiful. \nCLAIRE Thank you. \nMRS. FEUR And these roses.  They're much prettier up close. \nShe regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.  She seems skittish and shy. \nCLAIRE I...there's something I have to ask you. \nMrs. Feur waits. \nCLAIRE That day...at the fence.  You seemed terrified.  I don't think I was imagining that. \nThere's a pause.  Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap. \nMRS. FEUR No. \nCLAIRE Of what?  What were you so afraid of? \nMRS. FEUR You're going to think I'm crazy or something. \nA tiny smile. \nCLAIRE Not this week. \nShe looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire. \nMRS. FEUR Love. \nCLAIRE What? \nMRS. FEUR Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? \nCLAIRE Um...sure. \nMRS. FEUR I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... (beat) I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home. \nClaire is mesmerized. \nMRS. FEUR You must think I'm pathetic. \nCLAIRE No.  No, I don't. \nMRS. FEUR I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here. (beat) Perhaps we could be friends. \nClaire stares at this strange, passionate woman. \nCLAIRE I would like that. \nMrs. Feur smiles at her. \nINT.  VOLVO - NIGHT \nClaire pulls up in front of a large NEW YORK HOTEL. \nNORMAN (on a cell phone) ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner. (to Claire) Sure you won't stay? \nCLAIRE No, it's fine.  I'm fine. \nNORMAN (tempting her) Really big bed. \nShe smiles and shakes her head.  Norman kisses her goodbye, then grabs his bag from the backseat. \nNORMAN Do I have everything? \nCLAIRE Yep. \nNORMAN Call ya later. \nHe starts to walk into the hotel. \nCLAIRE (O.S.) And you glad you married me? \nHe turns.  She's standing next to the car. \nNORMAN What? \nCLAIRE Are you glad?  I'm glad. \nNorman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand. \nNORMAN (softly) You know I am. \nCLAIRE Good. (She gazes at him, then softly) You sat in front...I saw you there... \nCAITLIN I know he does. \nBeat.  Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter. \nCAITLIN Are you mad at me? \nCLAIRE Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother. \nThey hug.  For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back. Her eyes well up. \nCLAIRE I miss you. \nCAITLIN So much. \nCLAIRE (laughing) It got so bad your father almost had to put me away. \nCAITLIN What do you mean? \nCLAIRE I started seeing things. \nCAITLIN A ghost? \nBeat.  Claire stares at her daughter. \nCLAIRE Did you? \nCAITLIN No.  But once I heard... \nCLAIRE What? \nCAITLIN Someone crying.  A girl. (beat) I thought I was crazy. \nCLAIRE (quietly) Then we both are. \nCaitlin nods. \nINT.  PRESIDENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n...a large cocktail party.  The house is crowded with PROFESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, and their SPOUSES.  PRESIDENT TEMPLETON, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with his WIFE, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties. \nTEMPLETON There they are. \nNORMAN You remember my wife, Claire. \nMRS. TEMPLETON (shaking hands) Of course.  You must be so proud. \nCLAIRE I am. \nMRS. TEMPLETON (to Norman) Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity. \nShe takes their coats.  Dean Templeton leads them in. \nTEMPLETON Must've been some paper.  Your father would be very proud. \nThis seems to strike a nerve. \nNORMAN Uh-huh. \nClaire notices this and squeezes his hand.  Templeton leads Norman into a large living room which is filled with colleagues.  Several of them turn and begin clapping.  Others follow suit. \nEXT.  PATIO - NIGHT \nClaire stands at a small bar. \nCLAIRE (to bartender) White wine please. \nShe scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate conversation with each other.  She's speaking about something astonishing.  He's rapt. \nClaire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED ALUMNUS holds forth.  He sees her and mouths, \"I'm sorry.\" He points to his watch and flashes five fingers.  She smiles and nods. \nVOICE (O.S.) Guess I'm not much of a medium. \nShe turns to see Jody. \nCLAIRE Jody... \nThey hug. \nJODY Are you okay? \nCLAIRE I think so \nJODY I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire... \nCLAIRE It's alright. \nJODY I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen. \nCLAIRE Right. \nMrs. Templeton leaves.  Claire looks into the mirror. \nCLAIRE (V.O.) What was it about? \nEXT.  TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nClaire and Norman walk toward the car. \nNORMAN You don't remember? \nCLAIRE When she said it, there was something familiar...but no. \nHe looks at her for a moment. \nNORMAN You dropped a glass. \nCLAIRE I... \nNORMAN A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you... \nCLAIRE (something's triggered) In the living room... \nNORMAN You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home. \nCLAIRE But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely-- \nNORMAN It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time. \nCLAIRE But I don't remember. \nNORMAN Sweetheart, it was over a year ago. \nCLAIRE What's wrong with me? \nHe stops, takes her shoulders gently. \nNORMAN (reassuring) Nothing.  Nothing at all.  It's been a hard year.  But you're better now.  And things are really looking up for us.  So let's try to enjoy that. (gently) Please? \nShe thinks for a beat. \nCLAIRE Yes.  Yes.  That's what I want. \nShe takes his hand and kisses it. \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY \nClaire walks up to the door.  When she touches the knob she hears...the WHISPERING.  She opens the door and moves into: \nINT.  FOYER - DAY \nThe same intense whispered exchange.  She glances into the mirror and sees...SHAPES MOVING, BODIES, A FLASH OF SILVER. She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE. \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY \nShe walks in and stands before: \nThe repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party for the DUPONT CHAIR. \nShe takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the picture from the broken glass.  The caption reads: \n\"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman.\" \nShe stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over and scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly contested city council race, another contains details of a large alumni donation to the university. \nShe notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't noticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL. \nINT.  WORK ROOM - DAY \nClaire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  She narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND.  A screen pops up with a list of names.  She scrolls down the list until she finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH. \nCLAIRE M-E-F... \nClaire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a blurry cyber photo fills the screen.  Slowly, higher resolution moves down the image. \nIT'S THE GHOST. \nUnder the photo is the legend: \n\"DISAPPEARED - OCTOBER 22, 1998\" \nClaire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits PRINT. \nLATER \nClaire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out. \nClaire rings the bell.  A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early fifties answers the door. \nCLAIRE Mrs. Frank? \nMRS. FRANK Yeah. \nCLAIRE I'd like to talk to you about Madison. \nMRS. FRANK You know where she is? \nCLAIRE No, I don't. \nMRS. FRANK Please leave me alone. \nShe starts to close the door.  Claire leans forward. \nCLAIRE She's my friend. \nThe woman stops. \nCLAIRE Was.  We were...acquainted.  I've been away for awhile.  When I came back... \nShe studies Claire. \nMRS. FRANK What's your name? \nCLAIRE Claire. \nMRS. FRANK She never mentioned you. \nClaire doesn't know what to say to this. \nMRS. FRANK Then again, she didn't say much about her college friends. \nShe gives Claire the once over. \nMRS. FRANK I'm watchin' my shows. \nShe motions Claire in. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY \nClaire sits on a couch in the cramped living room.  Mrs. Frank serves up a mug of coffee.  A soap plays silently on an old 19\" RCA. \nMRS. FRANK Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense. \nCLAIRE It's fine. \nShe sizes Claire up. \nMRS. FRANK You look a little old for a student. \nCLAIRE I'm not.  We...we met at a party. \nMRS. FRANK Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it. \nCLAIRE She never mentioned her father. \nMRS. FRANK Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that. \nThere's a silence.  Mrs. Frank stares at the TV. \nMRS. FRANK Don't need the sound.  You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces.  Turn it up sometimes, though.  Feels like someone's here. \nClaire doesn't know what to say.  Mrs. Frank turns to her. \nMRS. FRANK Why are you here? \nCLAIRE I don't know. \nMRS. FRANK It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing. (beat) Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened. \nClaire stares at this tough, tragic woman. \nMRS. FRANK Wanna see her room? \nClaire nods. \nINT.  MADISON'S ROOM - DAY \nClaire enters the room.  Her face freezes. \nANGLE \nSEVERAL POSTERS FOR ALTERNATIVE AND METAL BANDS, side by side with ACADEMIC PLAQUES AND AWARDS. \nMRS. FRANK Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close. \n...then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room. \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY \nNorman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread. \nNORMAN I take it your not mad at me. \nCLAIRE Wouldn't go that far. \nShe grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the apple to his mouth.  Norman tentatively takes a bite.  She mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly. \nNORMAN (mouth full) Okay... \nWhen he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs down his chin.  Claire leans forward and licks it off. \nNORMAN What's gotten into you? \nShe just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him.  It looks like she's eating his lips.  Norman's getting hot.  She bites down on a lip. \nNORMAN Ow! \nCLAIRE What's the matter? \nNORMAN It's too rough. \nCLAIRE Since when? \nSomething about this response frightens him.  Claire yanks Norman's belt open.  He steps back, tripping over his castered desk chair.  She's on top of him in a flash, sitting astride him.  She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper. \nNORMAN I don't like this, this... \nCLAIRE (pinning his hands above his head) Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor. \nShe grinds up against him.  Suddenly, something pulls her eye to the hallway. \nPOV - The COAT RACK MIRROR, now from inside the study.  In it's reflection:  ANOTHER CLAIRE, shorter hair, stunned expression.  Where she's standing...it's DAYTIME. \nClaire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose. \nCLAIRE (tense whisper) I think she's starting to suspect something. \nNORMAN (through clenched teeth) Who? \nCLAIRE (leaning down) Your wife... \nNORMAN STOP IT! \nNorman shoves her off of him onto the floor.  He stands, breathless. \nNORMAN What the hell are you doing?! \nIn a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against the wall. \nCLAIRE (to herself, remembering) \"You know...\" \nNORMAN (rattled) What? \nShe looks up. \nCLAIRE I was there. \nNORMAN Claire-- \nCLAIRE (flooding back to her) I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house. \nNORMAN Oh God... \nCLAIRE I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now. \nHe just stares at her, his face anguished. \nNORMAN It was last year.  We were having troubles. \nCLAIRE So you fucked a student?! \nNORMAN (reaching for her) That's not what I'm sayi-- \nCLAIRE (pulling back) DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go! \nHe's frozen. \nCLAIRE I SAID GET OUT! \nNorman doesn't move.  He's never seen her like this. \nCLAIRE Fine... \nShe ambles off across the street.  Claire watches her go. Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  THREE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  She walks toward it. \nEXT.  SHOP - DAY \nClaire stands in front of the store window.  A sign in the window identifies it as \"The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought jewelry and gifts.\"  Claire tries to open the door, but sees a closed sign. \nShe steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios. \nSuddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD. \nHer eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.  Protruding from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  Claire looks like she's been punched. \nINT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nClaire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman.  She gingerly slides out of bed. \nINT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT \nClaire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album, tracking the years of their life.  Her hands tremble. Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches behind the photo and produces...THE KEY. \nEXT.  DOCK - NIGHT \nClaire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the dock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path. She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake. \nShe holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm lies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and stands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her once...then again. \nClaire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest, then carefully places it on the dock.  She very deliberately takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps off the dock. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs.  Norman bolts upright in bed. \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nNorman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.  He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting closed on his desk.  He looks around, sees the room is empty and walks over to it. \nThe mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is engraved:  To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F. \nHe pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside. \nTHE LIGHTS SWITCH ON. \nClaire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD NECKLACE. \nCLAIRE Looking for this? \nNorman stares at her dumbly. \nCLAIRE She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake. \nNORMAN Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is. \nCLAIRE Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed! \nNORMAN (nearly hysterical) I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have-- \nCLAIRE I don't believe you. \nNORMAN IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth! (beat, fighting tears) I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink. (beat) And I've lived with that image ever since. (beat) I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think! \nClaire's lip is quivering with confusion. \nCLAIRE I don't know what's true anymore. (beat) But that girl must be brought up.  Now do you want to call the police?  Or should I? \nNorman stares at the phone.  He's a wreck. \nNORMAN Fine.  I can't live with it anymore. \nHe takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits. \nNORMAN This is Dr. Norman Spencer.  No, it's not an emergency. \nHe looks at Claire. \nNORMAN I have some information about a missing girl, Madison Frank...Yes.  Could you send an officer?  Fifteen Willoughby, about a mile before the bridge...Thank you. \nHe hangs up.  Long silence.  They look at each other. \nNORMAN You did the right thing. (beat) I'm going to get cleaned up. \nHe walks out.  Claire walks over and stands before the box. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nClaire walks into the bedroom.  The shower can be heard through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  Steam drifts out through the crack. \nNORMAN That's a little much, don't you think? \nHe sees the necklace on her neck. \nNORMAN Oops.  Can't have that. \nHe puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around Claire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack. \nNORMAN'S POV \nHis arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE. \nNorman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS SHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils. \nClaire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.  The water slowly descends. \nWhen it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of air. \nThe drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She turns off the water and stands unsteadily. \nShe looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out of the room. \nINT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nClaire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs. \nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT \nShe fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty. \nShe spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles through the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open to see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the phone.  Then another.  It's blood. \nShe looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring down from the landing. \nShe reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in her hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself over the banister.  THUD! \nA BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the corner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles over on Norman. \nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nClaire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it. \nShe starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in the bed...nobody there. \nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT \nThe truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares at the door for signs of Norman. \nCLAIRE Come on...come on... \n...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway, constantly watching the door. \nWhen she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks into the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the open door, then clears.  Still nothing. \nEXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nClaire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road. \nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT \nShivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE. \nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge. \nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT \nANGLE \nClaire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across the windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in 911.  It blinks:  \"NO SERVICE.\" \nCLAIRE Shit. \nShe glances into the rear view mirror. \nCLAIRE'S POV \nA stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping in the breeze. \nClaire desperately punches the \"talk\" button again...\"NO SERVICE.\"  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks again:  \"ROAM.\"  Claire punches the talk button again. \nSMASH! \nA TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim visage pressed against the glass. \nShe squashes down the accelerator. \n", "test1_input": "In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the open trunk of his car. \nCLAIRE (in a hoarse whisper) Norman! \nHe's dead to the world.  She calls to him again. \nCLAIRE Norman, you have to look at this! \nNORMAN Mmnph. \nCLAIRE Hurry... \nAnother flash illuminates...Norman at her side. \nCLAIRE Look! \n...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness. \nNORMAN What is it?  What's the matter? \nShe stares down into the darkness. \nCLAIRE Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something. \nNORMAN Is it gone? \nTHE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods. \nNORMAN Come on, let's go back to bed. \nYet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the window. \nEXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING \nClaire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aims her camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at the FEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulled open, but no one's there. \nFeeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  The morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house. \nShe glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOW CLOSED. \nShe walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it. When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers across the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses: \nA DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a car pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her perch. \nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY \nClaire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes. \nCLAIRE Hey there. \nJody hugs her. \nJODY How you holding up? \nCLAIRE Good.  I'm good. \nJODY You are? \nCLAIRE Why does everyone find that so surprising? \nJODY (are you kidding?) Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping... \nCLAIRE Okay, I'm a little tender. \nJODY Well good.  So you're human. \nCLAIRE And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club. \nJODY Wow.  Got here just in time. (reaching into her bag) I brought you this. \nShe proffers several homemade tea bags. \nCLAIRE What is it? \nJODY Kambucha mushroom tea... \nCLAIRE Jody-- \nJODY It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring-- \nCLAIRE You're discussing me with your psychic? \nJODY She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit. \nCLAIRE Thanks, but I'm fine. \nJODY (pressing it into her hand) So you'll have some later. (beat) Notice anything...different? \n", "test1_true": "CLAIRE Oh my god.  You bought it. \nJODY Yep. \nCLAIRE It's niiice. \nJODY Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes? \nCLAIRE Absolutely. \nJODY Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning? \nCLAIRE You got it. \nJody grins. \nJODY See you then. \nJody drives off.  Claire walks down the driveway to her front door and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.  She starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut. \nClaire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the doorknob.  She stops.  A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from within.  Claire quietly opens the door and moves into: \nINT.  FOYER - DAY \nClaire stops inside the door.  Now it sounds like WHISPERING. Two voices, tense, impassioned.  It seems to be coming from Norman's study.  She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the room. \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY \nBut the whispering has suddenly stopped. \nCLAIRE Hello? \nThe lovely circular room is completely empty.  She looks around, puzzled.  Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually ambles over. \nCLAIRE (to Cooper) Please tell me you heard that. \nEXT.  LAKE - DAY \nClaire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at the water's edge.  Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.  Claire gazes at the LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance. Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water. \nClaire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark water. \nCLAIRE Cooper...what do you see? \nShe looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection. After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in the reflection of her face.  Cooper rumbles a low growl.  The shape seems to be gaining definition. \nRRRING! \nClaire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her sweater and pulls out a cordless phone. \nCLAIRE (into phone) Hi. \nNORMAN (V.O.) (on the other end) I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. \nClaire's smile fades. \nCLAIRE Oh. \nNORMAN (V.O.) Unless you need me to come home... \nCLAIRE No, no.  It's fine. \nClaire slowly leans out over the water to check her reflection... \nNORMAN (V.O.) You sure? \n...but the shape is gone. \nNORMAN (V.O.) Claire? \nCLAIRE Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time. \nShe clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water. \nINT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nClaire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses intently on the screen. \nANGLE \nIt's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of musical notes, parades across the screen. \nQUEEN OF HEARTS (on computer) You lost!  Off with your head! \nClaire hits \"New Game\" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber solitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen. \n", "test1_id": 120, "test2_input": "CLAIRE She did it. \nNORMAN We don't know that for sure. \nCLAIRE Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be? \nThe enormity of this hits Norman.  His head drops into his hands. \nNORMAN Oh God, what have I done?  How could I have let this into our lives? \nHe looks up at her, teary. \nCLAIRE I don't know. \nShe gets up and walks out of the room. \nEXT.  JODY'S STUDIO - DAY \nAn old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished oil paintings.  Jody brings Claire some tea. \nCLAIRE ...and everything I have, everything I thought my life was...Christ when I think of all the lies... \nJody looks down. \nCLAIRE What? (beat) Jody what? \nJody looks up, tears in her eyes. \nCLAIRE Oh God...you knew. \nJODY I was down in Adamant... \nCLAIRE Adamant? \nJODY Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe. \nClaire waits for her to continue. \nJODY I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young. (beat) I should have said something right away. But I didn't. \nCLAIRE Why? \nJODY Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved. \nCLAIRE Relieved? \nJODY I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed. \nClaire nods. \nJODY By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late. \nCLAIRE Too late?  Jody, it was an accident. \nJODY Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system? \nClaire walks over to a window. \nJODY I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away. \nCLAIRE All of us. \nBeat. \nJODY I'm a terrible friend. \nCLAIRE No. \nClaire turns. \nCLAIRE How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself? \nJODY What are you going to do? \nCLAIRE I don't know. \nJODY If she was dangerous before-- \nCLAIRE She could have hurt me if she wanted to. \nJODY You don't know that. (beat) If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection. \nCLAIRE No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace. \nJody isn't as sure. \nINT.  KITCHEN - DAY \n", "test2_true": "INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - MORNING \nClaire enters.  The bed is empty.  The shower is running in the bathroom. \nCLAIRE Norman? \nINT.  BATHROOM - MORNING \nANGLE - CLAIRE...her face a mask of terror. \nCLAIRE Oh God... \nCLAIRE'S POV \nThe BATHTUB, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the water blasting.  Norman's limp hand pokes through the curtain.  AN ELECTRIC CORD leads from the mirror socket into the tub. \nClaire races over and rips the plug from the wall.  She tears the SHOWER CURTAIN AWAY to find A BLUISH NORMAN lying, unconscious in the tub. \nCLAIRE No, no.  Please no... \nShe hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a heartbeat. \nCLAIRE Norman!!  Wake up!  Please! \nClaire shakes him to no effect. \nCLAIRE Oh God...NORMAN! \nShe slaps him on the face...once, then twice.  He suddenly sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns to life. \nCLAIRE It's me...it's me... \nSobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to pull him upright.  She discovered HER BLOWDRYER in the tub and hurls it across the room. \nINT.  BEDROOM - DAY \nClaire sits beside Norman on the bed as two E.M.T.'s, an OLD GUY and a HEAVY WOMAN pack up.  Stan's on the phone, Jody off to one side. \nHEAVY WOMAN Vitals are good.  I'd take it easy for a couple of days. \nNORMAN Thanks. \nThe E.M.T.'s leave as Stan hangs up. \nSTAN They'll take you for a CAT scan tomorrow if you're feeling dizzy at all. \nNORMAN That won't be necessary. \nHe glances at Claire as he walks Stan out. \nNORMAN Not unless there's a miracle drug for clumsiness. \nThey leave. \nCLAIRE Jody, she tried to kill him. \nJODY I know. \nCLAIRE I can't believe this is happening. \nJODY We need help.  Please let me call the medium. \nCLAIRE That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead. \nJody thinks for a moment. \nJODY Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it. \nCLAIRE Like what? \nJODY I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up... \nCLAIRE What is it? \nCUT TO: \nMADISON'S SMILING FACE \nEXT.  DOCK - DAY \nClaire's staring down at the PRINTOUT.  She's kneeling at the edge of the dock.  From her pocket she produces THE BLOND BRAID and a piece of TWINE.  She wraps the braid up in the printout with a rock and secures it with the twine. \nCLAIRE Sorry.  Better or worse, he's mine. \nShe tosses the little parcel into the dark water.  Bubbles stream up.  In the bubbles, Claire sees...THE PALE SHAPE, which slowly becomes THE DROWNED GIRL, staring up from beneath the dark water. \n", "test2_id": 121, "test3_input": "Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.  Madison reaches up toward the surface.  As the bubble diminish, she seems to be FADING AWAY.  When she's gone, Claire reaches out toward the water.  When her finger touches the surface... \nWHOOSH!  She's sucked down into the water. \nINT.  UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM - DAY \nNorman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off the dock.  He races out of the room. \nEXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY \nClaire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her deeper into the murky depths. \nEXT.  DOCK - DAY \nNorman sprints toward the dock. \nEXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY \nAs he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as her hand plunges into the muddy bottom. \nSuddenly, she's released.  She yanks her hand free, the silt swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud. \nNORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards. \nEXT.  DOCK - DAY \nNorman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock.  They hold each other. \nNORMAN Are you okay? \nShe nods, catching her breath. \nNORMAN We have to get out of here. \nCLAIRE It's alright. \nNORMAN Can't you see, she's trying to kill us. \nCLAIRE She's gone. \nNORMAN What? \nCLAIRE She can't be here without me. \nNORMAN How can you be sure? \nCLAIRE I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it. \nNORMAN Claire... \nShe stares into the still water. \nCLAIRE It's over. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nClaire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her.  Norman walks in with some steaming mulled cider.  He stokes the blazing fire.  He sits on the edge of the bed. \nNORMAN I know it's going to take awhile before things are back...until they're better than before.  But you've given us a chance to make a fresh start.  And I'm going to spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did. \nThe gaze at each other.  Tentatively, she places a hand on his. \nEXT.  GARDEN - DAY \nClaire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her rosebushes for the winter.  She picks up a basket of clipped flowers and heads inside. \nEXT.  PORCH - DAY \nShe turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering.  All is quiet. \nINT.  FOYER - DAY \nShe looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the lake behind it. \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY \nClaire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over. \nWith a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the wooden floor.  The stream has flowed over to the knot and dripped into the crack.  Claire stares down at THE STRANGE COPPER COIN. \nShe grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the coin out.  It's actually a SMALL BRASS KEY, the head of which is THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES.  She stares at it for a moment, then places it in her pocket. \nEXT.  SAILBOAT - DUSK \nClaire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.  The leaves on the surrounding hills are stunning.  Norman appears beside her. \nNORMAN Last sail of the year. \n", "test3_true": "CLAIRE The leaves... \nNORMAN Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast. \nCLAIRE Look for antiques... \nNORMAN Yep.  There's some great places nearby. \nCLAIRE (a reflex) Adamant. \nNORMAN What? \nCLAIRE Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming. \nNORMAN Huh. \nCLAIRE Do you know it? \nNORMAN Don't think so. \nCLAIRE Maybe we can stop there for lunch. \nHe wraps an arm around her. \nNORMAN Whatever you'd like. \nShe leans against him, staring out. \nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY \nJody and Claire return from a walk.  Norman has the boat on the trailer and is securing a tarp over it.  They stop under a tree. \nCLAIRE But he acted like he'd never heard of it. \nJODY Did he say that? \nCLAIRE Jody he was lying. \nJODY What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start? \nCLAIRE I guess not. \nJODY He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too. \nNorman smiles and waves.  They wave back as they arrive at the Karman-Ghia. \nJODY You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. (beat) I've come to think that's all that really matters. \nCLAIRE I don't know... \nJODY Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. (beat) You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go. \nJody drives off.  Claire walks over to Norman.  She hugs him tightly. \nNORMAN What's that for? \nCLAIRE Nothing. \nNORMAN I'm cooking you dinner. \nCLAIRE You don't have to do that. \nNORMAN I know. \nCLAIRE Fine.  I'll do the shopping. \nThey kiss.  She heads to the Volvo. \nINT.  VOLVO - DAY \nClaire is approaching a country market.  She spots a little sign with an arrow: \nADAMANT - 11 mi. \nShe hesitates for a moment, then take the turn. \nEXT.  ADAMANT - DAY \nClaire stands on a street in the quaint little village.  She looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.  A friendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store.  She watches Claire gazing around. \nHIPPIE WOMAN What are you looking for? \nCLAIRE I don't really know. \nHIPPIE WOMAN Know what you mean. \n", "test3_id": 122}

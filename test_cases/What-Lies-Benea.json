{"test1_input": "INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nShe glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves into: \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nShe dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through the phone. \nCLAIRE (straining to be heard) Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer. She's in 314...Well, could you check? \nShe plugs one ear. \nCLAIRE Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse me, how can you study with that? \nThe noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a classical music station. \nINT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nShe walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then hears a different set of musical notes from the computer. She stares at the screen, stunned. \nANGLE \nThe game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN! \nCLAIRE Oh.  Kay. \nWithout warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish rock and roll. \nCLAIRE Jesus... \nShe bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.  She follows him. \nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT \nThe foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire nervously walks out and looks around. \nCLAIRE Cooper! \nPOV - THE GARDEN \nNo sign of the dog. \nClaire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly into the study. \nCLAIRE Hello...?! \nThe whispering stops. \nINT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT \nClaire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD STUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt and tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming some unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness. She stops by the door to watch him. \nNORMAN ...and then what...Courtney? \nAn intense ASIAN GIRL answers. \nCOURTNEY We administer the Halothane. \nNORMAN Dosage? \nShe glances at her notes. \nCOURTNEY Three point five cc's. \nNORMAN Excellent.  Properties?  Andrew from downtown... \nAndrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this. \nANDREW An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent, which when administered in aerosol form temporarily renders the subject immobile. \nNORMAN Nothing but net. \nHe measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep. \nNORMAN Prudence here's an old friend. \nHe moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheep suddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around and begins a brief procedure. \nNORMAN I try to stay on her good side because I owe her my career and most of our grant money.  Why else? \nHe completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly. \nNORMAN Always do unto others as you'd have others do unto your ewe. \nGroans, laughter.  He stops Claire. \nNORMAN That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday! \n", "test1_true": "NORMAN (warm) What are you doing here? \nCLAIRE There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you. \nShe watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led out of the room. \nNORMAN What do you mean?  Some noises where? \nCLAIRE In the house.  I was scared. \nNORMAN Did you call the police? \nCLAIRE No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning. \nNORMAN Of course. \nHe takes her arm. \nINT.  THE FOYER - NIGHT \nNorman pushes open the front door.  Cooper pads over, wagging his tail.  They walk together past the stereo into... \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n...the living room.  All is quiet.  They move into... \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nIt's undisturbed.  Norman checks the window locks. \nCLAIRE It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering. \nNORMAN What kind of whispering? \nCLAIRE I don't know.  Just...whispering. \nHe nods as Cooper appears. \nNORMAN What'd you see, Coop? \nThe dog stares blankly. \nCLAIRE (to Cooper) Tell him! \nNorman smiles. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNorman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes. \nNORMAN I'm gonna have the police check on the house. \nClaire leans against the window sill. \nCLAIRE Oh great, \"Can you look in on my wife, she's hearing voices?\"  Wait'll that gets around. \nHe walks over to her. \nNORMAN I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe. \nCLAIRE I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day? \nHe goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box in his dresser. \nNORMAN Think I may have cracked it. \nCLAIRE Really? \nShe produces a match and lights it.  They sit on the bed. \nNORMAN I think so.  Maybe. \nCLAIRE You are so brilliant. \nNORMAN Yep. \nCLAIRE Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer... \nNORMAN (smiling) You know what that does to me. \nShe takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck. \nNORMAN (stopping) Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway... \nCLAIRE You're kidding. \n", "test1_id": 120, "test2_input": "...then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room. \nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY \nNorman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread. \nNORMAN I take it your not mad at me. \nCLAIRE Wouldn't go that far. \nShe grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the apple to his mouth.  Norman tentatively takes a bite.  She mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly. \nNORMAN (mouth full) Okay... \nWhen he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs down his chin.  Claire leans forward and licks it off. \nNORMAN What's gotten into you? \nShe just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him.  It looks like she's eating his lips.  Norman's getting hot.  She bites down on a lip. \nNORMAN Ow! \nCLAIRE What's the matter? \nNORMAN It's too rough. \nCLAIRE Since when? \nSomething about this response frightens him.  Claire yanks Norman's belt open.  He steps back, tripping over his castered desk chair.  She's on top of him in a flash, sitting astride him.  She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper. \nNORMAN I don't like this, this... \nCLAIRE (pinning his hands above his head) Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor. \nShe grinds up against him.  Suddenly, something pulls her eye to the hallway. \nPOV - The COAT RACK MIRROR, now from inside the study.  In it's reflection:  ANOTHER CLAIRE, shorter hair, stunned expression.  Where she's standing...it's DAYTIME. \nClaire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose. \nCLAIRE (tense whisper) I think she's starting to suspect something. \nNORMAN (through clenched teeth) Who? \nCLAIRE (leaning down) Your wife... \nNORMAN STOP IT! \nNorman shoves her off of him onto the floor.  He stands, breathless. \nNORMAN What the hell are you doing?! \nIn a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against the wall. \nCLAIRE (to herself, remembering) \"You know...\" \nNORMAN (rattled) What? \nShe looks up. \nCLAIRE I was there. \nNORMAN Claire-- \nCLAIRE (flooding back to her) I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house. \nNORMAN Oh God... \nCLAIRE I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now. \nHe just stares at her, his face anguished. \nNORMAN It was last year.  We were having troubles. \nCLAIRE So you fucked a student?! \nNORMAN (reaching for her) That's not what I'm sayi-- \nCLAIRE (pulling back) DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go! \nHe's frozen. \nCLAIRE I SAID GET OUT! \nNorman doesn't move.  He's never seen her like this. \nCLAIRE Fine... \n", "test2_true": "INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nShe grabs her coat. \nNORMAN (welling up) Claire, please don't... \nCLAIRE What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music... \nNORMAN I never asked you to quit! \nCLAIRE ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family... \nHe follows her as she searches for her purse and keys. \nNORMAN THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her. \nCLAIRE Who? \nNORMAN To Caitlin!! \nShe wheels on him with fury. \nCLAIRE Leave her out of this! \nNORMAN And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive... \nCLAIRE Stop... \nNORMAN ...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped. \nCLAIRE I'm not going to listen to this. \nClaire goes to leave, Norman blocks her path. \nNORMAN I tried to break it off! \nCLAIRE You should have tried harder. \nNORMAN Claire... \nCLAIRE (seething) Get out of my way. \nShe brushes past him. \nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT \nHe catches up, beside himself. \nNORMAN PLEASE DON'T GO! \nClaire's nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst. She turns at the door and looks back. \nCLAIRE You made it impossible for me to be someone you could be in love with. \nShe leaves. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nNorman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table.  He awakens to find Claire sitting across from him. \nCLAIRE I want you to answer one question. \nHe waits. \nCLAIRE Did you have anything to do with her disappearance? \nBeat. \nNORMAN Yes. \nClaire goes pale. \nNORMAN She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house... \nCLAIRE How did she know where it was? \nHe stares off.  The reality sinks in for Claire. \nCLAIRE (softly) Our dream house. \nNorman can hardly look at her. \nNORMAN She was out of control.  She said she was going to kill herself...or you.  I never thought she'd go through with any of it, but then she was gone... \nHe trails off. \n", "test2_id": 121, "test3_input": "NORMAN That's a little much, don't you think? \nHe sees the necklace on her neck. \nNORMAN Oops.  Can't have that. \nHe puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around Claire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack. \nNORMAN'S POV \nHis arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE. \nNorman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS SHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils. \nClaire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.  The water slowly descends. \nWhen it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of air. \nThe drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She turns off the water and stands unsteadily. \nShe looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out of the room. \nINT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nClaire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs. \nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT \nShe fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty. \nShe spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles through the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open to see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the phone.  Then another.  It's blood. \nShe looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring down from the landing. \nShe reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in her hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself over the banister.  THUD! \nA BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the corner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles over on Norman. \nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nClaire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it. \nShe starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in the bed...nobody there. \nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT \nThe truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares at the door for signs of Norman. \nCLAIRE Come on...come on... \n...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway, constantly watching the door. \nWhen she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks into the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the open door, then clears.  Still nothing. \nEXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nClaire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road. \nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT \nShivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE. \nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge. \nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT \nANGLE \nClaire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across the windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in 911.  It blinks:  \"NO SERVICE.\" \nCLAIRE Shit. \nShe glances into the rear view mirror. \nCLAIRE'S POV \nA stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping in the breeze. \nClaire desperately punches the \"talk\" button again...\"NO SERVICE.\"  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks again:  \"ROAM.\"  Claire punches the talk button again. \nSMASH! \nA TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim visage pressed against the glass. \nShe squashes down the accelerator. \n", "test3_true": "The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the pickup.  Claire chokes, then blacks out. \nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP. \nThe truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled through the rear window and into the passenger side dashboard. \nINT.  PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER \nClaire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of blood runs from her nose.  Norman stirs briefly as Claire groggily comes to.  She hears the hissing of the smashed radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the floor of the cab. \nShe leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into the water. \nBefore she can get the door open, the truck is half submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts to pull herself out. \nHer ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks onto her ankle and yanks her inside.  Norman pulls her down until they're face to face. \nCLAIRE Norman...NO... \nShe yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp. The truck is nearly submerged. \nCLAIRE (desperately) Norman, please... \nThe water is up to the windows.  Norman shakes his head slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes. \nCLAIRE Think of Caitlin... \nWater sprays in through the hole in the rear window and momentarily blinds Norman.  Claire jerks free and scrambles out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks. \nJust as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  She looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand clamped onto her ankle. \nThere is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurches downward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.  The boat buoys it like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake. \nThe headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater drop off.  Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not letting go. \nSuddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer. It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights reveal... \nMADISON'S SUBMERGED MUSTANG \nSMASH! \nWhen the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car, the Mustang's windshield shatters.  A PALE SHAPE FLOATS UPWARD. \nNorman is suddenly entangled by something.  He tries to brush it free but comes face-to-face with MADISON'S GHASTLY, DECOMPOSED FACE.  The last of his air bellows out of him in a scream as he releases Claire's ankle. \nHis dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom. \nEXT.  LAKE - DAWN \nClaire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air. \nCUT TO: \nUNDERWATER - DAWN \nThe sound of a furious cello solo. \nCOLD STARING EYES \nNorman, half out of the truck, arms floating. \nFollow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle. \nMove through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed back.  As she twists into view... \nMORPHS INTO:  MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace. \nCamera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach. \nCUT TO: \nFINGERS \n...filled with moist earth.  A hand tosses the clump of dirt onto... \nEXT.  CEMETERY - DAY \nA CASKET \nWiden to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from the grave.  A tiny arm snakes around her waist.  She glances down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother tightly.  Claire takes a last look into the grave. \nCLAIRE Rest in peace. \nTHE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK \n", "test3_id": 122}

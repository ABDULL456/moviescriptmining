{"train": "127 HOURS \nWritten by \nSimon Beaufoy & Danny Boyle \nEXT. CROWD SCENES. VARIOUS. \nA massive crowd, it could be a sports stadium, a u2 farewell show or new year's eve on copacabana beach, but whatever it is there are thousands and thousands of us. A mexican wave erupts success, celebration, with so many involved it's impossible to pick out anyone individually. Critical mass cyclists, easter crowds at st. Peter's basilica, nyc marathon, 4,000 flash mobbers doing the silent disco at london's victoria station, india's kumbh mela, macy's thanksgiving day parade, raves, subway parties, the daytona 500. . . . Gradually the screen splits into 2, and then 3, though at times there appears to be no division at all. \nEXT. FREEWAY. NIGHT. \nAn overhead shot of a crammed freeway gives way to a single vehicle, a 98 Toyota Tacoma, red and white with a topper. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. \nCut inside as Aron Ralston, 27 cuts off the freeway. \nTRIPTYCH. \nOPENING TITLES ARE A SERIES OF TRIPTYCHS FEATURING ALL THE TITLE CARDS EXCEPT THE MAIN ONE. THEY BLEND, OVERLAP AND ARE INTERCUT WITH ADVERTS SOME FROM THE BILLBOARDS ARON'S VAN PASSES, SOME FROM TELEVISION AND SOME FROM THE RADIO. AND, OF COURSE, ALL THESE INTERCUT WITH ARON AND HIS TRUCK. AND THE LANDSCAPE. \nA TITLE CARD READS: 'Utah. The Canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky-all that which lies beyond the end of the roads.' \nEdward Abbey. Desert Solitaire. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD. NIGHT. \nEventually Aron's truck is now alone on an interstate road. \nINT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. \nAt the southwest edge of Green River, Aron Ralston drives under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity. He looks to his right and left, not a single light perforates the absolute blackness of the San Rafael Desert. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. \nFrom high above, three quarters of the screen is black and we see his truck's lights running parallel with the blackness. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. \nA sign flashes by: Next Service: 110 miles America's challengers for the Tour de France flash by in a pack of 15 or so neon spirits. Night training. \n10PM. \nA BLM sign indicates that Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead is 47 miles ahead through the desert darkness. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING AREA. NIGHT. \nGhostly, but there are three other vehicles and two encampments at the Trailhead, despite signs prohibiting camping. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. \nHe turns off the music and waits for a head to pop out or a light to come on but they have all turned in. Ghostly. He glides to a flat spot near the sign board welcoming visitors to the Horseshoe Canyon quadrant of Canyonlands National Park. He whips into the back of the truck and flings everything out of the way of his sleeping bag and pad. Black. \nEND OF TRIPTYCH TITLE SEQUENCE. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nBut no rest. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S TRUCK. DAY. \nThe doors smash open to reveal a glorious day and Aron's bike careers into it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. VARIOUS. \nIt's still like a wild road movie, but now on a bicycle. Having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the land like an ad for extreme sports. Past bikers, he vanishes temporarily in their dust cloud, he wears a bandana across his face as the bikers pass by... a final telephone box, past remnants of those who tried to settle or work this unforgiving land; Aborigines, frontier settlers, ranchers... all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into....... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. CU on ARON. Wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend socks, Lycra biking shorts and a Phish tee shirt he has a back pack with equipment but hydrates through a gallon of water stored in an insulated three litre CamelBak hydration pouch which he sucks on without stopping. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. DAY. \nHis bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone against what nature can offer. He's clearly a fit and daring young man and these are his kicks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. DAY. \nEven uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone. Gasping for oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can suck on his water again. Part of a massive clan who define themselves not by what they are, but by what they do. In a way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls. \nUntil... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. DAY. \nSuddenly, he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the handle bars, face first into the sand, his toe clips and momentum brings the bike with him. The bike has him trapped on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits, landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess. \nCUT TO: \nKRISTI ... and suddenly there's a guy right behind you and `wait a minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY \nMASK!' They all laugh. \nARON Let me guess... You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral? \nKRISTI The Cathedral? We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great. Where is it? \nARON The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it. \nKRISTI / MEGAN We climb. \nThey all laugh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVE. APPARENTLY SMOOTH DOME. DAY \nTowards us comes Aron, upside down, like a tiny, fast spider, talking all the time, his voice echoing. \nARON There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing... it's a bit of a act of faith so I'll go first... take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end... \nMEGAN (O.S.) You behave Aron Ralston or we'll tell your mother all about where you lure girls... \nARON I swear I won't look but I swear you won't care when you get out here... \nWe've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say the least. We can't see the girls or what's underneath us but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale of the dome. \nARON (CONT'D) ... and the thing is, when you get to the middle... He lets go. \nARON (CONT'D) ... there aren't any more. We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool 60 feet below. \nKRISTI \nOMG! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVE. DAY. \nThey can't see him. They can only hear the explosive crack of man on water. \nMEGAN Are you ok? ARON! \nKRISTI Of course he's ok. Listen to him. Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from Megan. \nKRISTI (CONT'D) Got to be there, Meg. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVE. DAY. \nFrom the pool below with Aron we see Kristi in her underwear heading out arachnid-style to the centre. Before she gets there Megan appears too. She's left everything on except her shoes. \nThey crash into the pool one after the other. They bob together in the centre, the light seems to come from beneath them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling. \nARON Solitude. Great tunes. Empty mind. He indicates the wilderness. \nARON (CONT'D) And I can sing Phish songs as loud as I like. \nMEGAN Phish? \nKRISTI Not those guys from... \nARON Yeah, I know, I know. \n(LAUGHS) See, that's why I'm on my own. Nobody likes me or my band. They laugh as he goofs for them. He gathers all their packaging and stuffs it in his backpack. \nARON (CONT'D) I'll get this. Leave no trace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BLUE JOHN CANYON. DAY. \nThey're walking again. \nARON (CONT'D) Hey, but I like a beer like the next man. You know, end of the day. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CANYON. GULLEY. \nThey're negotiating a steep gulley. Aron is 1/2 way down, Megan at the top, Kristi on her way down to him. \nARON I'm not certified yet but that's what I want to do. \nMEGAN An illegal instructor. \nARON It's hard to get the hours to qualify. Catch 22. \nKRISTI Well, we'll sign your time-card today. \nARON Great. Now put your ass on my head. \nKRISTI Okay but don't look and no grabbing now, if I do... \nMEGAN Oh whatever, you love it. \nKRISTI Shhh! \nAron then quickly slips to the bottom. Megan is way high, Kristi half way. \nARON (at his most instructor- ish, talking all the time as he makes his way down) You'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here, watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel, now your butt's on the wall, so you can move your right foot across, now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part, it's slick, slime, try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide. This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out. He looks up to them. \nMEGAN I didn't understand any of that. \nEXT. CONJUNCTION OF BLUE JOHN CANYON, WEST FORK, EAST FORK. \nLATER IN THE DAY. 2PM-ISH They come to a clear fork in the paths. He watches them turn their map round and round. \nMEGAN (CONT'D) Kristi, I think this is our way back. \nINT. CANYON FROM UNDERNEATH SILHOUETTED AGAINST SKY. DAY. \nAs before he squats and clambers down the back side of the stone to reduce his drop down. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. C/U TIGHT ON ARON. \nJust as he dangles there's a scraping sound, small but close, too close and the stone judders towards him, pulled by the torque of his weight on his side, rotating. Instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops. Like he's trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. ON CHOCKSTONE. DAY. \nBut it follows him down, somehow he's released its latent energy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. TIGHTER ON ARON. DAY. \nHe watches the chockstone follow him - not looking where he's going. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. ARON'S POV. DAY. \nThe backlit chockstone falling towards him consuming the sky. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. \nHis arms rise to protect his head but his eyes remain open and through his fingers we see the next 3 seconds. The rock's face and his. \nIt grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall. He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and careers towards his right arm which he raises, to compensate for withdrawing the left, and to protect his head. \nThe rock smashes the right hand and wrist against the wall and drags it down the remaining distance. Like a cheese grater it tears the skin from the back of the hand and the forearm, decorating the wall. Aron is powerless to stop its force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall by the stone. \nAll this happens too quickly. We can hardly register what's happened as everything stops. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nSilence. He's standing behind the rock. Like he's in a line for a bus. Like he's shaking someone's hand. A hand shake with the canyon. Silence. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE: \n127HOURS \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \n... to see the slot canyon, back and back and back, nothing more than a dry crack in the surface of this massive land. Gradually his cries for help become inaudible. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nHe unpacks everything with great energy, like a stocktake, and lays it all out on the surface of the rock; \nchocolate bar wrappers and bakery bag with crumbs of chocolate muffin inside that he volunteered to take away on behalf of the girls, 2 small bean burritos, cd player, cds , extra AA batteries, mini digital video camcorder, small multi- use tool and 3 LED headlamp. \nCUT TO: \nBIG C/U: VARIOUS. ... of all these elements - these are now his only companions and their POV of him reflects that as he tests each one for its potential, opening all the blades and laying them out to look at them; sunglasses - scratched, bike Ulok key, rock climbing harness, cloth goggles bag, rapelling equipment, water bottle, car keys, plastic grocery bag, empty de- hydration pack, money, credit cards, green and yellow climbing rope in black zippers bag, a stick, stones and sand. Everything. \nPause. He stares at it all and it all stares back at him. \nCUT TO: \nC/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS. \n3.28, changes to 3.29 \nHARD ENERGY CUT \nTO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nInside the tiny gap we see... his headlamp flick on to let him assess the rock and the wall and his hand in between it. He picks a point and begins to chip away with the knife. He's back - energy, movement, purpose, action makes him happy. He occasionally stops to look at his left hand, swollen and puffy and constantly in need of flexing. He gets into a rhythm of 'tick,tick,tick', flex and back again, `tick,tick,tick' \nCUT TO: \nTIGHTER C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS. 4.19pm, changes to 4.20 \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nIn a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground that there's a pile of steel filings from the knife itself, almost as big as the dust from the ground - \nARON Not good. He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust. \nARON (CONT'D) When in a hole.... Alternative; he starts digging away at the wall instead, same result. \nARON (CONT'D) Fuck. It's hard as iron. Pause. \nYou're gonna have to cut your arm off. \nAs if to answer that idea we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nTapping a rock in his hand onto the top of the knife as he balances it against the wall or with his mouth. Weird close angles as he almost taps the side of his eye socket. Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the rock. Once again, gravity takes over. The knife hits his shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his leg. He pivots and turns to try and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist and it falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his left foot - \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. \nARON What you're looking at there is my arm, going into the rock... and there it is, stuck. It's been without circulation for 24 hours. \n(MORE) \nARON (CONT'D) It's pretty well gone. If the colour doesn't come across on the video, it's grey and blue. \nARON (CONT'D) Unnhhhhh.......I'm in deep stuff. \nARON (CONT'D) So I have very little water. He can't help look in the camera towards those who know what that means in this place. \nARON (CONT'D) Yeah, I have about a third of a litre left. He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT/EXT. VARIOUS. CANYON. DAY. \nDifferent angle on the freeze-frame. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. VIDEO FOOTAGE. \nARON So the way I see it... there's kind of four things happening here... I tried to move it with some rigging... useless... and I tried chipping away at the rock... I think part of the problem is, is that my hand is actually supporting the rock. Which means every time I chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again. I can't feel it happening but microscopically, it seems to be, because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller. And this chockstone is the hardest thing here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WIDE. MOVING THROUGH CANYON. REALTIME. \nA breeze slides through the canyon and he shudders involuntarily for five seconds. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. \nARON So the third thing left was to cut my arm off. \nPAUSE \nARON (CONT'D) I don't know whether I could do that but it's pretty much suicide. It's four hours to my vehicle that way and with very difficult climbing with one hand and the bike is like two, two and a half hours, that way but the climbing... fourth class climbing... which I think will be probably impossible with one hand... between the blood loss and the dehydration I think I would die if I cut off my arm. \nARON (CONT'D) Which means I'm waiting for someone to come along. He summons up the guts to let the evidence out. \nARON (CONT'D) I didn't tell anyone where I was going and I didn't leave a note on the truck. \nARON (CONT'D) Dumb. The video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the lens. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. REALTIME. \nHe hears voices. \nHe rewinds to the end of the message and erases his futile calls for help. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ARON'S TRUCK. DAY. \nAron's Truck. We sense him in the cab but we're not inside with him yet. Music loud and pulsing as we travel towards the inflatable Scooby Doo. It's 12ft tall, powered by a mini- generator. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S TRUCK. DAY. \nAron swerves to affect the figure which buckles and flaps in his after-draft. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD. DAY. \nWe stay with the dancing figure as his truck drives away into the landscape. The generator fan rattles on as the booming bass of the truck fades. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. \nYou can see him thinking. Will the girls go to the party? \nEXT. GOOGLE-EARTH SATELLITE SHOT OF WILDERNESS. DUSK. \nWe're now high above the desert, and in the time-lapse we see the soft, grey, endless line of darkness cross right to left \nBRINGING - \nCUT TO: \nTITLE: \n\" NIGHT TWO \": \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. NIGHT. \nA flashing, strobe-ing light - Aron's head-lamp bouncing back and forth off the canyon walls - but also, as he continues to chip away... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. CANYON. NIGHT. \n...jump-cutting, strobe-lit as though by flash, of Aron madly dressing for the night. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nC/U: WATCH \nWe see the thermometer on his watch falling down and down from 70 => below 50. \nARON Always do. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nCUT TO: \nC/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS 11:59 => 00.00 in huge, luminous figures. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. NIGHT. \nHe pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the ground where he has half-buried it. It won't open. He can't unscrew it. He mutters, cursing himself for tightening the lid too much. He puts it between his teeth and levers with his head, but nothing. Is his strength vanishing so quickly? \nHe looks at his puffy left hand... there's a tremble in it. He shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle between his legs. He uses a bit of cloth to give his hand better purchase on the top. We're tight on the neck of the bottle as it releases, finally and he lifts it, slowly, almost ceremonially. Controlling the tilt, a half-mouthful of water slides onto his tongue. He tilts the bottle back towards upright but not the whole way. He waits. Circulating the splash of water around his mouth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. C/U: BOTTLE NECK \nThe bottle neck stares at Aron. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. C/U: ARON \n... his eyes staring at the bottle neck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. NIGHT. \nHe still holds the water in his mouth as he rewinds the top onto the bottle and reburies it in the sand to stop any evaporation. He moves to pop his contact lenses into his mouth and wash them in the moisture. First one then the other as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. \nThe images shift with the lens change back to his apartment, daylight, we sense him though he's probably in the shower. His ansaphone clicks in. \nANSAPHONE (MOM) Aron, it's Mom. Hoping to catch you. Nothing urgent. Dad's in New York so it'll be a quiet weekend. Aron is clearly there but can't answer. \nANSAPHONE (MOM) (CONT'D) Call me. Lots of love. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. \nIn front of his bathroom mirror he's slipping his lenses in for the day. It looks like The Man Who Fell To Earth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. C/U: VARIOUS. ARON & MIRROR. DAY. \nARON (CONT'D) (mutters, bitterly) It's cold... this place is an ice- box at night... And killing winds. \nPAUSE \nARON (CONT'D) (he struggles to complete the sense of the \nSENTENCE) \n\" - to do all the outings that I did\". PAUSE. As he loses track of what he's saying and then catches up, the canyon has become noticeably darker. He's oblivious. \nARON (CONT'D) I did want to say, on the logistical side of things, I have some American Express insurance that should cover costs of the recovery operation when that does happen. Bank account balances should take care of my credit-card debts. You'll have to sell my house, Mom and Dad. Possession- wise, I don't know if Sonja can use my computer and video camera... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. \nHe's interrupted by a sudden realization as he looks first one way up the canyon and then the other. He looks up at the sky above. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. ARON'S POV. \nThere's an angry looking black motherfucker of a cloud. \nCUT TO: \nHUGE C/U OF: A massive crack of noise like the land has split. His eyes staring up, unblinking, the corridor of light above him reflected in is contact lenses like mirrors. Suddenly a drop of water hits his eye like an invisible bomb dropping from the sky. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. DAY. \nWe're many miles away, the dust spits as though hit by silent bullet tracer fire. Raindrops gathering and multiplying, soaking and bouncing off the desert floor, they skim and slip into a groove and then another, the slit instantly fills and water drops crash on the new surface. The spillage spreads and fills everything near it. We tilt up, the sky is furious black, and murderous. Lightning arcs across hundreds of miles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. \nAron's sky darkens above him. Instantly plunging him into a dark, violet nether-light. He looks up the canyon as he pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid-out possessions into his backpack. Simultaneously he opens his mouth to gather any drops he can into his parched throat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. DAY. \nA channel fills now as the grooves spill and multiply. The water poured from above appears everywhere, visibility is virtually gone, whether it's through mist or darkness it's impossible to tell. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT. DAY. \nAnother channel explodes like a volcanic surging mass in every direction. The camera literally slips and slides as the water now seems to take a direction towards deeper gulleys, looking for something to fill, for somewhere to escape to. \nThe floor of the desert becomes a river careering towards the slot canyons. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. NIGHT. \nHe can't believe so little time has passed. He's only just closed his eyes. It's going to be a long night. The two bottles stand looking at him. He goes back in the head bag and we go with him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT \nHe holds the video camera at waist height and switches it to playback. He rewinds through his messages. Stops, switches off playback and rewinds the blue LCD screen to save battery. The light is surreal, soft LCD hell. \nCUT TO: \nHUGE C/U OF: Battery time. Time rewinding, hurtling backwards. \nStops. Plays back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CATHEDRAL CAVE. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. \nMegan and Kristi. The Cathedral. They clamber out in wet clothes - it's from after their first jumps. We see all three of them climb and fall and get out of the water and climb and fall, smashing into the azure water. Their faces are dripping wet, beaming mad, screaming and howling, completely natural, children really, on their first helter- skelter / Big Dipper. \nHe rewinds this time in vision. Kristi's bra and pants are soaking. Megan's top cascades water as she rises out of the water. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT \nFor Aron the volume of his and their shouting is deafening and the first human sounds he has heard for days. He watches, staring, laughing; not laughing, staring, eyes tearing in self-pity. \nCUT TO: \nC/U: VIDEO CAMERA \nHE STOPS IT IN VISION There's water, joy, 2 beautiful girls, happiness, sensuality, company, freedom... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT. \nHe looks at the picture and then into the bag. His breathing is hard, pronounced. He carefully tells himself.. \nARON No. No. Don't. \nHe sees the moisture on the inside of the bag, condensation. He licks it with his sticky tongue, twice, three times. He looks back at the LCD screen. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT. \nThe LCD looks back at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT. \nINT. CANYON. NIGHT. \nAron very still, listens to their screams. He looks at his knife dangling from his wrist by the shoelace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CANYON. SUNRISE. \nHundreds of miles of canyon - sunrise. The inner canyons change from dark umbers and black shadows to immense bands of pastel yellow, white, green and a hundred shades of red, a hallucinogenic movement towards light. \nV.O. `Good morning America!' etc. \nThere's a chorus of 'Good Mornings' from American TV & radio shows. Literally dozens of them from Texas to Oregon, Massachusetts to the Carolinas. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE: \n\" TUESDAY \": \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. MORNING. VIDEO FOOTAGE. \nAron joins the morning chorus. \nARON Good morning everyone! It's 6:45 Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The weather is great! I figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi Leona! - has missed me hopefully since I didn't show up last night. Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up for work. Hi Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted...I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sorta let it distill...it tastes like hell. So it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss. \nPause. Did I say the weather is great? Well, it is. Though flash floods potential is still present. There's 4-prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this 3 foot wide gap where I am. The rock I pulled down on top of me, it was put there by flood. \nPAUSE Still, I'd get a drink. He shudders, it's ridiculous. Then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight at the camera. \nARON (CONT'D) Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I wanted to take this time to say the times we've spent together have been awesome. I haven't appreciated you in my own heart the way I know I could. Mom, I love you. I wish I'd returned all of your calls, ever. \n(MORE) \nARON (CONT'D) I really have lived this last year. I wish I had learned some lessons more astutely, more rapidly, than I did. I love you. I'll always be with you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. MORNING. \nSwitches off the camera. He charges into setting up the 6:1 haul system again. Much quicker this time. He clears the rope - the rock - of his possessions and puts his sunglasses on. \nARON Ready for lift-off. He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line. It looks a better set up. \nARON (CONT'D) Come on, move, dammit. \nNothing. He stops. And stares directly at the knife below him. Absolute stillness. Nothing moves. Not him. Not even the insects. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. MORNING. \nThe knife stares back. \nTITLE: \n\" NIGHT FOUR. WEDNESDAY. NIGHT FIVE \" \nCUT TO: \nINT/EXT. VARIOUS. \nThe rest of Tuesday and night, and Wednesday and night play out through the triptych. Repetition is used to create a trippy sense of losing coherence- sometimes there's 3 Arons doing the same thing. It could be consecutive days or he's forgotten. \nAt key moments it resolves to one image and then back again. Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch the loops happening again and again. This is particularly true inside the head bag at night. When his light is switched on it's bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel HD close- up - his disintegration is terrifying. \nWhen it's off we establish a night vision, of green, of blue, that allows us to witness him in hiding. The images, sometimes of himself also, play out on the interior surface of the bag. The effect is like wraparound Imax, multi-screen Technicolor. \nINT. CANYON. DAY.

But I really don't know what to do. Pause. \nQuietly, deadly: \nVOICE I did this Aron. I created this. The boulder did what it was here to do. It was waiting for me but it did the only natural thing it could do. I chose to come here, I chose to do this descent by myself. I chose not to tell anyone where I was going. I chose to turn away from the women who were there to keep me from getting in this trouble. I wanted it to be like this. Look how far I came to find this spot. \nIt's not that I'm getting what I deserve - I'm getting what I wanted. He's empty now. He clicks the camera shut and puts it away. That's over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. \nHe looks at his 'good' hand. It's swollen and angry red like an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand. He takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock again. Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock surface. SMASH. MAD NOW. \nARON I hate this rock. The rage blooms purple in his mind. \nARON (CONT'D) I hate it. His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring. \nARON (CONT'D) I hate this fucking canyon. \nA small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts each time. \nARON (CONT'D) I hate this cold slab pressing me against this damp fucking wall. Smash, Smash, Smash. \nARON (CONT'D) I know there's water near coz of these fucking mosquitoes. \nThe sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers and hammers. \nARON (CONT'D) I hate this fucking mess. \nFinally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the stone drops to his feet. \nHe returns to the knife. Finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand. Like swollen angel hair pasta. The nerve. He touches it with the knife edge. \nARON \nAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH! \nHe explodes internally with vocal pain, through gritted teeth. The first time he has made any sound during the surgery.

Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing his arm into a cauldron of magma... \n(It's difficult to tell because everything is so tight and claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently riding his shoulders slipping across and around him, or obstructed by the boulder and stopped from getting to Aron) ...until it breaks. He shudders in shock and drops everything for minutes. His head lolls forward dripping. His mind swarming with trauma. And then he's back on the last action stretching the skin of his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall. It's a piece of gristle on a cutting board. Everything now is forcing us towards the boulder, cramping us in with him impossibly close, he's sweating and heaving, his vision blurring with tears, his contacts failing, his breath impossibly dry and rasping and then, as simply as this all began, his shoulders open and he's free...... He staggers back, one, two, three steps away from his arm... \nHis head swarming with colours, swooning, overpowering. He stares at his obituary as he's born again. His feet stagger under him like a new foal, an involuntary dance, we see colours bleeding and blending in his P.O.V.s and the colours invade our shots of him. \nARON (spitting out this declaration at the rock) \nI AM NOT GOING TO DIE....

He stuffs the repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift sling. Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine, video, pocket knife. Grabs his climbing rope, messy and knotted from its use as insulation, and heads off down the canyon. \nStops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat.

Then a feeble effort is lost in the vast scale of the canyon. The figures walk on bending and disappearing in the light. He digs deep. \nARON \nHELP! \nAnd the figures turn. There's a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and then he pushes out another heartbreaking - \nARON (CONT'D) \nHELP ME! I NEED HELP! The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in close up as they come. If tears come, then now they come at the sight of humans. He mutters to himself. \nARON (CONT'D) Hang in there Aron. At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from somewhere. \nARON (CONT'D) My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder on Saturday and I've been without food and water for 5 days. I cut my arm off this morning to get free and I've lost a lot of blood. I need medical attention. \nThere's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low budget horror movie.

We joked that we would keep our eyes open and that we would try to find him. After a hike of 5.3 kilometres to the Great Gallery (Indian rock art) where we took some pictures, we returned and suddenly heard a noise behind us, and after that a voice that cried \"Help, I need help\".

The vehicles' own headlights illuminate Rana, a stunningly beautiful red-haired woman in her mid-20s, effortlessly organising the 15 or so group. As before, we remain behind Aron. By the camera's virtually complete concentration on Rana it's clear he's a fan. \nRANA OK - lights off and line up alongside me.

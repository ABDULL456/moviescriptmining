You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral? \nKRISTI The Cathedral? We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great. Where is it? \nARON The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it. \nKRISTI / MEGAN We climb. \nThey all laugh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVE. APPARENTLY SMOOTH DOME. DAY \nTowards us comes Aron, upside down, like a tiny, fast spider, talking all the time, his voice echoing. \nARON There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing... it's a bit of a act of faith so I'll go first... take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end... \nMEGAN (O.S.) You behave Aron Ralston or we'll tell your mother all about where you lure girls... \nARON I swear I won't look but I swear you won't care when you get out here... \nWe've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider style. He's stripped to his underwear. He's lithe to say the least. We can't see the girls or what's underneath us but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale of the dome. \nARON (CONT'D) ... and the thing is, when you get to the middle... He lets go. \nARON (CONT'D) ... there aren't any more. We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool 60 feet below. \nKRISTI \nOMG! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVE. DAY. \nThey can't see him. They can only hear the explosive crack of man on water. \nMEGAN Are you ok? ARON! \nKRISTI Of course he's ok. Listen to him. Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from Megan. \nKRISTI (CONT'D) Got to be there, Meg. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVE. DAY. \nFrom the pool below with Aron we see Kristi in her underwear heading out arachnid-style to the centre. Before she gets there Megan appears too. She's left everything on except her shoes. \nThey crash into the pool one after the other. They bob together in the centre, the light seems to come from beneath them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling. \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVE.

Never mind, yes I can! \nKRISTI So have you got a girlfriend, Aron? \nARON Well, there's not really anyone special. \nMEGAN Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends. \nKRISTI There's always a girl, you just don't know it yet. \nMEGAN Yeah, we meet lots of guys and there's always a girl. \nARON Long story. \nKRISTI With lots of characters in it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

No. \nMEGAN Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's house - the roof's caved in and someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on the side. Smelled weird though. \nARON Just like a MOTEL 6 then? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

BLUE JOHN CANYON. DAY. \nARON Easy Aron, easy now. He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more circumspect. He lets the change of pace allow him to whip round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times selects and plays a CD without stopping, slipping the headphones over his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RUCKSACK. PORTABLE CD PLAYER. \nWe see the CD begin to spin: the display tells us there's 38:47 to play before 0:01 appears. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. C/U ARON'S EARS. DAY. \nSuddenly, louder than loud, the sound of fanatical 5,000 strong applause at the Phish live concert in Las Vegas, fills his head and ours. He's heard it many times as he alternatively anticipates/answers all the dialogue preamble mixed over the applause... \nCD RECORDING Good evening Las Vegas... are you having a good time? Are you ready for PHISH! Whether we are or not, the first song begins on a wave of adoration from his fellow Phish fans. He sings along. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BLUE JOHN CANYON. SHORT SLOT ENTRY. DAY. \nAron keeps descending, the canyon walls growing taller and closer, into the narrowing slot canyon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BLUE JOHN CANYON. S-SHAPED LOG. DAY. \nA dry waterfall, many months since it's seen rain. A drop of maybe 12/15 ft with no obvious climb down. Way beyond his reach and jammed into the walls of the canyon is an enormous S-shaped log, sand bleached and wind dried it looks like a massive reptile making its way down the canyon. Beyond it, Aron can see his route down disappearing into narrowing darkness. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CANYON WALL. DAY. \nTo reduce the drop he scrambles down clinging to the edge, pushes away and drops the final 6 feet or so landing in a fine cloud of sand. Nothing to it, second nature. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

DAY. \nThe slot is now just 4ft wide and as he stops to look at massive tree logs jammed at strange angles high above him and silhouetted against the blue cloudless sky, he drinks deeply from his water bottle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON RIM. LOOKING DOWN. DAY. \nOn we go and so does the concert. He pumps the air unaware as we track above him - it's like the canyon in Star Wars and he's Anakin feeling the force. One set of chockstones leads to another and he rapidly negotiates them like an obstacle race - until there's one the size of a big refrigerator which has been stopped by the walls 18 inches from the floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. CHOCKSTONES. DAY. \nOver or under? He drops to his belly and squeezes underneath, rucking the sandy floor in front of him. He's halfway, his chest rising out the far side when suddenly he can't move. The music jams and loops on 2 notes like bad techno. He pushes but nothing. \nHe reaches back with his hand and releases a part of his rucksack strap that's snagged. And the music releases too. He squat-jumps out and brushes off the sand. \nNo panic -a nothing moment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. \nNow it's steeper. We're already 60ft below ground level and it's falling away further in front of us. Another drink and the map is out. \nCUT TO: \nINT/EXT. SILHOUETTE PROFILE. CROSS SECTION OF CANYON. DAY. \nWe see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron moving within it. We track in and elide into a graphic view of him chimneying his way along the canyon now only 3 ft wide at most. It's a chance to see his skill and thirst for climbing. And to see how deep he's going. \nHe uses his legs, back and natural body weight to body walk along and down the towering walls. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. \nHe's moving towards a final chockstone below him jammed in the gap. You can see the way he's thinking: it's about the size of a bus wheel and used as a platform will help him reduce the 10 foot drop and get quickly down into the next section. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. \nHe reaches it at the same time we do and kicks fiercely, automatically, to make sure it's solid. \nARON Yep. \nAnd across he steps onto it.

DAY. \nAs before he squats and clambers down the back side of the stone to reduce his drop down. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. DAY. C/U TIGHT ON ARON. \nJust as he dangles there's a scraping sound, small but close, too close and the stone judders towards him, pulled by the torque of his weight on his side, rotating. Instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops. Like he's trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. ON CHOCKSTONE. DAY. \nBut it follows him down, somehow he's released its latent energy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON. TIGHTER ON ARON.

SLOT CANYON. DAY. \nHis arms rise to protect his head but his eyes remain open and through his fingers we see the next 3 seconds. The rock's face and his. \nIt grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall. He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and careers towards his right arm which he raises, to compensate for withdrawing the left, and to protect his head. \nThe rock smashes the right hand and wrist against the wall and drags it down the remaining distance. Like a cheese grater it tears the skin from the back of the hand and the forearm, decorating the wall. Aron is powerless to stop its force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall by the stone. \nAll this happens too quickly. We can hardly register what's happened as everything stops. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nSilence. He's standing behind the rock. Like he's in a line for a bus.

Again and again thrusting up with knees, thighs, pelvis, left arm, head, neck... nothing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nThen slam upwards, harder than ever as though he's run at it from a hundred yards and it's a door that will surely burst open. \nARON \nYEEARKGG... UNNNHHH \nAir exploding out of his lungs. And then a quiet hollow sound of the boulder shifting fractionally. A howl of phenomenal pain - \nARON (CONT'D) \nNO, NO, NO, NO, FUCK. \nHe reverses the fraction and collapses in sweat and blood, knees bleeding, good fingers lacerated. But he remains upright, attached. Unable to physically collapse. Grabs his shirt and wipes sweat away and goes to drink. He hula-hoops out of his backpack to get access to the water, gulps down 3 full throatfulls - stops mid 4th and backwashes as much as he can into the bottle - \nARON (CONT'D) No, no... more water. \nHe caps the lid tightly and drops it into his pack. \nARON (CONT'D) Relax.

Stares at it until it changes to 3.15pm - the watch is working. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. \nHe examines the boulder at each point he can reach, stretching and contorting to see into his crushed and wretched hand where his thumb is visible above and his little finger below. No matter how much he touches them, there is no feeling. He prods up and down to see what feeling is left and where it stops. Comparing left hand to where the right hand is trapped to measure the width of his right wrist - now smaller than the width of his little finger on his right hand. He can barely get the little finger of his left hand in the gap. We reverse back on him at each contortion. He \nREALIZES - \nARON FUCK! What the fuck? How the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder? Its crushed, it's fucking dying man! He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin left on the canyon wall as the rock pushed him to where he is. Looks under boulder, no blood - check.

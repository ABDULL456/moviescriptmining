ALGREN (after a moment) Private cabin. 
EXT.                   TOKYO ­ STREET                             DAY 
Graham walks with Algren. 
GRAHAM Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white man has ever been in your position. Do you have any idea what it will mean to have Omura as your friend? You want land, you want women, you want boys? 
Algren starts to walk faster, but Graham Stops him. 
GRAHAM Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years. You must believe me there is a majest y about these people -- can you imagine what your own country would be if it had half the drive and the discipline and the belief and the bravery of these ridiculous little people? 
Then raised voices from across the street stop them. 
They see Yoritomo surrounded by four Imperial Army soldiers. The soldiers are rough and imperious, drunk with power. They carry gleaming rifle.. 
The soldiers bark orders. Yoritomo stands proudly, responding calmly. 
ALGREN 
Whit is this? 
GRAHAM My God, it's the edicts... 
ALGREN What edicts? 
Algren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile - the soldiers are pointing to Yoritomo's head, screaming 
Algren steps toward the soldiers-- 
ALGREN That's enough-- 
One of the soldiers SCREAMS at him -- raises his rifle -- all the soldiers raise their rifles ­ Yoritomo reaches for his sword -- Algren tries to push through - 
ALGREN (subtitles) YORITOMO, WAIT! 
One of the soldiers smacks Algren in the chin with a rifle butt. Algren reels, and by the time he stands straight again, four others are pointing their ba yonets at his face. 
Graham takes hold of Algren's arm. 
GRAHAM Don't be stupid. 
Algren makes eye contact with Yoritomo, who -- in deference to his friend -- puts his sword away. 
The Japanese soldiers continue to scream at Yoritomo. They force him to his knees. Rifles pressed to his head. 
Yoritomo bows his bead, speaking quietly, as if praying. 
Algren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet -- another grab. Yoritomo's hair, jerks his head back and begins hacking off Yoritomo's traditional top-knot of hair. Brutally. Blood. 
Yoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face. 
The soldiers laugh and move off. 
Algren kneels by Yoritomo. Yoritomo looks up at him. There are tears in his eyes. 
EXT.                  KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                    DUSK 
Katsumoto's house on the outskirts of Tokyo is spacious and harmonious. Utterly Japanese. Samurai guards in full regalia, stand menacingly outside. 
INT.                   KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                   DUSK 
Ujio kneels with Yoritomo, dressing the wounds on his head. 
Graham sits across the room talking quietly to the mammoth Nakao, taking notes in a small notebook. Nakao has been brutally shorn of his top knot as well. His shame is apparent. 
INT.                     KATSUMOTO'S CHAMBER                          DUSK 
Servants he1p dress Katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as Algren is ushered in. 
KATSUMOTO Captain, I had not thought to see you again. 
ALGREN I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to tell you what's going on here. 
KATSUMOTO You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers, is that how you sa y it? 
ALGREN They're about to close a trade agreement that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine. 
KATSUMOTO Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to need those weapons before be will sign. 
ALGREN (realizing) And you are to be the cause... 
KATSUMOTO Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons. The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu what it wants. And my country is sold to yours. 
As Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground of old scars, so like his own. 
KA TSUMOTO Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for the elimination of our traditional topknots. 
ALGREN I know. 
KATSUMOTO The second banned the wearing of sword. 
Algren stops. He knows what swords mean to the samurai. 
KATSUMOTO (re: his swords) Hand them to me, will you? 
Algren picks up Katsumoto's two swords. Looks at him deeply. 
ALGREN If you do this, they will kill you. 
KA TSUMOTO I am hard to kill. 
ALGREN You don't know what their weapons can do. All your men butchered ... Just for pride.

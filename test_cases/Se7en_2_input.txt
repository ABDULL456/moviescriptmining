SOMERSET My future. 
Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset. 
TRACY You have a strange way about you, Somerset... I mean in a good way... unusual. 
Somerset doesn't know what to say.  He pockets the paper rose. 
TRACY (CONT) I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair. 
Tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette. 
TRACY (CONT) It's just... it's nice to hear a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're acting like a homosexual.  That's how he is. 
SOMERSET (mock indignation) Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to him then. 
TRACY I suppose not. 
Somerset continues writing.  Tracy sits at the kitchenette table, watches him. 
INSERT -- TITLE CARD 
THURSDAY 
EXT.  CITY MORGUE -- MORNING 
It's raining hard.  Mills exits the morgue building with a few art books and a paper cup of coffee.  He holds one art book over his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street. 
INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING 
Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art books in a box.  He closes the door.  Alone with the sound of the rain.  He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes in the rearview mirror. 
He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.  He makes a face, opens Dante's Purgatory: 
|                                     THE EARTHLY PARADISE    | |                               VII The Lustful         /____\| |                                VI The Gluttonous    /_______| |       7 TERRACES OF                                /        | |                                 V The Avaricious  /         | |                                   and Prodigal   /__________| |         PURGATION                               /           | |                             IV The Slothful  /______________| |                     III The Wrathful     /__________________| |                      II The Envious    /____________________| |                       I The Proud    /______________________| |                                   /       THE ISLAND        | |                                 /        OF PURGATORY       | 
Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel. He reads.  He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.  He concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself.  He finally closes the book, shaking his head, not understanding anything he's reading.  He starts pounding the book against the steering wheel with all his might. 
MILLS Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing freak, mother-fuck... 
A figure outside the window knocks on the glass.  Mills rolls it down.  A COP in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through. 
MILLS (CONT) Good work, Officer.  Good work. 
The cop leaves as Mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the bag open.  Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and The Canterbury Tales. 
MILLS (CONT) Thank God. 
INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY 
It still rains outside.  Somerset enters, stops to notice DETECTIVE MILLS painted on the door where his name used to be. He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner. 
Somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files and papers.  Mills enters carrying the box of books. 
SOMERSET How's it coming? 
MILLS Great. 
Mills puts the box on the large desk.  They both settle in, attending to their work.  Two men, about five feet apart, each trying not to acknowledge the other's presence. 
Mills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is occupied, hides them in a desk drawer. 
Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  There's a chalk board nailed to the wall. 
On the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath 2 greed(x)       6 pride 3 sloth          7 lust 4 envy 
The PHONE RINGS.  Both men look at it.  Phone RINGS again. 
SOMERSET It's your name on the door. 
Mills picks up.  Somerset returns to his work. 
MILLS (into phone) Detective Mills here. (lowers voice) Honey, I asked you not to call unless... (listens) What... why?  Okay... okay.  Hold on. 
Mills is confused.  He holds the phone out to Somerset. 
MILLS (CONT) It's my wife. 
Somerset looks quizzical.  Mills shrugs.  Somerset takes it. 
SOMERSET (into phone) Hello? (listens) Yes, well... I appreciate the thought, but... I... (listens) Well, I guess I'd be delighted to. Thank you... goodbye. 
Somerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled.  Mills is waiting. 
MILLS Well? 
SOMERSET I'm invited to have a late supper with you and your wife.  And I accept. 
MILLS How's that? 
SOMERSET (sits back down) Tonight. 
Mills looks at the phone, lost. 
INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT 
A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC. 
There's a basketball game with NO VOLUME on the t.v. screen. Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table.  Mills has a beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently. 
TRACY Why aren't you married, Somerset? 
MILLS Tracy.  What the hell? 
Somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking. 
SOMERSET I was close.  It just didn't happen.

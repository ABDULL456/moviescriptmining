She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say.. 
BELLA 
Like watch more baseball on the flat 
screen? Or go to the Coffee Shop? 
Same people, same steak, same berry 
cobbler every night? That's you, 
Dad. Not me. 
This hits Charlie hard. She can barely stand it, heads down the stairs, as he takes a second to recover.. 
CHARLIE Bella... I just got you back. 
Which breaks Bella's heart... and forces her to deliver the final blow. 
BELLA 
And if I don't get out now, I'm 
going get stuck here like mom did. 
Charlie is stunned, wounded. She takes advantage of his shock, pushing past him out the door. 
102 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 102 
Bella exits, heads to her truck. Fresh tears spring to her eyes. 
ANGLE ON THE WOODS 
Trees, branches... and a pair of DEADLY EYES. James. He watches from a distance as Bella pulls out. The truck moves off... and so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out the window. 
103 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT 103 
Bella drives, wiping tears away. Suddenly Edward is outside the car, near Bella's window. 
EDWARD He'll forgive you. (off Bella's startled look) Slide over.. 
Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the door, sliding in, and takes the wheel. Bella slumps. 
BELLA His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him. 
EDWARD It was the only way he'd let you go. 
Edward FLOORS it. 
EDWARD Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us 
Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the truck. Bella SCREAMS. 
EDWARD It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us. 
She catches her breath. It kills him to see her so frightened. She looks out the window as they drive through town.. 
104 BELLA'S POV - EXT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP (CONT) - NIGHT 104 
The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION... INSIDE we SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent, hopeful.. 
105 EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT 105 
Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the house... but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits. They immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears. 
DR. CULLEN He came to warn us. About James. 
They back down slightly. Laurent address Dr. Cullen. 
LAURENT I've grown tired of his games. But he's got unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I've never seen anything like him in three hundred years ... And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate her. 
Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic. 
LAURENT I'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here. 
And he moves off, disappearing into the woods.. 
106 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - FOUR CAR GARAGE - NIGHT 
The side door BURSTS OPEN as Edward and the Cullens enter, followed by Bella. The lights flip on to reveal a pristine garage; the Volvo, the red BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an SUV. 
Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable GPS units, changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc. As they load up the vehicles 
JASPER I've had to fight our kind before. We're hard to kill. 
EDWARD But not impossible. We'll tear him up 
EMMETT

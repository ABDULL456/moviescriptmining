KAY-EM 14 I'm afraid I cannot assist. 
Rizzo is very frustrated. 
RIZZO I'm surrounded by idiots. 
KAY-EM 14 You need to get laid! 
Thorgon looks up from his work. 
THORGON Sorry, I'm working on it. 
DELONGPRE Are all twenty-first century girls like you? 
RIZZO He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you? 
AN ALARM SOUNDS. 
THORGON (re:monitor) There's been an unauthorized entrance to the Cargo Bay. 
BRODSKI Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs. 
YLLO (into the mic) At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski? 
BRODSKI (v.o.) I'll try. 
CUT TO: INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP 
kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in full armor, packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may have met his match. 
BRODSKI Alright, the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees. I say shoot to kill. 
The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action. 
BRODSKI So after you've killed him, put one in his knee so we can say we tried. 
The men LAUGH and high five. 
BRODSKI Go to infrared, stay in radio contact. (into headset) Teach you there? 
INT.  LAB ONE 
Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the team standing at the cargo doors. 
YLLO Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though. 
BRODSKI(V.O.) You just keep an eye out. 
YLLO Yeah yeah. Got it. 
Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He has his own agenda. 
INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP 
BRODSKI Let's move out. 
The doors HISS open. 
INT. CARGO BAY 
A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a maze. 
BRODSKI Two teams, Port, starboard. 
They split up. 
INT. LAB ONE 
The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips are entering the cargo area. 
BRODSKI(V.O.) Kicker, anything? 
KICKER(V.O.) Negative. 
Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor. 
THORGAN Each blip represents a trained killer. It's men like that fought off the pirates on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar moons... 
For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful. 
RIZZO So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces? 
THORGAN Exactly. 
INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE 
Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly he is jerked out of view. 
CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes go dead, the neck broken. 
INT. LAB ONE 
Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade. 
RIZZO WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS DISAPPEARS? 
All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES. 
KAY-EM 14 E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined. 
BOEMAN (into mic) Sergeant, this is Boemen... 
INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD 
Sergeant Brodski stops. 
BOEMAN(v.o.) You've lost Condor. 
BRODSKI Briggs, Geko, talk to me! 
INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE 
Briggs and Geko stare at each other. 
BRIGGS He was...he was right here!

The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK. Detective Nakagawa stands in the doorway, holding a thick FILE. 
NAKAGAWA I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss Davies. I was wondering if you could answer some additional questions? 
Doug stands, intercepting Nakagawa.   He sticks out a hand. 
DOUG I'm Doug.    Karen's boyfriend. 
Nakagawa nods. Fixes Doug with a blank stare.   Taking the hint, Doug turns to Karen. 
DOUG You up for this? 
KAREN (nodding:) Why don't you find out when I can check out of here. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     53. 
Reluctantly, Doug kisses her brow, then exits. Nakagawa pulls a chair up to the bed and sits, putting the file on a small table. 
NAKAGAWA How are you feeling? 
KAREN Okay.   Tired. 
NAKAGAWA You are an exchange student? (Karen nods:) And you have been volunteering at the Health Center for...? 
KAREN Three months. I needed a social welfare credit. 
NAKAGAWA You said this was the first time you'd been in that house? 
KAREN Yes. 
She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes. He seems somewhat uncomfortable, as if he's building to something: 
NAKAGAWA About the Japanese boy you said you saw there -- 
KAREN Did you find him? 
NAKAGAWA No, not yet. You said the boy had been taped into the closet? 
KAREN Yes, that's right. He was... holding a cat. A black cat. (remembering:) There was a book in the closet, too. I think it was a journal. 
NAKAGAWA Did it belong to the boy? 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   53aA. 
KAREN I don't think so. I think it belonged to a woman. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   53A. 
Nakagawa looks up.   Karen tries to explain: 
KAREN The writing. It looked feminine. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    54. 
KAREN I left it on the kitchen table. 
Nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note. 
NAKAGAWA I didn't see any book on the table. Perhaps someone moved it. Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet? 
She thinks, recalling: 
KAREN I asked him his name.   He said `Toshio'. 
Nakagawa immediately tenses. A long beat. He can see how exhausted Karen is. But something's troubling him: 
NAKAGAWA One more question, please. 
He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO Karen found, and taped together. He shows it to her. 
NAKAGAWA We found this in the room where... 
Karen looks at the picture. 
KAREN This is him. This is the boy. 
NAKAGAWA Are you certain? 
KAREN Yes.   Positive. 
Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands. 
And Karen notices -- Nakagawa's hands are shaking.

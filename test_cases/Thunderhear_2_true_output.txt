RAY Jesus. Oil? 
CROW HORSE Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry. 
RAY 
CROW HORSE What? 
RAY That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium. 
CROW HORSE We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water. 
RAY Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved. 
CROW HORSE So they took care of Leo. 
RAY Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again. 
Ray goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the elbow, sniffs the solution. 
CROW HORSE They're drainin' our water table. That's our life, man... 
Ray is looking past Crow Horse at -- 
Something strange in the moonlight. COYOTES. Some forty yards away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing. 
And run. 
REVERSE - RAY 
and Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left. A place in the dirt, they were digging up. When they reach it, they stare down into the dirt. 
A BODY 
lies there, face down. Denim jacket and a shock of black hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees Maggie Eagle Bear. 
RAY 
looks down in disbelief. 
RAY No. No... 
Ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant and soiled water. He covers his mouth, stopping himself from getting sick. And then he explodes, YELLING. 
LONG SHOT - RED DEER TABLE 
in the moonlight. And RAY'S YELLING ECHOING up out of the rocks 
EXT. BEAR CREEK VILLAGE - NIGHT 
The sordid little village the feds first drove through sits sleepy on the rim of sunrise. 
A DOG BARKS hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes -- rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so many. The Le Baron pulls up behind it. 
INT. LE BARON - NIGHT 
Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by crickets. And that one dog. 
RAY This Clear Moon's house? 
CROW HORSE Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man. 
Crow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in his rearview. 
INT. CLEAR MOON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth, beginning to tighten at the jowls. 
Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch. MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee. A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the hall, looking at him. 
Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS LAKOTA. Answering him. 
Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair, sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge. 
INT. LE BARON - PARKED - CLEAR MOON'S - DAWN 
Ray nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the window again. The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes. 
CROW HORSE Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing. 
RAY What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird. 
Crow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead.

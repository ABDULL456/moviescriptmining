WALTER Hey. Walter. 
They wave. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Did you guys, were you living in this car back seat when Sean O'Connell lived in the front seat? 
Walter starts miming taking photographs. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Sean? 
BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia.... 
The guy's pointing to where Walter is in the front seat. 
SECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia. 
WALTER Is that-- Are you saying quin-- 
SECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia... 
WALTER Are you saying Quintessence? In the Spanish form? Yeah. Sean says that. 
A deck Squall Alarm sounds. These guys leave the car quickly (to perhaps batten something down). Walter notices the breaktime snack they were enjoying - half's been left behind. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Is that Clementine cake? My mom makes-- I didn't know anyone else made that. 
Walter's alone in the Subaru. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Clementine cake. Wow. 
He reaches for some cake, it's been sliced into pieces, wrapped bakery style in some stray paper from the backseat. Walter takes one such slice. While the storm lifts and lowers the ship, Walter enjoys some clementine cake, then he notices something about the paper scrap it's wrapped in. There's handwriting on it. Walter examines it. 
What Walter's holding is a half-torn page bearing cursive handwriting. There is a date beside the word: Eyjafjallajökull. Then TTL shoemount flash. Zoom bounce flash. Nikon Camera.... 
WALTER (CONT'D) This is Sean's. 
There is a later destination and date on the paper - and some scrawl beside it. 
WALTER (CONT'D) (EXCITED) ...this is an itinerary. 
CUT TO: 
A CLOSE UP OF THE WORD EYJAFJALLAJÖKULL 
EXT. SHIP CROW'S NEST - LATER 
During this storm, Walter has climbed up the crow's nest ladder and stands in the crow's nest with the English- Speaking Chilean Sailor who escorted him to the Subaru. Walter's showing him the paper - Eyjafjallajökull 
WALTER That's where Sean is. Tomorrow. This gibberish. I have to crack it. 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR Crack? 
WALTER I have to crack the gibberish. 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR You don't have to crack anything. It's a volcano. In Iceland. That's the name. Eyjafjallajökull. 
WALTER ...Sean's in Iceland. We're going past there, right? Can we land there? 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR We can get you there. 
WALTER Can you get me there tomorrow? 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR We can get you there tomorrow, yes. 
WALTER Would you like some Clementine cake? 
Walter's brought the cake up with him. 
WALTER (CONT'D) It's very good. It tastes, man, exactly like my mom's. I didn't know Chilean mom's made this. Small world. 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR No thank you. I have to actually perform a function up here, during the storm. That's why I'm up here. 
WALTER Oh. Sorry. 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR I have to monitor the mooring winches and wind Lasses. (MORE) 
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR And you're standing, I'm sorry, like right where I'm supposed to be looking. 
WALTER Okay, I'm going to go, take my cake and..... 
Walter starts to descend the crow's nest ladder.

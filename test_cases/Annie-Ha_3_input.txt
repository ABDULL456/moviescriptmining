ANNIE No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all.  On the contrary, I think- 
ALVY Yeah. 
ANNIE It's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think they're gonna really like you. 
EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY 
The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green lawn, then cuts to: 
INT. DINING ROOM. 
Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner.  The sun is pouring through a big picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr. and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane. 
MOM HALL (Holding her wine glass) It's a nice ham this year, Mom. 
Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods. 
ANNIE (Smiling at Duane) Oh, yeah.  Grammy always does such a good job. 
DAD HALL (Chewing) A great sauce. 
ALVY It is. (Smacking his lips) It's dynamite ham. 
Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries not to notice. 
MOM HALL (To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) We went over to the swap meet.  Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames. 
ANNIE We really had a good time. 
Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard. 
MOM HALL (Lighting a cigarette and turning to Alvy) Ann tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. 
ALVY (Setting down his glass and coughing) Yes.  I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib. 
Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to stare. 
DAD HALL Duane and I went out to the boat basin. 
DUANE We were caulkin' holes all day. 
DAD HALL Yeah. (Laughing) Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual. 
MOM HALL Oh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir with you. 
ANNIE Oh, yes, yes. 
Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera. 
ALVY (To the audience) I can't believe this family. (Making chewing sounds) Annie's mother.  She really's beautiful. And they're talkin' swap meets and boat basins, and the old lady at the end of the table (Pointing to Grammy) is a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, they realty look American, you know, very healthy and ... like they never get sick or anything.  Nothing like my family.  You know, the two are like oil and water. 
The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father, aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed. 
ALVY'S FATHER Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his business?! 
ALVY'S MOTHER His wife has diabetes! 
ALVY'S FATHER Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse? Diabetes? 
ALVY'S UNCLE The man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job. 
ALVY'S AUNT (Putting more meat on her husband's plate) Is that a reason to steal from his father? 
ALVY'S UNCLE Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't know what you're talking about. 
ALVY'S AUNT Yes, I know what I'm talking about. 
ALVY'S MOTHER (Interrupting) George, defend him! 
ALVY'S UNCLE (Over Alvy's father's muttering) No Moskowitz he had a coronary. 
ALVY'S AUNT You don't say. 
ALVY'S MOTHER We fast. 
MOM HALL Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the Veterans Hospital. 
DAD HALL My God, he's the new president of the El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is somethin' else. 
MOM HALL That's Jack's wife.  We used to make that outta raisins. 
ANNIE Oh, yes, that's right.  Did you see the new play? 
MOM HALL Oh, you remember her, Annie.

ANNIE (smiles) Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- (shaving away) Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming. 
PAUL I didn't know it was going to be a big storm. 
ANNIE Lucky for you, I did. (pauses) Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels... 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE: CLOSE UP 
ANNIE I know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of them. I love them so. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, looking at her. There's something terribly touching about her now. 
PAUL You're very kind... 
ANNIE And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. (runs her fingers over his cheek) Like a baby. (smiles) All done. (starts to dab away the last bits of soap) 
ANNIE starts cleaning up. 
PAUL When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing. 
ANNIE It shouldn't be too much longer. (gently) Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you. (suddenly almost embarrassed) Could I ask you a favor? (Paul nods) I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... (hesitant) and I wondered if maybe... (her voice trails off) 
PAUL You want to read it? 
ANNIE (quietly) If you wouldn't mind. 
PAUL I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck. 
ANNIE (genuinely thrilled) You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. His eyes close briefly, he grimaces. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch. 
ANNIE Boy, it's like clockwork, the way your pain comes--I'll get you your Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy. 
She turns and goes out of the room. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, watching her. 
ANNIE What's your new book called? 
PAUL I don't have a title yet. 
ANNIE What's it about? 
PAUL (fast) It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title. 
ANNIE (in the doorway) Oh, like I could do that? 
CUT TO: 
THE MANAGER'S OFFICE AT THE SILVER CREEK LODGE 
Small, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all. 
BUSTER AND LIBBY, THE MANAGER, are going over books and records. Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane. 
LIBBY Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne. 
BUSTER Maybe you can, Libby. 
LIBBY No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door. 
BUSTER No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary? 
LIBBY (head shake) I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him. 
BUSTER So do I... 
LIBBY I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now. 
BUSTER I'm sure you're right. 
But you can tell he's not sure at all as we

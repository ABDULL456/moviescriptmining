HARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod who are you. You fucker. Omygod. 
He gingerly crouches down. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... You fucker... 
He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit pockets. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod, my god... Ungh... 
He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod... 
Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards, driver's license; empty. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... What the fuck... 
He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet. 
As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices: 
The suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled fringe. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... Oh my fuck... 
He straightens up again. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... I killed a fucking spook.    You fucker... 
He gazes down at the body. 
HARRY (CONT'D) ... What are you doing here, you fucker. 
111   INT. CIA HALLWAY - DAY                                          111 
We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway. 
112   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              112 
We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk. 
He looks up. 
PALMER Olson.    What's up. 
The door slams shut. 
113   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              113 
Some time later.    Our camera position is higher. 
At the cut the door swings open and Palmer Smith strides out, grim-faced. 
114   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY                    114 
Tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway. 
115   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY       115 
Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the desktop. 
MAN Palmer.    What's up. 
PALMER Not quite certain, sir, but it's... messy. 
He seats himself facing the desk. A desktop nameplate identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb. 
Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing. 
PALMER (CONT'D) ... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox. 
GARDNER CHUBB Kolyma-2? 
PALMER Our man in the Russian Embassy. 
GARDNER CHUBB Mm. 
PALMER It was brought to them by a woman who---- 
GARDNER CHUBB The Russians? 
PALMER Yeah. It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the folder. With Pfarrer's. 
GARDNER CHUBB The Russians. 
PALMER Yeah. 
GARDNER CHUBB Who's Pfarrer? 
PALMER Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other. 
GARDNER CHUBB All right.     Spare me. 
PALMER Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's gotten... complicated. He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house. 
GARDNER CHUBB Shot----your analyst?

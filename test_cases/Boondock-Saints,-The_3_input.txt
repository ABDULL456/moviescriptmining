INT.  YAKAVETTA'S FRONT FOYER  NIGHT 
There is a knock at the door. Geno jumps with fright and then looks out the peep hole. He sees a well-formed pair of woman's breasts in a cheap dress. He opens the door. A stunning blonde stands before him. She looks like a hooker. 
She wears a short, hot pink dress and a white scarf around her neck, as well as six inch platform heels. 
SMECKER AS WOMAN Joey Bevo sent me over. As entertainment. 
The woman speaks and it is apparent that this is actually Smecker in drag. 
GENO Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night for this shit. (beat) Bevo's so great. Always sending us hot girls. 
SMECKER You look like you could use a quickie. 
Smecker kisses him full on the lips and rubs up against him. 
Geno is convinced. He brings her inside. 
GENO Hey, Chappy! 
CHAPPY (Chappy, emerges way down the hall) What the fuck? 
GENO I ain't been laid in a week. Take five minutes. 
CHAPPY If I die cause you're getting a piece of ass, I'll come back and beat you to death with a big rubber dick. 
GENO Don't worry about it. 
INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
He takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer. 
They are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker uses a silencer, shoots him in the head. 
INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  HALL  NIGHT 
He starts to whisper, "It's on now. It's on now. Too far." as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses. 
He is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him. 
The Duke pistol whips Smecker. He's out. 
INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT 
Connor and Murphy are on their knees in front of Rocco, whom they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette. 
He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips. 
The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer. 
He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a hand on each of their cheeks. 
INT.  CHEAP BOSTON HOTEL ROOM  NIGHT  3 MONTHS LATER 
Both sleeping boys throw their arms out, mimicking a crucified Christ. Their father turns, sees this, turns back. 
The boys wake with a start. Connor looks to his father, who is already staring at him. 
CONNOR How far are we going with this, Da? 
FATHER The questions is not, "how far?" The question is, "Do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith to go as far as is needed?" 
INT.  COURTHOUSE  BACK FOYER AREA  MORNING 
Smecker opens the door from the inside and lets the MacManus father and sons in. He walks one way they walk the other through the grand courthouse halls. 
INT.  COURTROOM  MORNING 
The media, with their cameras and notebooks, are at the back of the courtroom. Yakavetta is testifying on the stand. He is cocky. The judge warns Yakavetta that he will have no more of this behavior in his courtroom. 
MEDIA MAN 1 (whispering to #2) Look at his charisma. He's the next John Gotti. 
MEDIA MAN 2 He'll walk. Even with all this evidence.

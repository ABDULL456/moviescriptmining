JODY It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I prattle on, do you? 
Fergus shakes his head and says nothing. 
JODY I will take it by your silence that you don't. 
He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody. 
JODY Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the frog. Ever heard of them? 
Fergus says nothing. 
JODY Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown." Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?" Scorpion replies, "I can't help it, it's in my nature." 
Jody chuckles under his hood. 
FERGUS So what's that supposed to mean? 
JODY Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man. 
FERGUS Why? 
JODY 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature. 
Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles up at him. 
JODY See? I was right about you. 
FERGUS Don't be so sure. 
JODY Jody's always right. 
INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON. 
Both men dozing in the heat. 
JODY Where would you most like to be now, man? 
FERGUS Doesn't matter where. 
JODY Come on, man. If this shit was all over. 
FERGUS Having a pint in the Rock. 
JODY You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring. 
FERGUS Like what? 
JODY Like having a pint in the Metro -- 
Fergus laughs. 
FERGUS Having two pints in the Rock. 
JODY Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita. 
FERGUS Who's Dil? 
JODY My special friend. 
FERGUS Oh, yeah. 
JODY We got simple tastes, you and me. 
FERGUS The best. 
JODY But you fellas never get a break, do you? 
FERGUS Do you? 
JODY Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you? 
FERGUS We don't look on it like that. 
JODY I've often wondered how you do it. 
FERGUS Depends on what you believe in. 
JODY What do you believe in? 
FERGUS That you guys shouldn't be here. 
JODY It's as simple as that? 
FERGUS Yes. 
Jude enters.

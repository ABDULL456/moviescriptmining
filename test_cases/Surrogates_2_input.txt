FADE IN ON: 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING 
A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night. This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the mirrored surface of a helmet visor. 
EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT 
A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather, climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN. He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the building's entrance. A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT. THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at 
TUXEDO. SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER," along with other personal information below. THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety switches and buttons. The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can 
REACH HIM-- A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in the back. They're gone in an instant. The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He starts it and pursues the limousine. 
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
THE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac, D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance. 
EXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT 
FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The LIMOUSINE approaches. 
INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome man in a suit named ARMANDO. 
TUXEDO I'm not really in the mood for opera, Armando. ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic. 
ARMANDO F Street? 
TUXEDO 
(UNDOING BOWTIE) You read my mind. Let's not mention this to my Dad... As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT 
THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area, pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X. TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open. 
TUXEDO I can find my way back. ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he disappears inside. THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch up with him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides open a crack-- THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes. 
BOUNCER This is a private club. 
ASSASSIN I just need to talk to-- THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face. 
INT. THE PIT - NIGHT 
POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful, others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them. A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes, with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up. IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage, numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here. TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC: 
BLONDE Mind if I join you? A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth, SPARKS fly to her tongue and--

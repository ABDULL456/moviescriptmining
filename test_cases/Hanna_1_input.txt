SEB (CONT'D) Here goes nothing. He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around. SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He passes ISAACS on his way round. 
SEB (CONT'D) Excuse me. Sir? ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her mirrors. SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea who he is. 
INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT - HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry. 
114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114 
Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast. A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with the exertion. Water dripping from his body. He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He approaches the beach car park. A POLICE CAR swings into the car park. ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on him. He stops and turns towards the police car. TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He watches them very carefully. 
115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115 
The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains. 
116 INT. VAN - DAY 116 
HANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged landscape. Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold evening light. HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a little water spills down his front. SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's. 
117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117 
ISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach. 
ISAACS Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we have a situation here... 
118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118 
ISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a number of scenes with no luck until he notices: The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and boarding the van. 
119 INT. VAN - DAY 119 
HANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and they stare at the huge, granite mountain range... She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's shoulder. 
120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120 
MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats freshly sliced. 
LEWIS The Danish authorities are taking this very seriously. They've doubled the number of officers on the ground. We've sent up spotter planes over the channel. 
(MORE) 
LEWIS (CONT'D) They're appealing for witnesses through the local media... MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her. 
LEWIS (CONT'D) You think he really swam it? MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she walks away. 
MARISSA Keep me posted. 
121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121 
The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage, borders and rules. Families come here from cities across Europe and bring their whole lives with them. The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious looking FRENCH family with quad bikes. SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment. 
GERMAN CAMPER. Guten tag. 
HANNA Guten Morgen. 
GERMAN CAMPER. Wie geht es Ihnen? 
HANNA Gutm und Ihnen? 
GERMAN CAMPER. Jah, gut, gut... A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them. 
FRENCH CAMPER. Bonjour. Ca va? 
HANNA Ca va. Oui. Bien... HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties complicated knots. RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.

{"train": "THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER \nWritten by \nLarry Ferguson & Tom Clancy \nON A BLACK SCREEN, THE FOLLOWING CRAWL: \nMOSCOW, 17 JULY 1991. THE KREMLIN \nANNOUNCED THE 'RETIREMENT' OF \nMIKAHIL, GORBACHEV AS WELL AS \nPOLITBURO MEMBERS YAVOLEV, \nMENDVENDEV AND BIRKOVO. \nDEFENSE MINISTER ULINOV ASSUMED \nTHE ROLE OF CHAIRMAN. KGB HEAD \nLIGACHEV BECAME PREMIER VOWING \n\"A RESTORATION OF DISCIPLINE.\" \nWESTERN LEADERS BRACED FOR \nA NEW ROUND OF COLD WAR. \nFOUR MONTHS LATER... \nFADE IN \nA BARREN LANDSCAPE beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach. \nMARKO ALEXANDROVICH RAMIUS bare-headed in cold wind, studies the inclement coast. Bottomless eyes move slowly across the landscape, missing nothing. \nSUPER: POLWARNY INLET Soviet Submarine Base on the Barents Sea 500 mi north of Murmansk Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS: \nVOICE (OS) Cold this morning, Captain. Ramius shivers. When he replies, he speaks not about the weather, but of the land: \nRAMIUS It is cold. \n(BEAT)- And hard. Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man who just spoke to him \nCAPTAIN SECOND., RANK VASILY BORODIN Ramius' executive officer, also in black uniform. Borodin's rigged with a mike. , Brass .buttons gambol in his Nubian cap like money. \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) e your head a bit. No need to crowd him. \nBORODIN \n(INTO MIKE) Come left three degrees. Make your course three-four-zero. Sonar, let me know when we pass fifty, fathoms. A HELMSMAN responds on a SPEAKER in the SAIL. Nautical CROSS TALK. Orders GIVEN and AFFIRMED. Pulling back, Ramius and Borodin are revealed standing atop \nTHE RED OCTOBER a huge submarine, trading a gigantic rudder a hundred yards aft her sail. A patrol BOAT and ICEBREAKER escort her to sea. On SPEAKERS in the SAIL: \nHELMSMAN (VO) Captain, political off=er Putin requests permission to come to the bridge. \nRAMIUS \n(GLANCING AT \nBORODIN) Granted. \nBORODIN (under his breath) Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a humble mM worker... \nRAMIUS Quiet as grass, Vastly. Quiet as grass. (louder, turning) Good morning, Comrade political off=er \nIVAN YURIEVICH PUTIN block-faced, forties, pink-necked, political officer assigned to Red October, clambers through the hatch into the air, wheezing: \nPUTIN Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that ladder, I realize what an over-fed ox rve become. Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly, there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge: \nPUTIN (CONT'D) \n(EXPANSIVELY) Such a glorious day. So exciting to h t ally put the land behind us and be on our way. \n(TO RAMIUS) Bourgeois of me, I know, but my enthusiasm at being chosen polidcica]. officer on this historic mission Its me with pride. \nTHE ROVER pulling to a curb in driving rain at Heathrow. Red Army CHORUS SWELLS. Leaping out, Ryan grabs luggage and races to the driver's side. Margaret pulls his face through the window. \nRYAN I'm all wet. \nMARGARET \n(KISSING HIM) You're sexy when you're wet. \nRYAN \n(GRINNING) I'm gonna miss you. \nMARGARET Get out of here, Yank. Or Ml tear you limb from limb. \n(HE STARTS) Wait! I got you these. They'Il help you sleep on the plane. She has a bottle of piUs in her hand. He squints at it, shaking his head in the pouring rain: \nRYAN Won't do me any good --- \nMARGARET Jack. \nRYAN \n(SHEEPISH) OK. I ll try. Taking the pil3s, he kisses her again. All of a sudden, he wants to climb inside, park someplace and steam the windows. Her smile is \nALL KNOWING: \n\" MARGARET You only have three minutes. \nRYAN \n(GIG) Hey.. If I'm lucky, might miss the damn plane altogether. \nCUT TO-0- - seated beneath the only light in a dark cabin. Engines HUM. Turbulence RATTLES a TEACUP. A STEWARDESS appears, smiling down at him: \nSTEWARDESS Can I get you anything, sir? \nRYAN \n' (LYING) I'm fine. Thank you. \nSTEWARDESS Why don't you try to sleep? The l f ight will go much faster. \nRYAN.. I can't seem to sleep on planes. It's the turbulence. \nSTEWARDESS Pardon? \nRYAN \n(SWALLOWING) Turbulence. You know. When solar radiation heats the earth's crust. Warm air rises. Cool air descends. Turbulence. I don't like it. \nSTEWARDESS Are you a scientist? \nRYAN No. I just read a lot of books. \nSTEWARDESS Well, try and get some sleep anyway. She leaves. Wide awake, Ryan stares out the window at the spinning dark. Red Army CHORUS BOOMS. \nCUT TO: \nRYAN humping his suitcase into a giant terminal at the end of a long line of travelers. Above the line, a sign: \nU.S. CUSTOMS \nDU:LLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT \nWASHINGTON, D.C. \nA GUY IN SUNGLASSES moves down, the line, stopping beside Ryan: \nI \nSUNGLASSES \n(RESPECTFTAY) Mr. Ryan? Exhausted, Ryan nods. CHORUS SWELLS. Sunglasses takes Ryan's bags. \nCUT TO:. \nA BLACK LIIKO gliding to a stop at the security kiosk outside a suburban office compound. Sign over the compound's entrance: \nGREER When .do you want to talk to him? \nRYAN Right now if it's OX with you? 've. never met him personally, but - \nGREER I'll take care of it. \n(PICKING UP \nTHE PHONE) Margie, have a car for Dr. Ryan at the front gate in tan. minutes. Ryan retrieves his photographs. Getting Up, Greer watches him, choosing his words carefully: \nGREER (CONT'D) One of our satellites caught Red October in Polijarny Inlet this morning. \nRYAN \n(SHOCKED) They shouldn't have been sea ready for weeks. Ryan closes his case. Greer walks him to the door: \nGREER Relax, son. The Navy's got a Las Angeles c'la'ss sittJng right off their doorstep. In a few days we'll know everything about her but the wok's name. \nRYAN Well, In that case -- \n(GRINNING) Can you tell me where I can buy a bear? \nGREER For Sally? \n(RYAN NODS) Same place you buy a baby brgther, I guess. \nCUT TO: \nA BANSHEE WAIL in blackness. The groan of a primordial beast echoing in the dark, followed by a deep vibration that rattles bones and shatters eardrums. The black screen is moving. A massive cylinder glides over the top of us like a giant spaceship, outlined by flashes of e1ectxic-blue phosphorenscence. \nSUPER: USS DALLAS Los Angeles Class Attack Sub 50 mks west of Polijarny Inlet \nDEPTH: 400 FEET \nON THE DALLAS in the sonar shack, a state of the art sonar display glows blue. High tech graphics pinpoint movements in deep water beyond the hull.. \nSEAMAN SECOND CLASS RONALD JONES listens to a headset and eyeballs the display. A college dropout with a genius IQ, Jones is the kind of guy who likes tossing dead cats into crowded cathedrals. \nSEAMAN CHARLES BEAUMONT unruly red hair, a minion freckles and a wary smile, sits beside Jones. On SPEAKERS in the bulkhead, the PRIMORDIAL HOWL again, MUFFLED, clued with NOISE TRANSIENTS: \nJONES \nHEAR I \nBEAUMONT No. Maybe. It's buried in... \nJONES \n(LEADING) Yes? \nBEAUMONT Surface clutter? I should go to SAPS? \nJONES Correct, Seaman Beaumont. Surface Affects Processing. There is hope for your small brain yet. \n(BEAUMONT GRINS) And like Mozart at Saltzburg, you have labored to produce... \n(ANOTHER HOWL) hiclocdc. \nBEAUMONT \nJONES A whale, Beaumont. A whale. A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do. Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly \nBEHIND JONES \nTHE COB Chief of the Boat, a barrel-chested bear, smiles at Beaumont: \nCOB He gets to raggin you too bad, kid, you can always ask him about Pavarattt.. Jones sinks into his chair. Beaumont grins. Sea story coming. From the look on Jones' face, it promises to be a good one: \nBEAUMONT Tell me, Chief. \nCOB (taking his time) Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak, right? And he figures this sonar system is basically just a big old 300 million ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this piece of Pavarmt3i -- \nJONES it was Paganini. \nCOB Whatever. It's this piece of music he likes so much he wants to share it, right? So he re-wires the computer and figures how to put it in the water with a gigawatt of juice behind it. \n(BEAT) Now, the Captain, he don't much care. But about twenty-one boats out of San Diego, including one way out at Pearl, starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out their ass. Jonesy has turned the whole fucking Pacific Ocean into a stereo speaker. \nPUTIN As you wish. There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside, another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys. Inside the second safe, a large envelope. it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at Putin; he reads: \nRAMIUS We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and rendezvous with the Akula submarine, Konovalov. \nPUTIN Captain Tupalev's boat. \nRAMIUS You know Tupolav? \nPU TIN I know that he is descended from a long line of aril rats and that he was a student of yours. it is rumored, he has no love in his heart for you. Why is that? Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup. \nRAMIUS There is no room in Tupolev's heart for anyone or anything except Tupolev. \n(READING) Having made contact, we are ordered to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev w2l hunt us while we test our ship. Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly \nOBSEQUIOUS: \nPUTIN Captain, this is an historic moment for all. of us. I should like to make a request. \nRAMIUS Before you do, I want to talk to you about something important. \nPUTIN \n(NOT HEARING) I know that it is not aooording to protocxrl, but would you permit me to post the orders and inform the crew of our mission? \nRAMIUS \n(RESIGNED) As you wash, Comrade. Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him. Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways. Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL in the SHARP corner of the DESK. Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains, using all of his strength until.. \nPUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face. \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) I an sorry my friend. But it is cyear to me now. Where I would walk, you cannot fallow. Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body with scalding tea. Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man. Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS: \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) Dr. Petrov. Come to my quarters at once. There's been an aociderit! \nCUT TO: \nA MINI SUB resembling an airstream t xxzller with a propeller on the back. It's floating in a gargantuan tank fSlled with brightly lit water beneath a vast domed cet'ling: \nSUPER: U.S. NAVAL UNDERWATER SYSTEMS LAB Patuxent, Maryland \nSKIP TYLER built-like a fireplug, a monument to logic and impatience, leans on a cane, atop a platform by the tank#I watching \nWARRANT OFFICER BILL STEINER thirties, the bane of Tyler's existence. Steiner's head is sticking out of a hatch on the mini sub. Eyeing him, Tyler BELLOWS: \nTYLER You're never gonna go anywhere, Be.. Unless you close the hatch and start the goddam engine! \nSTEINER Brilliant, Skip. You're one of those guys you can't hide things from, right? \nTyler. grits his teeth. Steiner closes the hatch. Across the room, Ryan enters. Spotting Tyler, he moves to the platform, staring at the mini sub. The propeller starts turning. It submerges. \nTYLER \n(TURNING) Ryan? \nRYAN Yes sir. (re: mini sub) What it that thing? \nTYLER Deep submergence rescue vehicle. \nRYAN That's what a DSRV looks like. \nTYLER That's it. I designed this one. lt's aan d the Mystic. \nRYAN What are you doing with it? Tyler climbs off the piatfarm, working his cane with practiced precision. Taking Ryan by the arm, he heads for a door: \nTYLER Rigging it with a generic docking acllar so it will mate with British, German, other kinds of subs. \n(NODDING) This one here is designed to be super mobile. We can get it anywhere in the world in twenty-four hours. If that lunatic doesn't crash it fast:. \n(BEAT) Admiral Greer says you have some pdr ures.- - \nCUT TO: \nTYLER'S OFFICE high tech naval architecture. Technicians, graduate students move about in the background. Tyler is hunched over the Red October \nPHOTOGRAPHS: \nTYLER Bigger than a regular typhoon. \nLOGINOV \n(TREMBLING) Cook's assistant, Loginov, sir. \nRAMIUS Good. Now, I want you and the Doctor to witness this, Ioginov. I have removed Putin's missfle key from his neck and am keeping it myse f. Iognov blinks. Petrov frowns. Closing the freezer door, the sates ]save. Loginov isn't sure what to do. Petrov's agitated: \nPETROV This is all very unnerving, Captain. The reason for having two missM keys in the first place is to prevent one person from... \nRAMIUS From what, Doctor? \nPETROV Making a mistake and... \n(EXASPERATED) We must report this to Red Meet Command. \nRAMIUS Impossible. We are ordered to maintain strict radio silence. \n(TO IOGINOV) That will be all, Comrade. Glad to be anywhere else, Loginov returns to his work. \nPETROV Captain, perhaps I should keep Putin's key until -- \nRAMIUS \n(SHARPLY) I suggest you return to sick bay, Doctor. Soon, I will address the crew and explain our orders. This is not a decision for discussion. Shrugging, Petrov disappears. Borodin and Ramius.. follow him. Freaked, Loginov watches them go. \nCUT TO: \nMANCUSO bent over Jones' shoulder in the Da11as' sonar shack, concentrating on the blinking light on the sonar display. Thompson's to his left. Jones is on a headset: \nJONES \n(LISTENING) He's holding steady on zero-two-zero, twelve knots at about ten thousand yards. \nMANCUSO Can you identify him? \nJONES Computer's chewing on it. Twin screw and the plant noise sounds like a typhoon but - Computer ptintar CLATTERS. Ripping off the printout, Mancuso \nSTUDIES IT: \nSIGNAL EVALUATION: \nSOVIET TYPHOON CLASS SUBMARINE \nUNKNOWN IDENTITY \nNOT PREVIOUSLY RECORDED \nMANCUSO Must be a new boat. \n(TO THOMPSON) I miss something in dispatch the last few days, Phil? \nTHOMPSON Fleet hasn't said a word about it. \nMANCUSO Alright. Start a f]e on his, Jonesy. For now, call his Sierra thirty-five. (.Leaving) r91 see if we can work in a little closer and sniff his out. Thompson fcDows Mancuso. Beaumont glances at Jones, whispering: \nBEAUMONT Won't the Soviets hear us? \nJONES Not if we stay in his baffles, seaman Beaumont. Not if we stay in his baffles. Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post. \nCUT TO: \nRAMIUS SPINNING THE PERISCOPE in Red October's Conn. At all stations, helm, fire control, quartermaster, sailors work with galvanic prec s4r n. Standing next \nTO BORODIN \nCAPTAIN LIEUTENANT BORIS KAMAROV Red October's navigator, watches Ramius i tently. The tension is palpable. Something extraordinary is about to happen: \nRAMIUS Down scope. \n(TURNING) Any. sonar contacts? \nKAMAROV Sonar is clear, Captain. \nRAMIUS All right. rm going to address the crew. Ramius grabs the whip telephone. Jaw set, his eyes blaze with \nHYPNOTIC INTENSITY: \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) \nA LOBBY decorated with secretaries and suits, all, in quiet motion. At speed, Ryan trues to keep up with Greer: \nRYAN I got a line on the doors. You know what they are? Greer doesn't answer. Impatient, Ryan follows him into \nAN ELEVATOR Greer pushes a button marked SUB LEVEL FOUR. Turning to Ryan: \nGREER A silent propulsion system. - \nRYAN \n(CHAGRINED) How did -? \nGREER Captain of the sub we had following her radioed in. Thing up and disappeared right in front of him. But that isn't the half of it. Read. He hands Ryan a sheaf of message flimsies. The descending elevator stops. Doors open. Ryan reads. Greer leaves. Realizing he's been left behind, Ryan takes off, entering \nA SUBTERRANEAN CORRIDOR Reading and walking, Ryan does his best to keep up with Greer: \nRYAN Jesus... ! This is unbelievable. \n(TURNING PAGES) The Kirov, too. They've sortled their whale bloody fleet! \nGREER About the size of it. Glancing up from his reading, Ryan notices a sign at the end of the \nCORRIDOR: \nSUB LEVEL FOUR \nWHITE HOUSE SECURITY Stopping on a dime, his eyes narrow: \nRYAN Where're we going anyway? \nGREER \n(F IG) Brle$ng Jeffrey Pelt. The. President's National Security Advisor. Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there. Along with a few other people. \nRYAN Who's giving the brieefing? \nGREER You are. \nRYAN \n(WIDE-EYED) \nBUT \nGREER The yeoman'fl have the slides all, laid out. AIL you have to do -- \nTen feet ahead, Greer realizes Ryan's no longer faUowing. Stopping, he comes back: \nGREER (CONT'D) Look. No one knows this material better than you do. Give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand. He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers and say what you think. Yowll do fine. Come on. Ryan takes a deep breath. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nRYAN FOLLOWING GREER into the White House Briefing Room. Joint Chiefs are gathered around a thirty foot conference table. Greer introduces Ryan to a GENERAL and an ADMIRAL, then mingles. Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a yeoman tends a slide machine, an overhead projector and a large bulletin board. Ryan heads for the lectern. The yeoman has a list of slides, some photos and mustrations. Trying to gather his thoughts, Ryan steps behind the lectern. \nJEFFREY PELT the President's National Security Advisor arrives. In his mid-mss, wearing wire-rim spectacles, Pelt's nearsighted, brOliant and a crackerjack poker player. Generals and Admirals take their places. Pelt site at the head of the tabl, turning to Greer: \nPELT Let's get started. \nGREER Yes, sir. The preliminary briefing today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan. I believe you've seen some of his :work. \nPELT \n(TO RYAN) You may begin. Taking a sip of water, Ryan nods at the yeoman. Projector is \nTURNED ON: \nRYAN Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity. The first to sail was -- \n(SLIDE) this ship, the Red October. A variant of the typhoon class, she's some six hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two thousand tons submerged displacement, roughly the size of a World War II aircraft Carrier. \n(BEAT) Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped to fire long-range missiles from Russian waters, Red October carries fifty-six SS-311s, which is a short-range attack mis it with eight independent warheads. That's four hundred forty-eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in. \n(ANOTHER SLIDE) We believe these doors on the bow, and here again on the stern, enclose a magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar, which may allow the sub to run totally silent. \n(ANOTHER SLIDE) it is possible this new drive system allowed the captain, a man named Marko \nRAMIUS - Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful woman. \nADMIRAL Four days. \nPELT Alright. I'll brief the President. That will, be all, gentlemen. \n(BEAT) Dr. Ryan. Would you stay for a moment, please? Everyone gets up to leave. As Greer rises, he winks at Ryan: \nGREER I said speak your mind, Jack, but \nJESUS -- shaking his head, Greer pats Ryan's shoulder and leaves. Ryan's mouth is dry. Pelt gets up: \nPELT You slammed the door on the General pretty hard, Jack. \nRYAN It wasn't my intention, sir - \nPELT \n(GRINNING) Yes it was. He was patronizing you and you stomped on him. In my opinion, he deserved It. \n(BEAT) Look, I'm a politk:ian, Jack. That means I'm a liar, a cheat and when I'm nvt kissing babies I'm stealing their lallipops. But it also means I know people and keep my options open. \n(BEAT) Let's assume for a minute that you're right and he intends to defect What do you think we should do? \nRYAN Well, somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him. \nPELT OK. When can you leave? \nRYAN \n(FLUSHED) Wait a minute. The General was right. I'm just an analyst -- \nPELT Perfect. I can't ask any of these cha\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtacters to go. None of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line. And anyway, none of them are expendable. \n(RYAN FROWNS) IR]. give you three days to prove your theory, after that we won't have any choice but to hunt Ramius down and blow him away. Will, you do it? Ryan stares at Pelt. \nCUT TO: \nCHOPPY SEA below haze-grey sky. A ape breaks the surface, trailing a small wake. Submarine is below. \nIN THE KONOVALOV Tupolav spins the .periscope in the Konova]ov's Conn. Bonavia brings him a message. Frowning, Tupolev reads it. \nTUPOLEV Mother of God. \n(TURNING) Down scope. Dive the ship. Saes in the Conn, prepare to dive. Tupalev is furious. Turning to Bonavia, he sneers: \nTUPOLEV The entire Soviet Fleet has been ordered to hunt Ramius down and destroy him. And where were we? Out of contact. Dead in the water! \nBONAVIA But, Captain. Have you forgotten that it was you who - \nTUPOLEV \n(TURNING) I have forgotten nothing. All ahead flank. Come to course three-five-zero. \nCUT TO: \nRAMIUS at the head of a table in Red October's wardroom, Borodin to his left. Seven officers sit or stand to the side. Beside Borodin \nLIEUTENANT ALEXANDER MELEKHIN forties, grey eyes, Red October's engineer. At the door \nENSIGN IVAN STADNYUK nervous, twenties, Asiatic, locks a dead bait, securing the wardroom. Tension is elect_ic, palpable. \nLIEUTENANT VIKTOR TBILISI thirties, curly brown hair, Red October's sonar offer, stares at Ramius, anxious to get something off his chest: \nT BILLSI Before we begin, Captain. I would like to know exactly what happened to Putin? \n(BEAT) He didn't slip on his tea. Did he? \nRAMIUS No, Vlktor. Visibly shaken, Stadnyuk waves his hands: \nSTADNYUK Captain? \nRAMIUS There is no way we could have accomplished our task with Putin aboard. He would have stopped us. \nT BILISI I have no objections to eliminating him. He was a pig. But it's a decision we should all have made. \nBORODIN You're not in command. \nT BILISI Don't give me that command garbage, Vasily. This is no ordinary cruise. We're all risking our lives. Everything that happens affects-each of us. \nAN AIRCRAFT CARRIER in the STORM, bobbing like a cork in twenty-foot waves, thirty-foot landing \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd strip. surging violently in all directions. \nUSS KENNEDY The North Atlantic 100 miles south of Greenland- On the deck, A LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER SCREAMS into a,;. WALKIE-TALKIE. Rain POUNDS his FACE. Wiping his eyes, he \nSPOTS \nTHE GREYHOUND. heading for the carrier. PROPELLERS SHRIEK over the STORM. LSO BELLOWS INSTRUCTIONS into his WALKIE-TALKIE. At the last moment, WHEELS RIP into the DECK. \nA HOOK on the Greyhound's belly CATCHES the last wire. SPARKS cascade on WET STEEL. Moving across the deck with an ensign \nCAPTAIN CHARLES DAVENPORT fiort ies, in a leather flight jacket, approaches the Greyhound. SHOUTING SAILORS batten down the plane. A door opens. Ryan climbs down a ramp on shaky legs. Taking his arm, Davenport SHOUTS: \nDAVENPORT Charles Davenport, commanding officer of the Kennedy! The Admiral is waiting for you in his quarters! \nA STEWARD pouring coffee into a large mug on a tray loaded down with sandwiches. Setting down the coffee, the steward leaves. \nREAR ADMIRAL JOSHUA PAINTER fifties, a man of puritanical integrity, takes a hit of the ooze in his quarters on the Kennedy.. KNOCK on the DOOR. Ryan and Davenport enter. \nRYAN;' (sha)dng hands) Jack Ryan, Admiral.. Sorry for the confusion, but, as:-l was just. telling Captain Davenport, I'm not a naval of cer \n(BEAT) I work for Admiral Greer at the. CIA. He thought I would draw less attention if I.was in uniform. \nPAINTER You want coffee? Something to eat? \n(RYAN DOESN'T) Alright:. What can I do.for you, son? You gonna tell me what all this activity is about? Ryan hands Painter a lettew. Opening It, Painter studies the \ncontents. Davenport leans on a bulkhead, staring at Ryan. Painter returns the letter: \nPAINTER (CONT'D) Can't get any higher authority than that. Now, what's going on? \nCUT TO: \nJONES at a translucent status board in the quartermaster's station on the Dalla. Behind the status board, projected on a screen, a nautical map of the North Atlantic. Mancuso and Thompson enter. \nJONES \n(TO MANCUSO) I know you're busy, Captain. But I may have something here. \nMANCUSO Go ahead. \nJONES I've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared. I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it. But when I asked the computer to identify it, the answer I got. was magma displacement. \nMANCUSO Magma displacement? \nJONES Yes sir. See, the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it. to hunt for submarines - \nMANCUSO utto the chase, Jonesy._:., \nJONES Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious, and. started tracking. the sound on our lateral array. I located it four different times. The fifth time it was gone and I couldn't find it. But I want to show you what I worked up. Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map: \nJONES (CONT'D) The first contact was at zero-nine-Been hours and the bearing was two-six-nine. \n(DRAWING LINE) Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine- forty-eight is was two-ive-zero. \n(ANOTHER LINE) I came back to it at about ten-hundred and the bearing was two-four-two. The last signal was real faint and I didn't have a very good lock on it. \nMANCUSO So? \nJONES Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern: \nMANCUSO Headed directly into Red Route One. \nJONES Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast. \nTHOMPSON What do you think, captain? Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones: \nMANCUSO Let me see if I got this straight. The three minion dollar computer tells you you're chasing after an earthquake and you aren't convinced. So you get curious and came up with this theory: on your own? \nJONES \n(UNCERTAIN) Yes, sir. \nMANCUSO Relax, Jonesy. You sold me. Jones grans. \nMANCUSO (CONT'D) Let me ask you this. If we get close to this supers lent sub again, you think you can track him down? \nJONES Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for, I'1 bag the sucker cold. \nPILOT \n(INTO HEADSET) You have permission to shift aircraft control. \n(TO COPILOT) Ask God for forgiveness, Comrade. \nIN THE FUSELAGE of the Foxtrot, Ama1ric enters a program on his keyboard. Watching it lock in, he announces: \nAMALRIC \n(INTO HEADSET) Computer is now in control, of aircraft. \nIN THE SKY the Foxtrot levels off. Bomb bay doors inch open, revealing a torpedo, sixteen inches in diameter and eight feet long. As the plane's nose dips, the torpedo relaasee. parachute opening behind, a thousand pounds of doomsday device dive earthward at dizzying speed, splashing into choppy sea. \nON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, Ramius listens to SONAR on AUDIO. Faint PINGS appear, growing inexorably LOUDER, more FREQUENT, the submariner's worst nightmare: \nTBILISI (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) High speed screw l Torpedo in the water! \nRAMIUS \n(INTO MIKE) Torpedo room, this is the Captain. Launch counter-measure. The Conn SHUDDERS. Metal GRINDS. Within moments, a second PINGING Is added to that of the TORPEDO on AUDIO. \nTORPEDO ROOM (VO) \n(ON SPEAKER) Captain, this is the torpedo room. Counter-measure has been launched. \nIN THE WATER outskle Red October. The counter-measure, a device similar to a torpedo, designed to confuse acoustic homing mechanisms, spins away Pram Red October on high-speed screws. \nON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, torpedo and counter-measure PING LOUDLY on ship's SPEAKERS. Cool as ice, Ramius turns to Kamarov, at dive control: \nRAMIUS Bottom the ship. \nSTADNYUK Wait! Leaving his quartermaster's station, Stadnyuk stands on shaky legs between Ramius and Kamarov: \nSTADNYUK (CONT'D) The bottom is five hundred meters down. We9l be crushed! \nRAMIUS You're relieved of your duties, Ivan! Return to your quarters. \n(BEAT) Now! Amplified PINGS. Torpedo's getting CLOSER. The counter-measure is MOVING AWAY. Waiting until. Stadnyuk has gone, Ramius turns to the Kamarov: \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) Bottom the damn ship! \nIN THE WATER Tanks flooding, Red October dives into the abyss.. Beyond, in the clammering dark, the torpedo hurtles relentlessly forward, death on wheels. \nIN THE FUSELAGE of the Foxtrot, Amalrk listens to the torpedo: \nAMALRIC \n(ON HEADSET) Weapon has locked onto target and is homing. \nON RED OCTOBER:. in the Conn, men bang on. Everything is at a forty-five degree down angle. Kamarov watches a depth gauge plummet. \nKAMAROV Four hundred meters. Bulkheads CRACK under tons of pressure. Torpedo and counter- measure'. PING on AUDIO. Red October dives under the torpedo. it misses the safl by inches. Lacking a target, it automatically initiates a wide turn to the left. \nIN THE FUSELAGE of the Foxtrot,. Amaltic reports the torpedo's progress, vaice f lat: \nAMALRIC \n(INTO HEADSET) Torpedo has lost contact. \n(LISTENING) Searching. \nON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, men hang on as the ship dives deeper. Kamarov watches the depth gauge creep into a red zone. Torpedo PINGS are farther APART, Less FREQUENT. \nTBIISSI (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo has passed over us. It's hunting for a target. \nKAMAROV \n(READING) Four hundred fifty meters. Estimate bottom at five hundred meters. AIL eyes are fixed on the depth gauge. Bulkheads POP. A saltwater relief valve EXPLODES. BLASTED in the fame with WATER, a HELMSMAN leaps to his feet, SCREAMING: \nHELMSMAN We're flooding! Expressinnless, Kamarov slams him back to his chair and shuts down the relief valve. The spray stops: \nKAMAROV Keep your teeth on the shelf, boy. Nobody's flooding. \n(INTO INTERCOM ) Conn, sonar. Negative, Captain. \nCOB Where is your phantom Russian sub, Jonesy? According to your calcuiat\u00c2\u00a3ons we ' should have picked him up hours ago. \nJONES He's close. I can feel it. \nCOB Close don't count in anything but horseshoes and hand grenades. Beaumont CHORTLES. Jones glances at him: \nJONES Don't encourage the man, seaman Beaumont. He's very old. \nCOB- The hell, you say. \nJONES You're an old man, COB. Way over the ham. Your trout is so wrinkled it's about to faU off. \nCOB Screw you. \nJONES Speaking of which, what happened to that Hustler Magazine that was in the head? \nCOB \n(BLANCHING) Don't start on that crap. Beaumont grins. The C O 8 and Jones are everything he hoped the Navy would be: \nBEAUMONT \n(M AY) What Hustler magazine? \nJONES For many months, seaman Beaumont, there was a Hustler magazine located in the crew's head. it was community property. \n(WORKING SONAR) Then one day, it disappeared. The ..COB. here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished. \nBEAUMONT Where'd it' go? \nCOB \n(SQUIRMING) Come on, Jonesy. \nJONES I have a theory, seaman Beaumont. I believe the CO B Is like a black widow, spider. After he has sex with a magazine, he eats it. Beaumont HOWLS. The COB turns pink. \nCOS Goddam you, Jonesy -- \nJONES \n(RAISING HIS \nHAND) Wait! Jones the tunes a dial. In the distance, barely di i nguishahle through transient NOISE, the sound of RUSTLING WATER followed by a fleeting HUM. \nCUT TO: \nPAINTER Leaning over a status board in the Combat Information Center on the Kennedy. Replete with lights, the status board reveals details of force deployment. Ryan enters, carrying copse: \nRYAN Morning, Admiral. \nPAINTER Sleep well? \nRYAN Like the dead. (re: status board) Our friends have been busy. \nPAINTER During the night, they positioned most of their front line submarines at barrier stations between Greenland and Iceland. Here, here and here. \n(PIG) The majority of their Northern Fleet surface vessels are moving in a line abreast through here. \n(BEAT) It's an old anti submaxlne tactic. Like beaters in the jungle making a lot of noise, driving the prey into the guns of waiting hunters. \n(PIG) One of our submarines, the Da71as, reports intermittent contact with Red October and is positioned here at the bottom of Red Route One. With luck, the Dallas will inte pt her. \nRYAN Could you get me aboard the Dallas? \nPAINTER We could fly you out there in a helicopter. But I don't think you'd like that much. \nRYAN- \n(ASHEN) No other way? \nPAINTER That's all there is, I'm afraid. Putting down his coffee cup, Ryan stares at the status board. A sal]ci r arrives with a message. Reading it, Painter glances at Ryan: \nPAINTER (CONT'D) DaIlas found Red October and is backing her now. Locking eyes with Painter, Ryan grits his teeth. \nRYAN \nTHUNDERING ROTORS on a SH-3 on the Kennedy's flight deck. Ryan and Davenport move to the waiting chopper. Davenport SHOUTS: \nDAVENPORT The Dallas picked up Red October and is tracking her again. The Admiral issued orders for her to fall back and pick you up. Davenport takes Ryan's arm. \nDAVENPORT (CONT'D) Ryan, listen to me. Getting someone on a sub is a nightmare. The Admiral told me what happened to you in the Mediterranean. The next hour could be very rough. Ryan ftroes a grin. A sax7or helps him into the helicopter. Davenport steps back. ROTORS ACCELERATE. \nCUT TO: \nJEFF PELT in his chair in his office in the Executive Office Building. Sitting on the couch in precisely the same position as when they last talked, Ambassador Lysenko wipes his brow: \nLYSENKO The weather in Washington is so unpredictable, don't you think? \nPELT How can I help you, Ambassador? \nLYSENKO I'm afraid there's been a pew development. \n(PAUSE) Apparently, the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate. \n(PELT IS silent), The. submarine in question, Red October, is commanded' by a Captain Marko Ramius Apparently r he has suffered some kind of a nervous breakdown... \n(SWEATING) He -posted a letter just before he announcing his intentions to fire his mis' it at the United Stat s. Pelt stares at Lysenko. Lysenko shifts his weight. _ The Russian finds Pelt's steady\u00e2\u0080\u00a2.gaze unnerving: \nPELT Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met? \nLYSENKO In my position, I'm sometimes compromised by the fact that Moscow doesn't tea me everything. \nPELT So one of your submarine captains has gone insane? \n(LYSENKO NODS) What is it you want from us? \nLYSENKO The other day you offered your assistance \nPELT The other day it was a rescue mission. You want us to help you hunt Ramius down and kill. him? \nLYSENKO Because American lives are at stake, I've been instructed to ask your President for precisely that. \n(SWALLOWING) Since you were so adamant about the consequences of confusion, I thought we might ask him together. \nPELT I understand. Pelt picks up the phone. \nCUT TO: \nBROKEN SUNSHINE dappling a choppy sea. Ice-cold WIND whips whitecapped waves and lashes the horizon. The helicopter with Ryan aboard circles into view. \nIN THE CHOPPER HOWLING. NOISE. PILOT and COPILOT navigate tricky winds.. TWO SAILORS crouch by an open door, checking a harness on Ryan. Tuiindng to the pi ot, the copilot BELLOWS: \nCOPILOT no contact with the Da'Ha! \n# (READING GAUGE) Fuel capacity is in the red! \nPILOT We can't wait any Unger! \nCOPILOT Hang on. I have contact! \nPILOT OK. Tell them to surface. \n(RE: RYAN) Hook him up! But hurry, we don't have much fuel left! Sai],or threads cable through a winch by the door. Ryan's white as a ghost. NOISE Is DEAFENING. Another sa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdar belts a harness to Ryan's back. Ryan peers down. Wind from the rotors crushes the waves. Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a periscope. \nON THE DALLAS in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him. Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets: \nMANCUSO Whoever this guy is, he's in far one hell of a ride. \n( NG) Officer of the deck. Surface the ship. A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface. Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm. \nIN THE CHOPPER the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans forward, painting to a ]ever on Ryan's chest, SHOUTING: \nSAILOR Pull this to release! Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea bans- mine-grey. \nON THE DALLAS sail in the Conn work like lightning in cramped quarters. A petty af\u00e2\u0082\u00ac'lcer straps Mancuso and Thompson into harnesses. \nMANCUSO You got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him or it! l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the water the only way to get him out is with divers 'cause most of the ship's underwater. \n(PAUSE) Fun? \nTHOMPSON \n(G NING) Why I joined the Navy. A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge. \nON THE DALLAS BEDLAM in the CONN. STACCATO orders. Mancuso helps Thompson through the hatch. Hell on wheels, Mancuso disappears down a passageway. \nIN THE WATER Jones and Ryan ride waves by the curved hull. of the ship. Jones offers Ryan his mouthpiece. \nRYAN Wait a minute! \nJONES Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking thing in your mouth and breathe! Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan \nUNDER THE WATER into bruised silence. Pulling themselves downward along the Dalla rolling hull, Ryan and Jones share oxygen. \nIN THE ESCAPE TRUNK Ryan and Jones pull themselves inside. Blazing light ignites a fire storm of one-caned organisms. Eyes wide, Ryan watches Jones c3 se the hatch. Jones starts draining the trunk. Everything slows down. Echoes REVERBERATE. The water level in the trunk drops and the \nSHRIEK OF PRESSURIZED AIR ASSAULTS Ryan's EARDRUMS. Hurling the mouthpiece. away, he gulps air in the rapidly draining trunk like a banked trout. \nIN THE HALLWAY outside the trunk, Mancuso and crew open the hatch. Tumbling out, Ryan stands; on shaky legs, excited, babbling: \nRYAN Jesus Christ! I cant believe it! Jesus Christ --\u00c2\u00bb \nMANCUSO Take it easy -- \nRYAN When I hit the water, it was like Ice. I thought I was going to freeze -- \nMANCUSO Slow down. You're hypervent it sting. \n(RYAN BLINKS) Now, who are you? \nRYAN \n(DISORIENTED) Sorry. I'm Jack Ryan. Are you Captain Mancuso? Mancuso nods. The radioman appears with another message. Mancuso rips it open and starts reading it. Ryan rockets into \nPRESENT TIME: \nRYAN (CONT'D) Captain, we have to find the Red October. She's a Russian -- \nMANCUSO \n(READING) I already found him, Ryan. Then I was ordered to pick you up. \nRYAN - \n(QUIC)DY) We have to find him again. The Captain is going to defect and - \nMANCUSO What the hell are you yammering about? \nRYAN I have to talk to - \nMANCUSO Mr. Thompson. Get this man some dry clothes and coffee. \nRYAN \nBUT CAPTAIN \nMANCUSO I'Il be in the Conn. \nJUMP CUT TO: at the entrance of the sonar shack, fifteen minutes later. Behind him, in the Conn, the crew is preparing to man battle stations. Jones has returned to sonar. \nMANCUSO \n(TO JONES) Any sign that he's alerted to our presence? \nJONES No, sir, captain. operating as before. \nRyan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of the deck turns to Mancuso: \nOOD Captain. Battle stations are manned. \nMANCUSO Very well. \nRYAN What do you mean battle stations? \n(URGENTLY) Look, I've been authorized by the President of the United States to talk to the Captain of Red October. Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket: \nMANCUSO And I have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the United States or demonstrates any hostile intentions. \nRYAN \n(STUNNED) I don't understand. \n(NO ANSWER) Captain, shall I flood the tubes? \nRAMIUS (after a beat) No. Lock the (ring solution into computer. Do not flood the tubes. \nCUT TO: \nMANCUSO on the DaIIas in the Conn. Eyeing Ryan, Mancuso opens a mike: \nMANCUSO What's he doing, Jonesy? Has he l f ooded his tubes? \nJONES Negative, Captain. He's just matting there. Hold on -- \n(BEAT) Hull popping. Target's coming shallow. Mancuso frowns. The crew's a cased spring. Ryan's walking on \nRAZOR BLADES: \nRYAN What does it mean? \nMANCUSO It means, he's a very cool customer, \nYOUR RUS sian. He knows we're here and that we are ready to fire. But he's not going to provoke us. He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the surface. \n(TO THOMPSON) What's his course, now? \nTHOMPSON \n(READING) Target is on course north. \nMANCUSO \n(TO- HELMSMAN) Right ten degrees rudder. Steer course north. \n(BEAT) Sonar, Conn. Report all contacts. \nJONES Conn, sonar. My only contact is Sierra thirty-five, Red October. Bearing two- seven-zero. \nMANCUSO Conn, aye. Fire control, range to target? \nTHOMPSON Range is three hundred yards. \nMANCUSO Diving oar make your depth sixty- f f ve feet. \n(TO RYAN) He wants to go up and take a peek, we'll play along. \nON THE SURFACE Grey sky. Frothy sea. Red October's periscope appears. Seconds later, three hundred yards away, the Dalla' scope breaks the surface. \nON RED OCTOBER Ramius is glued to the eyepiece of his periscope. He spots the Dallas' scope in the water. Behind him, sailors are tense, wary. Uncomfortable, Borodin sweats at fire control. \nRAMIUS \n(ON SCOPE) Weapons status? \nBORODIN Weapons are armed. Tubes one and two are not ficoded. \nRAMIU S \n(AT SCOPE) Mark this bearing. \nQUARTERMASTER Bearing zero-nine-zero. in the Conn, Mancuso is glued to his scope just like Ramius. Ryan can hear his heart nq: \nMANCUSO All right, Mr. Ryan. You wanted to:. talk to him. There he is. What do you want to say? Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a periscope light in morse: \nRYAN American government told you intend to launch mis. lc s. Do not approach U.S. coast. Repeat. Do not approach U.S. coast, or you .w>7 . be attacked. If you understand, ping once. \n(TO MANCUSO) He can do that, can't he? \nMANCUSO He can do that. But is he gonna do that? \nON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, Ramius is still at. the scope, watching the light in the Dalla' periscope. After a moment, he, glances at Borodin: \nRAM=S Verify the range again. \n(BEAT) Ping one time only. \nON THE DALLAS in the Conn, Mancuso's at the scope. Ryan is scribbling something on a pad. Sailors hear a PING. Thompson grins. \nMANCUSO I'D. be dammed. \n(BABBLING) I knew we should have checked the reactor before we started it. When the caterpillar broke down the vare must have been damaged! \nRANIUS Keep your vcadoe down, Doctor. There are several explanations - \nPETROV Listen to me. Radioactive fuel is in the water. If it gets into our air, it could ' loll us all! \nRAMIUS I said, keep your voice down. The \nCREW - \nPETROV \n(SHRILL) I will not! We have a level four radiation leak. And if something isn't done, we're all going to die! - Ramius stands. Suddenly, Petrov remembers where he is. Ramius' eyes are bullet holes. Wilting,, Petrov stammers: \nPETROV (CONT'D) Forgive me, Captain. But - \nRAMIUS it's probably a piece of corrosion in the pipes. That happens. Now let's take' another sample. But quietly. We don't want to panic the crew. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nENGINEERING minutes later. Melekhin and Petrov prepare to draw another sample at the sink. Ramius stands behind them. Technicians to the rear. Melekhin struggles with the valve: \nMELEKHIN I may have shut it too hard. Grabbing the wrench, Ramius leans his weight on it. Suddenly, the \nvalve CRACKS. HOT water SPRAYS Ramius in the FACE. Melekhin \nFREAKS: \nMELEKHIN (CONT'D) Secure the valve before the water turns to steam ! Desperately, Ramius tries to plug the hole. The VALVE BREAKS. BOILING WATER pours out, turning to STEAM, SPLATTERING Melekhin. ALARMS GO OFF. Ramius BELLOWS: \nRAMIUS Evacuate the compartment-' Technicians scramble for the door. Searing hot steam chokes the compartment. Melekhin SCREAMS: \nMELEKHIN in try and stop the leak. Everybody get the hen out of here! \nIN THE CONN Crew members are panicking. ALARMS are GOING OFF. Dripping water, Ramius charges in. On the deck, Borodin SHOUTS: \nBORODIN \n(ON HEADSET) Captain, radiation alarms are activating in all compartments. Engineering is heavily contaminated. Radiation is spreading forward! \nRAMIUS Get us to periscope depth.We ]i ventilate! \nBORODIN \n(TURNING) Emergency surface! While the crew works to get the boat to the surface, Petrov studies a radiation detector.' it ALARMS. Gauges are in a red zone. \nPETROV \n(READING) Ventilating won't do any good. Ws getting worse. At these levels it is only a matter of minutes. We have to abandon ship!; - Sailors in the Conn stare at the Captain. Ramins BELLOWS: \nRAMIUS \n(TO BORODIN) Alright. Pass word to abandon ship. Draft a message to Red Fleet Command telling them our location and situation! \nBORODIN \n(INTO MIKE) Stand by to abandon ship! Stand by to abandon ship! All hands muster on the miss Bp- deck. Designated personnel bring lire rafts! \nON THE SURFACE Red October rises in angry sea. An emergency door on the sail opens. Seconds later, a hatch on the missile deck opens also. The sea RAGES. Climbing out on the deck, Tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to inflate rafts. Red October PITCHES and ROLLS. Wind HOWLS. Frurated, Tbilisi SCREAMS into a headset. \nIN THE CONN through the open emergency door, the sea CRASHES. Frightened to death, shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave. Petrov counts them. Ramius stands by Sorodin. \nBORODIN Captain. L,ieubenant Tbi3JsJ reports the sea state is too rough to launch the rafts' over the she. The men will be gushed! \nRAMIUS All right. Instruct the crew to secure the rafts to the deck. When all. personnel are aboard the rafts, we will scuttle the ship out from under us! \nON THE DECK. Ocean, ROARS. Fighting gale farce WINDS, sailors Me out of the hatch and tie down the rafts. Around them, the hounds of hell are loose on the face of the deep. \nIN THE CONN the last of the crew leaves. Borodin is at the periscope, Kamarov stands by Ramius. Only offfcers are left. \nKAMAROV Captain, Major Tbilisi reports the crew are secured in rafts and rafts are tied down. We should join the crew and scuttle the ship. \nRAMIUS \n(TO PETROV) Do you have a count? Have they all been evacuated? \nPETROV I think so. I -- \nIN THE CIC Curry coordinates information. AIL around him, men work intensely. Curry turns to one of the shadows: \nCURRY Seahawk One reports torpedo is launched and running normally at forty knots. I have it on sonar. \n(TURNING) Four hundred yards from drop paint. Eight hundred yards. Twelve hundred yards. One of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on Curry's console. The button is marked Command Control Detonate. The \nSHADOW IS \nADMIRAL GREER in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his cane, concentrating on Curry's display. \nIN THE HELICOPTER Pilot studies the sea. Suddenly, it BULGES. Loud CONCUSSION. Shock WAVE. A giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas bubbles vent. \nON THE FANTAIL Petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below the helicopter. A huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward. \nIN THE CIC aboard the frigate, Curry turns to Greer: \nCURRY Torpedo has detonated. \nGREER And you understand, Lieutenant. I was never here. That torpedo did not self-destruct. It hit the target. Right? \n(CURRY NODS) Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them to proceed. Curry nods. \nCUT TO: \nMANCUSO in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message: \nTHOMPSON Frigate reports phase one completed, Captain. We are ordered to proceed. \nMANCUSO OK. Now comes the weird part. Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into \nA PASSAGEWAY running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far \nFROM HAPPY: \nMANCUSO I don't like leaving the boat, Phil. But the orders are specific. \nTHOMPSON We're gonna be f ne. Rounding a corner, they start \nDOWN A LADDER Thompson will never get over how fast Mancuso can move. Aren't guys that big supposed to be slow? \nMANCUSO This has got to be the craziest stunt I've ever heard of. There's only about two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong. At the bottom of the ladder, they enter \nA PASSAGEWAY Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder. Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson: \nMANCUSO Listen. If anything -- \nTHOMPSON Captain. We'll be all right. Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch. Thompson closes it. \nCUT TO: \nWARRANT OFFICER STEINER sitting before a wheel at a brightly lit panel, just as cocky as when we last saw him in the mini sub at Tyler's lab. Next to him, a COPILOT checks a clipboard. Behind them, Jones, Ryan and Mancuso climb up through a hatch. Jones shuts it. Steiner speaks into a headset:: \nSTEINER OX. Passengers are aboard. Check-off complete. Request clearance to lift-off. \n(TURNING) Gentlemen, we have clearance. Fasten your belts and grab your nuts. We're taking a ride. Ryan sits opposite Mancuso. Jones is to Mancuso's right. The bulkhead rocks slightly. Steiner turns a yoke. \nSTEINER (CONT'D) Battery sperm? \nCOPILOT Eighty percent capacity. Homing beacon is five degrees to the right. Recommend new course zero-seven-five. Range now five hundred yards. \nSTEINER Roger. Coming right to course zero-seven- ive. Make initial preparations to land. The copilot starts toggling switches. Behind him, Mancuso checks the .45 in his holster. Ryan watches. \nCOPILOT Contact is two hundred yards below. One hundred yards ahead. \nSTEINER Roger. \n(BEAT) Hit the running lights. \nIN THE WATER -black on black. Then, in a single blinding flash of light \nTHE RED OCTOBER is revealed. Hovering above it, floodlights blazing, the DSRV. Descending, it locks onto a hatch by the sail. \nIN THE DSRV Copilot turns to Steiner: \nCOPILOT We have a seal. Skirt is dry. \nSTEINER Roger. Open the hatch. Getting up, the copilot heads for the hatch. \nTHOMPSON What's the status of Red October? \nBEAUMONT Dead in the water. \nTHOMPSON They can't maneuver with the goddam DSRV stuck to them. \n(WHISPERING) Come on, Mancuso, move it. Get the hell out of there. \nON RED OCTOBER BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar. Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin: \nRAMIUS Get back to engineering and give me some power! \n(TO MANCUSO \nRE: DSRV) Get that damn thing off my boat. Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at \nHIM: \nSTEINER I think somebody just shot a torpedo at us! \nMANCUSO No shit, buckwheat. Get the hell. out of here! \nSTEINER \n(STUNNED) Where am I supposed -- Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm: \nRAMIUS No, Vasily. I need you in fire control. We must track whoever's out there. Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair behind the helm : \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) You sit here! \nRYAN \nBUTICAN'T -- \nRAMIUS Do exactly as I tell you! Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE: \nJONES (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) DSRV is away. There's a Russian Akula about eight thousand yards starboard. \nTBILISI (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) It's the Konovalov. \nRAMIUS \n(TO RYAN) All ahead flank! \nRYAN \n(PANIC)DNG) I told you I'm just an analyst. I write books. \nRAMIUS - \n(LEANING FORWARD) Turn that knob all the way to the right. Ryan: does. AIL around him the world is going stark raving mad. Again, SPEAKERS CRACKLE: \nJONES (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo in the water. High speed screws. Beaming zero-two-zero. I estimate range at about eight thousand yards. \nRAMIUS \n(TO RYAN) Turn the helm to the heft. Steer course zero-two-zero. \nMANCUSO \n(TO RAMIUS) Wait a minute! That's heading into the t o rpedo. You should turn away from it. \nJONES (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) Steady bearing to the weapon. Still zero-two-zero. Range about seven thousand yards. \nRAMIUS \n(TO RYAN) Turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero-two-zero. \nMANCUSO No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn that goddam wheel! Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero. \nTUPOLEV Got him. Match bearings and the. \nBONAVIA We are too close. I have to set \nTUPOLEV Shoot now! Tupolev pulls the lever himself. \nON RED: OCTOBER': in the : Conn, Mancuso, Kamarov and the others are on pins and needles. What next? Suddenly, they hear PIN GIN G. \nJONES (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) Launch transient astern. He's shooting again. Very close. \nMANCUSO Left full rudder! \nJONES \n(LOUDER PINGS) Weapon is alive. \n(LOUDER PINGS) It has acquired. Sound of torpedo passing close to the hull: \nJONES (VO CONT'D) \n(ON SPEAKERS) Weapon passed close aboard. Is Ong re-attack. Hold on. It's reacquired. But not on us! Ryan appears with Ramius aft of the Conn. Pinging grows QUIETER, more DISTANT. \nON THE KONOVALOV in the Conn, Tupalev is suddenly confused, disorientaed by the \nPINGS. \nTUPOLEV Wait. I - \nSONAR (VO) \n(OVER SPEAKERS) Our torpedo missed Red October and is homing on us! \nTUPOLEV \n(STUNNED) How could that be? \nBONAVIA The weapon was not properly programmed. PINGS CLOSER. LOUDER. Finally, PINGS become a SPINE- TINGLTNG HOWL. Bonavia SHOUTS: \nBONAVIA (CONT'D) You stupid arrogant bastard. You've Idiled us all! \nIN THE . WATER Blinding light. The Konovalov disintegrates. Billowing pockets of gas embrace the deep. Thirty-seven hundred tons of steel. and iron rip apart in the blink of an eye. \nON THE SURFACE a white mountain of displaced water rises into the air, compresses and explodes. \nON THE FRIGATE in shock, the Russian crew gapes at the explosion. The young sailor who took courage from Ramius makes the sign of the cross. \nON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, as the aftershock subsides, Ryan helps Ramius up off the floor, trying to make him comfortable against a bulkhead: \nRAMIUS Captain Tupalev has just provided your pantomime with the one thing you could never have managed. \nRYAN \n(NODDING) Wreckage. \nCUT TO: \nPELT in his office seated across from Lysenko: \nPELT With the depth of the water and the wreckage scattered over such a wide area, it we]. be a long time before anything is recovered. Your people are already interviewing the crew and making arrangements for their r turn. (Lysenko nods, \nSOBERLY) This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador. I can only stress that if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avcdded. \nLYSENKO I appreciate your candor in the matter. \nPELT \n(SMOOTHLY) And I yours, Andrei.. \nLYSENKO \n(PROBING) Perhaps in the future, the technology will be available for a more thorough I n vestigation of the wreckage... \nPELT \n(STEADY) Perhaps. A long beat as the two men stare at each other. Lysenko finally breaks it off: \n", "test1_input": "SONAR (VO) Sonar contact, Captains Dead astern. An American Los Angeles 0ass3 \nBORODIN He must have been in our baffles. We can't have Raising his hand, Ramius activates the intercom \nRAMIUS Sonar. Is the American turning to Ballow us? \nSONAR (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) No, Captain. No he's not. He's continuing on our original course. \nRAMIUS \n(SLOW SMILE) He can't hear us. Silence, Impulsively, Kamarov starts HUMMING the INTERNATIONALE. Of cers and enlisted men join in. It snowballs. One at a time, the crew RAISE their VOICES \nTHROUGHOUT THE BOAT In the torpedo room, engineering, wardroom and the Conn, the ANTHEM GROWS LOUDER and LOUDER. Caught in the moment, Ramius JOINS the CHORUS. \nCUT TO: \nMANCUSO sticking his head into sonar. The COB and Beaumont are on pins and needles. Jones is working his computer furiously. \nMANCUSO it did what? \nJONES It disappeared, sir. \nMANCUSO t a d) What are you talking about? Check your gear. \nJONES Running diagnostics, now, Captain. Jones is starting to sweat. He runs his tests. Nothing. urning, he stares blankly at Mancuso: \nJONES (CONT'D) Sonar is working, sir. The Russian just disappeared. One minute he was steady four thousand yards off our bow and then he was gone. And r a second, I thought I heard... well ;-- \nMANCUSO \nHEARD WHAT'S \nJONES \n(RELUCTANT) I thought, I heard singing, sir. \nMANCUSO Singing? Jones nods. Hairs stand up on the back of Mancuso's neck: \nCUT TO: \nA SOVIET SUBMARINE dead In the water at four hundred feet. 'About the. size of the Dallas, this one's bualt for speed and maneuverability.

He is \nLIEUTENANT ANDREI BONAVIA early-thfrties, Tupolev's executive officer. This Conn is smaller than Red . October's and the weird vibes perfectly reflect the rampant paranoia of the Commander: \nBONAVIA Captain Tupolev? \nTUPOLEV What is it2l \nBONAVIA St M no sign of Red October, sir. I think we should surface and contact Red Fleet Command. \nTUPOLEV To what purpose? \nBONAVIA To inform them Red October has not appeared. \nTUPOLEV What makes you think she hasn't? Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him, Bonavia's stomach growls. \nTUPOLEV Has it occurred to you that Red October may already be in position? That Ramius is merely hiding behind his silent drive? Waiting for me to break radio silence and make a fool of myself? \nBONAVIA \n(FRUSTRATED) \nBUT - \nTUPOLEV I will not break radio silence. We wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command. \n", "test1_true": "TUPOLEV I Care little for your concerns, Comrade. Tupolev leaves.

Naval officers snap salutes. Padorin answers, dourly. Yeah- heave-me-alone. Mumbling, he moves through \nANTEROOMS Leaving a wake of aides and sues crawling all over themselves, whispered greetings on their lips. Yeah-right-leave-me-alone. Frowning and cranky, Padorin marches into \nHIS PRIVATE OFFICE where he's met by his seventy-four year old PERSONAL ORDERLY. They've known each other forever and act like an old married couple. The orderly takes Padorin's overcoat and hat. Behind a desk, Padorin lights a morning cigarette. The orderly brings tea things and incessant small talk. Padorin says nothing. Finally, Padodn sits, focusing on the morning maiL Twenty or so letters are laid neatly on a blotter. Yeah-right-leave-me-alone. Yeah leave-me-alone. Don't heel like dealing with mail\u00e2\u0080\u009e now. \nORDERLY There's a note from Marko Ramivs there. \nADMIRAL \n(BRIGHTENING) Ah, Marko. The old coot: almost smiles. This he'Il read.. Getting the envelope open, he prepares for a good time. Somewhere in the first paragraph,. his smile fades. The -hand holding his cigarette begins to shake. Reaching absently for. the teacup, nearing the bottom of the pager Padoadn chokes, spilling everything. \nCUT TO: \nDALLAS' SONAR SHACK Mancuso at the door. Beaumont is at his station next to Jones. Wearing a headset, Jones concentrates on his sonar display. Suddenly, he rips the headset off: \nJONES Jesus Christ. Somebody just stepped on the gas. \n(RE: DISPLAY) Sonar contact, Captain. Very loud. Viktar Class Soviet submarine. Cutting big holes in the water. Bearing six- five-zero. \nMANCUSO Put it on the speakers. WHINING PROPELLERS and CAVITATION NOISE fi]1 the sonar shack. Suddenly, MORE PROPELLERS: \nJONES Jeez. There's another one. Bearing .,even-three. \n(MORE) Hold on. There's two more out there. They're all in a hurry and don't care who the hell knows it. \n(TURNING) Have the Soviets scheduled submarine races today, sir? \nMANCUSO I'm gonna radio Fleet Command. He takes off. Jones hears something buried in the PROPELLERS and CAVITATION NOISE. A strange WHOOSHING SOUND. Frowning, he starts a tape rewarder. \nCUT TO: \nA PHONE RINGING, Ryan picks it up. He and Tyler are hip-deep in top secret fees in the naval archive stacks. \nRYAN Yes? \n(LISTENING) No, this is Dr. Ryan. \n(PAUSE) Affright. He stares at Tyler quizzically, waiting: \nGREER'S VOICE \n(FROM PHONE) Jack? \nRYAN Yes, Admiral, I'm --- \nGREER'S VOICE Where the hell are you?!

Trailing parachutes, they splash into the ice-cold sea. \nCUT TO: \nRAMIUS in Red October's Conn, talking in hushed tones with Melekhin and Borodin. Oblivious to their conversation, the crew moves about in the background. \nRAMIUS What do you mean, \u00e2\u0080\u009e you stall, don't know? \nMELEKHIN Captain, I need - \nBORODIN Dammit, Alex.

Adjusting his headset, the pilbt answers Amalric: \n", "test3_input": "RYAN What happened? \nMANCUSO Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself. I never would have thought of it. \nRYAN So we're safe? \nRAMIUS Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain, a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons. He won't make the same mistake twice. Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand. \nSUDDENLY: \nA FIRE STORM of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN. Everybody scatters. Borodin is HIT. SLAMMING into the bulkhead, he falls in a seated position, eyes wide. Fire control panel EXPLODES. Behind a console, Mancuso drags out his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears. \nON THE DALLAS Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar shack's door, breathing hard: \nBEAUMONT Jesus Christ.

Ramius leans over Borodin: \nBORODIN I would have like to have seen Montana. And the Indians. (eyes gT'\u00e2\u0096\u00bag) captain? - _. He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov notices a light on a panel: \nKAMAROV He's in the missile compartment! \nRAMIUS \n(TO MANCUSO) The ship is yours. \nMANCUSO But the control is blasted to hell. I can't shoot. \nRAMIUS Then get behind him and stay there. Don't let him put you in his sights or we're all dead. Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan follows. \nCUT TO: \nTUPOLEV a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking back at him : \nBONAVIA Enabling devices are removed. \nTUPOLEV \nABOUT TIMEL \n(INTO MIKE) Sonar, give me a bearing on Red October. \nSONAR (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) She's taken position behind us. \nTUPOLEV Damn. \n(TO HELM) Left full rudder. T11 shake him loose. \nON RED OCTOBER in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment, Ramius and Ryan hug the bulkhead: \nRAMIUS He'll break into a panel and short -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll be blown to pieces. Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the \nMISSILE COMPARTMENT coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT. Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully, the shooting STOPS. Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone. The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet \nin diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's working with a wrench. \nRAMIUS We must stop him before he gets into a panel.. Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody. Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket, \nMUMBLING: \nRYAN \n(TO HIMSELF) Next time memos. Only memos. \nRAMIUS Be careful what you shoot at in here, Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive. In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING: \nRYAN Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan. Very sensitive.. .in here... \n", "test3_true": "JONES (VO) \n(ON SPEAKERS) He's going deep! \nMANCUSO \n(TO KAMAROV) Twenty degrees down on the bowl \nIN THE MISSILE COMPARTMENT The wall becomes the floor. Fighting to keep his balance, Ryan walks on the wall, still MUMBLING: \nRYAN Sensitive stuff...in here ...I have to... be careful... of course. The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan hangs at a ninety degree angle. GUNFIRE. Bullets RIP into the BULKHEAD inches from his HEAD: \nRYAN (CONT'D) I have to be careful what I shoot at.. He doesn't have to be careful... He can shoot at anything he wants. \nIN THE CIC aboard the frigate, curry hunches over a console. Greer and Tyler \nWATCH ANXIOUSLY: \nCURRY The Akula is too fast. No way Red October can stay behind her. lt's only a matter of time now. \n(BEAT) The Akula's turning. She's fired another torpedo. This one can't miss. \nON RED OCTOBER in sonar, Jones and Tbzisi hear PINGING become LOUDER, more FREQUENT. Holding the mike, ashen: \nJONES Another torpedo, Captain. It has enabled and is active. It has acquired us and is homing. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DEEP Red October looms into view. To the right, the Konovalov shimmers in the dark. Between them, the torpedo appears. PINGS grow CLOSER and CLOSER. At the last minute \nTHE DALLAS raves into view, rocketing forward at full, bore, streaking between Red October and the torpedo. it's really something. \nIN THE CIC aboard the frigate, Curry SHOUTS: \nCURRY Jesus Chi i t. \nGREER \nI \nCURRY The Dallas has moved between Red October and the torpedo. The torpedo is chasing the Dallas now! \nON THE DALLAS in the sonar shack. Beaumont works his equipment, speaking into a \nMIKE: \nBEAUMONT Conn, sonar. Torpedo is in acquisition. Range five hundred yards and c3nsing. You've done it, Mr. Thompson! \nIN THE CONN on the Dallas, Thompson stands on the deck. The COB is at ballasCt control, holding the emergency blow handles. \nTHOMPSON Chief, release counter-measures and emergency blow all main valves. Let's hope to Christ this works! \nCOB \n(ON PHONE} Signal ejector station. Release counter-measures. \n(PULLING HANDLES) Emergency blow ! SHRIEK of the BLOW is DEAFENING. The deck angles crazily upwards at thirty degrees. Gear CRASHES to the FLOOR. Eardrums SHATTERING, Thompson holds on, fighting gravity. \nIN THE WATER the DAIlas heads for the surface. Counter-measures head for the bottom. The incoming torpedo chases the counter-measures, disappearing into the abyss. \nON THE SURFACE The Da11a ERUPTS from the WATER at THIRTY DEGREES, her bottom exposed well aft of the sail. A broaching behemoth, she CRASHES back into the sea, DISPLACING TONS of WATER. \nON THE FRIGATE neither Soviet nor American sailors on the fantail can believe their eyes. Peirov's jaw drops. Has the entire world gone completely insane?. \nON RED OCTOBER in the missile compartment, blood pounding, Ryan leans flat against a missile tube. On the other side of the tube, METAL fans on \nCONCRETE. Rounding the tube, Ryan holds the .45 at arm's length. Kneeling before him, directly in front of an open panel on the missale bay is a Sovvet sail or with crazy eyes: \nIT'S LOGINOV the cook's assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange. He's got a hot wire in each hand. Time stands sthl. Ryan stares at Loginov. Loginov stares back. There's something in the Loginov's eyes, an uncompromising, irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness. For a moment, Ryan's paralyzed, a rabbit before a cobra. Deliberately, Loginov begins to move his hands together, bringing the wires closer. Ryan tri es to speak. He can't. Loginov's grin cracks wide like a rotten egg. \nRYAN FIRES Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a MULE. Loginov is delivered to eternity. Impotent, the wires fall to the floor. \nON THE KONOVALOV Flushed, Tupolev towers over fire oontroL Seated before him, Bonavia tries to hang on to his sanity. \nBONAVIA Directly ahead. Range five hundred yards. \n"}

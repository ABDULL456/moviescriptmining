Sorry for the confusion, but, as:-l was just. telling Captain Davenport, I'm not a naval of cer \n(BEAT) I work for Admiral Greer at the. CIA. He thought I would draw less attention if I.was in uniform. \nPAINTER You want coffee? Something to eat? \n(RYAN DOESN'T) Alright:. What can I do.for you, son? You gonna tell me what all this activity is about? Ryan hands Painter a lettew. Opening It, Painter studies the \ncontents. Davenport leans on a bulkhead, staring at Ryan. Painter returns the letter: \nPAINTER (CONT'D) Can't get any higher authority than that. Now, what's going on? \nCUT TO: \nJONES at a translucent status board in the quartermaster's station on the Dalla. Behind the status board, projected on a screen, a nautical map of the North Atlantic. Mancuso and Thompson enter. \nJONES \n(TO MANCUSO) I know you're busy, Captain. But I may have something here. \nMANCUSO Go ahead. \nJONES I've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared. I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it. But when I asked the computer to identify it, the answer I got. was magma displacement. \nMANCUSO Magma displacement? \nJONES Yes sir. See, the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it. to hunt for submarines - \nMANCUSO utto the chase, Jonesy._:., \nJONES Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious, and. started tracking. the sound on our lateral array. I located it four different times. The fifth time it was gone and I couldn't find it. But I want to show you what I worked up. Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map: \nJONES (CONT'D) The first contact was at zero-nine-Been hours and the bearing was two-six-nine. \n(DRAWING LINE) Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine- forty-eight is was two-ive-zero. \n(ANOTHER LINE) I came back to it at about ten-hundred and the bearing was two-four-two. The last signal was real faint and I didn't have a very good lock on it. \nMANCUSO So? \nJONES Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern: \nMANCUSO Headed directly into Red Route One. \nJONES Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast. \nTHOMPSON What do you think, captain? Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones: \nMANCUSO Let me see if I got this straight. The three minion dollar computer tells you you're chasing after an earthquake and you aren't convinced. So you get curious and came up with this theory: on your own? \nJONES \n(UNCERTAIN) Yes, sir. \nMANCUSO Relax, Jonesy. You sold me. Jones grans. \nMANCUSO (CONT'D) Let me ask you this. If we get close to this supers lent sub again, you think you can track him down? \nJONES Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for, I'1 bag the sucker cold. \n", "test1_true": "DAVENPORT frowning at Ryan, who sits opposite him, finishing a sandwich: \nDAVENPORT Christ'_ I've heard some strange stuff, Ryan, but that takes it.

Over by the porthole, Painter clears his throat: \nPAINTER For the sake of argument, let's assume you're right and Ramius intends to defect. What are you gonna do with the boat? You cant keep it. The Russians will. want it back. And theyRl know you've got it, :`because the crew wl]l tell them so.

(Ryan smiles weakly) Still, it would be nice to keep it. When's the last time you slept? \nRYAN Can't remember. Every time I get. the chance, somebody puts me on another airplane. \nPAINTER OK. Why don't you rack out fear a while. The chief outside will find you quarters. \n(STANDING) We'll be in CIC in the morning. It's gonna get real interesting out here the ' next couple of days. \nPAINTER When you shook hands with him, you notice the ring on his finger,, Chuck? \n(DAVENPORT DIDN'T) Class of M. Marine Corps. \nPAINTER Greer told me about him. Three weeks after he was commissioned, he was in a chopper on a rescue mission in the Med. They went down. Bad. P11 and crew killed instantly.

Oblivious to their conversation, the crew moves about in the background. \nRAMIUS What do you mean, \u00e2\u0080\u009e you stall, don't know? \nMELEKHIN Captain, I need - \nBORODIN Dammit, Alex.

Climbing out on the deck, Tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to inflate rafts. Red October PITCHES and ROLLS. Wind HOWLS. Frurated, Tbilisi SCREAMS into a headset. \nIN THE CONN through the open emergency door, the sea CRASHES. Frightened to death, shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave.

At the door, Ramius stops him: \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) Doctor. When you get home. You will. hear many stories about me and some are true. But tell them that in the end I did my duty. Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it. \nRAMIUS (CONT'D) \n(TO BORODIN) Submerge the ship. \nON THE DECK the ocean RAGES. Red October sets to submerge. GEYSERS of WATER and air EXPLODE hundreds of feet in the sky as she dives. The BLOWBACK is STAGGERING. Wild-eyed sailors in rubber rafts hang on for their lives. On the horizon, Petrov spots the American frigate hurtling forward, light flashing. A puff of smoke appears, fbnowed by a muted EXPLOSION. The frigate's FIRING. As the round comes in, there is an \nEARSPLITTING SHRIEK. A hundred yards beyond Red October's bow, the SEA EXPLODES. The CONCUSSION and the STORM are mind-bending. Petrov thinks the world's coming to an end. In the rafts, men slash at ropes binding them to the deck. One by one, they drift free of the submerging ship into foaming sea. One sailor can't cut his rope. His raft's dragged under. Wind HOWLS. The frigate FIRES AGAIN. Another EARSPLITTING SHRIEK. Another EXPLOSION. Tons of icy saltwater cascade over Petxov's head. - Gulping air, Petrov spots the raft and sail r pop back to the surface. Red October's sail disappears. Sailors haul freezing men from raging water. Hell on earth. \nCUT TO: \nTHE FRIGATE bow slicing through the freezing ocean at flank speed. On the fantai, a helicopter prepares to take off, ROTORS HOWLING \nIN THE COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER aboard the frigate, thirty sailors work various consoles replete with computer terminals, status boards and plotting tables. In the middle of the compartment \nISEUTENANT COMMANDER JIM CURRY thirties, mans the nerve center of the CIC. Curry has immediate access to both sonar and radio.

In one of the rafts, Petrov watches as a net is thrown down at him. \nIN THE HELICOPTER the p eyeballs the sea as it races by. Speaking into a mike: \nPILOT Roger that, Bravo One. Five hundred yards to the drop paint. Torpedo is armed and ready. \nIN THE CIC aboard the fcigate, Curry turns to one of the shadows: \nCURRY Seahawk One reports torpedo armed and ready to fire.

Halfway up, the doctor stares back at the helicopter hovering in the distance. \nIN THE AIR thirty feet above the water, the helicopter releases a torpedo in the area where Red October went down. \nON THE FRIGATE Petrov climbs onto the fantail.

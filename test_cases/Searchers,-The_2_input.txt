INT. JORGENSEN HOME - GROUP AS BEFORE - LAURIE READING - DAY 
Mrs. Jorgensen is bringing a lighted lamp over to the table where Laurie is reading against the fading light of day. Jorgensen's pipe has gone out and he lights it. 
LAURIE Maybe she left other signs for us to follow but we'll never know -- 'cause it snowed all day and all the next week... We were heading north, through the buffalo country when something happened that I ain't got straight in my own mind yet... (her voice fades) 
137-A 
EXT. SNOW COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - TWO RIDERS (COLORADO FOOTAGE) 
The two men are picking their way through a snow-mantled grove. Martin's voice resumes the narration. 
MARTIN'S VOICE Ethan's always been throwing it up to me that I'm a quarter-breed... I never figgered it made much difference... 
137-B 
EXT. BUFFALO HERD - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - DAY (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
MARTIN'S VOICE But this day we came on a small herd. We needed some meat so we circled 'round... 
137-C 
EXT. THE HERD - ANOTHER ANGLE (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
MARTIN'S VOICE ...and came up on 'em afoot...  They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close. 
137-D 
EXT. THE HERD - MARTIN AND ETHAN - DAY (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
The two men walk from behind CAMERA. Ethan aims, fires and brings down a bull. 
MARTIN'S VOICE Ethan got a nice one on his first shot, but then he began killing one after another -- cows as well as bulls -- fast as he could fire and load... It was just a slaughter... no sense to it... 
137-E 
EXT. THE HERD BEGINNING TO RUN (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
Shots cracking out -- the terrified bawling of the bulls -- the beginning of the stampede. 
137-F 
EXT. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN (PROCESS) 
Martin strides across to where Ethan is firing. 
MARTIN Ethan, quit it! 
ETHAN (firing again) Nine... (another shot) Ten! 
MARTIN What's the sense in it! 
Ethan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches Martin by surprise and fells him. 
ETHAN (in a fury) Hunger! -- Empty bellies! That's the sense in it, you Cherokee!... 
He swings up his gun and fires again -- and again... as Martin stares at him from the ground. 
137-G 
EXT. THE HERD - LONG SHOT - THE STAMPEDE (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
Fear-maddened animals are swinging into full stampede fleeing the deadly marksman. Rifle shots keep cracking out. 
137-H 
EXT. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN AS BEFORE (PROCESS) 
The thunder of the hooves is receding and Ethan grimly lowers his rifle. Martin picks himself up -- still staring at Ethan as though at a madman. Ethan turns and looks at him. 
ETHAN Least, THEY won't feed any Comanches this winter... Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country. 
MARTIN Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too.... 
ETHAN Ain't that too bad... If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours... 
He whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead buffalo o.s. Martin looks after him with troubled expression. Suddenly he hears something, borne faint by the wind. 
MARTIN ETHAN! 
Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle. 
MARTIN Listen!... Hear it?... There! Ain't that a bugle... and firing? 
Ethan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the distant crack of shots, from long miles off. 
ETHAN (grimly) Just hope we ain't too late... 
And the two break and run for their horses.

OMITTED 
EXT. A RIVER - WIDE ANGLE - CAVALRY CROSSING WITH PRISONERS - DAY 
MARTIN'S VOICE (as narrator) It was all over long before we got there and the soldiers was high- tailin' it back to the agency with their prisoners -- squaws mostly -- by the time Ethan and me reached the camp... 
EXT. SNOW SLOPE - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN 
Horses and riders plunge downslope through breast-high snow.

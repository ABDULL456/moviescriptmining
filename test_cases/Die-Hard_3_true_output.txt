HANS You're amazing.  You figured this all out already? 
ELLIS Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building. (smiling) Hans, baby...I'm your white knight. 
HANS (dryly) I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying? 
ELLIS The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you. 
As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we: 
CUT TO: 
231     POWELL                                               231 
By the CB.  He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane. 
POWELL Roy!  You all right? 
232     INSIDE - MCCLANE                                     232 
He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full. 
MCCLANE Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things? 
POWELL (reciting) 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.' 
MCCLANE (laughing) You sound like a man with a couple of kids. 
POWELL Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch? 
McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet, flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids in happier days. 
MCCLANE Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior. 
POWELL It's a date.  You buy the ice cream. 
McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE besides Powell's comes over his radio. 
HANS' VOICE (o.s., on CB) Touching, cowboy, touching. (pause) Or should I call you Mister McClane? Mister officer John McClane on the NYPD? 
McClane FREEZES.  How much do they know? 
233     THORNBURG - IN TRAILER                               233 
Reacts, gleeful, writes down the name. 
THORSON (to Mary) Get on the phone to our New York affiliate...move, move! 
234     POWELL                                               234 
reacts, signals an Aide, who's already writing, too. 
INTERCUT: 
235     MCCLANE AND HANS                                     235 
MCCLANE (fighting to stay calm) Sister Teresa in third grade called me Mr. McClane.  My friends call me John Mac.  You're neither...shithead. 
HANS' VOICE I have someone who wants to talk to you.  A very special friend who was at the party with you tonight. 
McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the voice that tells him it's all over. 
ELLIS' VOICE Hello, John boy? 
McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope. In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him the CB. 
MCCLANE Ellis? 
Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke. 
ELLIS John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works. 
MCCLANE (carefully) Ellis, what have you told them? 
ELLIS I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party. 
McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his eyes. 
MCCLANE Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this... 
ELLIS Tell me about it. 
He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod. 
ELLIS All right...John, listen to me... They want you to tell them where the detonators are.  They know people are listening.  They want the detonators of they're going to kill me. 
Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it. 
236     INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME     236 
and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen, even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.

CLOSE ON BOB SEIDMAN. 
CLOSE ON THE MARINE JUROR. 
CLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand. 
JUDGE GARNETT In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation. 
JOE With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we? 
JUDGE GARNETT No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection. 
CUT TO: 
COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM, FIVE URINALS, THREE SINKS (INT./DAY). 
The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while he pees (a classic rock tune, like "Radar Love.") The BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh." 
The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change. 
The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ. This does not escape the MARINE'S notice. 
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (innocently, to Marine) I have some gay friends. What's the biggie? 
The MARINE says nothing. 
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.) Everybody has a couple of gay friends. Don't you? 
MARINE No, sir. I do not. 
The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see his private parts. 
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR You might have them, and just not know they're gay. 
The MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR. 
MARINE I know. 
CUT TO: 
WALTER KENTON ON THE WITNESS STAND (INT./DAY) ... 
JOE And how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea, without stopping at port? 
KENTON Anywhere from two weeks, to several months. 
JOE Any women on board? 
Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR. 
KENTON Not when I was in the Navy. 
JOE So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal instincts... Anything going on? 
KENTON Going on... like...? 
JOE Like... two sailors playing hide the salami. 
Andrew covers his face with his hands. 
BELINDA Objection! 
JUDGE GARNETT Mr. Miller! 
KENTON (can't resist) We had one guy like that. 
BELINDA You haven't ruled on my objection, Your Honor. 
Kenton seems eager to tell his story. Joe stands with crossed arms, waiting. 
JUDGE GARNETT Let's continue. 
JOE (to Kenton) You had one guy "like that?" 
KENTON Yeah. But we took care of him. 
JOE How did you do that? 
KENTON We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it. 
LAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS. 
The JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL. 
JOE You taught him a lesson. 
KENTON Yes, we did. 
JOE Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson? 
BELINDA Objection!

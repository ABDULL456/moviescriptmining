STAN Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip! 
KYLE Our moms suck! 
CARTMAN This could mean... No more Terrance and Phillip - EVER! 
EXT. UNITED NATIONS - DAY 
Establishing shot. 
INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENERAL ASSEMBLY ROOM 
Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation headsets -- in the general assembly hall.  The Canadian Ambassador stands before them. 
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby condemn the actions taken by America in apprehending Terrance and Phillip! 
A MURMUR goes through the crowd. 
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As you can see from this graph, the entire economy of Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip! Without them we are doomed to recession! 
The United Nations head bangs his gavel. 
Now Kyle's mother stands up. She is with a group of mothers all wearing M.A.C T-shirts. 
KYLE'S MOTHER If I may? 
Everyone looks at Kyle's mother. 
KYLE'S MOTHER As president and founder of M.A.C., I would like to state- 
UNITED NATIONS HEAD Excuse me, M.A.C.? 
KYLE'S MOTHER Yes, Mothers Against Canada. 
UNITED NATIONS HEAD Kay. 
KYLE'S MOTHER I would like to state that Canada must learn to stop infiltrating our country with its graphic art! 
Cheers from the Americans. 
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR Last time I checked America was a free country! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Look at this! 
Kyle's mother pulls Kenny's mother up by the head. 
KYLE'S MOTHER This woman's child was KILLED by your country's humor! Look how upset she is! 
Kenny's mom looks fine. 
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR We will continue to sell Terrance and Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough to buy it!! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Then you leave me no choice... I call for an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!! 
More cheers from the Americans. The Canadians look worried. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 
The boys are in the check out line at Bob's supermarket. 
CARTMAN What the hell do you mean I can't get Cheesy Poofs?! 
BOB Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian export. We can't carry them any more. 
KYLE Who the hell made up that law?! 
CARTMAN You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch. 
BOB There's nothing I can do. I can still sell you Cheese-o's. 
CARTMAN FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you! 
Cartman storms out. The boys follow him. 
INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door behind him. The boys all walk toward the living room. 
CARTMAN Come on, you guys... We have to THINK! 
STAN About what? 
CARTMAN About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far! 
KYLE I don't really think you need Cheesy- Poofs, tubby- 
But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for them, silently. 
Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's mother's face looks almost evil. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion. 
KYLE We already know what you did. We saw it on television. 
STAN Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and Phillip? 
STAN'S MOTHER Stanly, you're too young to understand what's good for you. That's why we mothers have taken charge. 
KYLE But they fucking didn't do anything wrong! 
CARTMAN Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!? 
The mothers all gasp in horror. 
KYLE'S MOTHER What was that word, young man!? 
CARTMAN'S MOTHER Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for- 
KYLE'S MOTHER I know what it is! 
CARTMAN (To his mother) Lick someone's ass?!

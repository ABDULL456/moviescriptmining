{"test1_input": "O'KEEFE (V.O.) Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for. \nThey rise to leave.  Bertrand with a slight limp. \nJIM (V.O.) Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie? \nO'KEEFE (V.O.) I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63. \nFLASHBACK TO Dave Ferrie's apartment on a night in 1963. The place is filled messy bricabrac, including two dozen mouse cages for Ferrie's cancer experiments.  Ferrie, Bertrand, O'Keefe, and four Cubans in battle fatigues are laughing and fooling around.  Oswald is in a corner cleaning a .22 rifle with a scope on it.  He looks different, unkempt, unshaven.  A record player grinds out a speech in Spanish by Castro.  Some other people are there as well - it's a beatnik scene: sandals, hanging out, only one woman.  Ferrie is taking pictures throughout of the group horsing around, photographing Oswald. \nO'KEEFE ...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess, (laughs) Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer... \nBILL (V.O.) And that's where you met Oswald for the first time? \nO'KEEFE (V.O.) Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as... \nFERRIE Willie, say hello to Leon Oswald. \nO'KEEFE (over the racket) How ya doing? \nOSWALD (sullen, to Ferrie) What the fuck's he doing here? \nO'KEEFE Fuck you, man. \nFerrie separates them.  Oswald seems to resent an outsider being there. \nFERRIE (to O'Keefe) Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right. \nJIM (V.O.) Would you say this \"Leon\" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald? \nO'KEEFE (in present) Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger. \nBILL Go on, Willie. \nO'KEEFE (present merging to past) ...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know \"beatnik\" type things. \nFERRIE (to O'Keefe) We're having a little meeting here. (indicates the second player) That's Castro.  Sounds like Hitler doesn't he?  Sonofabitch is going to go.  Real soon. \nCUBANS Muerte a Fidel!  Muerte! \nBERTRAND (irritated at the noise) Oh, stop it already!  What are all these people doing here anyway?  I can't bear all this infernal noise. \nFERRIE Clara, don't be so sensitive. \nBERTRAND I didn't come here for a pep rally. Get all this riffraff out of here. \nFERRIE Okay, okay. \nTIMECUT TO later that night, when only O'Keefe, Ferrie, Bertrand, Oswald and three Cubans are left. \nO'KEEFE (V.O.) ...finally they got out of there and I found myself alone with Dave and this Leon, two of the Cubans, and this guy Bertrand.  Dave pulled out his clippings which he was always carrying around.  He'd been obsessed with Castro and Kennedy for months and he started in again... \nFERRIE (waving a clipping, drunk) Kennedy fucked us in '61, '62, and he's fuckin' us now!  And that fuckin' zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee! The nerve of that little asswipe closing the camps.  Took all our C- 4!  Took ten thousand rounds, 3,000 pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons. Next we'll be living in a world where only the cocksucking Reds will have all the weapons and we'll be surrounded.  If we want a free Cuba, we gotta whack out the fucking beard. \nCUBAN That faggot Kennedy won't let us. Our hands are empty - how can we kill him? \nBERTRAND (moving with a drink, walks with a slight limp) It's a real problem getting at him. Castro's got informers on every block. \nFERRIE (pointing to a map of Cuba on the wall) Bullshit!  There's all kinds of new stuff.  I heard about rockets in an umbrella - they're tested at Fort Detrick?  I can show you a dozen poisons.  Stick it in his food, he'll die in three days, no trace.  We can put something in his beard, make it fall out, he'll look fuckin' ridiculous without his beard. \nCUBAN (drunk) Why don't we just take care of the main problem?  Which is that piece of shit Kennedy.  He's doing all kinds of deals!  Kissing Khrushchev's ass.  I wouldn't even call him President Kennedy. \nO'KEEFE (V.O.) ...then the Cubans left and the bullshitting was going on, Dave was drunk, really drunk and he starts in with Kennedy again. \nFERRIE See, what Kennedy done, with him you should take a knife and stab and kill the fucker where he is now.  I mean it.  This is true.  But I tell you something.  I hope I get a week's notice.  I'll kill.  Right in the fuckin' White House.  Somebody's got to get rid of this fucker. \nOswald looks up, listens quietly. \nO'KEEFE Oh, c'mon, Dave, you're never gonna get that sonofabitch. \nFERRIE No?  It won't be long, mark my words. That fucker'll get what's coming to him.  And it can be blamed on Castro. Then the whole country'll want to invade Cuba.  All we got to do is get Kennedy in the open. \nBertrand with his arms around O'Keefe, laughs, tries to change the subject. \nBERTRAND David, David, always some harebrained scheme or another... Oh?  What do I see here?  Oooooh, let's have some more champagne, shall we! \nO'KEEFE (interested in Ferrie's proposal) What about the Secret Service, the cops? \nFERRIE (pacing, hyper) No problem if it's planned right. Look how close they got with de Gaulle.  Eisenhower was always riding around in an open top.  I know somebody who actually went up and touched Eisenhower once.  We need to have three mechanics at three different locations.  An office building with a high-powered rifle. Triangulation of crossfire is the key.  You get the diversionary shot gets the Secret Service looking one way - Boom!  You get the kill shot. The crucial thing is one man has to be sacrificed, then in the commotion of the crowd the job gets done and the others fly out of the country to someplace with no extradition.  I could do that myself.  I could fly to Mexico, and then Brazil. \nOswald listens, playing with his rifle.  Bertrand suddenly turns cold, flashing a look at Ferrie. \nBERTRAND Why don't we drop this subject... it's one thing to engage in badinage with these youngsters, but this sort of thing could be so easily misunderstood. (he squeezes Ferrie) \nFERRIE Ouch! \nO'KEEFE (V.O.) I didn't think much about it at the time.  Just bullshit, y'know, everybody likes to make themselves out to be something more than they are.  Specially in the homosexual underworld.  But then when they got him (merging to the present) I got real scared, y'know.  Real scared.  And that's when I got popped. \nBACK TO the prison work area.  Jim and O'Keefe continue talking. \nJIM Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor? \nO'KEEFE Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so. \nJIM You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people. \nO'KEEFE Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is... \n", "test1_true": "O'KEEFE (pauses) You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change. \nAs he talks, Jim shares a sickened look with Bill.  Whatever truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an attitude that could be destroyed in court. \nGARRISON HOME - NIGHT(1967) \nJim, Lou, Al, Susie, and Numa sit around the table having an after hours conference.  The kids run in and out of the room, playing.  Susie is doing the talking, showing new paperwork and photos. \nSUSIE Your hunch was right, boss, but it's even spookier than we thought. Starting in September '63 on, two months before the assassination, there are sightings of Oswald all over Dallas, buying ammunition, getting a telescopic sight fixed, going to rifle ranges... Early November, a Dallas downtown Lincoln- Mercury dealership where he tells the salesman Albert Bogard... \nFLASHBACK TO the Lincoln-Mercury dealership.  Oswald is deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots - a mystery figure.  He kicks the tires on a used red Mercury Comet, cocky. \n\"OSWALD\" \nLet's take it out for a test drive. \nThe salesman, Bogard, is hesitant.  \"Oswald\" doesn't look like he's got a dime to his name. \n\"OSWALD\" \n(SENSING BOGARD'S HESITANCY) Hey, I got a lotta money coming in the next two weeks. \nIn the next scene we see the car, driven by \"Oswald\", zooming up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway. \nSUSIE (V.O.) ...despite the fact he has no license and from what marina says, does not know how to drive, he hits the curves like Mario Andretti at the Indy 500. Bogard later told his boss he drove \"like a madman.\" \nResume the scene at the dealership. \nBOGARD Three hundred bucks down, Mr. Oswald, you can drive outta here with it. \n\"Oswald\", unhappy, starts to leave. \n\"OSWALD\" Who you kidding!  For this heap? Forget it...  No honest working man can afford a car anymore in the goddamn country!  Maybe I'll have to go back to Russia to buy a car... \nSUSIE (V.O.) ... really dumb dialogue like he's trying to draw attention to himself. A real moron.  He walks out.  The salesman remembers him as about 5'7\", but we know from his draft card he was about 5'11\"... \nLOU ...several witnesses see him on several separate days at different firing ranges. \nFLASHBACK TO a Dallas firing range in 1963. \nLOU ...one time, November 9, he decides he needs to practice on the target of the guy next to him.  Says something really dumb to the guy, who says Oswald was a great shot. \nMAN Hey, watcha doing, boy... that's my target. \n\"OSWALD\" Hey, sorry, buddy.  I just thought it was that sonofabitch Kennedy, y'know.  I couldn't help myself. (laughs) \nJIM (in present) ...about as subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white rug. \nSUSIE I'll go you one better, Lou.  He shows up at Silvia Odio's, a Cuban lady in Dallas working in the anti- Castro underground - remember that name, a solid witness.  The two Cubans introduce him as \"Leon Oswald\". \nFLASHBACK TO the corridor of Silvia Odio's apartment in Dallas on a night in 1963.  Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is \"the Bull\", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, \"the Indian\", is quiet and cold.  The men ring the doorbell and talk to a concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the shadows.  The men give her intimate information about her father, who is imprisoned in Cuba.  The men chatter ad lib in Spanish. \nSUSIE ...the Cubans want Silvia, whose parents are political prisoners in Cuba, to help them raise money to assassinate Castro.  Something about the men bothers her.  She tells them she doesn't want anything to do with violence... about 48 hours later one of the Cubans calls her back... \nWe see a shot of Silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut with a shot of \"the Bull\" in a gas station phone booth, on a night in 1963. \nTHE BULL (on the phone, in Spanish) This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's kinda nut...  he told us we don't any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy should've been whacked after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should've done that, it's easy to do, he says - you know he's a Marine, an expert shooter... \nSilvia Odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered. \"The Bull's\" eyes are on \"Oswaldo\", outside the booth with \"the Indian\".  They're hanging out, talking to a mystery man, an Anglo. \nSUSIE It's like he's giving her information she doesn't even ask for.  She's scared, doesn't see them again till she sees Oswald's picture in the paper.  But the Warren Commission says she has bad eyesight because they have Oswald in Mexico at this time, trying to get back into Cuba. The Cubans think he's a double agent so they won't take him.  The CIA has a camera outside the Cuban Embassy and says this is Oswald in Mexico. (hands over a picture) You figure it. \nJim looks at the famous photo... the camera closes in on a heavyset man who looks nothing like Oswald.  Liz has come back in and overhears. \nAL If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald. \nJIM The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion... \nSusie picks up the famous Life magazine cover shot of Oswald holding a rifle in his backyard. \nSUSIE I even have doubts about this photo, boss.  It pretty much convicted Oswald in the public mind.  Well, according to Captain Fritz, Oswald told him during his interrogation the photo was fake. \nFLASHBACK TO the Dallas Homicide Office in 1963.  Oswald is being interrogated by Will Fritz, Dallas Homicide Chief, who shows him the original of the photo from the Williams garage. \nOSWALD That's not me. \nFRITZ It came from Janet William's garage. \nOSWALD Well, I never saw that picture.  It is my face, but my face has been super-imposed - the rest of the picture is not me at all.  I've done a lot of photographic work, and that picture was made by someone else. \nFRITZ So who the hell are you?  Alex Hidell or Oswald? \nOSWALD Well, you're the policeman, you work it out. \nSUSIE (in the present) Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, did know spy photography pretty well.  I took this picture to two experts.  Look at the way the shadows on the nose fall in a straight line like it's high noon.  But the shadow here on the ground reads like late afternoon or early morning. It's not the same time.  Also look at the crop marks across the chin. It seems like his head is pasted on somebody else's body implicating him with this rifle and gun. \nWe see a blowup of the photo - the shadows, the crop mark. \nSUSIE And of the two newspapers in his hands, one is Leninist, the other Trotskyite.  Any genuine Socialist would know they hate each other's politics! \nFRENCH QUARTER - SAME NIGHT(1967) \nBroussard walks past a jazz wake leaving the cemetery - black flambeurs carry torches, people sing \"When the Saints Go Marching in\".  Bill is with a local gambler type. \nMOBSTER Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter. \nBILL Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk. \n", "test1_id": 2925, "test2_input": "FERRIE I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over. \nLOU Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want. \nFERRIE I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation? \nAs Lou picks up the phone and orders room service, Jim answers. \nJIM You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake? \nFERRIE (incoherent) Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files. \nJIM Who was paying you, Dave? \nFERRIE You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you? \nJIM I don't know.  Were you? (Dave laughs) Who you scared of, Dave? \nFERRIE Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track. \nLou writes it down.  Seeing him writing makes Ferrie even more paranoid. \nFERRIE Hold it!  Hold it!  I'm not cooperating with anyone.  There's a death warrant for me, don't you get it?  Wait a minute.  You're not bugged, are you? \nHe feels Lou for bugs, but out of a sense of hierarchy, ignores Jim.  He checks around the room - the phone, behind paintings, flower vase, light fixtures - as the batty conversation continues: \nLOU Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I\"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready. \nFERRIE (checking the room) I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does. (holding his neck) I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this? \nLOU Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw? \nFERRIE That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls. \nLOU What do you mean? \nFERRIE Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps... (checks the room for bugs) I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A \"wanna be,\" y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me. \nJIM Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you? \nFERRIE Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald! \nRoom service knocks, and Ferrie jumps and rushes to the bathroom. \nFERRIE Who is it? \nBELLHOP (V.O.) Room service. \nJim whispers something and Lou goes to the door, takes the service table without letting the bellhop in.  Jim, excited but trying to stay even, continues with Ferrie. \nJIM Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator. \nFERRIE Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator. \nFLASHBACK TO Ferrie at the party with Oswald (obscured) per Willie O'Keefe's witness.  Jim, in the present, doesn't feel right about it. \nJIM Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald? \nFERRIE (shrugs, can't be bothered) Black, black - just give it to me. (takes the fresh coffee from Lou, lights a Camel) Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure. \nJIM Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA? \nFERRIE (laughs) You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life. \nJIM And Shaw? \nFERRIE Shaw's an \"untouchable\", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency. \nJIM What about Ruby? \nFERRIE Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games. \nLOU What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this? \nFERRIE They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out \"Alan Pope\" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called \"Mongoose\"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  \"Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive.\" \nJIM Then who killed the President? \nFERRIE Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die! (he sits down, cracking, sobbing) I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything. \nHe bows his head, holding it in his hands, and his wig starts to come off in his hands. \nFERRIE Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn. \nJIM (empathetic) Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it. \nThere's a long silence.  Ferrie, spent, stares at Jim.  He's about to crack, but... \nFERRIE They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man... (then) I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight. \nJIM Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then. \nFERRIE Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls. \nHis eyes are going again.  Deals... intrigue - thru the tears. \nLOU Whatever you say, Dave.  I'll be home.  Okay? \n", "test2_true": "CORRIDOR OF GARRISON'S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER(1967) \nA mob scene.  Press from the U.S. and all over the world are filling the corridor.

Mr. Garrison is busy but his assistant... \nA camera moves by into the interior offices. \nMONTAGE OF OFFICE SHOTS: \nBILL BROUSSARD'S OFFICE A man with the demeanor of Julius Caesar walks into Bill's office. \nCAESAR (raising arm) Hail!  Et tu, Brutus? \nBILL And you, too, my friend. \nBill escorts him out before he gets the chance to sit down, and then heads for Jim's office. \nJIM GARRISON'S OFFICE Numa joins Jim with a stack of new mail. \nNUMA Love a duck!  It takes twenty minutes to get into this office these days. Are we famous or what? \nJim is reading Newsweek, deeply hurt.  There are newspapers all over his desk. \nJIM Notorious is more like it.  \"Jim Garrison is right.  There has been a conspiracy in New Orleans - but it's a plot of Garrison's own making\"... and this - \"one of the D.A.'s investigators offered an unwilling witness $3000 if only he would fill in the facts of the alleged meeting to plot the death of the President\"... How can they write that?  Where did they come up with this? ... (sorting through others) \"A charlatan,\" \"power-mad,\" a \"hulking D.A.\" (New York Post) \"Morbid Frolic in New Orleans.\" \nBill has come in during this, completely frazzled. \nBILL The crazies have taken over the asylum!  It's a zoo out there. \nNUMA Sensational garbage sells newspapers, Jim.  What else is new?  Look at the thousands of letters you're getting. That's where the heart of the country is. (reads from one) \"Dear Mr. Garrison, God bless you for having the courage to go after the murderers of President Kennedy. Please don't stop till they're behind bars.  I am a beautician here in Hannibal, Missouri, and my husband is a janitor in the local high school.

God bless, Judith Hardy, Hannibal, Missouri.\" \nNuma pulls a dollar bill from the envelope. \nNUMA That's what it's about, boss.  For every lousy article in the press there's a hundred of these. \nJim is moved.  Bill is not. \nBILL That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a \"White Paper\" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss... \nJIM Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me? \nNUMA (to Bill) What do you want to do, Bill - fold up and close the store?  You sound like it. \nBILL Look, this is bigger than all of us. We can't try a case in this atmosphere. \nSharon has come in during this, signalling to Jim. \nSHARON Mr. Miller's been waiting. \nJIM (remembering) Oh!  Send him in. (to Numa) Denver oilman wants to support the investigation. (specifically to Bill) Bill, I know what you're thinking, but sometimes when it makes no sense that's exactly when you just gotta stick to it, head down. \nSharon shows in Mr. Miller, the Denver oilman.  He's a self- assured, impressive man in his 50's with a western accent, cowboy boots and hat, and a well-cut gabardine suit. \nJIM Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee? \nMILLER Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it. \nNuma leaves.  Bill indicates he'd like to sit in.  Jim nods okay.  Miller pays no attention to Bill. \nMILLER I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet. \nJIM Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there. \nMILLER I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say. \nJIM We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you. \nJim has gathered together a group of photos of the shooting. Sharon bringing the coffee. \nJIM They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail... \nMILLER Splendid, love to see them. \nHe glances at the photo but continues on across the room, looking at the pictures on the walls. \nMILLER Where were you?  Europe, Pacific? \nJIM Germany. \nMILLER You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific. (he looks out the blinds at Tulane Avenue) I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that? \nJIM (nettled by Miller's moving around) I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building (showing a photo) This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We... \nWe see a blurry blowup of something behind the picket fence. Miller takes the photo, glances at it and sits down. \nMILLER I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy. (Puts the photo back on the desk) How much do you have for carrying on your investigation? \n", "test2_id": 2926, "test3_input": "JIM Are you willing to testify, Mrs. Hill? \nBack at the Knoll. \nJEAN HILL (without hesitation) Damned right I would.  Somebody's got to tell the truth around here 'cause the Government sure ain't doing it. \nDISSOLVE TO a scene inside the Texas School Book Depository in 1967.  Jim and Lou walk the floor and look out the windows. Lou has a Mannlicher-Carcano in his hand with a sight and clip.  We see Oswald's supposed view of the limousine as he pulls the trigger.  Now, innocuous traffic goes by, but the iris of the camera tightens into a sniper's scope. \nLOU The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots in 5.6 seconds.  Here.  I'm Oswald. Time me. \nLou cocks the Mannlicher for the first shot.  Jim looks at this watch. \nLou assumes the Oswald pose, crouched at the window aiming out. \nJIM Go! \nLou pulls, quickly recharges the bolt, fires, recycles, fires. \nLOU Time? \nJIM Between six and seven seconds. \nLOU The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing. (he recycles the bolt for firing) The other problem is there was a tree right there... (he points) Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film. \nJIM Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November? \nLOU It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. (he shakes his head) It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public. \nJIM The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it. \nLOU That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it. \nJIM (looks out the window) Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot? \nJim points the Carcano south, right up Houston Street, following a car that happens to be passing by - a convertible with an unknown woman driving. \nLOU I asked myself the same thing.  Common sense.  Even if you miss the first shot, if he accelerates you still got him for a second shot.  No... the only reason for waiting to get him on Elm is you got him in a triangulated crossfire.  You got him on a flat low trajectory from the front at the fence there. \nThe camera swings to the Grassy Knoll and the picket fence as seen from the sixth floor of the Depository. \nLOU ...you put a third team there - in that building, on a low floor. \nThe camera swings to the Daltex Building across the street. \nLOU When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot. \nJIM (aiming) How many men? \nLOU One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... \"3-2-1...  green!\" (he taps Jim on the shoulder) Or else \"Abort!  Abort!\" \nJim pulls the dead trigger, reliving the moment through the scope on a passing car. \nLOU Main Street's over there - the original parade route on the way to the Trade Mart.  Too far right? Impossible shot. \nJim swings the scope up to confront Main Street.  Another car is in his sight.  Too far. \nLOU So they changed the route to bring it this way. \nMoving at a normal 25 mph, they knew the motorcade would have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn. That's where you get him. \nThe camera swings to the Houston and Main intersection. \nJIM Who do you think changed the parade route? \nLOU Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, \"and afterwards there's only the freeway,\" and went home. \nJIM You know who the mayor was? \nLOU No. \nJIM Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is? \nLOU Who? \nJIM General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a \"traitor\".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw. \nLOU The Warren Commission call him? \nJIM (shaking his head) His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community. \nLOU Allen Dulles? \nJIM (he nods) Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years. (sickened) Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou. \nLOU They're gonna love you, chief. \nLou walks to another window in the empty Book Depository where Oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out over the plaza, with all its ghosts.  Jim and Lou are two men - with only two men's power.  A terrible aloneness pervades their minds. \nJIM Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about. \nLOU You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong. \nFLASHBACK TO 1963 - the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository - the same place Jim and Lou are now.  Jim looks around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox radio, in repairman clothes.  Jim is watching.  Neither of these men is Oswald.  We hear the sounds of the motorcade below.  The shooter pulls the trigger on the Carcano.  A loud frightening sound snaps Jim back to the present. \nJIM (in present) Subpoena them, Lou - Dulles, the Cabells, Time-Life... the whole damned lot of 'em! \nGARRISON'S OFFICE - 9 MONTHS LATER - 1968 \n", "test3_true": "AL The U.S. Attorney in Washington \"declines\" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named. \nJIM Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt. \nAL Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet. \nBILL What the hell is going on?  Never before has an extradition request from this office been refused. \nAL We haven't tried to get Julia Anne Mercer in? \nJIM No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people. \nNUMA She's the best damn witness we have! \nJIM I just don't want to do it.  What else? \nNuma is opening another stack of letters.  The dollar bills keep coming.  He points to two giant stacks of mail. \nNUMA Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office. \nJIM (he snorts) I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years. (we see his hurt) Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw? \nBILL Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive. \nBILL ...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's... \nLOU (back to present) You know you keep saying that. \nBILL Keep saying what? \nLOU You're not digging. \nJIM I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. (a look from Lou) \nSUSIE This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald. \nFLASHBACK TO Dallas FBI Office in 1963.  Oswald is at the counter addressing the female receptionist. \nOSWALD I want to see Special Agent Hosty. \nRECEPTIONIST I'm sorry, he's not in.  Can someone else help you? \nOSWALD Can I use a pen? \nSUSIE (V.O.) He left a note.  Hosty told a Dallas newspaperman it was a warning to him to stop questioning Marina at their home when Oswald was not present. She was not a citizen, so possibly he was threatening to deport her back to Russia. \nTIMECUT TO FBI James Hosty confronting his agitated superior, FBI Agent Shanklin in one of his cubicles. \nSUSIE But what the note really said no one knows because his boss Shanklin told Hosty... \nSHANKLIN (reading the note) Oswald's dead now.  There's no trial. Get rid of it.  I don't even want this in the office.  Get rid of it, Hosty. (he gives it back to Hosty) \nSUSIE (V.O.) Hosty tore it up and flushed it down the toilet.  Waggoner Carr, the Attorney  General of Texas, says he had evidence from the Dallas Sheriff's office that Oswald had been employed as an undercover informant for the FBI at a salary of $200 a month, beginning more than a year before the murder. \nJIM (in present) This is just speculation, people, but what if the note was describing the assassination attempt on J.F.K.? (the staff seem surprised by the thought) Come on guys, think - that's the only reason to destroy it, because if it was any kind of threat, like Hosty said, they would've kept it 'cause it makes their case against the \"angry lone nut\" stronger! Remember the New Orleans meeting with Agent Quigley the day he got busted? \nFLASHBACK TO Oswald, under arrest, meeting with Quigley. \nJIM ...there again Quigley destroyed the notes of the meeting.  I think we can raise the possibility that Oswald not only was an informant but that he may well have been the original source for the telex we have dated November 17 warning of the Kennedy assassination in Dallas on November \nHolds up the telex.  We see a close-up: \"URGENT TO ALL SACS FROM DIRECTOR.\" \nJIM William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al. \nAL (V.O.) \"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc...\" \nFLASHBACK TO New Orleans FBI office in 1963.  Walter, the night clerk, receives the teletype, reads it, and runs it. \nJIM (V.O.) ...shortly after the assassination, Walter says, the telex was removed from all the files in all cities, as an obvious embarrassment to the Bureau.  I believe Oswald was sending information through Hosty... \nFLASHBACK TO a Dallas safe house in 1963.  Oswald, Ruby, and several Cubans including the Bull and the Indian are talking. \nJIM I have a hunch that from the get go, Oswald had infiltrated this group, probably Cubans or right-wing extremists.  He was at the Book Depository that day, told to be there by their handlers, either to prevent the assassination or to take part in it.  They coulda told him anything, either 1) they were going to close down the plotters that day, or 2) they were going to fake an attack on Kennedy to whip up public opinion against Russia or Cuba and reverse his policies - it doesn't really matter what they told him, 'cause he was under orders, he was a foot soldier. \nUnderneath the voice-over we hear and see Oswald, with a floor plan of the Book Depository, at the center of the group. Jack Ruby, Bull, and the Indian, two or three young Cubans and a young white shooter - the man in the plaid shirt described by Julia Ann Mercer - are also there. \nOSWALD (to the two young Cubans) I can get you in and up there.  This is a shot out the southeast window of the sixth floor.  That floor will be unoccupied between noon and one. \nBULL What about the elevator? \nOSWALD I can close it off.  The only access is a stairwell. \nBULL We get them in as an air-conditioning unit. \nRUBY No.  A floor refurbishing group. Got the van, the uniforms... \nOSWALD (his back to the screen) ...if we can get the motorcade to turn from Main onto Houston, that'll do the trick, 'cause it'll slow down to make the turn here.  You can't miss. (to the two young Cubans) He's a dead duck. \nRuby shares a look with Bull unbeknownst to Oswald, and then we see the looks on the faces of Jim's team. \nBILL I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country? \nJIM There's a word - orders. \nBack in Garrison's office in 1968. \nSUSIE Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now? \n", "test3_id": 2927}

DUSSANDER (O.S.) All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it go! 
Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle. Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth, he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein. Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly cannot. 
DUSSANDER (continuing) A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't you read?  I thought all American boys could read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day. 
The door begins to close.  Todd waits till the last moment before speaking.

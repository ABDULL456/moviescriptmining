CARNBY I'll catch up. 
Agent Miles escorts Aline out of the Museum. 
Burke and Carnby regard one another. 
BURKE Why am I still looking at you? 
CARNBY I need to know what those things are. 
BURKE That information's classified. If you were still an agent, you'd already know. But since you're not, stay out of my way. 
Burke turns to stride away. Carnby grabs his arm. Burke turns back, annoyed. 
CARNBY I'm asking nicely. 
Burke grabs Carnby's arm, trying to twist it away. But Carnby's fast enough to slip out of Burke's hold. 
Now angry, Burke grabs Carnby by the collar, shoving him against a stone column.

CONTINUED: (2) 
But Carnby deftly twists out of Burke's grip and shoves him up against the same stone column. 
In the struggle, Carnby's hand flicks into Burke's pocket. 
Agent Barr intervenes, pulling Carnby away. Burke straightens himself out, trying not to look rattled. 
BURKE Get him out of here! 
Carnby shrugs off Agent Barr and walks away. 
CARNBY You're right, Commander. I guess I have gone soft. 
As Carnby walks off, he looks down in his hand. He has lifted Burke's I-D card out of his pocket.

Aline sits in the back of a 713 Emergency Medical Vehicle. A 713 MEDIC finishes dressing the cuts on her arm. 
Carnby approaches her. Aline nods to the Medic and gets up to join Carnby. They speak quietly. 
ALINE I want to finish studying those artifacts. 
CARNBY I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later.

Agent Miles escorts Aline over to Burke. Burke is distracted by the scanning device he is holding. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALINE Commander, I need to get to my office. 
BURKE The museum's quarantined until we're done. 
ALINE At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get damaged... 
Burke looks up at Aline. He gives a minute nod to Miles. 
BURKE If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know immediately. 
Aline looks around at the Agents scanning the destruction caused by the creatures. 
ALINE I don't think I want to know your definition of out of the ordinary.

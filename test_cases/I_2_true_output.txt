BEN Guys, I hate to pile on bad news. 
Ben noses up to the window, Mrs. Kaspbrack's TV set flashing in the dark. They all nose up, see what Ben sees. 
STAN No. 
ON THE LOCAL NEWS: Chief Borton and Officer Bowers pose in front of camera with THE ONE-ARMED OLD MAN in the U.S.S. Indianapolis hat in handcuffs. Caption under them reads: 
"CHILD SERIAL KILLER APPREHENDED BY LOCAL POLICE. DERRY CITIZENRY BREATHS A SIGH OF RELIEF." 
BEVERLY That can't be true.   We just saw "IT." 
Mike just shakes his head. 
MIKE This is all crazy.    Who are you guys anyway? 
BEN The only losers in town- 
WILL Who know what's going on. 
RICHIE Welcome to the club, kid. 
They half-heartedly pat Mike on the back. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD OVER THE LAST SLIVER OF LIGHT BEYOND DERRY'S MOUNTAIN RANGE. 
AUGUST Tilt down to the OVERHEAD shot of what we expect to be "Derry 1988", but instead we see forests, logging trails, a hardscrabble 19th century downtown, and a LOG CABIN SALOON squatting on the edge of the swollen Kenduskeag canal. Smoke billows from its chimney, day drawing down to a misty dark. 
EXT. SILVER DOLLAR SALOON - CONTINUOUS 
Follow from behind, a MAN in a lumberjack's jacket walking through the muddy, waterlogged street, a double-bited ax slung over his shoulder. 
A WOMAN pleads with the Sheriff on the side of the street. 
WOMAN He didn't run away, sir! He's just a child, missing now for more than three days! 
She sees the MAN. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) (TO MAN) Have you seen my baby, Claude? He's been gone near... 
Claude ignores the woman... 
CHRYON: 
And walks into the saloon, "SILVER DOLLAR" carved deep and poorly into the wood over the door. 
INT. SILVER DOLLAR SALOON - NIGHT 
Dozens of loggers are bellied up at the bar, drinking beers, spitting chew on the sawdust covered floor. The man with the ax, CLAUDE HEROUX, elbows himself a place at the bar and throws down a TWO DOLLAR BILL. 
The bartender brings Heroux a schooner of beer, one hardboiled egg in a bowl, a shaker of salt and some change. Heroux salts the egg and the beer, his piercing eyes stuck on 
A CARD GAME AT A TABLE OF 5 MEN IN BACK 
He devours the egg, downs the beer, then lets out a belch. The man next to him gives a friendly nod. Heroux doesn't respond. He kicks back from the bar, dragging his ax behind. 
Heroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal -- $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat and changes tune to something more festive, manic almost. 
Heroux continues into the back, walking like a man in a half dream. 
At the table, EL KATOOK deals out a hand to a group of railroad bulls -- TINKER MCCUTCHEON, FLOYD CALDERWOOD, "STUGLEY" GRENIER, and EDDIE KING, a bearded man whose spectacles are almost as fat as his gut. 
FLOYD CALDERWOOD You sitting in Claude? 
Floyd reaches out to grab his hand when... 
THUNK! 
Heroux's ax falls, chopping of Floyd's hand at the wrist. Floyd recoils back shrieking, blood spurting from the stump, his severed hand remaining on the table. 
At the bar somebody calls for more beer. The bartender takes a casual look back just in time to see... 
Heroux bury his ax in Tinker McCutchoen's head. The big man tries to get up, blood pouring down his face, then sits back down again. A second chop finishes him. 
Floyd, writhing under the table, gropes for his hand on the table above it. Heroux chops his other hand off, Floyd screams even louder. 
Laughter from the bar as patrons rub the bartender's bald head for luck. The piano playing only gets more giddy and festive, then we see who's playing it: 
PENNYWISE, fingers dancing across the keys like a virtuoso. 
Heroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back. 
CRACK! 
A shot goes off. But at the bar, conversation between two loggers turns to the weather. This winter will be a jeezer. 
Fat Eddie King falls to the floor trying to crab away from the table. Heroux, bloody ax dragging on the floor, comes over to the fat man who pleads. 
EDDIE KING Please Claude, I just got married last month. 
The ax comes down into Eddie's ample gut. Blood sprays all the way up to the Dollar's beamed roof. 
Men at the bar laugh and eat their boiled eggs, dully aware of the gorefest behind them. 
Heroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he brings it down again. 
THWAP! 
Eddie's severed head goes rolling over toward the bar, right to the foot of a drunk, who without breaking his call for another drink, kicks it away.

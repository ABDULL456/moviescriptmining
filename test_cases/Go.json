A DITCH - NIGHT \nA light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night, DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat. \nWater trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine. \nThe tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids. Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding. \nBleeding a lot. \nShe tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles. Her legs are         useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to         a favorite joke. \nCLAIRE (V.O.) You know what I like best about Christmas? The surprises. \nCUT TO: \n2        INT. A DARK PLACE - DAY? NIGHT?                                           2 \nPitch black. We hear an ENGINE and ROAD NOISE. \nCLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D) It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. \nSPARKS. A cigarette lighter flares. \nWe're in the trunk of a car with SIMON BAINES (22), a skinny Brit with surfer hair. He looks around, realizes where he is. Panicked, he starts POUNDING and KICKING. \nCLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D) You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. \nThe lighter goes out. It's black again. \nCUT TO: \nThis script is copyright \u00a9 1998 John August \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) \n3   INT. UNIDENTIFIABLE ROOM - DAY                                               3 \nWe keep tight on CLAIRE MONTGOMERY (19) as she talks to an unseen guest. Christmas lights blink behind her. \nCLAIRE (CONT'd) But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here. \nShe takes a sip of coffee, smiles. She has a bewitching smile. \nCLAIRE I'm not saying this is anything it's not. But c'mon. This time yesterday, who'dda thunk it? \nCUT TO: \nTITLE OVER BLACK: \nPart One: `X' Christmas MUZAK plays. A baby CRIES. \nFADE IN: \n4   INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY                                                       4 \nA cash drawer slides shut. \nOn the far side of the checkout stand, a STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN counts food stamps. Her eyes are sunken, black. She's got a screaming BABY on her arm and two rambunctious BOYS in the cart. They're wearing pajamas and raincoats. \nIt's five a.m. and the store is almost empty. \nContainers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the conveyor belt. Ronna Martin -- the girl in the ditch -- is bagging groceries. \nRONNA Paper or plastic? \nShe wears a green apron with a red \"Yule Save More\" button. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 4   CONTINUED:                                                                     4 \nRONNA Paper or plastic? \nShe's been working for fourteen hours, and it shows. Her intonation doesn't change at all. \nRONNA Paper or plastic? \nSTRINGY HAIRED WOMAN Both. \nFinally satisfied she has all her stamps, the Woman starts looking through the receipt. In the cart, the boys knock gum from the stand. \nSTRINGY HAIRED WOMAN You didn't double my coupons. \nRONNA They're at the bottom. In red. Where it says, double coupons. \nShe finishes one bag and starts another. The Woman is watching her carefully. \nSTRINGY HAIRED WOMAN You can't do that. You can't put bleach in the same bag as food. It's poison. \nRonna fishes out the bleach and makes a big show of wrapping it in a plastic bag. \nSTRINGY HAIRED WOMAN Don't think you're something you're not. I used to have your job. \nRonna puts the bag in the cart. Looks her dead in the eye. \nRONNA Look how far it got you. \n5   INT. SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                                                   5 \nRonna pulls off her apron as she heads for the back. In the BACKGROUND, the Stringy Haired Woman is bitching to an overweight STORE MANAGER. \nMANNIE (17) pulls his arm back through with the orange juice.                    * He's on break with Ronna and Claire.                                             * VOICE ON INTERCOM                                         * Repeat, cashier to the front.                                       * All eyes look up to the voice of God. \nCLAIRE One of us has to go. \nMANNIE                                                    * Dead celebrities?                                                   * RONNA                                                     * Loser goes up.

Nothing starts with X. \nHe puts the tub back on the shelf. \nRONNA That's not my problem. \nMANNIE (to Claire) You can challenge. \nCLAIRE Okay, I challenge.

Mannie starts to audibly CLICK the countdown. Ronna shoots him a withering look. \nRONNA X...X...There is one. I know I thought of one before. \nA jug of milk suddenly shifts to the side, revealing the bulbous face of the Manager, looking through from the store side. \nSWITTERMAN Break was over four minutes ago. Who's up front? \nClaire looks at Mannie. Mannie looks at Ronna. Resigned to martyrdom... \nRONNA I am. \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) \n10   INT. SUPERMARKET / CHECKOUT LANE - DAY                                  10 \nRonna rips off a receipt, handing it to a CLUTCHY OLD WOMAN. Starts scanning someone else's groceries. Mannie is digging out returns from under Ronna's checkstand. He suddenly looks up. \nMANNIE Xerxes. \nRONNA What? \nMANNIE Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X. \nRONNA That wasn't it. I never heard of fucking \"Xerxes.\" \nMANNIE Pharaoh coulda saved your ass. \nMannie pushes his cart down to the next checkstand. \nVOICE (O.S.) There's an opera about him. \nRonna looks up at the customer, a handsome college guy (ADAM). He's cute in that fresh-scrubbed, Midwestern way. \nRONNA Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch. \nMannie and Claire remain unconvinced. Ronna reaches for the keys, CRANKING the ignition even though Mannie's driving. The ENGINE purrs. \nRONNA (CONT'd) Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any problem. \nA BUZZER sounds. \n12   EXT. DOORSTEP - NIGHT                                                     12 \nRonna stands by the intercom of a two-story walkup in Hollywood. Waiting, she looks back to the street, where The Beast sits idle at the curb. \nINTERCOM VOICE Speak! \nRONNA Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon. \nA long pause. \nINTERCOM VOICE Yeah? \nRONNA Can I come up? \nAnother long pause. Ronna looks back at The Beast, embarrassed. Finally the door BUZZES and a latch CLICKS open. Stairs lead up. \nShe motions back \"five minutes\" to The Beast. \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) \n13   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                     13 \nThree out of four lights are burned out in the hallway. \nA few feet ahead of Ronna, a door stands partly ajar. A weird red-and-green light spills out through the crack, along with an Alice in Chains SONG. \n14   INT. APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     14 \nRonna pushes the door open from the hallway. \nRONNA Todd? \nShades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality. The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism. \nGAINES (O.S.) Don't let the cat out. \nRonna closes the door behind her. \nTODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the string on a pair of sweat pants. That's all he's wearing. \nRONNA I didn't wake you up, did I? \nGAINES Nah. \nHe settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro. Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on. \nGAINES I thought you were still buying quarters off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are quarters. \nRONNA I keep him honest. \nGAINES At that level you're supposed to pinch. It's the economics of it. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 14   CONTINUED:                                                                 14 \nIN THE BACKGROUND \nA WOMAN with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. She tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top. \nGAINES You leaving? \nShe leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss. In a sneak attack, she shoves a Santa's hat down to his ears. He bats the white pom out of his eyes. \nGAINES Be good. \nThe woman is out the door without a word. Gaines looks back over at Ronna, not the least bit self-conscious about the hat. \nGAINES I take it this is not a social call. \nRONNA I need a favor. \nGAINES A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head before I give favors. I don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim. (beat) You might try just telling me what you want to buy. \nRONNA Twenty hits of ecstacy. \nHe takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. Blows the smoke out. He picks up a remote control. Aims it at the stereo. \nCLOSE UP \nThe volume meter, climbing fast. Out of the green, into the red. The MUSIC is deafening. \nON GAINES \nOn top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying. Ronna's eyes betray her fear. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 14   CONTINUED: (2)                                                          14 \nHe backs off. She looks confused. \nHe nods. Do it. \nThe MUSIC still BLARING, she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt. Takes it off -- very self-consciously. Pulls her t- shirt off over her head. Just her bra underneath. He motions for her to turn around. She does, then back. \nHer hands are shaking. She holds them together. \nGaines aims the remote at the stereo. The MUSIC retreats. \nENGINE running, The Beast is parked along a residential street in Venice. In the driver's seat, Mannie looks for an address. \nMANNIE Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for directions. \nHe kills the engine. Ronna does a quick face-check in the rear view mirror. She's out the door, moving a hundred miles an hour. \nMANNIE Ronna! \nShe looks back in. Mannie shakes the Tylenol bottle she forgot. Tosses them to her. \nMANNIE You're a pro. \nRONNA I'm a top-seeded amateur. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 17   CONTINUED:                                                                 17 \nShe pockets the bottle. SLAMS the door. Mannie tracks her as she circles the car. \nMANNIE And I'm a very happy man. \nIn his palm, two tablets. He works up a good gob of spit, then swallows them both. They're bitter as hell. \n18   INT. VENICE HOUSE / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                                      18 \nA beefy guy named BURKE HALVERSON reaches out a hand. \nBURKE Damn good to meet you, Rhonda. \nRONNA Ronna. \nBURKE Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you. \nHer PAGER goes off, a shrill CRY. She quiets it, checks the number. Burke smiles. \nBURKE Work work work. Friday must be a busy night. \nRONNA That was just a friend. \nOnly now do we TURN to see Adam and Zack standing nearby, trying to look cool. Their house is spartan even by frat-boy standards, just goodwill furniture and as-is Ikea. \nBURKE (O.S.) Hey. What can I get you to drink? \nRONNA Some of that orange juice would be great. \nBurke does a hepcat swing through the kitchen door, leaving Ronna alone with Adam and Zack. \nZACK So this party tonight sounds like it's gonna be huge. \n(CONTINUED) \n18A. \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 18   CONTINUED:                                                                 18 \nADAM Massive. \nZACK That would be a synonym for huge. \nADAM Just backing you up. \nZACK And I appreciate that. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 18   CONTINUED: (2)                                                             18 \nBURKE (O.S.)

We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car. \nANGLE ON RONNA \nwatching them with a lion tamer's concentration. Burke looks back over at her. \nBURKE Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right? \nRONNA (suddenly) You got a bathroom? \nADAM Down the hall on the right. \nZACK Let me show you... \nHe moves at Ronna strangely. It freaks her out. \nBURKE Maybe we could do this first. \nBurke shoots Adam a look. Ronna's already headed down the hall. They wait silently until Ronna's out of earshot. \nADAM We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia. \nCUT TO: \nA MONITOR \nIn black-and-white VIDEO, we're looking down on wide-angle view of the entire room -- a surveillance camera. We can see the reflection of someone watching. \n(CONTINUED) \n19A. \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 18   CONTINUED: (3)                                                        18 \nADAM [FILTERED] Maybe she didn't notice. \nAdam steps away from the door. \nRonna backs her way out the door, never taking her eyes off them. The door CLOSES. \nA BEAT. Adam and Zack await the fury. Burke looks back to the hallway. \n28   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (NORMAL)                                             28 \nA white guy with dreadlocks comes out of a locked door.

THE BEAST ON STREET - NIGHT                                     29 \nThe car is parked on the side of another residential street. \nRONNA I think it was Simon they were after. He deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the fucking register. \nMANNIE They didn't know who was dealing, just that it was someone at the store? \nRONNA They were fishing. I bit. \nRonna's PAGER goes off with a shrill BEEPING. She checks the number. \nRONNA It's Claire. She paged me while I was in there. \nMANNIE We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire. \nRONNA We can't. \nMANNIE Why not? \nRONNA They're gone. I flushed them. \nMANNIE Oh shit. \nRONNA Think of something. I need a hundred bucks or 20 hits of X. \nA long silent beat as both put on their thinking caps. Mannie tries to beat down a smile that curls the edges of his lips. He clenches his jaw, trying to keep it in. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 29   CONTINUED:                                                               29 \nRONNA What?! \nShe turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light. They're wild and dilated. And his smile resurfaces despite his best efforts. \nRONNA You took one, didn't you? Fuck you, Mannie! How could you do this to me?

He smiles broadly at an idle REGISTER WOMAN, who doesn't even look up. He then ducks down behind the counter. \nA CRAPPY CD PLAYER spins away. He presses the \"| \" button, then cranks the volume dial all the way up. \nThe opening FLOURISHES of a Latinized Christmas classic BLAST through the PA system. \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) \n32   INT.

She's alone. \nShe starts grabbing boxes off the shelf and shoving them into the pockets of Mannie's coat. Cold medicine. Allergy medicine. Every pill she can find. \nSWITTERMAN \ncomes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her. \nRonna does a quick check to see if she got everything. Hurrying down the aisle, she swipes a bottle of Evian. \n35   INT.

In the mosh pit, SKINHEADS and coked-up POSEURS run in blind circles. A stringy- haired EYELINER BOY crashes into \nRONNA \nwho had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the wheel, a foot on his ass. \nClaire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the cup. That's not what Claire meant -- she's a little pissed -- but Ronna is oblivious. \nBoth hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and loving every minute of it. \n49   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                                     49 \nThe line to get in is longer still, snaking down the wall.

Simon cranks the wheel, barely avoiding the car ahead of him. \nNot slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes through the bar. \n105B EXT.

Simon and Marcus look over to         the OFFICER, trying to be calm. Singh and Tiny peer out the         back. \nThe Ram Charger slowly approaches, no hurry. In the squad car, the Officer takes a radio call. Drunken TOURISTS walk past. The crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand. \nSIMON How did they find us? \nMARCUS It's their town. I'm sure they have people. \nThe Ram Charger pulls in right behind the Cadillac. It's so tall, all we see are the blinding headlights through the back window. Singh and Tiny slink down.

In the rear-view mirror, we see the Ram Charger, gaining. \nMARCUS We have to get off the major streets. Take a right up here. No, not here! \nIt's too late. Simon mistook an alley for an actual road. \nSIMON Hold on. \nAiming for the alley, Simon hits a curb on the way in. Singh's head BANGS against the roof.

Wider, it scrapes against one side. \nAhead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors it. The Caddy hits thirty, forty. Engine RACING -- \nMARCUS We can't make it! \nThe sweeper is already halfway across the alley. Singh braces for impact.

Peels off a printed card. \nSANDRA It's some sort of rave thing. \nZACK (takes card) Mary Xmas Supafest. \nSANDRA He left an hour ago. \nAdam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after them. \nSANDRA You're not going to kill him, are you? The little shit owes me rent. \n144   EXT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT                               144 \nAt the doors, BOUNCERS stamp hands. We move down the line of people waiting to get in, stopping on Adam and Zack. \nZACK Okay, I just have to say this. The thing is, about Jimmy, he wasn't even that good. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 144   CONTINUED:                                                              144 \nADAM I know. \nZACK Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made, God. It was like having sex with Nell. \nAdam imitates the MOAN. \nZACK Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales were beaching themselves. \nADAM And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips. That's really not necessary. \nZACK The only thing I will give him credit for is the oral. \nADAM What do you mean? He was terrible. At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up. \nA beat. \nZACK When was that? \nADAM October, maybe? \n", "test3_true": "A beat. \nADAM That is so disturbing. It's like you were there. \n145   INT.

Rebuffed, Jimmy scans the crowd. \nZack comes up behind him, grabs him by the waist. Jimmy smiles, kisses him hello. \nAdam comes up from the other side, blows in Jimmy's ear. Jimmy is so coked up that it takes him a beat to make the connection. Zack plus Adam equals bad. \nHe smiles nervously. \nZack takes a pair of child safety scissors from his jacket. Confused, Jimmy tries to back away. Adam holds him tight. Grabbing a fistful of hair, Zack cuts it off at the scalp. He lets the hair fall to the floor. \nTucking away the scissors, he and Adam walk off. \n146   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (RAINING)                                           146 \nThe tiny Miata maneuvers through the badly organized parking lot, trying to find the way out. \n147   INT. MIATA - NIGHT (RAINING)                                           147 \nZack gives directions from the passenger seat. \nZACK Right. This right. This right! (passing) That was the right you wanted. \nAdam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. A beat later, it dead-ends in a chain link fence. \nZack points to his lips. He didn't say a word. \nAdam slams it in reverse, backtracking. He's doing about 20 when suddenly we hear a loud THUMP! \nBy instinct, he SLAMS on the brakes. \nSomething CRASHES down on the soft roof. \nZACK What the fuck! \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 147   CONTINUED:                                                               147 \nRonna's face suddenly slams down on the windshield, bleeding already. Both men SCREAM. Her eyes are open, staring at them. After a beat, they recognize her. \nZACK Oh my God. \nADAM It's...It's that girl. \nZACK Ronna. \nHer body continues its slide across the windshield, finally resting on the hood. In a sort of spasm, Adam REVS back, shaking the body off. It drops beyond the headlights. \nZack looks past Adam to see Gaines standing there, gun drawn. \nZACK Go. Go. Go! \nADAM What if she's... \nZACK Go! \nAdam pops the clutch and they lurch backward, out of there. \nIN THE MIRROR \nGaines steps out to watch them go. \n148   EXT. FIELD / PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)                                  148 \nWe stay at ditch-level as the headlights retreat. \n149   EXT. 24/7 GAS - NIGHT (RAIN)                                             149 \nThe Miata is parked at the far island. \n150   INT.

The energy is still revved up to 11 -- we don't let ourselves catch a breath. \n(CONTINUED) \n\"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 150   CONTINUED:                                                              150 \nZACK Let's think about it logically. Either she's alive, or she's dead. If she's dead, then there's nothing we can do. If she's alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her, probably did shoot her. \nADAM So even if she's alive, she's dead. \nZACK Exactly. \nAdam takes another drink. \nZACK On the plus side, the only witnesses are you, me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have. \nADAM A girl is dead. \nZACK (snaps) I didn't say it went perfectly. \nAdam gets out of the car, walks away. Zack takes another swig. \n", "test3_id": 2744}

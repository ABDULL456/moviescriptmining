He shifts the MAP around, turning it upside down. \nJACK That. \nJACK walks over to the railing and hands the MAP to DENHAM. \nDENHAM I don't know ... what is it, a coffee stain? \nDENHAM looks hard at the map, suddenly a look of intrigue dawning on his face. \nSLOW PUSH IN on a STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING ... \nLOSE ON: DENHAM is CAPTIVATED ... \nCLOSE ON: DENHAM slowly looks up from the MAP, a look of HOPE kindles in his EYES. \nCLOSE ON: the STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING.

LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone freezes ... F AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB. \nIn the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and wailing in unison. \nIMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ...

I've gotta have a breather. \nLUMPY flops down on the ground, and grabs a cigarette from behind his ear and lights up. \nJACK watches as OTHER SAILORS follow suit. \nJACK Hey fellas - we don't have time for this. We've lost too much ground already! Come on, - get up! \nHAYES (quiet) They're not about to quit on you.

TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past. \nDENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ... JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM! A NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE, out of reach of the MEATEATERS! \nQUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM ... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS, CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall! \nA CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head! \nACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS.

The CARNOTAURS immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into fleshy stomachs. J ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS leaps ... \nBAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls DEAD at JACK'S FEET! \nHAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN! \nHAYES (yelling) Go! Go! \nHAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS. \nJACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic. \nJACK (frantic) Carl!?

FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the flailing SAILORS! \nA SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD. \nThe MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot squeeze through. \nANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg ... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ... \nDENHAM Herb! Come on! \nHERB (gasping) Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod. \nDENHAM Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up. Come on, hold on to your end. \nHERB (gasping) You gotta go!! \nDENHAM I'm not going anywhere without you! \nHERB You gotta leave me! \nHERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way ... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR! \nCLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the frenzying CARNOTAURS. \nEXT.

Most of the GUNS are lost. \nAILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED. \nThey are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE. \nHAYES Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know how many injured and how bad - \nLUMPY (interrupting) Injured? Four of us are dead! \nCLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK. He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP. PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby. \nPRESTON It's not your fault. What happened to Herb - it's no ones fault. \nDENHAM (soft realization) You're absolutely right, Preston ... And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that. \nCLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification. \nDENHAM (cont'd) He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket! (excited) Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it, and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids. \nCLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before. \nANN watches as KONG lopes off.

JACK follows HAYES ... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other, trying not to let the DROP unnerve them. \nANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS on the other side of the CHASM ... \nCREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.

KONG THROWS ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each other. \nKONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE.

The TYRANNOSAUR sprawls back, DEAD. \nKONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.

For a MOMENT she stares blankly at JACK ... then REALISATION arrives quickly - he has come for her! She looks at JACK with disbelief. \nLOSE ON: JACK looks at ANN, drawing a finger to his lips ... neither DARES to move, or make a sound. \nERY SLOWLY, JACK rises and steps towards ANN. He gestures for her to stay motionless in KONG'S PALM. \nNGLE ON: The salivating, carnivorous BAT-THINGS flutter out of the CAVE and SWARM around the LEDGE ... their FEAR of KONG is overwhelmed by the tempting SIGHT of JACK and ANN. \nKONG STIRS. \nCLOSE ON: JACK extends his HAND towards ANN ... she reaches out ... their FINGERS TOUCH ... \n... and KONG'S EYES SNAP OPEN! \nTIME seems to SLOW: JACK attempts to GRAB ANN'S WRIST, but KONG'S FINGERS CLOSE around ANN with stunning SPEED!

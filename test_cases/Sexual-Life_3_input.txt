She glances across the street.  A shop window sign reads, "Bail Bonds." 
GWEN My name is Gail.  Gail Bonds. 
JOSH Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may I take you to my car and ravish you? 
GWEN Hmm.  On one condition. 
JOSH What's that? 
GWEN That you tell me your name. 
JOSH Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire. 
She laughs. 
INT. JOSH'S CAR -- NIGHT 
They get into the back seat and begin to kiss. 
GWEN Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires?  That all the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size? 
JOSH People are jealous. 
GWEN I can imagine.  It must be so lonely at the top. 
He reaches between her knees. 
GWEN What are you doing? 
JOSH What do you think I'm doing? 
(beat) 
The fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success...in bed. 
GWEN We're not in a bed. 
JOSH You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally. 
Josh swings Gwen onto his lap.  They go at each other like...a couple of college kids. 
CLOSE ON JOSH As he makes love to his wife, he thinks-- 
JOSH ...Can anyone see us?...Is anyone looking?...Why should it bother you?  You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you don't know... 
He puts his mind to it-- 
FADE OUT: FADE IN: 
INT. GWEN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Gwen and her mother JOANNE are in the living room looking at samples of fabric.  At sixty, Joanne is robust and shrewd. 
GWEN Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think of...the vibrant colors of Haiti. 
JOANNE Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind me of that trip. 
(beat) 
Anyway, quit changing the subject. 
Gwen puts down the swatches. 
GWEN Alright.  I didn't say anything. 
JOANNE Because you're not sure? 
GWEN No, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's sleeping with her. 
(beat) 
And I may have to kill him. 
JOANNE Hmm. 
GWEN What?  You think I should just forget about it? 
JOANNE Yes, I do. 
GWEN Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage? 
JOANNE It depends.  It can be quite detrimental. 
Gwen begins to pace in exasperation. 
JOANNE Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late 30s.  Lonely.

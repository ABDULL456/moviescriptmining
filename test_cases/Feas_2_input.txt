Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver. 
Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy. 
ADULTERER Just bring the whole bottle. 
EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Tuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise. 
Freeze on her.

BELLE If I could made that kind of money, I'd be in Hollywood next week. 
Boss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her teeth and moves to the staircase. 
TUFFY 'Round here, there are ways. 
Boss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze. 
Freeze on him.

EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar... 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game. 
EDGY CAT That cash is gonna look much better in my pocket. 
BOZO (re: mounted head) Ya know, that deer only looks scared when you're in the room. 
Para rolls up behind Edgy. 
PARA Excuse me, please. 
EDGY CAT Jesus! 
Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline. 
EXT. BAR -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot. 
EDGY CAT That's all she wrote... 
SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball ricochets away as intended. 
Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch. 
EDGY CAT What?! 
BOZO Ohhh, now that's a rough one. 
EDGY CAT That's motherfuckin' impossible! 
BOZO (crude Oriental accent) Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go again? 
EDGY CAT Goddamn it! NO! 
BOZO Oh, come on. Crape Diem! 
Bozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away cursing to himself and moves to the bar. 
Roadie looks on, sipping a beer. 
Freeze on Roadie.

MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY \nHan moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris. BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport. ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen. Finally, the transport door opens. And standing there is LEIA. She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and embers, no one says a word. Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field: \nC-3PO Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia, \nINCREASINGLY AWKWARD) Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly. \n(BB-8 BEEPS) Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. He hurries off. Finally, alone again. \nHAN You changed your hair. \nLEIA Same jacket. \nHAN No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly: \nHAN (CONT'D) ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke. \nEXT.

Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down -- Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off. \nIT IS POE! Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive. \nFINN Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace. \nFINN (CONT'D) You're alive! \nPOE So are you! \nFINN What happened to you? \nPOE What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn. \nPOE (CONT'D) BB-8 says that you saved him. \nFINN No, no, no.

He worked on the base. \nLEIA We're desperate for anything you can tell us. \nFINN That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. \nLEIA And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. \nINT.

PAN as she moves, REVEALING HAN. C-3PO is here and some others. \nC-3PO General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. \nLEIA I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. \nHAN Leia... \nLEIA Don't do that. \nHAN Do what?

RESISTANCE BASE - DAY \nLOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. Then: \nC-3PO (O.S.) BB-8. You're wasting your time. BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS. \nC-3PO (CONT'D) It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. \n(BB-8 BEEPS) I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again. \nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY \nLeia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns. \nHAN Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. \nLEIA You think I want to forget him? I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy. \nHAN There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him. \nLEIA That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAN We both had to deal with it in our own way.

OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT \nHan finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide, vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole demeanor changes -- HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall, \nHAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE THAT BISECTS the open space. Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK- CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding. This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly: \nHAN Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns. \nKYLO REN Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAN Take off that mask. You don't need it. \nKYLO REN What do you think you'll see if I do? Han moves toward Kylo Ren. \nHAN The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. \nKYLO REN Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. \nHAN That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch. \nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS \nKylo flares. \nKYLO REN No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern: \nHAN Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it. \nKYLO REN It's too late. \nHAN No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes... \nKYLO REN I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. \nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS \nHan takes one step toward his son, but stops himself. \nKYLO REN I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. \nHAN Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch \nVANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH \nDARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS \nOUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK! \nKYLO REN Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM -- \nFINN \n(PANTING) Solo. \nREY \n(ALSO PANTING) No, no. Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S KNEES BUCKLE.

Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest. \nFINN The Falcon's this way.

STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT \nKylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes out the saber, ignites it. A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow. \nSTANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.

Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt. \nFINN Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE. \nKYLO REN \nTRAITOR! In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK. \nKYLO REN (CONT'D) That lightsaber. It belongs to me! \nFINN Come get it.

Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO -- \nLUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET! Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S \nLIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE. \nLUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW. Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER \nFINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN -- \n-- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM! \nKYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF \nREY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF, \nBUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS \nSHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN! Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER \nFOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING. Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.

I can show you the ways of the Force! \nREY The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES \nAGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND \nCHEST.

Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over, sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound. \nREY Finn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms.

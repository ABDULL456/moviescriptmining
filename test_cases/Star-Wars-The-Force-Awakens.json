{"train": "STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS \nWritten by \nLawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams & Michael Arndt \nBased on characters created by George Lucas \nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... \nSTAR WARS \nEPISODE VII \nTHE FORCE AWAKENS \nLuke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. \nLeia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts.... \nPAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen -- HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE... \nCUT TO BLACK. \nA GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER STORMTROOPER, then it's gone. \nThe FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We \nARE IN: \nINT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT \nTWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING \nQUIET: \nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of native animals. A single wind chime. Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY, orange and white, this is BB-8. Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND \nROLLS OFF FAST -- \nINT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm. The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it. In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark: \nLOR SAN TEKKA This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. \nPOE Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. \nLOR SAN TEKKA \"The General.\" To me, she's royalty. Well, she certainly is that. \nPOE BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka. \nPOE (CONT'D) We've got company. \nEXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT \nThe men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS. POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS. POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A \nGROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER. \nPOE You have to hide. \nLOR SAN TEKKA You have to leave. Go! Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off. BB-8 follows. \nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT \nTRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village, various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend. \nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT \nA ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many are HIT! \nEXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT \nPoe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING. \nPOE Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES \nIN THE DISTANCE. Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS. The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE! But just then: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING! \nPOE (CONT'D) I see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble. \nEXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTORMTROOPER #2 Nothing here. Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION. \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT \nBB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL. BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened. \nEXT. SPACE - NIGHT \nWith the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER. \nINT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT \nPoe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the hangar. He is awed by the imposing space. \nPOE All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast: \nINT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT \nOur Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But in this moment, terrified, desperate. After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187 knows he's in trouble. \nCAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. \nFN-2187 Yes, Captain. \nCAPTAIN PHASMA And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? \nFN-2187 I'm sorry, Captain. \nCAPTAIN PHASMA Report to my division at once. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY \nA metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL. Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable, between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to: \nINT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER \nAlone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS HARD onto rusty metal. \nINT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY \nThe Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT. \nEXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY \nThe Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young WOMAN. This is REY, 19. She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. CUT WIDE: Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC \nENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER, tiny from here. Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery engine and DRIVES OFF. \nEXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY \nRey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED \nSPACESHIPS. \nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY \nRey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town. Refueling, small trade, scavengers. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town. \nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY \nTIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage. Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small, passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another language. She returns to work. \nINT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY \nRey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish, unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers: \nUNKAR What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks. Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. She takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off. \nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY \nThe IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame. \nFN-2187 \nFN-2187! Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history. \nPOE FN-whaa? \nFN-2187 That's the only name they ever gave me! \nPOE Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile. \nFINN \"Finn.\" Yeah, \"Finn\", I like that! I like that! \nPOE I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. \nFINN Good to meet you, Poe! \nPOE Good to meet you too, Finn! \nINT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY \nGeneral Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at a console. \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- \nGENERAL HUX Use the ventral cannons. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- \nKYLO REN (O.S.) General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry. \nGENERAL HUX Yes, and he had help. \n(VEXED) From one of our own. PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says: \nGENERAL HUX (CONT'D) We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. \nKYLO REN ... The one from the village. FN- \nHux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off. \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. Ventral cannons hot. \nGENERAL HUX Fire. \nEXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY \nMassive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION. The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU, \nTHE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8. \nINT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY \nPOE One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it? \nFINN Hold on! I see it! \nPOE Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm -- \nFINN Where are you going? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPOE We're going back to Jakku. That's where. \nFINN No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively. \nPOE I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! \nFINN What - a droid?! \nPOE That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. \nFINN I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! \nPOE This one is, pal. \nFINN We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! \nPOE That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! \nREY (To BB-8) Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly: \nREY What's your hurry, thief? \nFINN What--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES \nFROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN! \nFINN (CONT'D) OW! HEY! What?! \nREY The jacket! This droid says you stole it! \nFINN I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him \nAGAIN) \nSTOP IT! \nREY Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. \nFINN It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more. \nFINN (CONT'D) He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. \n(RELIVING IT) Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, \nROLLS OFF) Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8, then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed: \nREY So you're with the Resistance? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie. \nFINN Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. \n(WHISPERS) I'm with the Resistance. Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him: \nREY I've never met a Resistance fighter before. \nFINN Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. \nREY BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. \nFINN Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks: \nREY Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees. \nREY (CONT'D) What is it? Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents: \nREY (CONT'D) (re: her hand) What are you doing?! \nFINN Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run! \nEXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY \nFinn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through a maze of tents: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFINN Come on, BB-8! \nREY Let go of me! \nFINN No, we gotta move! \nREY (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET. \nSTORMTROOPER Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent: \nINT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY \nRey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover. Quiet, urgent: \nREY They're shooting at both of us! \nFINN Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! \nREY Well, thanks for that! \nFINN I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! \nREY \nUNKAR \nHEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY \nRey pilots, headed for the sky! Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS. \nFINN Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! \nREY \nWHAT? \nFINN Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS! \nREY BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. \nREY \nI'M GOING LOW!!! \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nBEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC, UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand. Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY \nIn the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING! Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They are ROCKED BY A BLAST! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREY What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?! \nFinn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP: \nFINN I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat. \nREY Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR: \nFINN Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS! \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nFinn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING! \nINT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY \nThe BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY \nThe Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST! \nFINN We need cover, quick! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY \nRey HITS SWITCHES, pilots the best she can: \nREY We're about to get some! \n(TO HERSELF) I hope. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nThe Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK, TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING! The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY \nBB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing them. \nFINN Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY \nFinn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES -- \nFINN Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER! \nINT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY \nLieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing. \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. \nKYLO REN The droid... stole a freighter? \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats. \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing scars. \nKYLO REN Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but: \nLIEUTENANT MITAKA The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove: \nKYLO REN What girl? \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY \nRey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES. \nREY It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues -- \nFINN How bad is it?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREY If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS: \nFINN They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench. \nREY BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is \"need to know\" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! \nFINN (Throws a tool) This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently: \nFINN (CONT'D) You gotta tell us where the base is. \n(BB-8 BEEPS) I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. Rey pops up again: \nREY Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool. \nREY (CONT'D) So where's your base? \nFINN (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. \n(QUIETLY) Please! She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole situation, then BEEPS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREY The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again. \nFINN Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it. \nREY I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! \nFINN (searching for tape) What about you? \nREY I gotta get back to Jakku! \nFINN (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! \nREY No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below: \nFINN This? \nREY Yes! \nFINN Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed: \nREY None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAN (CONT'D) Where'd you get this ship? \nREY Niima Outpost. \nHAN Jakku?! That junkyard? \nFINN Thank you! Junkyard! \nHAN \n(TO CHEWIE) Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! \n(TO REY) Who had it, Ducain? \nREY I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. \nHAN Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit. \nREY This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAN I used to be. \nFINN Han Solo? The Rebellion General? \nREY No, the smuggler! \nFINN \n(TO CHEWIE) Wasn't he a war hero?! Chewie replies: \"Yeah, I guess, kinda...\" Rey calls out: \nREY This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME \nHan enters the cockpit. \nHAN Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS \nHIM: \nHAN (CONT'D) Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY \nREY Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on \nTHE HYPERDRIVE-- \nHAN \n(OVERLAPPING HER) -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. \nREY Wait! No -- we need your help! \nHAN My help? \nREY This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFINN He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks. \nFINN (CONT'D) You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn. \nHAN Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK! \nHAN (CONT'D) Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten \nLOOSE-- Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN: \nFINN Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! \nINT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY \nThe Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him. \nFINN You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? \nHAN I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful. \nTASU LEECH Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous. Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them. \nHAN Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? \nBALA-TIK Yeah. \nTASU LEECH Twice! Han realizes he's right. \nHAN What was the second time? \nBALA-TIK Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. \nTASU LEECH Nowhere left for you to hide. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBALA-TIK That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble. \nHAN First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED): \nRAZOO QIN-FEE Search the freighter. One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor, AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls. \nREY Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! \nFINN Close the blast doors from here? \nREY Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- \nSLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE! BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE. The GANGS look around. Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY: \nHAN ... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned. \nREY Oh no. \nFINN Oh no, what? \nREY \n(PALE) Wrong fuses. \nIN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS: \nBALA-TIK Kill them! And take the droid! The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND \nTHE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY! Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT. \nINT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY \nHan, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep steppin.... \nINT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY \nRey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks. \nFINN This was a mistake! \nREY Huge! \nINT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY \nTwo Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way. Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction -- they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out, quickly. \nThey turn a corridor -- \nREY What do they look like? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH. \nFINN They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a \nRATHTAR IS THERE! \nFINN (CONT'D) This way! \nREY Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY \nFAST! \nREY (CONT'D) \nFINN! But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey -- \n(HUGE PROBLEM) No problem! \nINT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY \nThree GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON -- hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD! The ship is hit. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY \nHAN Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING. \nHAN (CONT'D) What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly. \nREY Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO: \nEXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY \nCamera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving the cargo ship behind. \nINT. CARGO SHIP - DAY \nPUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window, SEETHING. Makes a CALL: \nBALA-TIK Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. \nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY \nA pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET, frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet that has been hacked and modified into something sinister. Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice very much in control, of power: \nSNOKE (V.O.) The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... \nINT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT \nKYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at someone addressing them. We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile and powerful, all at the same time. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSNOKE ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. \nGENERAL HUX Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- \nSNOKE General! Our strategy must now change. \nGENERAL HUX The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then: \nSNOKE Go. Oversee preparations. \nGENERAL HUX Yes, Supreme Leader. General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice. \nSNOKE There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? \nKYLO REN Yes. \nSNOKE There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. \nKYLO REN He means nothing to me. \nSNOKE Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKYLO REN \n(STEELY RESOLVE) By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. \nSNOKE We shall see. We shall see. A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along. \nEXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY \nRACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY \nCHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot, ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER. \nSPARKS! \nHAN Electrical overload! \nREY I can fix that! \nHAN The coolant's leaking! \nBEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY \nHan pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot. Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears. \nREY \n(QUIETLY) ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him. \nEXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY \nThe Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN, smallish freighters. \nEXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY \nRey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side. She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side, LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY \nFrom BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages, retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned. \nFINN Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- \nHAN D'you just call me \"Solo\"? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFINN Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? \nHAN Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER. \nHAN (CONT'D) Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt. \nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY \nHan hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the castle. \nHAN You might need this. \nREY I think I can handle myself. \nHAN I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it. \nHAN (CONT'D) You know how to use one of these? \nREY Yeah, you pull the trigger. \nHAN There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? \nREY Rey. \nHAN Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREY Are you offering me a job? \nHAN I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. \nREY You're offering me a job. \nHAN I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross. \nHAN (CONT'D) Well? \nREY If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly. \nHAN Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku. \nREY \n(BEAT) I've already been away too long. \nHAN \n(TO CHEWIE) Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. \nHAN (CONT'D) It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey. \nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY \nHAN I don't know, but it ain't good. \nMAZ If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. \nFINN (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFINN (CONT'D) You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner. \nMAZ You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers. \nREY Finn! \nFINN Come with me. \nREY What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. \nFINN I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han. \nHAN Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han. \nMAZ Who's the girl? \nON FINN Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS. \nFINN I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. \nREY What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her. \nFINN (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Embarrassed, Finn moves her away. \nREY You can't just go. I won't let you. \nFINN I'm not who you think I am. \nREY Finn, what are you talking about? \nFINN I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. \n(STOPS HER) Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... \n(EMOTIONAL) But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran. \nFINN (CONT'D) Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. \nREY Don't go. \nFINN Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time. \nINT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY \nRey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end, where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE \nDOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters. \nINT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY \nRey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows. Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment heavy with tension. Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air. \nYOUNG GIRL \nNO! She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT -- and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP -- To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see... A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her. \nYOUNG GIRL No, come back! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nUNKAR PLUTT Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is.. In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN: \nINT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY \nShe falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. She HEARS something and turns to look. Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened. \nREY What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. \nBB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads \nBACK FOR THE CASTLE. \nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY \nPost battle. Finn runs to Han: \nFINN He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone! \nHAN \n(WALKS PAST) Yeah, yeah, I know... And he and Chewie head off. \nEXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY \nHan moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris. BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport. ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen. Finally, the transport door opens. And standing there is LEIA. She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and embers, no one says a word. Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field: \nC-3PO Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia, \nINCREASINGLY AWKWARD) Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly. \n(BB-8 BEEPS) Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. He hurries off. Finally, alone again. \nHAN You changed your hair. \nLEIA Same jacket. \nHAN No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly: \nHAN (CONT'D) ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke. \nEXT. SPACE - DAY \nThe FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a \nPLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: This is D'QAR. \nEXT. D'QAR - DAY \nThe SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken structures. \nEXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY \nLARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS, a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down -- Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off. \nIT IS POE! Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive. \nFINN Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace. \nFINN (CONT'D) You're alive! \nPOE So are you! \nFINN What happened to you? \nPOE What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn. \nPOE (CONT'D) BB-8 says that you saved him. \nFINN No, no, no. It wasn't just me. \nPOE You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFINN Oh here. \nPOE No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn. \nFINN Poe -- I need your help. \nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY \nMOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA: \nPOE General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to \nYOU -- \n(LONG BEAT) It was Snoke. Han takes this in. \nLEIA (CONT'D) He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. \nHAN If Luke couldn't reach him, how could \nI? \nLEIA Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. \nGENERAL STATURA General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY \nRey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask in place, standing there. \nREY Where am I? \nKYLO REN \n(LONG BEAT) You're my guest. \nREY Where are the others? \nKYLO REN You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious. \nKYLO REN (CONT'D) You still want to kill me. \nREY That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. \nKYLO REN Tell me about the droid. \nREY (a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- \nKYLO REN He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? \nKYLO REN (CONT'D) You know I can take whatever I want. Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing. \nKYLO REN (CONT'D) ... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... (then, slight smile) At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge. \nKYLO REN (CONT'D) And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony: \nREY -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer. \nKYLO REN I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: \nREY I'm not giving you anything. \nKYLO REN We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze -- \nDESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass \nAND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED \nAT WHAT SHE IS SEEING! \nREY ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP: \nSNOKE (V.O.) This scavenger, resisted you? \nINT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT \nKylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke. \nKYLO REN She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke: \nSNOKE And the droid? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then: \nGENERAL HUX (O.S.) Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren. \nGENERAL HUX (CONT'D) That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Snoke is visibly furious. \nSNOKE Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. \nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY \nMASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han, Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES. \nFINN The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. \nHAN What was your job when you were based here? \nFINN Sanitation. \nHAN Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? \nFINN I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. \nHAN People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! \nFINN Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! \nHAN That's not how the Force works--! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Chewie MOANTALKS. \nHAN (CONT'D) Oh really, you're cold? \nFINN Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE \nLASER SIPHON SHOOTING INTO THE SKY, SLOWLY SUCKING THE SUN \nDRY. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nTechnicians at work, the SUN SUCKING seen in the window behind him. \nGENERAL HUX Report. \nFIRST ORDER OFFICER Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 4 - DAY \nA STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. The door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there! \nSTORMTROOPER FN-9330 Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary. \nHAN The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? \nFINN I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nCaptain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers. Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF \nFRAME BY CHEWIE! And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS \nARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn. \nFINN Remember me? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAPTAIN PHASMA \nFN-2187. \nFINN Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. \nHAN Bring it down. Bring it down. \nFINN Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO: \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY \nTIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside. TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM- and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue. WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY \nA REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base. Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she makes her way ACROSS. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY \nWIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit! \nSNAP Approaching target. \nINT. X-WING - DAY \nNien Nunb acknowledges. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nLARGE EXPLOSIONS atop the DISTANT OSCILLATOR, seen through the large windows! ALARMS BLARE in here -- we PULL BACK as Hux moves quickly to see the damage, he turns sharply to a First Order Officer: \nGENERAL HUX Dispatch all squadrons... \nCOLONEL DATOO Yes, General. \nINT. X-WING - DAY \nPOE Let's light it up! \nDIVE BOMBING THE OSCILLATOR, HITTING IT DEAD CENTER IN QUICK \nSUCCESSION! \nINT. X-WING - DAY \nLT. BASTIAN Direct hit! \nELLO ASTY But no damage! Jess reacts. \nPOE Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. \nINT. X-WING - DAY \nA BEEPING from BB-8, riding in the back of his X-wing, and Poe looks out -- can't believe what he's seeing: DOZENS OF \nTIE FIGHTERS! \nPOE Guys, we got a lot of company! \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY \nFinn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. Blast doors nearby. \nFINN We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. \nHAN You sure you're up for this? \nFINN Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to \nSOMETHING BEHIND \nFINN) Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more grateful than anyone. \nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY \nA Resistance Technician turns to Leia: \nADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's still standing. \nOFFICER X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 6 - DAY \nRey climbs up to the corridor, vigilant. She hears a SOUND, SWOOPS her rifle at -- Finn, Han and Chewie! She cannot believe it! All Finn wants to do is hug her -- and she him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAN Are you all right? \nREY Yeah. \nHAN Good. \nFINN What happened -- did he hurt you? \nREY Finn. What are you doing here?! \nFINN We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. \nFINN (CONT'D) What'd he say? \nREY (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace. \nREY (CONT'D) Thank you. \nOnce they're gone, he plants another charge. \nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS \nThe Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY \nGONE. \nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT \nHan finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide, vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole demeanor changes -- HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall, \nHAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE THAT BISECTS the open space. Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK- CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding. This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly: \nHAN Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns. \nKYLO REN Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAN Take off that mask. You don't need it. \nKYLO REN What do you think you'll see if I do? Han moves toward Kylo Ren. \nHAN The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. \nKYLO REN Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. \nHAN That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch. \nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS \nKylo flares. \nKYLO REN No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern: \nHAN Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it. \nKYLO REN It's too late. \nHAN No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes... \nKYLO REN I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. \nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS \nHan takes one step toward his son, but stops himself. \nKYLO REN I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. \nHAN Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch \nVANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH \nDARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS \nOUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK! \nKYLO REN Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM -- \nFINN \n(PANTING) Solo. \nREY \n(ALSO PANTING) No, no. Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF \nTHE STRUCTURE! \nINT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY \nLeia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, \nDEVASTATED. \nINT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT \nKylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when -- CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED, \nLT. BASTIAN I'm coming in! \nJESS Watch out! \nELLO ASTY I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces. \nPOE All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me! \nNIV LEK Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS \nOutside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH \nTHE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN: \nSTARKILLER TECHNICIAN Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. \nGENERAL HUX Prepare to fire. \nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT \nPoe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after volley of torpedoes. \nEXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT \nThe remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place -- and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground \nEXPLOSIONS! \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nAmid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD. She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK -- MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest. Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A \nMASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF! \nKYLO REN You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! \nREY The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES \nAGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND \nCHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber. And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE! But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who watches this out the control room window in horror. He hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes: \nCOLONEL DATOO Lieutenant, get back to your station! \nYOUNG TECHNICIAN (stops, fleetingly) Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR: \nGENERAL HUX (V.O.) Supreme Leader. \nINT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT \nHux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together but is horrified, heartsick: \nGENERAL HUX The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing. \nSNOKE Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. \n(GRIM) It is time to complete his training. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nRey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to: FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over, sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound. \nREY Finn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see: \nLIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights \nILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE! CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them! \nEXT. FALCON - NIGHT \nChewie exits the ship. MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries with them back into the ship -- \nINT.

He leans forward. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nUNKAR What about the droid? \nREY What about him? \nUNKAR I'll pay for him. BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious. \nUNKAR (CONT'D) Sixty portions. CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all. Finally, she hears herself say: \nREY Actually... the droid's not for sale. \n(TO BB-8) Come on. Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar watches her go with dark eyes.

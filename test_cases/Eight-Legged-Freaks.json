MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY \nVintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines. \nGLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner. Ignoring the signs behind her head: \"NO SMOKING!\", \"DANGER GAS!\" \nAs Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a drawer. \nGLADYS Did you pop him one? \nCHRIS He had it comin'. But Sam Palmer... That woman abuses her power. \nGLADYS Why? Because she stopped you from givin' Wade another pop? \nCHRIS I'm not proud of it. \nChris goes to a table and a map of the mines that honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked \"explored.\" Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys. Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open and puts out the flame. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHRIS I thought you were trying the patch. \nGLADYS I am. \nShe raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.

What else is new? (lays bills on table) You need to pay these by the end of the month. \nCHRIS (looks at bills) Today... For a split second... I actually thought I had it. \nGLADYS Another vein of iron pyrite? \nCHRIS Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch. I practically blew myself up trying to get it back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGLADYS I'm glad you like my bologna sandwiches. (beat) Maybe you should talk to Wade. \nCHRIS What are you saying? \nGLADYS Honey, if he really does have a buyer... \nCHRIS You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother lode. \nGLADYS Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I don't think he cared    how that happened. If he was     still alive, maybe he'd sell those    mines. \n", "test1_true": "CHRIS And maybe you didn't know him so well after all. \nA tense beat. \nGLADYS You're right... I'm just worried about how we're going to pay these bills. \nCHRIS Don't give up on me, Gladys. I promised him I'd find the gold.

Me love you long time. \nJoshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its perch. \nJOSHUA Be quiet, bird! \nCharlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around the back of the tank. \nCHARLIE Charlie's in the wire!     Incoming! \nSomething yanks the parrot O.S. \nJOSHUA Stop screwing around...! \nJoshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of the tank. \nJOSHUA Where'd you go? Consuela? \nShe's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet. Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing. His body desiccated. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOSHUA Charlie... Semper fidelis. \nJoshua sees Charlie is attached to a web. He tugs on the webline. Something tugs back. Joshua leans down to look under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees.

Some mice... \nCHRIS How about stampeding rats? \nSAM Were they running away from something? \nCHRIS Could have been. Never saw them do that before.

He stomps around, crushing as many as he can. Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the squashed bodies. \nMIKE I think you should stop. \nNORMAN Why? \nMIKE They don't have hair. They aren't fully grown tarantulas. \nChris and Sam look over. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIKE They're giant babies! \nNorman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL. \nChris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming... \nThe FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair. Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes. \nMike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis. \nMIKE Consuela. \nCHRIS Consuela? \nThe fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is something weird there. A lot of weird things. In fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas. \nAs Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt. \nNORMAN Bummer... \nConsuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper, chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas. \nCHRIS Go! \nThe group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away bits of gold. \nCHRIS Leave it! \nWADE So you can keep it all!?   Hell no! \nWade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms behind him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRET Dad! \nBret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for him.

There should be a generator at the exit. Start it up and await for my signal to throw the switch. \nSAM And the toxic waste... \nCHRIS Will be buried under tons of rock! Go! \nSAM What about you? \nCHRIS I need to set the fuse as close to the spiders as I can. That should give us time to get clear. \nSam and Chris share a brief beat.

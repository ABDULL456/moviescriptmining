{"train": "ARAC ATTACK (Eight Legged Freaks) \nby \nJesse Alexander & Ellory Elkayem \nJuly 2000 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nARAC ATTACK! \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DESERT - NIGHT \nA rabbit hops across rough terrain. \nEXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT \nThree trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP \nINT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT \nA sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck. \nSELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.) I will be self-assured and confident around women. \nPIG PEN I will be self-assured and confident around women. \nEXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT \nThe rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses the highway in front of the third. \nINT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT \nSELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.) I will not fear the unexpected. \nPIG PEN I will not fear the unexpected. \nThe rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights. \nPIG PEN Ahhhhhhhhhh! \nPig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the bunny. \nEXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT \nThe truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker. \nINT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT \nPig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the rig together. \nEXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT \nThe rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the water below. \nEXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT \nA biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon ink. \nEXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY \nThe ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly. \nJOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people. \nJOSHUA Hey, Mike.   Check this one out. \nMIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard and fast for this bright, little nerd. \nMIKE He's huge! \nJOSHUA They've been like this all week. Must be something extra tasty in the water. \nMIKE Like what? \nJOSHUA Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce. Mighty satisfying. \nJOSHUA She fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs. Now watch... She'll drink her victim from the inside out. While it's still alive! \nMIKE (looks queasy) And you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you. \nJOSHUA Arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years. And they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried. \nSuddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils. \nMIKE Bad!   Bad Consuela! \nConsuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated. \nTARANTULA POV - MIKE \nThe multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger. \nBACK TO MIKE \nMike stares into the many eyes of Consuela. \nMIKE Do that again and I feed you to the parrot. \nCHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN. \nJOSHUA There's your mom. \nMIKE See you tomorrow, Joshua! \nMike heads for the door. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nThe entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside. A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY, PROSPERITY, NV. \nINT. MINE SHAFT - DAY \nRotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of the tunnel. \nCHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles. \nChris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light. \nSomething sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him. \nChris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile fades... \nCHRIS Damn. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nChris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's sack lunch. \nChris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas. \nA BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch. \nCHRIS Hope you like bologna! \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nA police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the trunk. \nINT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY \nSAMANTHA \"SAM\" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside her. \nMIKE You   should see them, Mom. Each one   has a unique feeding behavior. The   spitters fire poisonous snot. The   tarantulas mummify their prey. The   jumpers can... \nSAM Why does he have all those things? \nMIKE He studies them. NASA uses spider webs in outer space. And for medicine. They've been here forever, and they'll be here long after we're all dead. \nSAM You're givin' me nightmares. \nMIKE Nightmares are cool. \n(CONTINUED) \nASHLEY Can't you give 'em a break? \nSAM Get in the car, Ashley.       Now. \nASHLEY But, Mom! \nSam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance. \nBRET No sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up later. \nSAM (threatening) Over my dead body. \nINT. SAM'S COP CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY \nMike grins from the front seat as Ashley climbs in back. \nMIKE You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used... \nASHLEY Shut up, dork. \nEXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY - DAY \nSam hands Bret the ticket. \nBRET Larry, do we know anybody at City Hall who can mark this go away? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLARRY Your Dad is the Mayor. \nBRET Oh, yeah. (to Sam) He signs your paycheck. \nSAM The next time you put my daughter's life in danger, I'll show you exactly how little that means to me. \nBret and Larry feel her resolve. \nBRET Relax, bee-otch. It's all good. \nThe punks remount their bikes. \nSAM I want both wheels on the ground. \nThe punks REV their BIKES and defiantly wheelie toward town. \nINT. POLICE CAR - DAY \nSam climbs behind the wheel. \nMIKE I read her her rights. \nSAM I can always count on you, Mike. \nSam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town. \nASHLEY Do you get off on humiliating me? \nSAM This bad girl act doesn't suit you, Ash. \nASHLEY I'm just trying to have fun. Don't you remember what it's like to grow up here? \nSAM That's what scares me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley. \nSAM I told you to keep this with you. \nAshley slides the zapper into her backpack. \nASHLEY You are so over protective. \nMike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response. \nSAM A mother's job is to protect her children. \nINT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY \nAn attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF. Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g. \nWADE (V.O.) It puts food on the table. Haven't the people of this town lived hand-to-mouth for long enough? \nINT. BARBERSHOP (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY \nFLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO. \nWADE (V.O.) We're all gonna die in this hell hole. \nFLOYD Yeah, of boredom. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nDEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading Playstation magazine. He listens to the RADIO. \nWADE (V.O.) Wouldn't it be nice not to worry about surviving retirement? Or taking a shot at that life-long dream? \nINT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY \nWADE Think about it, Harlan, you could buy a commercial transmitter and start broadcasting to a national audience. \nHARLAN It would be nice to get the message out. Let people know the aliens walk among us. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY \nChris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son Mining Company. This stately edifice was once the driving force behind the local economy. \nWADE (V.O.) If Chris McCormick refuses to sell his mines. The rest of us are out of luck. \nChris frowns. \nINT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY \nWADE (V.O.) I don't think it's fair for one person to wield that much power. But he's just like his father. Selfish. Greedy. And more than a little bit nuts. \nSAM Uh-oh. \nSam flips on the SIREN and accelerates. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThe locals stop eating and look toward the radio. \nWADE (V.O.) That family has been digging in those tunnels since the twenties. If there was something down there, don't you think they would have found it by now? \nINT. BARBERSHOP - DAY \nFloyd and Leroy stare at the radio. \nWADE (V.O.) Common sense does not apply to crazy people. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY \nWADE (V.O.) Might as well be chasing a leprechaun's pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nChris is furious as he PEELS OUT and speeds toward Harlan's. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThe locals watch Chris's pickup speed by. \nWADE (V.O.) ... lunatics... \nINT. BARBERSHOP - DAY \nFloyd and Leroy watch Chris speed by. \nWADE (V.O.) ... certifiably nuts... \nINT. POLICE CAR - (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY \nAs Sam pulls into town. She sees Chris skid to a stop in front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup. \nASHLEY Maybe you're not gay after all. \nSAM What are you talking about? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nASHLEY You can't take your eyes off his butt. \nSAM Where did you learn that it's okay to talk to me like this? \nASHLEY Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old guy. I can admit it. Why can't you? \nSam watches Chris get into his truck. He gives her one last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her daughter. \nINT. MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY \nVintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines. \nGLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner. Ignoring the signs behind her head: \"NO SMOKING!\", \"DANGER GAS!\" \nAs Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a drawer. \nGLADYS Did you pop him one? \nCHRIS He had it comin'. But Sam Palmer... That woman abuses her power. \nGLADYS Why? Because she stopped you from givin' Wade another pop? \nCHRIS I'm not proud of it. \nChris goes to a table and a map of the mines that honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked \"explored.\" Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys. Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open and puts out the flame. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHRIS I thought you were trying the patch. \nGLADYS I am. \nShe raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches. Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum. \nINT. MUSEUM - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nChris enters the family living quarters. The furniture was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen. \nINT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY \nChris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner permanently on \"light.\" \nChris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS. \nChris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer. Gladys enters with a stack of bills. \nCHRIS That burner's on the fritz again. \nGLADYS Oh something's broken? What else is new? (lays bills on table) You need to pay these by the end of the month. \nCHRIS (looks at bills) Today... For a split second... I actually thought I had it. \nGLADYS Another vein of iron pyrite? \nCHRIS Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch. I practically blew myself up trying to get it back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGLADYS I'm glad you like my bologna sandwiches. (beat) Maybe you should talk to Wade. \nCHRIS What are you saying? \nGLADYS Honey, if he really does have a buyer... \nCHRIS You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother lode. \nGLADYS Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I don't think he cared    how that happened. If he was     still alive, maybe he'd sell those    mines. \nASHLEY (O.S.) Ladies first. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIKE What's your excuse!? \nSam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall. \nSAM You still want a ride, Mike? \nMIKE I'm just going to the mall. \nSAM Have fun. \nMike heads down the hallway and out of the house. \nINT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY \nAshley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs in. \nINT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY \nAshley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the soap. \nAshley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once more. The spider returns across its web right in front of her eyes. \nThe water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the spider scurries onto its opposite side. \nAshley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth. \nThe cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it was there. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAshley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again. The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in horror. \nSam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little spiders. \nSAM Now what? \nAshley just screams. \nINT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAY \nThe SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur. \nA cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching something intently. The cat charges into the wall after unseen prey. \nEMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop. He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS CUTTING. \nEMMA Why do you need to do that as six in the morning!? Do you hate me that much!? \nHANK I want to finish before I go to work. \nEMMA You've been saying that for six months! \nHANK I can't finish if you keep interrupting! \nHanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen. \nINT. REMODELED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nEmma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco, lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat food. \nINT. REMODELED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nEmma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW. \nHANK If you're gonna keep pulling the plug... \nEMMA Have you seen Zeke this morning? \nHANK He was chasing something earlier. \nEMMA If he got into the wall again, it's your balls in the blender. \nThe Clerk grabs the PA's microphone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCLERK (over PA speakers) All bug spray, rodent traps, ant poison and fly paper is on aisle five! \nHe returns his attention to Mike. \nCLERK That'll be three fifty-two. \nMike pays the man. \nMIKE Where's aisle five? \nThe annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off. \nEXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY \nBeverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid object is coughed up through the hose. \nBeverly continues watering. Two more unidentified objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then inexplicably stops. \nBeverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage. \nBeverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another. And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and into her mouth. \nBeverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared. \nBeverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream... but can only retch. \nEXT. STREET (TOWN) - DAY \nMike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike it thoroughly grossed out. \nEXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY \nMike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads inside. \nINT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY \nMike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows. Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos. \nMIKE Hello?   Joshua? Charlie? \nThe spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts recording. \nMIKE (into PDA) Captain's log. Stardate... \nStops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE. \nMIKE Cool! (records again) The house is deserted. No sign of Joshua Taft or his bird. The spider tanks are shattered. There is broken glass everywhere. \nMike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings open and shut in the WIND. \nEXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - BACK YARD - DAY \nMike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of wooden barricades labeled: \"McCORMICK AND SONS MINING COMPANY.\" Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind the barriers. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIKE (into PDA) Animal tracks. Definitely too big to be spiders. Could be rats. \nMike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too dark. \nMike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never realizing... \nSeveral feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing. Grisly. \nSuddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper into the shaft by some unseen creature. \nEXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY \nChris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - DAY \nWADE Came out to feed my birds this morning. \nSAM Coyotes? \nWADE Hell no! \nThe trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches are there to greet them. \nWADE My flock had fifty birds! Where'd they go, dammit! Who the hell steals fifty birds that can't even fly!? \nSAM All this happened last night? \nWADE I guess.   And we didn't hear a thing. \nSam gestures toward the BARKING DOG. \nSAM What about him? \nWADE Not a peep. \nMike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.     He heads over for a closer look. \nThe DOG watches his progress.    BARKING excitedly. \nSam talks to Wade. \nSAM How's the ostrich business? \nWADE Not so good lately. \nSAM You've got that new Hummer. You must be makin' enough to pay for it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWADE (annoyed) You like it? I'll take you for a ride. \nSAM These birds are insured.   Right? \nWADE I didn't kill my birds, Sam.      Is that what you think? \nMike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade. \nWADE (in the distance) ... reject... absolutely not... \nMike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are larger: \nMIKE (into PDA) I've found more tracks.    Even larger now. \nMike follows the trail toward another mine entrance. This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby. \nMike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right. An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts. A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is able to lift it. \nMike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide. \nINT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY \nTwenty feet down the shaft.     A shape moves. \nTRAPDOOR SPIDER POV - MIKE \nA MULTI-EYED SPIDER'S VIEW of Mike at the top of the burrow. \nEXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY \nMike squints into the burrow but can't see anything. \nINT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY \nA dark shape inches up the burrow toward Mike. \nEXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY \nMike is oblivious as he peers into the dark. \nEXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nThe BARKING CATTLE DOG SNAPS its TETHER and charges Mike. Sam and Wade see this and run after it. \nBret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK. Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop. \nASHLEY Woo-hoo! \nBret offers his stogie.    Ashley refuses.     Bret puffs away. \nASHLEY Haven't you had enough of that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRET No such thing.     Norman's bud is da'kine. \nHe coughs and they both laugh. \nBRET When I medal at the X-Games, Honda will give me full sponsorship. Then I'll take you with me on the Supercross tour. \nAshley is silent. \nBRET Are you still thinking about going away? \nASHLEY I don't know. I want to do something with my life, Bret. Help people. Maybe med school is still an option. \nBRET Not if you keep hanging out with me. \nASHLEY Thanks, Mom. \nThey kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of \"get down.\" Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand. \nASHLEY Slow down... \nBret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him. \nBRET I thought you loved me. \nASHLEY I do! \nBRET Then what's the problem? You want to leave town. You don't want to make out. \nASHLEY I don't feel... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRET What? \nASHLEY I don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a monster truck. \nBRET Why didn't you say so? We can go outside. I've got a blanket in the back. \nASHLEY No... I guess... I'm just not ready. \nBRET Tammy and Larry do it every night! \nASHLEY Then call them! Have a menage a trois! \nBRET Come on,   Ashley. Mommy's not around.    You don't have to play the good   girl. Let Daddy give you what you   really want. \nBret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it. \nASHLEY Please, Bret... Please don't... \nBut Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the trigger. \nBret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the driver's side door. \nEXT. BEHIND TRUCK STOP - DAY \nBret twitches on the ground. \nBRET My balls? Ahh! My balls! (looks down) I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAshley watches from the truck. \nThe black and white classic: Tarantula, plays over an old TV and VCR. Mike is at his computer, downloading a spider encyclopedia into his PDA. A message flashes across the screen: CONNECTION LOST. Mike picks up the telephone. \nMIKE Hello?   Hello? \nThe line is dead. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nBret rides into a dead-end canyon with the spiders very close behind. Bret steers for the mouth of a hillside mine shaft. \nINT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY \nBret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far before crashing. \nBret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face. He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack. Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing him in the mine. \nEXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY \nSeveral locals put up more signs for missing pets. \nINT. DINER/EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY \nHarlan is kibitzing with Travis. Pete and Emma console each other over dessert. Wade sits alone at a table for two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a fresh beer. \nWAITRESS The phones went down for some reason. Maybe that's why Bret didn't call. Did you want to go ahead and order? \nWADE Just give me the usual. \nWAITRESS One ostrich steak, comin' up. \nWade reacts glumly to the word \"ostrich.\" \nINT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY \nGladys smokes as she puts together the fixings for a large meal. She has a cookbook out. Pots and pans. Chris enters. Gladys quickly drops her cigarette in the disposal. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGLADYS What are you doing home? \nCHRIS Need some rat traps. \nGLADYS Try the basement. \nCHRIS What is all this? \nGLADYS I wanted to surprise you with a special dinner. Turkey De La Gladys. \nCHRIS I'll have mine without Nicotine. \nGLADYS Not as good that way. \nChris goes through a nearby door to the basement. \nINT. MUSEUM - BASEMENT - DAY \nChris comes downstairs. He rummages through some junk. comes up with several rat traps. He turns around to discover an odd hole in the wall. He ventures over for a look. \nCHRIS Rats... \nChris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his entry. \nChris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the spider. \nChris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in the hole. He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind him. \nChris backs out of the hole. He picks up his jacket. The spider is gone. He grabs his traps and heads upstairs. \nINT. MUSEUM - DAY \nChris passes through the kitchen.    He eyes Gladys warily. \nCHRIS Have you been smoking? \nGLADYS No. \nSmoke pours out of her nostrils. \nSAM (taken aback) Are you asking me out on a date? \nCHRIS Only if you're going to say yes. \nSam smiles slightly. \nINT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY \nThe basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip. \nA male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters. Hair all over. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider is about to strike, she goes another direction to get spices, utensils, a pan. \nGladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her. Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner knobs, turning on the gas. \nGladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her. \nGladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the webline prevents her from slotting it home. \nGladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The tarantula is engulfed in    flame. \nGladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the floor toward the basement door. \nThe fire grows more intense, spreading quickly. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nCHRIS So that's a 'No.' \nSAM My kids are the world to me, Chris. When their dad left... it really took a toll. On all of us. I can't go through that again. I won't. \nCHRIS No... I understand... I don't know what I was thinking... (laughs) Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm gonna kill her. \nDeputy Pete throws open the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETE The museum's on fire! \nOFF Chris's look. \nEXT. BURNING MUSEUM - DAY \nThe museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks the conflagration. All the locals are there to help. \nSam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to the ground. \nCHRIS No!   Let me go! Gladys!   Let me go! \nThe museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the ground. \nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER) \nThe fire is out. The once-proud building is now a smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups. \nChris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines. Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy. Sam steps up. \nSAM Maybe she got out. \nSam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. \nCHRIS (devastated) She was cooking. The stove was broken. \nSAM Why don't you come home with me? We'll get you cleaned up. \nChris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMike stands off to the side. He spots something near the edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big. Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away. \nChris looks up at Sam. \nCHRIS They keep their food alive. \nMike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton. \nSAM What is this? \nMIKE A spider's leg! \nSam flinches, dropping the object to the floor. \nMIKE Careful! \nSAM No. That's a piece of cactus. Look... It's covered with spines. \nMIKE Those are quills! Tarantulas can flick them at you like darts! \nMike does an odd flicking motion.       Kind of like a dog scratching a flea. \nSAM Giant tarantulas? \nMIKE Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors! Joshua had a ton of exotics! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHRIS If there were giant spiders roaming the desert, don't you think somebody would've seen them by now? \nMIKE The jumpers hunt in daylight. But not the others. They only come out when the sun goes down! \nThe group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the sky. \nEXT. TOWN - DUSK \nProsperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent promise. \nINT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY \nThe garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes. Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's clothes. \nSAM I guess I should watch more 'Oprah.' It must be a textbook 'no-dad' kind of thing. \nChris shifts awkwardly.     In shock.   Sad.   Sam holds up a flannel shirt. \nCHRIS That one looks kind of scratchy. \nSam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt. \nSAM All Jason cared about was getting out and starting over. I guess that included buying a new wardrobe. \nSam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't register Sam ogling his exposed chest. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHRIS Gladys thought I should sell... but you know... I never wanted to get rich. If it was about the money, I would have sold out to Wade a long time ago. \nChris moves behind the car and takes off his pants. \nCHRIS I think I just wanted to prove the gold was down there. That my family wasn't crazy to keep looking. Even after we'd lost so much. And now... she's gone, too. \nSAM I'm sorry, Chris. \nCHRIS Do you know what I'm trying to say? \nSAM It wasn't about spending the gold, it was about finding it. \nCHRIS That's right.    That's exactly right. \nSam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door. \nCHRIS Remind me never to let you do my laundry. \nShe turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out from behind the car. Sam stares at him. \nSAM They look great. \nChris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab for his scissors. He gets them. \nMIKE Get under it! Stab it in the abdomen! They don't have any armor down there! \nCHRIS How am I supposed to do that!? \nThe spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair. Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts. \nCHRIS I'm gonna need some new pants. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSAM Ever used one of these? \nCHRIS I'm a fast learner. \nChris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his waistband. But these damn pants are too tight. \nAshley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair. \nMIKE I told you! I told you all!     But nobody ever listens to Mike! Still think I'm crazy, Mom? \nSAM I'm sorry I didn't believe you. \nAshley is about to hyperventilate. \nSAM Calm down, baby. \nASHLEY There aren't enough wine coolers in the world to calm me down! \nSAM I won't let anything happen to you. \nSam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun. \nCHRIS What other spiders did Joshua have? \nMIKE Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers, tarantulas... \nCHRIS Why couldn't he keep goldfish like a normal person? \nSam checks the phone.     It's dead. \nSAM We need to warn people. \nCHRIS How about the radio station? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSAM Good one.    We'll go to Harlan's. \nASHLEY Outside?    You want to go outside? \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT \nChris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam looks one way. Chris the other. \nNo giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a SUMMER NIGHT. \nSAM It's okay... \nMike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the adults. They move toward the cop car. \nEXT. STREETS (TOWN) - NIGHT \nThe cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows. Everything appears normal. Although no people are visible. \nEXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nSam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to the door. They are at the far end of town. All appears to be normal. \nINT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nThey see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume grenades at the spider, covering their retreat. \nAnother spider comes after them through one of the tubes. Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers. \nMIKE We've gotta go! \nAshley finds a hole that leads to the slide. \nASHLEY Here! \nShe starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the arachnid clear. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nAshley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam finish off the spider and then run with the kids. \nEmma runs parallel to them across the playground's sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider. \nHank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand. \nHANK It's tool time! \nFloyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the floor. \nChris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He stops for a moment to look at the jeans. \nSAM (O.S.) Chris! \nChris continues on. \nAll of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all directions. \nMike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT. Others use their make-shift weapons. \nNorman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this and gets an idea. \nMIKE Where do you grow your weed?! \nNORMAN Dude, if I tell you, I have to kill you. \nNorman takes a hit on his reefer. \nMIKE They're going to kill us, you stoner! \nNorman sees the army of spiders closing in. \nNORMAN Over here! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNorman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors run over and    crowd through it. Norman shuts the door behind them.     The groups of pursuing spiders collide and begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy. \nINT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT \nNorman leads the survivors down the tight hallway. \nWADE Where are you taking us? \nNORMAN To Shangri-la. \nINT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT \nNorman leads the survivors into a basement room full of pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters. \nNORMAN You aren't going to arrest me for this are you? \nSAM Not today. \nThe group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door. \nWADE (to Norman) Oh great! Now you've trapped us! \nChris moves to the bottom of the stairs. \nCHRIS We should be able to hold them off for a little while. \nSuddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them. \nINT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT \nA boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file into a slightly more open area with two branching tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with barrels of toxic waste. \nCHRIS I don't believe it... \nMike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the barrel in the drainage ditch. \nMIKE I've seen one of these before! \nASHLEY What are they? \nCHRIS Toxic waste. \nSAM Where did you see it, Mike? \nMIKE The creek where Joshua gets his spider food. There was one in the water. \nChris starts toward the sloping tunnel. \nCHRIS We can get out this way! \nBRET No, we can't. (turns to Wade) Isn't that tunnel blocked off, Dad? \nChris and the others look at Wade. \nWADE Uh... yeah... he's right.   We can't get out that way. \nCHRIS You did this? \nWADE I knew you'd never sell... We're under my property so... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSAM You put all of us at risk. \nWADE I didn't have a choice! I was broke! They gave me a hundred grand! \nSam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground. \nSAM I think our lives are worth a little more than that. \nCHRIS We're wasting time. \nChris heads toward the only exit available. The others follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after them. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT \nChris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs runs along the roof into both tunnels. \nCHRIS One end of these lights should be connected to a generator. That'll be near the entrance. \nThey continue down the tunnel.     Entering... \nINT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT \nA large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground. Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches. \nWADE My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't lying! That's what I can put on the insurance form... giant spiders! \nASHLEY Ewww... what's that smell? \nThe others are reacting strongly. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHRIS Methane.   This cavern is full of gas. \nASHLEY What does that mean? \nCHRIS One spark and we're all dead. \nNorman swallows his glowing joint. \nChris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles. \nGLADYS Have you got a smoke, kid? \nNORMAN The man says this cavern is full of highly flammable methane gas. I smoke to get high, not to die. \nSAM Spiders! \nThe group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas scuttling out of the shadows. \nNORMAN What's the big deal? \nNorman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can. Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the squashed bodies. \nMIKE I think you should stop. \nNORMAN Why? \nMIKE They don't have hair. They aren't fully grown tarantulas. \nChris and Sam look over. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIKE They're giant babies! \nNorman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL. \nChris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming... \nThe FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair. Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes. \nMike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis. \nMIKE Consuela. \nCHRIS Consuela? \nThe fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is something weird there. A lot of weird things. In fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas. \nAs Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt. \nNORMAN Bummer... \nConsuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper, chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas. \nCHRIS Go! \nThe group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away bits of gold. \nCHRIS Leave it! \nWADE So you can keep it all!?   Hell no! \nWade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms behind him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRET Dad! \nBret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings Wade into the cave. \nCHRIS Bret, come on! \nBret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion. \nASHLEY Bret! \nAshley goes to his side. \nBRET I'm sorry I... \nBret dies.     Sam drags Ashley away from him. \nINT. MINES - NIGHT \nThe survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling. \nSam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction. \nASHLEY Oh shit. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears. \nSAM Banzai! \nWith perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel. \nEXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN \nMike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It won't catch. \nMIKE It needs gas! \nGLADYS There's a ranch! \nGladys heads over toward Wade's ranch. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN \nChris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him, Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs. \nEXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN \nMike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the motorcycle. \nMIKE It needs gas! \nSam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of the tank. It's clear this is not going to work. \nASHLEY Hurry! \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN \nChris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close behind. \nCHRIS Start the generator! \nEXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN \nMIKE He's coming! \nASHLEY Hurry, Mom! \nSam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries to start it. It won't turn over. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN \nChris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps going. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN \nSam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate. \nCHRIS Throw the switch! \nSAM I don't have any power! \nASHLEY Yo, Mom! \nSam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING it. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN \nAs Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially, traveling past him into the cavern. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN \nA broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout the mines. \nINT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN \nA huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like popcorn. \n", "test1_input": "MIKE Wait, Mom! The noise will attract more of them! \nCHRIS Let's try for the mall. \nSam leads the others toward town. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nChris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten by spiders. \nCHRIS My truck's at the museum. \nSAM Your keys? \nCHRIS In my other pants. \nMIKE Look out! \nThe group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly a familiar mini-van races past. \nHARLAN Stop!    Take us with you! \nHarlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees... \nThe van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper. The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to pieces. The van crashes. \nEXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT \nA group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE. Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids' feeding frenzy. \nEXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT \nA dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at him. \nWADE No!     Please! \nThe spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade climbs out of the dumpster. \nWADE Thank you! \nChris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade. \nMIKE You stink. \nWADE (to Ashley) Have you seen Bret? \nASHLEY He was out at the dunes. \nSAM Go ahead.    I've got your butt. \nCHRIS What? \nSAM Your back!    I've got your back! \nChris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right... \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nSam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other locals. \nEXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT \nSam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their kids. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSuddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS underground. \nMIKE Trapdoors!    They're all around us! \nSAM How can we spot them? \nMike consults his Cassiopeia. \nMIKE I didn't download that part! \nASHLEY You dork! \n", "test1_true": "TRAVIS Help... me... please... \nHe is dragged back underground. \nThe group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged under. \nMore beasts rise out of their dens.       Reaching for the humans. \nCHRIS Keep going! \nChris and the others flee toward the mall.          Some of them SHOOT at the spiders as they run. \nLeroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging him under. \nThe group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after them. \nEXT. MALL ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nChris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked. Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them desperately. \nASHLEY There's someone inside! \nThe group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously. \nNORMAN We're closed. \nSam points her gun at him.   Norman raise his hands in shock. \nNORMAN Wait! I have a prescription! It's for my glaucoma! \nSAM Open this goddamn door! \nNORMAN Yes, ma'am. \nNorman unlocks the door and lets the group in. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nThe survivors hustle inside. They lock the glass doors behind them. The spiders are still coming. \nMIKE Get away from the doors! \nNORMAN Be cool, little dude.     They're locked. \nMIKE Glass won't stop them! \nThe spiders begin smashing through the glass doors. Chris and Sam SHOOT to keep them back. People flee into the mall. \nSAM The gates!    Close the gates! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel security gates. Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on the other side. \nASHLEY Mom! \nMIKE Hurry up! \nSam and Chris see the gate coming down. They run for it and slide underneath just as the gate comes down. A massive trapdoor slams up against the metal. But the metal holds. \nSAM Shut the other entrances! \nNorman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall. \nINT. MALL - SOUTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nChris and Norman arrive. Spiders are SMASHING through the GLASS. Chris and Norman bring the gate down. They back away as more spiders slam against the steel. \nNORMAN Trick or treat. \nChris and Norman head back to join the others.   They find... \nINT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE (MALL) - NIGHT \nThe survivors gather makeshift weapons. Floyd take a chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint cans. Hank stands before a display of circular buzz saws. \nChris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms. \n", "test1_id": 498, "test2_input": "CHRIS We're sealed up at both ends. \nSam hands Chris a shotgun.    He tries to get the feel of it. \nSAM You pump the slide to jack in a fresh round. Point at your target and squeeze. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nChris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head. \nWADE Watch it! \nCHRIS Like that? \nSam shakes her head and takes the gun back.       She pulls a machete off the wall and hands it to Chris. \nSAM Try not to cut yourself. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nThe place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege. Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the entrances to watch the spiders' every move. \nINT. MALL - NORTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nWADE Why didn't we see them earlier? \nMIKE For the last time! They can't handle the sunlight. They were waiting in the mines for the sun to go down! \nCHRIS Then at daybreak they'll go back inside. We can walk out the front door. \nMIKE We won't make it that long. \nASHLEY They're gonna come in after us? \nMIKE They're growing very fast. They need food to sustain that kind of development. \nHANK Someone should go out and get help. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEMMA You go, Sam. \nSAM Me? \nWADE You're the sheriff. \nSAM I don't have that many handcuffs. \nPETE What about the police radio? \nSAM You're not goin' back out there, Pete. None of us are. \nCHRIS Radio Shack is full of cell phones. \nWADE But the signal won't get out of the valley. That's why we couldn't sell any of the damn things. \nHARLAN My antenna... \nThe group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna is visible on the skylights that run the length of the mall. \nHARLAN I could climb up to the top. I bet I could get a signal out. \nWADE Great idea.    You should do that. \nCHRIS I'll cover you, Harlan. \nINT. MALL - NIGHT \nWade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives him the shotgun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSAM Are you sure you can handle this? \n", "test2_true": "SAM I'll do my best. (a beat) Uhh... Do you want to go out sometime?  Dinner? Maybe a movie? \nChris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her lips. \nWade holds open the nearby access door. \nWADE Hey, loverboy... you've got a town to save. \nChris and Harlan head out. Sam watches them disappear through the door and then returns to the survivors. \nASHLEY You're not really going to get him bigger pants are you? \nSAM No way. \nINT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT \nWade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase. The door at the top is identified as \"Roof Access.\" Wade reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him. \nCHRIS Don't even think about locking this door. \nWADE I'll be right here waiting. \nWade slowly opens the roof door. \nEXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT \nChris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear.       No sign of any spiders. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWade closes the door behind them and locks it.       Chris and Harlan aren't happy to hear that LOCK TURN. \nThey sneak across the roof toward the base of the antenna. \nCHRIS It looks clear. \nHarlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders climbing up the side of the building toward the roof. \nINT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - MALL - NIGHT \nMike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie. \nASHLEY I didn't know you wore cologne. \nMIKE I don't.   It's spider repellent. \nSam steps in through the door. \nSAM Let's stay together, guys. \nASHLEY (holds up a teddy) Can I get this? \nSAM Move it! \nThe kids run out to join their mom.       After they go... \nThe grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor. Another spider follows. \nEXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT \nHarlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in hand. It still indicates: \"NO SERVICE.\" He keeps climbing. \nEXT.

The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere! \nMIKE Arac attack! \nChris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the bottom.

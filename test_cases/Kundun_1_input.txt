CLOSE on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance hall. 
Tenzin Gyatso's hands open the doors. 
The young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false teeth. 
Tenzin Gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat.  He tucks the lead soldier of an Indian Ghurka into the center of the scarf.  He places the bundle in the drawer. 
Then, he adds something.  A sweet.  The kind his Mother makes. 
He closes the drawer, and locks it. 
He hides the key, again, behind the small, unobtrusive cabinet. 
EXT.  RESIDENCE, STAIRS  NIGHT 
With a soldier on either side of him, the Dalai Lama descends the staircase. 
The Soldiers start to lead him away, but he pauses. 
TENZIN GYATSO Wait. 
The young man leaves them. 
EXT.  RESIDENCE  NIGHT 
He walks to the far side of this white building. 
TENZIN GYATSO I see a safe journey. 
The boy returns to the front steps. 
TENZIN GYATSO I see a safe return. 
The soldiers wait. 
TENZIN GYATSO Now.  I am ready. 
Tenzin Gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder.  A soldier lays a rifle over the other one. 
EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  NIGHT 
The three men walk quietly through the empty gardens.  We hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder. 
EXT.  WALL  NIGHT 
The soldiers pause, look to His Holiness.  Tenzin Gyatso removes his glasses, puts them in his bag, then nods - and the soldiers open the gate. 
SOLDIER Move aside, tour of inspection, move aside. 
Of course, we see only a fraction of the crowd - angry men and women. 
A man steps beside His Holiness. 
Tenzin Gyatso looks up - face to face. 
It is the Khamba bodyguard, the monk who guarded him so many times.  The man with the horrible face. 
KHAMBA BODYGUARD Move aside, let us through. Move aside! 
The Dalai Lama is between the soldiers, shouldering his own gun.  The Bodyguard falls in behind. 
The little group makes its way through the crowd. 
EXT.  TRIBUTARY OF ThE KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT 
In the same place where the little Tenzin Gyatso tentatively tested one rock, the escape party crosses on the slippery, stepping stones. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT 
The small party makes its way across a bit of countryside. 
People are camped here - Khambas, farmers, nomads.  The Dalai Lama crosses to safety - unnoticed. 
EXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT 
Coracles await. 
The Dalai Lama climbs in, the Lord Chmaberlian sits beside him.  The soldiers push off. The Khamba Bodyguard stands on the bank, alone. 
Every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead. 
Tenzin Gyatso looks back.  He puts on his glasses. 
He sees camp fires and the glow of torches.  He hears echoed voices. 
He looks up.  He sees the stars and the moon and that incomparable Tibetan sky.

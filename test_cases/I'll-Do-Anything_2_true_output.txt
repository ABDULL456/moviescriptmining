DIRECTOR Except you, Matt. 
They all look at him. 
HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY (fiercely to Matt) You filthy bastard. 
BETH (drawing closer to Matt) What did he say? 
The Director hunts for the paragraph. 
MATT Don't read it. 
OTHER ACTOR Oh, please. You can't wait to run out of here, buy a flashlight, and then go into some dark alley and drool over every word. 
MATT (truthfully) You're wrong. I'm maybe relieved and curious. That's it. 
BETH (wildly exasperated) What did they say about him? 
DIRECTOR (reading) ...'in the midst of this delirium of pretension...' 
MATT Don't. This divisive crap won't... 
DIRECTOR (again) '...one actor, rather miraculously, manages to provide passion and, yes, truth. Matt Hobbs, in the supporting role of Jesus, manages to touch the heart long after you thought it numbed by boredom.' 
The table of actors look at a sober Matt. A long beat and then, against his will, he grins... then a short, involuntary barking laugh of joy... then: 
MATT (to his colleagues with sincerity) Sorry. 
MORPH TO: 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - L.A. MODERATE INCOME STREET 
As we HEAR the next lines of "WOW", BEGIN MAIN TITLES as the CAMERA BOOMS UP to the outside of a small apartment as a legend appears on screen: 
'EMMY NIGHT - 1980' 
Beth, now 27, is standing in front of a TV set showing the Emmy dancers performing a phrase of "WOW". She screams out. 
BETH Will you get in here--for God's sake? 
INT. ANOTHER ROOM 
Matt, 30, is on the phone. 
MATT (into phone) Come on, Ma, how could I show up tonight when my union is boycotting the Emmys? Look, I have to hang up. 
BETH (O. S.) (screaming voice) It's on right now... right now... right this second! You will miss it!! 
MATT (into phone) I gotta go. Watch! 
Matt hangs up and tear-asses into the living room. Beth screams as his name is read. 
TV VOICE (on TV) ...and Matt Hobbs for 'Caine Mutiny Court Martial'... And the winner is Powers Boothe for 'Jonestown--Story of a Massacre.' 
BETH Shit! Fuck! Shit! 
MATT He was good. 
BETH (again) Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Look, he even showed up. 
TV INSERT - POWERS BOOTHE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH 
MATT That took courage. I wonder if they send you something for just being nominated? 
BETH Of all the pathetic questions. 
MATT (sharply) Why are you being so damn foul? 
Beth glares at him, on the verge of taking him on--but he is looking at her very directly... the lack of any other agenda giving him a temporary edge... Beth decides to state the unadorned truth. 
BETH We've been going back and forth on our status for so long. I was hoping that if you won, it might mean something for us. 
MATT Look, Beth... the only... 
She is waving her hand in a circle... he is puzzled. 
BETH Please go fast. I can't take you dragging it out. 
MATT (a bit faster) The only reason I haven't... 
BETH I promised myself I wouldn't be so bossy. Take your time!! Was that bossy too? 
MATT (persisting) The only thing I have against getting married is that it might not be fair because I'm going to stay with acting forever and you know how erratic the money's been and there's no resolve...

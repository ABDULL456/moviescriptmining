The American's don't move... 
Then, the BRITISH LINE STOPS... 
At a flurry of commands, the Redcoats ready their muskets, then aim... 
Still, Marion and the Americans don't move... 
DEAD SILENCE... 
Then, a single, thin voice calls out from the British lines... 
IN A THUNDEROUS, MASSIVE VOLLEY, three thousand British muskets fire simultaneously... just as the entire line of AMERICAN MILITIAMEN DIVE TO THE GROUND... 
Many Americans are saved by the move but many, many others are torn apart by the British musketballs... 
THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IS INCREDIBLE... it obscures everything.  Each musket spits out a billow of think white smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of them just fired.  The massive, opaque white cloud quickly spreads over the entire battlefield. 
The astonished Redcoats instantly reload... 
And watch as the Americans rise in DISORDERLY PANIC and FLEE... 
Some Redcoats laugh... 
ON A RISE BEHIND THE BATTLEFIELD, CORNWALLIS, watches through his spyglass, trying to get a sense of what's happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke obscures everything. 
He barks to his SIGNALMAN... 
CORNWALLIS Fix bayonets... dispatch the Green Dragoons. 
The Signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the message. 
MARION AND HIS MEN are caught in the middle of the chaotic retreat... 
THE BRITISH LINE advances at a quickstep, bayonets fixed... 
From behind them, THE GREEN DRAGOONS appear, at a full gallop, Tarleton at their head... 
THE BATTLEFIELD 
It's an astonishing sight... total madness... hell... a painting by Hieronymous Bosch... 
The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing Patriot militiamen... 
The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs... 
TARLETON AND THE BRITISH CAVALRY THUNDERS to the head of the Redcoats, closing in on the fleeing Patriots.  The cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter... 
THEN SUDDENLY 
Stepping into view from behind a low, grass covered rise, a SOLID LINE OF BLUE APPEARS, rock solid... 
It open up, allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through it like water... 
then it closes again, becoming a solid blue wall... 
MARION, HIS MEN AND THE ENTIRE MASS OF FLEEING MILITIA STOPS DEAD, turns and joins the blue American line... 
A flurry of orders, then the BLUE WALL ERUPTS WITH A VOLLEY of musket fire that stops the disorderly British advance in its tracks... 
Hundreds of Redcoats fall instantly... 
Hundreds of Green Dragoons and their horses fall with them... 
The effect of the volley is devastating...' 
The American timing is perfect... 
Again, the amount of SMOKE is astonishing... visibility drops to less than twenty feet in most places... 
Drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and there but it is primarily a battle of sound... 
Men simply follow the men in front of them... 
The Blue Continentals advance in an orderly manner from both flanks onto the Redcoats, trapping them... 
The Redcoats try to flee... 
Fighting small, gathered holding actions... 
MARION FIRES one of his pistols... 
Draws his sword... 
Slashes downward... killing one Redcoat after another... 
No remorse, no hesitation, no pity... 
A relentless, simple battle... 
Slashing through the Redcoat infantry... 
His sword sinks into the stock of an upraised British musket and is pulled from his hands... 
Marion quickly kills the Redcoat with his pistol... 
THEN, THROUGH THE SMOKE, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF TARLETON... 
Marion freezes... his eyes locked on Tarleton who is fighting a pitched battle, making his way toward the perimeter of the field, trying to escape back to the British lines... 
Seeing nothing but Tarleton, Marion hurriedly tears open his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made from Thomas' lead soldiers... 
As he loads the pistol, his eyes still trained on Tarleton, Dalton runs up in the chaos... 
DALTON COLONEL!  OUR LINE! 
Marion finishes reloading... distracted he turns to Dalton for an instant...

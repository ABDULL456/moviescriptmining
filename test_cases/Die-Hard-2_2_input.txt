STUART 
(DRYLY) I think by now I've got your attention. I know your recorders go 24 hours around the clock, so I'll be quick -you can play me back later all you want. 
94 INT. CAB - INTERCUT 94 
TRUDEAU How. did you get on this line? Who is this? 
STUART Who I am is unimportant. What I want... well, if you don't want those planes overhead to start dropping like flies when they run out of fuel... what I want is very important. All REACT - McClane as much as anyone.

STUART(CONT'D) A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes. It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1. 
MCCLANE Esperanza? Trudeau nods - 
STUART This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled. 
95 FAVORING MCCLANE 95 As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over to Barnes. 
MCCLANE What's all that about? 
BARNES A 747 has the furthest flight capacity of anything we've got here. Take out the seats and save some weight, add the wing tanks and it could go to Australia, Africa, Asia - hell the whole Goddamn world.' 
MCCLANE Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties. 
LORENZO They're talking to us on our own Goddamn system! They gotta be close - I'll have my men tear this airport 
APART - 
MCCLANE About time, Carmine. Guess you have to light a fire under your ass to light a fire under your ass.

LORENZO McClane, I got a first class unit here, SWAT team and all, and we don't need any Monday morning quarterbacks. 
MCCLANE (pissed, moving in) Monday morning? My wife's on one of those planes these aasstards are fucking with! That makes me a player on the fucking field, you putz! And if you got off your fat ass when I told you to, maybe we wouldn't be knee deep in shit right now! 
LORENZO (turning, shouting) Security! (back to McClane) You're out of here! And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau REACTS, unsure - 
LORENZO Mr. Trudeau. Do I have to remind you about FAA regulations regarding unauthorized personnel in the control tower? 
TRUDEAU 
(TO GUARDS) See Mr. McClane out. 
96 AT THE ELEVATOR 96 It opens. Someone's inside., but we don't feature them yet. 
MCCLANE (as he's muscled in) Trudeau, can't you see you're dealing with pros? You can't fuck with these 
GUYS - Sam comes out of the elevator, holding up her ID. 
SAM 
(TO TRUDEAU) Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau, there's a lot of rumors flying around 
THE - 
LORENZO Oh, no, no way -

TRUDEAU This is off limits, Coleman, you know that! Together with McClane she's shoved into the elevator. 
MCCLANE Anything you can think-of, they'll think of, too! But the elevator DOORS CLOSE on him and now Lorenzo turns a KEY on the control panel, then SPEAKS into his walkie talkie. 
LORENZO Lobby Security, come in. 
96A AIRPORT - LOBBY - INTERCUT 96A 
LOBBY COP (into RADIO), Tomlinson here - 
LORENZO And Lorenzo here, with two unauthorized personnel in the fucking tower! Get your thumb out of your ass and get over to the elevator. Get them out and post a guard or you're gonna have a pink slip in your Christmas stocking! Rattled, the guard signals a comrade, hustles to obey.

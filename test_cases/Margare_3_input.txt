86 INT. LISA'S ROOM./INT. ABIGAIL'S HOUSE. DAY. 86 
Lisa is on the phone. 
LISA Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz? 
ABIGAIL This is Abigail. 
LISA Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I... 
ABIGAIL Yes? Hello? 
LISA Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson? 
ABIGAIL 
OK...? 
LISA I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died... 
ABIGAIL 
OK...? 
LISA Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time... 
86 CONTINUED: 86 
ABIGAIL Yes? What can I do for you? 
LISA OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because -- 
ABIGAIL 
(ON "ASSUME")) No. As far as I know they're doing something or other next week. But -- 
LISA I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter? 
ABIGAIL LISA No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago. 
LISA Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was 
IT -- 
ABIGAIL She had leukemia. 
LISA Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa? 
ABIGAIL Yes...? 
LISA OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought -- 
ABIGAIL Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number? 
LISA Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to -- 
ABIGAIL 
(ON "IF") Well they really shouldn't be giving out my number. (blurts out) This is harassment! 
86 CONTINUED: (2) 86 
LISA 
(SHOCKED) I'm sorry! -I'm not trying to harass 
YOU -- 
ABIGAIL I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me. 
LISA I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to 
CONTACT -- 
ABIGAIL Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop. 
LISA Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen? 
ABIGAIL Yes, all right. 
87 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT/COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 87 
EMILY MORRISON, 40s, is on the phone in her Upper West Side apartment. She's on the phone with Lisa. 
EMILY I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine... 
LISA Oh so was she a lawyer? 
EMILY Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers. 
87 CONTINUED: 87 
LISA Were you really good friends with her? 
EMILY Yes I was. 
88 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 88 
Joan is reading audition sides. Lisa passes through, dressed somberly. 
JOAN Where you going, sweetie? 
LISA I'm going to that woman's funeral. 
JOAN Are you sure you don't want me to come? 
LISA Why? I don't even know her. 
JOAN I would be coming for you. 
89 INT. EMILY'S CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT. DAY. 89 
EMILY opens the door for LISA. In the b.g. about thirty people are gathered. A mix of Upper West Siders, social workers, and Monica's multi-ethnic clients. 
EMILY Hi. Are you Lisa? 
LISA Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come. 
EMILY Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink? 
LISA Oh -- Um -- no thanks. 
EMILY We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres. 
LISA Oh - that's quite all right, thank you. 
90 INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. 90 
Everyone is seated on Emily's chairs and borrowed chairs. 
90 CONTINUED: 90 
EMILY Well-thank you all for coming. 
WOMAN MOURNER Thank you for doing this, Emily. 
THE MOURNERS Yes, thank you, Emily. 
EMILY As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly. 
EMILY (CONT'D) I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel. And I don't want to kid myself about the stupid, meaningless way she died, because it would really make her throw up. But I don't want it to become the summation of her life. Because it's not. When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can you stand it?" And she said. "First of all I can't. But I don't want to take away the twelve years she did have, and turn them all into leukemia. Because they weren't." So despite the fact that she got -- ripped off, I do think it's important to remember that Monica got a lot out of life. She was the most fully developed person I personally have ever known. She was also impossible to get along with, but that's another story. Everybody laughs.

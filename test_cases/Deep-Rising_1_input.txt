117     FUJI MARU REAR DECK - DAY                              117 
The Saipan is still bobbing behind the Fuji Maru. But the HARPOON HOOK, which holds the tow-line and is embedded into the rear deck of the ship, is starting to PRY LOOSE. It JERKS and BUCKS against the metal wall. Canton doesn't notice this as he slips and slides his way up to the railing. He sees the Saipan and smiles. Then he looks off at -- 
118     ISLAND                                                 118 
rising out of the ocean. About a mile away. Canton starts to climb over the railing. And that's when the HARPOON HOOK RIPS FREE. WHIZZES FORWARD. And IMPALES Canton's LEG. He SCREAMS. Tries to spin free. The hook hangs onto his leg for a long, agonizing BEAT as Canton continues to SCREAM. Then the HOOK RIPS FREE, grabs the METAL RAILING and starts TEARING IT off the deck. Canton drops to the deck, holding his leg and whimpering in pain. And then he sees it -- 
119     SPEEDBOAT                                              119 
dangling from its harness down on the watersports platform. 
120     TO SCENE                                               120 
Canton starts to crawl for it. Moaning and bleeding.

121     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                              121 
Finnegan and Trillian race up onto the pool deck. Passing beneath a colorful NEON SIGN which READS: 
"THE FUJI MARU - YOUR FUN SHIP" 
In the dark, Trillian trips. She falls to the slippery, waterlogged deck, and SCREAMS... 
TRILLIAN EEEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH! 
...clawing at her face... Finnegan pulls her hands from her face...and the thing that attached itself there...a small squid from the shattered aquarium. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) (freaked) Ah...ah...ah... 
Tries to catch her breath. 
FINNEGAN It's OK...it's not one of them... it's from the aquarium...it's... 
And then it dawns on Finnegan. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) It's not them...it's it... 
TRILLIAN What? 
FINNEGAN You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this... 
He holds up the squid. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...can't exert that kind of pressure... And the way it tracked us? A million little things don't carry portable phones to coordinate positions... What's chasing us... it's one...thing...one giant... thing. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
122     ARIAL POV - MATTE FX SHOT - NIGHT                      122 
...looking down on the Fuji Maru from high up in the air. Beneath the ENTIRE SHIP is an enormous, undulating BLACK SHADOW. A massive monster from the deep.

123     CASINO - NIGHT                                         123 
RED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH. The CLAXTON RINGS. Off to one side of a wall, behind the bar, the dumbwaiter door opens, and Pantucci tumbles out, looks around, and then hears... 
HANOVER (V.O.) Help!! Help!! 
Pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed bandits... rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover. 
Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. His face is badly constricted. His body paralyzed. He clings to a black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg. It's already to his hip. He grasps desperately for his pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. This guy ain't gonna survive. 
PANTUCCI YELPS and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally tense. He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle, and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover. Pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover. Then he looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh. 
PANTUCCI ...even you don't deserve this. 
Pantucci picks up Hanover's pistol. Then slowly, cautiously, he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's TWITCHING HAND. 
PANTUCCI (CONT'D) I'm sorry man... 
He turns and quickly limps off. Hanover's EYES look down at the gun in his hand. Then, with all the strength he has left, he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his head. 
CLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself. He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream.

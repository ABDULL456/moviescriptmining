Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces are just a couple of feet away -- 
)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         15. 
57    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - CHRISTY - NIGHT 57 
as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes close and -- 
CLOSE ON RICHMOND                                                * 
as his eyes are open -- 
-- the look on his drunken face is scary. 
58    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 58 
Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried. 
59    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CHRISTY AND RICHMOND         59 IN CLOSEUP - NIGHT 
looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone. 
60    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 60 
Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied bed. 
61    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        61 
The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him like that, her eyes shut tight -- 
62    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 62 
Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut, they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the awful look from before is back, only worse, and then without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly -- 
-- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond smiles at her sweetly. 
Christy.   Shaking her head. 
Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology. 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED:                                                     62 
Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him. 
Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully- handsome man. 
Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger, reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth. 
It's a sweet moment. 
They smile. 
Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously, right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor. 
Christy sits there stunned. 
CHRISTY (slurred) You fucking bastard. 
And on that -- 
Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up. Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as she is on her feet -- 
Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach. 
63   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                    63 
Luther, silently applauding. 
64   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                           64 
Richmond, the air momentarily out of him,  falling drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just  a moment and clearly in pain, but he is a big man and  he is strong and he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both  are laboring on the floor and Christy kicks him again and  again -- 
-- but he will not release her ankle.   Each kick only inflames his drunken rage. 
(CONTINUED) 
64   CONTINUED:                                                      64 
RICHMOND (very slurred --) You little whore -- 
And now they both try and stand. 
Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he is on his feet he begins to strangle her. 
Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her fingers scratching deeply -- 
-- but he will not let go. 
She twists and jerks her body -- 
-- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her throat -- 
-- and spreads his legs for better balance. 
The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches around for something, anything -- her fingers finally close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she slashes his right arm. 
Now he lets go.    And stares, stunned, at his bleeding arm. 
Then he crunches her flush in the   mouth, a brutal blow, and blood pours from her nose and   mouth and if she weren't so scared, maybe it would   have stopped her, but it doesn't -- because somehow she   manages to maintain balance -- 
-- and knees him all she has, in the nuts. 
It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless.       He lies on his back, holding his crotch. 
But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face, stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her hand. 
And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --

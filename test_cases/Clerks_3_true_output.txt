DANTE carries a litter box to be dumped. He pauses midstrike and lays it on the ice cream chest. DANTE picks up the phone and looks at the paper. He dials and waits. 
DANTE Yes, I'd like to check on a misprint in today's edition...Today's edition...It says "Bree to Wed Asian Design Major...No, no; everything's spelled fine. I just wanted to know if the piece was a misprint...I don't know, like a typographical error or something... 
A CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the litter box. A black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts pawing around. 
DANTE (O.C.) Maybe it's supposed to be Caitlin Bray, or Caitlin Bre, with one e...I'm a curious party...A curious party... 
DANTE on the phone: 
DANTE ...I'm an ex-boyfriend...Well, it's just that we talk all the time, and she never mentioned this engagement, which is why I'm thinking maybe it's a misprint... 
The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load. 
DANTE (O.C.) ...Are you sure?...Maybe there's like a vindictive printer working for you... 
DANTE on the phone: 
DANTE Meaning like someone who maybe-I don't know-asked her out once and got shot down, and his revenge is throwing this bogus article in when the paper went to press...Hello?...Hello? 
DANTE hangs up. He looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his head. He then sniffs the air.

JAY, SILENT BOB and OLAF lean against wall. 
JAY "Not in me." That's what she says. I gotta pull out and spank it to get it on. So I blow a nut on her belly, and I get out of there, just as my uncle walks in. It was such a close call. I tell you what, though, I don't care if she is my cousin, I'm gonna knock those boots again tonight. 
TWO GIRLS join them. 
JAY Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum. 
GIRL 1 Scumbag. What are you doing? 
JAY Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin. 
GIRL 1 (to SILENT BOB) He's your cousin? 
JAY Check this out, he's from Russia. 
GIRL 1 No way. 
JAY I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying? 
SILENT BOB shakes his head: 
JAY See? And Silent Bob never told a lie in his life. 
GIRL 2 What part of Russia? 
JAY I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer? (to OLAF) Olaf, what part of Russia are you from? 
OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB. 
SILENT BOB (in Russian) Home. 
OLAF (comprehending) Moscow. 
GIRL 1 He only speaks Russian? 
JAY He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do. 
GIRL 2 Is he staying here? 
JAY He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.

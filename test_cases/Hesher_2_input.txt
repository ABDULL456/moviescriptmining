HESHER Um... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
The funeral director looks over to Dad, not sure what to do. He lightly puts his hand on Hesher's arm to guide him off stage. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR I'm sorry, sir- 
Hesher pushes the funeral director's arm away hard. 
HESHER You touch me again, I'll rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you. 
The funeral director backs off, scared and unsure of what to do. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't want me here and I don't want to fucking be here, but I'm not here for me, I'm fuckin' here for her- 
Hesher gestures to Grandma's coffin. 
HESHER (CONT'D) - and I'm not fuckin' here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it - this is not how I want to say goodbye to someone I like - in this shit-hole with these- 
Hesher points to the funeral director. 
HESHER (CONT'D) - fuckin' assholes. 
TJ's dad stands and interrupts. 
DAD OK, this is enough- 
HESHER Yeah, well why don't you shut up for a second and listen cause I'm going to say what I want to say and then you'll never see me again. Alright?! 
There is a beat of silence. No one knows what to say or do. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
HESHER (CONT'D) I'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin' break it down. 
Hesher takes a long pull from his beer can. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that. 
Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of beer on the floor. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit. 
The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued. 
HESHER (CONT'D) And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) HESHER (CONT'D) All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too. 
Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his point. They look back at him stunned. 
HESHER (CONT'D) You lost your mom. You lost your wife. I lost a nut. 
Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk. This soaks in with the crowd. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Fuck this. 
Hesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified. 
The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks over from the floor. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Leave her alone. We're not finished yet. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR (POLITELY) Unfortunately sir, we need to be. 
They continue to push the coffin away. Hesher lifts himself up and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin. The funeral workers back away. 
HESHER I told Grandma I was going on a walk with her and I'm gonna do it! 
Determined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the coffin stand. 
Dad stands, not exactly sure what to do. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (6) 
With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit. He turns to TJ - 
HESHER (CONT'D) You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her. This is your last chance. 
Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the coffin toward the exit and out through the doors. 
TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the coffin out into the parking lot. 
TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does the same. 
All three are now walking together through the funeral home parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a release. Other mourners watch from the doorway. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

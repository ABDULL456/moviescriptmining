VINCE Of course, but it's nice to make it official. JULIUS                                      * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother. VINCE                                       * And tonight we celebrate! 
135   INT. VINCE AND JULIUS'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                 135 Vince is finishing dressing, making sure he looks partic- ularly fantastic. Julius hangs back; something is bothering him. JULIUS (embarrassed; a burst) Vince, you've got to help me -- I've never been out on a date before... what should I do? 
VINCE Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance. 
Julius looks at his brother. (CONTINUED)

VINCE Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her. 
JULIUS You dance with them?                                     * 
VINCE It turns them to putty in your hands. 
CUT TO: 
VINCE He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room. VINCE Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- JULIUS (coming over) -- Thank you for this, Vince -- VINCE (a pained look on his face) -- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes his hands. VINCE I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn... (AD LIB as follows) ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- Vince begins to take Julius through the steps slowly at first, then as Julius gains confidence they begin to sail round the room, and we -- CUT TO:

Marnie, thrilled, stays with him step for step as we -- PULL BACK to reveal -- 
Vince and Linda, waltzing brilliantly, too. The four of them have the whole floor to themselves as other dancers ring the area, watching and shouting encouragement. 
The SONG ENDS -- Everyone applauds -- Our two couples head over to their table. VINCE (to Julius) Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. CUT TO: 
A137   INT. DADDY'S GIRL - BOOTH                                     A137 Vince, Linda, Julius and Marnie are seated at a table covered with quite a few empty beer bottles. They are all a little drunk. JULIUS Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt? 
MARNIE Er... no... 
JULIUS Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process. LINDA You sure know a lot about beer. 
MARNIE He knows a lot about everything. Julius polishes off the bottle, belches.

VINCE Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him. JULIUS Can I ask you a question? 
MARNIE Anything... JULIUS Am I shit-faced yet? Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer. 
MARNIE (laughing) You're getting there. Vince gets to his feet. VINCE Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.

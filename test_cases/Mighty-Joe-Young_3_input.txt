racing at breakneck speed over the dirt highway. Driven by GREGG O'HARA -- anyone would consider him young, strong and handsome -- except that right now, it's all hidden under the grime from a long flight and a week's growth of beard. Hair long, unkempt; clothes wrinkled. 
Gregg passes four local men burning a clearing in the woods for yet more farmland. 
Pushing its way up the mountain side. The humvee is packed with EQUIPMENT that RATTLES as Gregg hits every bump in the road. 
17    EXT. VILLAGE - DAY                                               17 
A tiny African village, just a main square with a bar, a school, an infirmary and a gas station. 
Standing smack in the middle of the road is an East Indian with a goatee, wrap-around Black Flys, and a Nike workout suit. 
Gregg's HUMVEE SKIDS to a sharp stop in front of him. 
GREGG You must be Pindi. 
Pindi flashes him a broad smile. 
PINDI The one and only, bro.

17A   EXT. VILLAGE - DAY                                               17A 
Pindi is leading Gregg down a row of vehicles: two Land Rovers, one with a strange-looking seat attached to the front hood, and an old, flatbed lorry. A surly-looking group of men lounge around on them.

PINDI Six men, three cars... everything you ask for, Mr. Ohara. (lowering his voice) All paid for in advance, out of Pindi's pocket... 
Gregg holds an envelope filled with cash in Pindi's face. He nods towards the nasty-looking men. 
GREGG Sweet-looking bunch of guys. 
Pindi snatches the envelope -- but Gregg holds onto his end. 
GREGG I asked for experienced trackers. 
PINDI These men are the best -- I assure you. Very best. 
Gregg allows Pindi to pull the envelope away. He immediately rifles through the cash, checking to make sure it's all there. 
Gregg eyes Pindi's men suspiciously, then walks around to the back of his humvee and flips open the storage boot, revealing an array of animal-tracking gadgetry. Pindi looks over his shoulder as Gregg loads a menacing-looking rifle. 
PINDI Nice piece you got there. What are we hunting, elephants? 
GREGG We're not hunting anything. 
Pindi sees that Gregg is loading the rifle with tran- quilizer darts. This confuses him, but he pretends to approve. 
PINDI Ah! Tranquilizer darts. I agree -- much nicer to animals than bullets. 
GREGG (indicating tranquilizer gun) Your men know how to use this, right?

PINDI Oh sure, boss.     Only professionals here. 
Gregg carefully puts the rifle back, then grabs a pair of Minolta 10x20 binoculars. 
PINDI So tell me, boss -- where are we going today? 
ON Gregg, panning across his field of vision with the binoculars. He stops. 
GREGG There. 
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS 
The highest peak in the range, playing hide and seek with the clouds. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Pindi's men see where Gregg is pointing. They murmur, trading grim glances at each other. Pindi jumps with nerves. 
PINDI There? Uh, boss, that is not such a good mountain. The men don't like it very much at all. You see there is a legend they believe in, that a creature lives there... 
Gregg's back to checking his equipment. 
GREGG 'N'Gai Zamu.' The sacred guardian of Mount Pangani. 
Pindi looks at Gregg, surprised he knows this. 
PINDI You know it? How funny! (with dread) That's not, by any chance, what you are looking for, is it, boss? 
Gregg looks from Pindi's nervous face to the serious faces of the trackers. They are all watching him. 
(CONTINUED) 14A. 
17A   CONTINUED:    (2A)                                              17A 
GREGG Looking for a legend?   No.   Why would I do that? 
Gregg takes the car keys from Pindi's hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
17A   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             17A 
GREGG Gimme those. 
OFF Pindi -- not particularly thrilled...

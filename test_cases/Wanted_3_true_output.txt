WESLEY That's terrible. 
FOX I Nah. Motherfucker deserved it. Be raped eight women in those four days. One of them was my great-great-great-grandmama. She pushes her chair back, done with her work. The CAMERA PUSHES IN as Fox removes the device so we can take a look: the three-headed dog has been tattooed into his hand. 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Wesley and Fox walk down a crowded urban city street. The CAMERA finds Wesley's tattoo and then moves around behind Fox and holds on hers. 
WESLEY Where's the Diablo? 
FOX 
(SHRUGS) I got tired of the color. Wesley can't help but smile, then Fox stops. They're standing right in front of a CAR SHOWROOM, displayed in the window is a MIDNIGHT BLACK PORSCHE 911 convertible sitting in a showroom window... 'us like the one Wesley's father smashed in Fox's story. 
EXT. SHOWROOM - NIGHT 
Suddenly, the car comes flying out of the window, glass shattering everywhere as it tears up the street. 
WESLEY (V.0.) Being a member of the Fraternity was like winning the lottery... 
ON THE CITY STREETS: Traffic lights mean nothing, as Wesley mashes the accelerator to the mat, and the Porsche responds, ripping up the road like a tiger on the prowl. Fox rises up in the passenger seat, looking over the windshield, the wind whipping her face... 
WESLEY.(V.0.) This... this is what my dad's life was like. He was a fucking god. He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler, which has to slam on its brakes. 
WESLEY (CONT'D) Where we headed? 
FOX Trial by fire, sugar. Hook a right. Wesley whips the car around a corner... 
FOX (CONT'D) Park it here, baby. He pulls the car to the side of the street... .in front of a busy outdoor mall. It's covered with shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people, people. Fox eyes the crowd. 
WESLEY You need a new wardrobe or something? 
FOX we're here for a reason and it ain't clothes-shopping. Somewhere in that crowd is your first target. 
WESLEY A test? 
FOX (shakes her head) The real thing. 
WESLEY Who's the mark? 
FOX You'll know him when you see him. 
WESLEY What if I don't? 
FOX Then you get shot. Fox hands him his Imanishi pistol, which Wesley rolls over in his hand. 
FOX (CONT'D) It's graduation day, baby. I He nods and makes his way toward... 
THE OUTDOOR MALL: .where he quickly mingles with the crowd. He has his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded- sweatshirt, the pistol inside. People pass him on his left and right, some make eye contact, some don't... anybody could be the target.. Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the SECURITY GUARD by the theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping at the sunglasses stand. And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was shagging his girlfriend... is thumbing through books outside the BARNES AND NOBLE... seemingly. not paying attention to what's around him. Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it? Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck, this can't really be happening... 
..Wesley gets ready, both hands inside that front pocket... .and now Barry meets his eyes... still coming... still coming...

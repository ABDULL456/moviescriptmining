PAMELA Henry, neither one of them has had a period yet. 
HENRY Ah. Yes. You've said. Repeatedly. As Pamela says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word 1.a Brigitte. 
PAMELA It's very odd that two perfectly healthy fifteen year olds are not menstruating. Right? Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger. 
HENRY Mmmm. steak's really yummy tonight. This a new sauce? The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool. 
PAMELA I started at eleven. The problem must be on your side, Henry. 
HENRY Pamela? This is not my fault. No one's at fault here. 
PAMELA when did your sister start? 
HENRY I've told you, I really have no idea. Oddly enough, we never discussed it. why don't you call her and ask her yourself? 
PAMELA I can't call her out of the blue and ask a thing like that. Besides, it's dinner time. They'll be eating. 
HENRY A--ha! 
PAMELA Well I've been checking panties for four years now 
GINGER & BRIGITTE/HENRY Mo-othe-er!!! /For chrissakes. 
GINGER (CON'T) You look at our underwear? Fuck! 
HENRY Hey, hey - I don't want to hear that word in my house. You will do as your mother says and I will change the subject. Anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence? From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off picket stained bloody from Ginger's impaling. Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see its masticated contents. Ginger cracks up laughing. Henry and Pamela sigh. 
INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Norman the terrier barks OFF-SCREEN - constantl Brigitte grimaces at the cartoon-style diagrams of How To Insert A Tampon. She carefully unwraps one and sets it in a glass of water. She times its expansion on her watch. 
BRIGITTE Why din't you jus' tell her you're going to get it? 
Ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker. she sniffs its contents. 
GINGER Can't take her 'attention'. She grosses me out. Can't believe she's our mother. Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid camera at arms' length from her face. 
BRIGITTE Yeah, but now we have to see this doctor. You can jus' say you got it, but I'm screwed. FLASH! The Polaroid spits out the front. Brigitte sticks another tampon in her free nostril, and one in each ear as, 
GINGER Did I get you out of Home Ec? Did I get you out of ballet classes? So I'll get you out of this, right? 
BR IG ITTE You better, gawd the idea FLASH! Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon sticking out of every visible orifice. Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and sticks it in her mouth. 
GINGER I said I will, I will. This jay's fine. Let us smoke, sister. Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She double- takes Brigitte' s tampon face. 
GINGER WHAT are you doing? 
BRIGITTE (sticking tampons under her upper lip) Look - a walrus. 
GINGER Hardee-har. Har. 
Ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window open.

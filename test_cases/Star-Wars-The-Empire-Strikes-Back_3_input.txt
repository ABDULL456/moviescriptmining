Luke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle. 
INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR 
Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention. 
The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers. Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia and one to Lando. 
LANDO Well done.  Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet.  Move. 
As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to undo Chewie's binding. 
LEIA What do you think you're doing? 
LANDO We're getting out of here. 
THREEPIO I knew all along it had to be a mistake. 
Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him. 
LEIA Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? 
Lando tries to free himself from Chewie. 
LANDO (choking) I had no choice... 
Chewie barks ferociously. 
THREEPIO (to Chewie) What are you doing?  Trust him, trust him! 
LEIA Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie?  He had no choice. 
LANDO I'm just trying to help... 
LEIA We don't need any of your help. 
LANDO (choking) H-a-a-a... 
LEIA What? 
THREEPIO It sounds like Han. 
LANDO There's still a chance to save Han... I mean, at the East Platform... 
LEIA Chewie. 
Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back. 
THREEPIO (to Lando) I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee. 
EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP 
The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold. 
BOBA FETT Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. 
And with that, the door slams shut. 
INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR 
Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly. 
THREEPIO Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you been? 
Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend. 
THREEPIO Turn around, you wooly...! (to Artoo) Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! 
Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing group. 
THREEPIO Well, at least your still in one piece!  Look what happened to me! 
EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY 
An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform. 
Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky. 
In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship. 
THREEPIO Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind you! 
A laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the elevator. 
Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons. 
But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward.

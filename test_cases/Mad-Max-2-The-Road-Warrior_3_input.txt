THE MONTAGE 
BLACK AND WHITE ACADEMY FORMAT 
THE WASTELAND. DAY. 
Flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move through an eerie, barren land. The only sound is the howl of a rising wind. 
Ahead something looms out of the storm. As we approach we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil pump. 
The wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very old man. This is the Narrator: 
NARRATOR v/o 
The vision dims and all that remains are memories. ._ They take me back - back to the place where the black pump sucked guzzolene from the earth...

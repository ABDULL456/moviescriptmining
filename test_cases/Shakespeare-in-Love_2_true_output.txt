Alone in the auditorium, FENNYMAN looks and listens, fascinated. So this is theatre! 
WILL (CONT'D) Go once more! 
NED ALLEYN comes out of the wings, frowning over his manuscript. 
ALLEYN WillWhere is Mercutio? 
WILL (tapping his forehead) Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write. 
WILL moves back into the wings where HENSLOWE is looking anxious. 
HENSLOWE A sonnet? You mean a play. 
WILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY. 
VIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house WESSEX can be heard ranting. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT. 
LORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing the brunt of his impatience. 
WESSEX Two hours at prayer! 
NURSE Lady Viola is pious, my lord. 
WESSEX Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance! 
NURSE It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord. 
WESSEX It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master. 
VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately, the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has disappeared. 
WESSEX (CONT'D) My lady VIOLA. 
VIOLA Lord Wessex. You have been waiting. 
WESSEX I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege. 
VIOLA You flatter, my lord. 
WESSEX No. I have spoken to the Queen. (pause) Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command. 
VIOLA Do you intend to marry, my lord? 
WESSEX Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. (pause) You are allowed to show your pleasure. 
VIOLA I do not love you, my lord. 
WESSEX How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia. 
VIOLA Virginia?! 
WESSEX Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . . 
VIOLA But why me? 
WESSEX It was your eyes. No, your lips. 
He kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA recoils, and slaps him. 
WESSEX (CONT'D) Will you defy your father and your Queen? 
VIOLA The Queen has consented? 
WESSEX She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. 
VIOLA (forced to submit) I will do my duty, my lord. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table. We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day" 
Now we see what VIOLA is writing. 
INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a daughter's duty " 
She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear.

STUMP No, I do. 
RAMONA All this ambiguity -- I see why she's divorcing ya. Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely. He doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some- one is Ramona. 
STUMP I don't know what I'm saying or doing anymore... I'm trying to speak my heart. RAMONA Oh God... STUMP I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She said 'okay' -- then I realized maybe I don't. RAMONA Then go back to her. STUMP No. 
RAMONA Then quit crying. You want a divorce, you don't want a divorce, you're asking marital advice from a woman you're trying to get in the sack -- Jeez Louise! 
STUMP I'm not myself. 
RAMONA Who is? A sigh.   Stump is lost.    He motions to the bartender. 
(CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              85 STUMP Another round, Harvey. (back to Ramona) This assignment has me befuddled. I'm supposed to tell the world that a monster is really a prince. I'm supposed to lie. 
RAMONA You being paid? 
STUMP Very well. RAMONA Then it's not a lie. It's a job. Quit agonizing -- take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over with. STUMP I can't. RAMONA Then quit. STUMP No! 
RAMONA For godsakes why not? Stump has to think about this for a while. 
STUMP He knows greatness. I'm in the presence of greatness. I want to learn about greatness. She looks at him like he's crazy. 
RAMONA Greatness is overrated. STUMP Maybe you're right, maybe you're right... RAMONA So what do you want? 
Stump drinks deeply -- his heart needs alcoholic reinforcement. (CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:    (4)                                               85 STUMP I want to be in someone's arms tonight. RAMONA Oh that. Why do men have such a hard time saying what they want? 
CUT TO: 
86   INT. STUMP'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                 86 Stump and Ramona stagger in drunkenly -- they are awkward and passionate. 
She grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle. STUMP Wait, wait... don't drink too much. RAMONA Ya think I won't be able to screw if I'm too drunk? STUMP Well... yeah... 
RAMONA Screwed, stewed, and tattooed! She laughs a hearty laugh, letting it all out. 
STUMP C'mere... I want to hold you. 
RAMONA You're so thoughtful -- the others are trying to get me drunk and you're trying to keep me sober.  You'd be good husband material. STUMP Not so fast -- 
RAMONA I didn't mean -- 
STUMP Come here. (CONTINUED) 
86   CONTINUED:                                                   86 They embrace -- and hold each other fully, doing nothing but holding on. Stump relaxes. 
RAMONA I'm not a whore. 
STUMP Shh, shh... I know, I know... A moment of quiet, simple bliss -- when: 
The door bursts open -- the LOCK SPLINTERS with a CRASH, and: Cobb bursts into the room -- Full of rage. 
COBB You two-timing bastard! You God damn Judas Iscariot! You stealing my girl! I'll kill you! STUMP She's not 'your' girl! And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him again. 
Stump falls backwards -- His head hits a corner of the table. RAMONA What're you doing?! And Cobb backhands Ramona across the face, knocking her down. 
Stump lies on the floor only half conscious. He grabs his head. Blood. The room swirls in front of him as --

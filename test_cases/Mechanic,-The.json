{"train": "THE MECHANIC \nWritten by \nKarl Gajdusek & Lewis John Carlino \nDRAFT: 07/17/2009 \n\"Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game.\" The Rolling Stones, 1968 \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT \nCLOSE on the needle of a precision-weighted 33rpm turntable. It comes down, touches vinyl. The Rolling Stones \"Sympathy for the Devil\" purrs out... ARTHUR BISHOP (40's) Sitting in a comfortable wooden chair, stares right through us. Lean, hard, in perfect physical shape. In this moment, carrying the stillness of someone utterly in balance. For all we know, he's been sitting this way for hours. \nBISHOP (V.O.) Every man has a death that's right for him. Every one. REVERSE to find a wall of photographs, charts, official documents. In the center A PHOTOGRAPH of a man, mid-40's, East-Indian, dressed like the billionaire he is. Dodi Fayed meets Bill Gates. THE MARK. \nBISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D) For every man, there's a way to leave this earth which is so right for them, it's almost as if they carry it with them. MOVING over the wall. MORE PHOTOGRAPHS. The Mark escorted from a bullet-proof sedan by ear-wired men. Entertaining at a palatial estate. Magazine covers: \"The billion-dollar lifestyle.\" \"The new Playboy.\" ...passing over smaller articles: \"What does this man do with your money?\" \nBISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D) When the right death overtakes a man, there will be grief in those who knew him, but there will also be a sense of inevitability. Because they will know, that of course... CLOSE ON BISHOP. Statue-like, except his eyes which dart across the wall in front of him, making connections... \nEXT. RURAL RACETRACK - DAY \nVINTAGE RACE CARS speed by, a blur of color. But all we hear is the Rolling Stones' song. And... \nBISHOP (V.O.) ...Of course, this was always going to happen this way. WHOMP! The SOUND OF THE RACE floods in as the cars blow by, revealing Bishop amidst onlookers, watching, calculating. \nBISHOP'S P.O.V.: Two cars TANGLE in a corner, SPIN to a stop, crushing a half-million in beautiful restored antique. The Mark climbs from his wreck, tosses his helmet, pissed. Bishop raises a camera, takes a picture. \nEXT. BISHOP'S STUDY - DAY \nBishop at his wall again, this time actively engaged, working it. A picture of the Mark in his vintage car goes up, underneath, Bishop tacks a stats page: \"Fatality in auto accidents by type of impact. Head on, Side rear,...\" Off to the side, bank statements, cash transfers. Saudi Arabia. Chechnya. United Arab Emirates. Bishop tacks more photos up. The Mark, getting off a private plane, the Mark, playing Polo... \nEXT. POLO GROUNDS - DAY \nWHACK! A Rider SLAMS a ball forward, spurs his horse onwards, bearing down on the ball... and SLAM! Another Rider comes in from the side, sends the man crashing off his horse. The second man, the Mark, takes a second to gloat over his fallen opponent before CHARGING onwards. IN THE STANDS. Bishop watches, takes a note on a pad. \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - DAY \nBishop keeps working, the wall completely covered now. Lists of possible deaths have been ordered, drawbacks circled. Bishop scans over various magazine covers featuring the Mark. One with a vintage hunting rifle slung low in his arms, unbroken. \"American Dream or American Nightmare?\" Bishop stares at this. Eyes moving over the wall, accident stats, a copy of a hunting-club reprimand... he's arrived. \nINT. RIVERWAY - NIGHT \nBishop stands in front of a moving riverway, his body sheathed in a black slicksuit, backpack on. He slips into the water and starts to SWIM. We STAY with Bishop as he SWIMS HARD, powerfully, not tiring. Finally, we PULL AWAY, across miles of water, realizing this is what Bishop will swim without stopping. \nEXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT \nA pair of ARMED SECURITY patrol a wooded shore. One lifts a pair of binoculars, scans the shore as BEHIND THEM, a form moves from behind a tree, blends into the woods. ON BISHOP. Moving fast, silent, towards a LIT STRUCTURE in the distance... \nINT. HIDEAWAY - NIGHT \nBLACK. The SENSE that someone is in here with us... A LOW GREEN GLOW illuminates Bishop in a TINY, CRAMPED, COMPARTMENT. No way to know what or where. The glow, coming from his watch, illuminates his face, crammed and claustrophobic. An eye checks the time, the light goes out. Just the sound of his breathing... \nEXT. SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING \nCRACK! CRACK! PLUMES OF SMOKE rise from the end of vintage hunting rifles. Game birds scatter into the air. Dogs BARK, tear through underbrush. MEN dressed in traditional hunting livery move through foggy woods, followed by STEWARDS. This is old school hunting, old school weapons. Camera finds The Mark, raising his weapon, sights... BLAM! A PHEASANT falls, dogs race after it. The Mark starts forward but is interrupted by his Steward reminding him to break his weapon as the other hunters have. The Mark pushes the man back, ignoring him, hurrying on. At a small distance, two unhappy private security guards follow. \nINT. HIDEAWAY - NO TIME \nBLACKNESS. A soft BEEPING, almost inaudible. A low rustle of cloth, then the green glow illuminates Bishop's face as he checks the time again. Hasn't moved in HOURS. \nEXT. SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING \nINT. BISHOP'S GYM - LATER \nBishop sits at a small desk, plotting the evening's work-out in a book. He traces columns, enters points on a graph. THE BOOK. Doesn't matter how impressive the numbers are, they've peaked and are now starting their inevitable slide... ON BISHOP. Staring at the book. \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT \nBishops stands in front of his phone. He scrolls through the last ten calls that have come through. They all read \"McKenna, Harry.\" Over and over. Three days' worth. \nINT. BISHOP'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nBishop eats dinner, alone at the end of a beautiful antique table. Hanging on the wall across from him, a vivid disturbing painting of three women. ON HIS PLATE. His food is a meal we might expect an astronaut to eat. Raw Spinach, a collection of supplements. He crunches through something that looks like cardboard, chews, stares at the painting. In his study, the phone rings. He eyeballs it, lets it ring. \nINT. DEN, BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nBishop sits on the couch in front of the television, his cat curls under his arm, purring. Bishop flips channels through an endless display of over-amped human behavior. People HAW and WINK in the sitcoms, people YELL on the talk-shows, people CRY and LUST on the dramas. Flip. Flip. A news channel shows a PICTURE of The Mark. \"Billionaire tech mogul dead in tragic accident.\" Two ANCHORS discuss... \nMALE NEWS ANCHOR ...here's a guy at the top of his game. And yes there were questions about the money: Where did it all go. Were some of his friends less than friendly to the US? But in the end, it's not the feds who catch up with him -- \nFEMALE NEWS ANCHOR It's that age old adage that boys will be boys. These dangerous hobbies come with the risk of accidents like this -- Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the door. \nEXT. HIGH-END APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nBishop pulls up in his car, looks up. Hundred of lit windows above him, lives going on behind each. He heads forward, the doorman holding the door for him. \nEXT. CORRIDOR, HIGH-RISE - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop gets out of the elevator, stops in front of a door. Beat. He rings the bell. \nWOMAN'S VOICE \n(FROM INSIDE) It's open! Bishop pushes the door open, steps into... \nINT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBeautifully, warmly furnished. Sofas surround a living area, a gas fire flickering. Throws and rugs. Art on the walls, tasteful and human. An open bottle of wine on a granite counter top. THE VIEW. Over all the city, thousands of lights twinkle. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'll just be a minute. We catch a GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair, wearing a skirt and a bra, crossing from the bathroom into her bedroom. Even in the small glimpse, she's beautiful. Bishop looks down at a coffee table. Magazines, newspaper. A picture of the first Mark's elaborate funeral. \nBISHOP I'm sorry I was away so long this time. I had some complications... He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom. 30's. Long dark hair, damp from the shower. Buttoning a shirt, the curve of her breasts caught as she does. A comfortable, sophisticated air about her. Effortlessly attractive. \nWOMAN You don't have to apologize. I'm just glad you're here now. \n(BEAT) Are you hungry? She starts to move by him, his hand catches her arm and she is in his arms, holding him TIGHT, kissing him. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I just... miss you. I never thought I was going to be a \"woman who waits.\" But I do. I wait for you. He nods. She breaks off, pours red wine in a glass. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Were you in Europe? Africa? \n(BEAT) Was there another woman? \nBISHOP No. \nWOMAN Liar. It's alright. I don't mind. (Suddenly shifting gears) I... I made something for you. She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV. Hits a button. A moment, then an IMAGE flickers to life. ON THE TV: The WOMAN, sitting in this same living room. She wears a long sleeve shirt over panties. Sips a glass of wine. Smiles warm at the camera. The silence of late night. \nWOMAN ON CAMERA Hey, you. Just got back from the weekend at the lake with Julianne and Barry and their kids. Their oldest is five. You'd like him. \n(BEAT) Everybody spoke about you, of course. We should go up there sometime, just the two of us... ON THE TV: She reaches towards the camera and the image JUMPS AHEAD. Another night, late. The WOMAN enters the frame, now wearing a stunning black party dress. \nWOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D) (announcing, giggling) I, just got back from seeing the most boring opening at the Pierre Grochet gallery. And of course everyone's asking where you are and of course I made your apologies, but what I was thinking... ON THE TV: She winks at the camera, happily drunk. Raises her dress a little, suggestive... \nWOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D) \nBishop steps out of the elevator into a top-level wonderland of money manipulation. Desks, crushed with monitors, manned by casually brilliant MIT-grads. Flat screens track the markets. All of this overseen by a witch's tit of a MANAGER who eyeballs Bishop coolly. A tapping gets Bishop's attention. The corner office is glass-walled. HARRY MCKENNA is tapping on it, gesturing Bishop inside. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MOMENTS LATER \nThe office is high-tech. Harry less so. 60's. Overweight and doesn't give a shit. Cigars in a ashtray, ash-burns on the Persian rugs. A man to be reckoned with, in his time. The time has perhaps passed. Harry comes out from behind his desk, points Bishop to a big leather sofa. Bishop perches on the arm. \nBISHOP I like the new digs. McKenna LAUGHS, like a grunt. Fiddles with his hearing aid, turning it up. Bishop's eyes track. \nMCKENNA Has it really been that long? Jesus. \n(BEAT) You know how they say youth is lost on the young? They're right. If I had my nineteen year old body back, I wouldn't be here, I'll tell you that. I'd be out there, making it my personal life mission to bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit skirts. \nBISHOP Times have changed, Harry. They don't wear skirts anymore. McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head. He goes to the glass wall, points out at the screens, financial markets. \nMCKENNA You know what all that is? (off Bishop's nod) That's their money, getting moved, exchanged. Made clean and neat and proper for Uncle Sam. And I have always been extremely careful. \nMcKenna goes to his desk, tosses legal papers on the table between them. \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) You know what that is? That's a God damn subpoena from the Justice Department. We get a new face in the white house, all of a sudden they want to look at my records. They got accountants want to go through MY BOOKS. Are you kidding me? I got the left hand coming after me for what I did for the right hand. Bishop looks over the papers, nods. \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) So I call them up. I say \"hey, you guys gotta get your own house in order...\" \nBISHOP And... \nMCKENNA And? And that's the point! Nothing. I tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it I get silence, zippo, fuck- all. What are they, twelve? \nBISHOP ...I don't see how I can -- \nMCKENNA That's bullshit, Arthur. Your father -- they still talk about the guy like he walked on water. You, they'll listen to. You -- \nBISHOP I'm not a part of that. McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous. Shakes a pill out of as small vial, pops it. He chuckles, shakes his head. \nMCKENNA You remember that fishing trip we all took, back in the day. You were, what? About eight, right? (Off Bishop's nod) You fell out of the boat... couldn't swim a stroke. City kid. (Animated, laughing) You're in the water, splashing around. \n(MORE) \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) You got these big eyes like saucers, like you're sure you're gonna drown. Splashing... swallowing water... just STARING at your father and he's not making a move. Remember? Just looking down at you like... Suddenly it's gotten less funny. \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) I finally had to grab you by the hair, pull you back into the boat. You're shivering like hell and he -- your dad -- gives one of those laughs. Those big laughs everyone loved him for. \n(BEAT) Anyway, the whole time you're in the water, you didn't cry out. Not once. You were a tough sonofabitch, even then. \nBISHOP That was a long time ago, Harry. McKenna turns from the window, takes in all his monitors, charts. Stock lines tick up and down, graphs flow, pulse... \nMCKENNA Well, I'm in the water this time, Arthur. You think it's easy for me to ask? It cuts like hell. But that's what I'm doing. Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the office. Pillows and blankets on a sofa. Some clothes strewn about. McKenna's been sleeping here. A long beat. Bishop... nods. The tension seems to DRAIN from McKenna. He claps Bishop on the back, nods back. \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) ...Thank you. Thank you. THROUGH THE GLASS WALL OF THE OFFICE. Bishop's eyes track as elevator doors open and STEVE MCKENNA steps out, a beautiful young woman with him, LOUISE. She's a trophy, the woman you get for being top dog and the one you regret getting. Gorgeous, self-obsessed, entitled. She flops onto a leather sofa as Steve moves towards the office. Steve's young, mid-20's, strikingly handsome, wearing the casual uniform of wealth not earned. But there's something else that arrests Bishop immediately. Unwasted motion, detachment, observing the world around him... from above. \nEven as Steve nods to one of his father's security and pushes into the room, he picks up Bishop. The two men lock eyes, a strange reflection not of appearance, but of nature. \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) And here's the prodigal son, arrived to bilk me for ransom. \n(TO STEVE) Steve, this is Arthur Bishop. Steve shakes Bishop's hand. Strong. Observant. \nSTEVE Hey. Nice to meet you. You work for my father? \nMCKENNA No, quite the opposite. Arthur's doing me a little favor. \nSTEVE So you're a criminal? \nMCKENNA That's enough. \nART DEALER (CONT'D) This way. Bishop follows the Dealer into another area where they approach a canvas. It's a portrait of a young boy, alone. The effect is of rage-filled isolation. \nART DEALER (CONT'D) Zak is almost finished. It will make a wonderful addition to your collection. Bishop looks at the canvas. Nods. Glances back to where the artist is carefully adjusting his model's position. \nART DEALER (CONT'D) Do you want to meet him? \nBISHOP ...No. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nBishop enters his home, sets his things down. Stares at his phone a beat, then on impulse picks it up and dials. The voice that answers is female, official. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can I help you? \nBISHOP Yes. I'd like to speak to Dean. There's a brief pause on the phone, then. \nWOMAN'S VOICE ...Mr. Dean is not available right now. Can I take a message? \nBISHOP No. Just tell him I called. Bishop hangs up, stares at the phone. The doorbell rings. Bishop opens it to find a DHL COURIER on his doorstep. Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly. The public face of Bishop. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Hello, Don. They make you drive all the way out here this evening? \nDON That's the job. \nThe man gestures to the open barn door, the classic cars. \nDON (CONT'D) You find tires for that old FleetMaster? \nBISHOP \n(SIGNING) No, not yet. Maybe when I do, we'll take it out for a spin. Say hello to the wife for me. \nDON Will do. Good night, Arthur. The man heads back towards his truck. Bishop tears away the strip that seals the envelope, a small USB jump-drive slides into his hands. The friendly grin on Bishop's face... evaporates. \nINT. STUDY - NIGHT \nBishop fires up a computer hooked to a printer. He slots the USB drive into the computer. Nothing seems to happen, just a low pulsing red light on the drive. Almost instantly, his phone rings and he answers. Silence. \nBISHOP \n(INTO PHONE) We should all be so lucky. Click. The phone goes dead. Almost at the same time, the glowing red light on the jump-drive turns GREEN. Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages. A few medical charts... and then a photograph: Harry McKenna. The new mark. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nBishop eats. Lost in thought. Eyes play over his art... \nINT. STUDY - NIGHT \nBishop hits the study, work-mode. All hesitation gone. Pages are tacked up, other ripped down and tossed. He takes out a thick pen, circles words: \"Syncope cardiac spasms...\" \"Prognosis...\" \"Poor eustachian tube function...\" \nINT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY \nBishop sits at a desk under a reading lamp, making notes out of a stack of books. Medical textbooks. Charts. A diagram of the central nervous system. Stress tests. The technical specs for an electronic device. \nINT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE - DAY \nBishop receives a SET OF PLANS from an attendant. Spreads them out over a counter. In the corner, a large photocopier. \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING \nBishop sits at his desk, a Jeweler's Loup over one eye, working with soldering iron and electronic tools, meticulous. Behind him, tacked to the wall, are copies of the building plans. Heavily inked. Routes in and out penned in. Locations of security. Photographs. He's done his recon. Sitting in the sun on a window ledge: an open jar of Mayonnaise, turning rancid. A fly buzzes around it. THROUGH THE JEWELER'S LOUP: Bishop is working on a hearing aide. Tweezers adjust a tiny chip, slot it into place... Phone rings. Bishop eyes it for a beat. Snaps it up. The voice on the other end is world weary, professional. DEAN. \nMCKENNA This turns out alright, I'm going to send you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos. You can return the hookers if you want, but the cigars... \nBISHOP \n(SMILING) I don't smoke. \nMCKENNA You will, my friend. For these, you will. \nINT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop and McKenna heading down. McKenna watches the numbers. Bishop studies McKenna... then, casually: \nBISHOP Why the change of security? \nMCKENNA ...What? Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button. Elevator jerks to a halt. Bishop gets a finger into the doors, PRIES them open. \nMCKENNA (CONT'D) Arthur...? McKenna looks at the effort, sighs. Lets Bishop help him down. Halfway through, BALANCE SHIFTS, McKenna starts to fall. Bishop STEADIES him. McKenna STARES at Bishop, concerned. Bishop nods, heading towards the STAIRS, pocketing a small hearing aide as he goes. ON MCKENNA, touching the hearing aide in his ear... \nBISHOP Come on... \nINT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop and McKenna reach the bottom of the stairwell. McKenna's winded, steadying himself against a wall. Bishop cracks the door, peers out. \nBISHOP What the hell...? McKenna moves in, pushes Bishop aside. MCKENNA'S P.O.V.: His SECURITY. Only there are two new faces in the garage. Replacements packing weaponry. \nMCKENNA This isn't good, Arthur... \nBISHOP Listen to me. Stay here. I'm going to check it out. \nMCKENNA Bishop, those men are armed... \nBISHOP Harry, relax. I know what I'm doing. And Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe moment he's out, he turns and sinks down in front of it, blocking it with his back. He opens his jacket, brings out a small TRANSMITTER. Waits a beat, then flicks a switch. \nINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nMcKenna there, STARING at the door. Nothing. He approaches the steel door, tries the handle. Can't open it. Nervous, he carefully puts his head against the door to listen... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The SOUND OF GUNFIRE, VOICES fill McKenna's ears. He staggers back, crouched, terrified... CLOSE ON HIS HEARING AIDE: The sounds of gunfire is coming from it. BLAM! BLAM! More shots, then the sound of POUNDING on the door. \nBISHOP'S VOICE Harry! It's a trap! RUN!!! The door flies opens and Bishop LURCHES IN, gun raised. McKenna starts up the stairs, breathing hard. Behind him, he can see Bishop, gun lined back at the door. BLAM! BLAM! Gunshots assault his eardrums. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nOn the other side of the door, Security hears the door slam, looks over for a moment, but there's nothing else. \nINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nMcKenna picks up the pace, hauling himself upwards. Sweat POURING off him, eyes wild. He stops, tries to catch his breath. Shooting PAIN through his right arm, he grabs it just as MORE GUNFIRE SOUNDS from below. \nBishop comes rushing up the stairs. His shirt stained with blood. Gun in his hand. \nBISHOP Come on! If we can get to the roof I can hold them off! Come on! McKenna GULPS AIR, staggers on... \nEXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MOMENTS LATER \nDoor BLOWS open, McKenna staggers onto the rooftop. The manic victory of having made it clashing with the tragic knowledge that his heart is rebelling. He falls to his knees, clutching his right arm. PAIN coursing through his body. Unaware for the moment that everything has gone silent. FEET come into his view. He looks up, sees Bishop standing over him. Bishop's face is a death mask. Emotion removed. Harry stares into his eyes... and understands. \nMCKENNA ...You. Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which turns into a scream as PAIN sends him reeling. He falls, hitting his head. Blood rolls down his face. \nSTEVE You know, what I don't get is you. Harry didn't have any friends. \nBISHOP Your dad worked with my father a long time ago. \nSTEVE So? \nBISHOP So, just paying my respects. \nSTEVE So your old man was into all that? \nBISHOP \n(SMALL NOD) Yeah, he was into all that. \nSTEVE Well, that is refreshingly honest, Mr. Bishop. What about you? Bishop doesn't answer, steers the car up a manicured drive. P.O.V. - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: An ESTATE. A main house, lawns, pools, guest houses. \nEXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON \nSteve and Bishop get out of the car. The McKenna estate was modeled neoclassical for a wanna-be emperor. Now a week of youth with limitless credit has left its mark. A SOUND SYSTEM has been set up poolside. A DJ spins a trance-like deep groove. YOUNG WOMEN lounge around the pool in bikinis, less. Beautiful and bored. YOUNG MEN, most dressed modern hip-hop, mostly white, eyeball the women, fist-bump each other, drink beers. Steve takes the whole thing in, nods, somehow pleased. \nSTEVE Why is it so comforting, when people surpass even our lowest expectations? \n(BEAT) Come on in, meet the crowd. \nBISHOP No, thanks. I've got to -- \nSTEVE Please. A favor to me. None of these people even remembered what today was. Bishop nods. They move into the scene. People recognize Steve, hug or bump-fists. Steve's friendly, but stays locked on Bishop. Bishop observes it all, not uncomfortable. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Do you believe in fate, Mr. Bishop? \nBISHOP Why? A basketball hoop has been set up near the pool. Young men take turns dunking and then landing in the water. \nSTEVE I think maybe we're all doomed to become our fathers. I'll probably die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and alone. Runs in the blood. What would that make you? \nBISHOP You're still young. You can do pretty much whatever you please. AT THE HOT TUB, two girls kiss each other, filmed in DV by an young entrepreneur. \nSTEVE You think so? Just chuck all this and go help the children in South America, something like that? \nBISHOP Maybe. \nSTEVE Well look at you, Mr. Bishop. You're a dreamer. Steve heads inside. A beat, Bishop follows. \nINT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON \nAs soon as they enter, Steve finds himself locked up by two BEAUTIES who whisper excitedly in his ear. \nBEAUTY #1 Well? Do you want to...? \nSTEVE No, in fact I'm pretty sure that's illegal in this state. \n(TO BISHOP) Come on, this way. Steve leaves the Beauties disappointed, moves up some stairs. Bishop follows. \nINT. MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nSteve and Bishop move into another room where two HUGE flatscreens have converted the room into a Wii court. Young muscle-bound posers play a first person head-to-head shoot-em game. Others drink, CHEER. Two bump fists with Steve. One fronts cool at Bishop, fakes a punch at him. Bishop just watches, doesn't do a thing. The kid smiles, nods... On the floor, paintings of Harry McKenna, discarded. \nINT. MASTER SUITE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nThis used to be Harry's realm. Now Steve's taken it over. Giant ornate king bed. Huge balcony overlooking the estate. Steve goes to the railing of the balcony, looks down at the grounds, the people. Bishop hangs back, glances into a private study, untouched from when Harry ruled there. Papers, books, a portrait of Harry over the desk. \nSTEVE You know, I went up there. To where my father died. \nEXT. BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EVENING \nBishop sits with Steve on the patio. From inside, Louise's soft crying can be heard. Seen through the trees in front of them, young people dance, splash, party. \nLOUISE \n(FROM INSIDE) Steve! Steve! I know you feel this. I know you'll stop me. \nSTEVE \n(CALLING BACK) If you don't care anything about your life, why should I? Steve looks to Bishop. He checks his watch. 10:30. \nLOUISE I'm getting cold. Please. I'm frightened. I'm scared, Steve. Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards. \nSTEVE You can help her if you want. The sounds of water, splashing. Louise arrives on the patio, a blood-stained robe loosely pulled on around her. Mascara eyes ran. She stares down at Steve. \nLOUISE You're a bastard. \nSTEVE You know what the kick of it is, Louise? If you actually had the stones, then there's be something for us. But in 30 seconds when you run down that path and all of those people go crazy saving your life... Well, then we'll be done. \n(BEAT) I know. Catch-22. Life's not fair. \nLOUISE \n(REALIZING) What happened to you? \nSTEVE Maybe nothing. Maybe you never really knew me. A beat. Louise, looking between the two men. She SWAYS on her feet and Bishop puts a hand out, steadies her. \nLOUISE You're a bastard, too. Both of you. Like looking in some dark mirror. \nSTEVE Go on, Louise. You'll do fine. The world's gonna love you. Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into the dark. A beat, the men just watching after her and then a SCREAM from below. COMMOTION, ACTION. People rush to Louise, help her to the ground. Others pulling out cell phones, call for help. Louise's LOUD cries drift back. \nBISHOP Would you have let her do it? \nSTEVE We'll never know, will we? Steve rises, heads up a small path. \nEXT. ESTATE GROUNDS - NIGHT \nSteve and Bishop, walking high above the estate. Far below them, the lights of an ambulance in the driveway. \nBISHOP You didn't answer my question. \nSTEVE Everybody dies. \nBISHOP Sure. But it's a whole other world when you're personally involved. There's a very big tab that has to be picked up. \nSTEVE Such as? Bishop stops, looks down at the action far below them. \nBISHOP Governments, cops, the military... we give young men a licence and send them into it blind, thinking it'll all be okay. Because someone told them they had permission. \n(BEAT) But when you cross over that line, you do it alone. Most people, they stay that way from then on. Alone. \nSTEVE Everybody can kill. You take a mother, protecting her child... \nBISHOP Sure. But that's instinct. What I'm talking about is up here... (tapping his head) Knowledge of foresight. Intention. A person who knows that the only way to truly be free of man's laws, is to break his highest one. Beat. It sits there, between them. \nSTEVE Why are you telling me all this? \nBISHOP Why did you want me to see that little stunt with your girlfriend? Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion. Ants swarming. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) These aren't your people, are they? You don't have \"people.\" Your life is crowded, but you're alone. Steve unconsciously nods, then: \nFEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D) You can pay at the desk. \nINT. FRONT DESK, EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop pays cash. He crumples the prescriptions, tosses it in the trash, starts to toss the doctor's card. Beat. He can see her down the hall, speaking with another doctor. Pretty, real. A moment, he pockets the card. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY \nSteve sits in his father's office chair, staring back at us, occasionally nodding. We REVERSE to find a collection of Investigators, a Forensic Doc, and a hardened SECURITY SPECIALIST. The Doc is in the middle of a presentation. BOARDS hold diagrams, conclusions, crime scene photos, all about Harry McKenna. The Doc demonstrates the precise hold, the pressure points that killed Harry McKenna. Steve watches, impassive. \nEXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON \nBishop runs through the woods, full-tilt. Finally stops in front of his house. He feels his injured shoulder, winces... \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING \nBishop sits on his sofa in front of the TV: A bureaucrat at a press conference. A female diplomat pushes through photogs with her hand up, shielding her face. Words scroll: \"US Intelligence under scrutiny... High level meeting...\" Bishop hits the remote and the TV goes to static, white noise again. His eyes... relax, almost asleep. We stay on his face, a glimpse into his only moments of peace... \nBANG! BANG! BANG! POUNDING on his front door. Bishop's eyes POP open. He's on his feet, instantly alert, moving past a sideboard. He touches a hidden catch, a \"click\" and he reaches underneath, comes out with a handgun. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR, BISHOP'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER \nSteve is there, pounding on the door. \nSTEVE Mr. Bishop! Arthur! Please, I need to speak with you. The front door opens. Bishop, fronting sleepy. Steve is ENERGIZED, LIT, eyes blazing. \nBISHOP What time is it? \nSTEVE I wanna show you something. Please. It'll be... It'll be interesting. \nINT. BENTLEY - EVENING \nSteve drives, too fast. Bishop is shotgun. The rear area usually reserved for passengers is empty. \nBISHOP Gonna tell me what the big surprise is? \nSTEVE I'd rather show you. I know, melodramatic. But I think it'll be worth it to you. Bishop TENSES, almost imperceptible as Steve pilots the car into the underground structure beneath McKenna Holding Corp. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nCar screeches to a stop. Steve grabs a case, is out. Bishops takes in the area. Two of Steve's SECURITY there, looking stern. Bishop checks the gun he has concealed in his waistband, reaches for his door. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA ENTERPRISES - EVENING \nElevator opens at the very top. Steve pushes out onto the roof. Bishop follows. Security lighting floods on, illuminating the desolate surface in eerie even light. \nSteve opens his case, starts tossing down PHOTOGRAPHS: CLOSE ON THE PICTURES: Harry McKenna. Dead on the roof. Other details. The doors, the elevator shaft, everything. PAPERS, coroner's documents. Medical photographs. \nBISHOP \n(CAREFUL) Maybe it's time you start talking. \nSTEVE (off the papers) You know what that says? My dad didn't die of a heart attack. I mean, he was dying of a heart attack, but that's not what killed him. The blood flow to his brain was cut off, his brain died before his body. Somebody killed him. On Bishop, considering Steve. \nBISHOP What do the police think? \nSTEVE \n(LAUGHING) The police? They don't want to hear about this. I mean, they'll look into it. But they don't very much like the idea that they totally missed this one and it'd be just easier for everyone if I would shut the hell up. \nBISHOP ...What do you want? \nINT. MORGUE - MORNING \nAs they enter, fluorescent lights flicker on. Cheap, overused. Some burnt out, others shorting. ROWS OF GURNEYS line the room. Bodies, covered in green morgue drapes. Steve's eyes play over it. He swallows. Bishop is cold, business-like. \nBISHOP Stay focused. This is a test. Bishop moves down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does. Nude BODIES are revealed. Men, women, teens. In some, the reason for their death is obvious. Others aren't telling. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) You want to know about killing, look around. Steve does, a little creeped out, but keeping it cool. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) The act of killing, is an end in itself. Any other motive keeps it from being pure. \nSTEVE The psychopath has no motive. \nBISHOP No, he's driven, compelled, by his sickness. He's as much the victim as those he kills. More drapes fall. Dead eyes stare up at them. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) But when you make your own law, you're responsible to no one else but yourself. Maybe you're free... \nSTEVE I understand. \nBISHOP Do you? This isn't some idea anymore. This is the real thing. You still with me? \nSTEVE I am. Another drape falls. A beautiful woman. No signs of injury. \nBISHOP Ever heard the term \"Mechanic\" used outside of its normal meaning? \nSTEVE My father used it. A dealer... a guy who works the tables. Bishops smiles, shakes his head. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Or a... killer. A hit man. Bishop just stares. Steve shakes his head, looks away from Bishop, winds up staring at a dead man. Laughs to himself. \nBISHOP What are you thinking? \nSTEVE I had you pegged as... a security consultant. Maybe ex-military. Someone who... protects people. \nBISHOP Maybe I do. \nSTEVE Or maybe you just get paid to kill people. Bishop nods his head yes. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) So why let me in? I mean, I know what I want. What do you get out of it? \nBISHOP ...Times are changing. Security is better trained, more lethal. Sometimes I could use a partner. \nSTEVE Bullshit. Bishop nods, smiles. He moves away from the tables, leaves Steve standing in the middle of it all. \nBISHOP In this... there isn't room for those who are outside of it. There's too much isolation. Friendships can't work. Eventually everyone expects you to account. The isolation... becomes a liability. You stand out. Standing out... isn't good. Steve smiles, shakes his head. \nSTEVE You need a... friend? \nBISHOP An associate. \n(BEAT) I'm offering to teach you something that most people can't be taught. \nSTEVE Because you think I'm a natural. \nBISHOP That remains to be seen. (taps his head) But you're alone in there, aren't you? That's... the prerequisite. Steve continues to stare at the bodies. Bishops starts towards the exit. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Think it over. \nSTEVE Bishop... \n(BEAT) When I find the men who murdered my father. You help me to kill them. \nBISHOP You may never find them. \nINT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY \nA huge square filled with VENDORS selling all manner of food and good out of CARTS and STALLS. Music, voices, crowds of people. Bishop moves through. Dressed average, just a guy in the crowd. He watches a couple argue. Moves on... \nBISHOP (V.O.) It's not good enough to simply follow your Mark and attack him. Most of these people know they're targets. They'll be watching for you. ... A moment, then Steve enters the frame, tracking Bishop. \nBISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D) You need to understand the location, control the situation. You're looking for escapes, security, police presence... Bishop passes two COPS, squeezes between two parked produce trucks towards the row of shops that border the square. \nINT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS \nBishop stands in front of a case, watches the precision instruments tick. From behind a counter, the Chinese OWNER notices him, puts down the watch he's repairing, approaches. 60's, authoritative, a LOUP on his forehead. \nOWNER Interest you in anything? Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective surfaces, back to the man. Bishop points to a watch. \nBISHOP That's a beauty. \nOWNER \n(BEAMING) You know your instruments... \nEXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - CONTINUOUS \nConcealed amidst exotic Guatemalan wraps, Steve tracks the Watch Shop. The attractive older woman running the stall eyes him. He looks right through her. STEVE'S P.O.V.: Bishop exits, heading back into the market. \nBISHOP (V.O.) Most of all, you need to answer this question: \"How does this man die here today?\" Bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat. Steve follows behind Bishop, lost in the sea of people. \nBISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D) Everybody, everyday, has a way to die. You have to find it. \nEXT. CURIOS STALL, OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop stands in front of stall filled with classic toys, rocking horses, vintage dolls. His gaze finds a large, still- boxed doll of the \"Luna Cromwell\" character that the Grocery Owner's Daughter is obsessed with. Almost life-sized. \nSALESMAN They don't make that anymore. That's a classic. I can let you have it for three hundred... \nINT. OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop turns away from the stand carrying the doll. A GROUP of teens RUNS by Bishop, buffeting him for a moment. Slightly off kilter, he checks his surroundings. Nothing. Bishop starts again, aware for the first time that a MAN is headed his direction, passing a knife-sharpening stand, blades gleaming, his face hidden by a low hat... Bishop tracks the figure out of the corner of his eye, turns and pushes through the tight space between two stalls, out the back where trucks are parked. Bishops glances back for the man, squeezes between two large trucks... ...coming out the other side when POP! A loud SOUND makes Bishop glance over. A HISSING coming from one of the trucks which starts to ROLL backwards and Suddenly HANDS are on Bishop from behind, PUSHING HIM backwards, into the space between the two trucks! A FLASH, A SPLIT SECOND to stare into Steve's face, holding him there to be crushed and... \nCRASH! The one truck SLAMS into the second, the vice closed, metal crumpling. Bishop, at the last minute pulled back by Steve who's holding him there, smiling. A beat. Bishop checks the surroundings, nods. Steve release him. \nBISHOP ...Good. Very good. \nSTEVE Good? That's all you got? How about God damn perfect, man? \nBISHOP Don't get cocky. \nSTEVE Broad daylight. A thousand witnesses. Man takes a wrong step. Excuse me if I take a moment to appreciate myself. Because that was poetry. (laughing, smiling) You just can't bring yourself to be impressed, can you? Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has fallen in the gutter. Picks it up, tries to dry it. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) (hand to his ear) What's that? You're what? Oh, you are impressed? No, come on, you don't have to say that. Really, I'm fine with -- You what? You've never seen someone better? Wow. \nBISHOP All right. You did very well. \nSTEVE Damn straight I did. And now, in celebration of me, I'm taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses... what? Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve. Bishop reaches into his jacket, places a gun in Steve's hands. A confused beat, Steve conceals the weapon. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) ...Bishop? \nBISHOP There's a man behind me. Look up once, then look away. Don't look back. Steve glances up. We realize we're right in front of the watch store. The OWNER is pulling the steel grate down over his store, closing for the day. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) You got him? \nSTEVE Yeah. Look... \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Of course why do we need that? We have each other right here. \nINT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCarefully, slowly, Steve makes his way down the hall towards the lit living room. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM The owner pauses, enjoying the crescendo of the music. Eyes closed for a moment. Then they open... ... Steve is standing in the doorway to the living room, the gun pointed at the owner. The owner sees him, becomes motionless. The two men staring across the space between them... and then everything happens very fast. The Owner LURCHES to the side with surprising speed and agility just as Steve FIRES! The bullet catches the Owner in the side, SPINNING him around. He CRASHES to the floor... ... but only for an INSTANT. THEN he's BACK ON HIS FEET, MOVING across the room! Steve tracks, pulls the trigger again but the gun only \"clicks\" empty. The man reaches a coat rack, grabs it in one fluid motion and is MOVING back at Steve who barely has time to drop the gun and BLOCK the rack as it SLICES through the air at him. The Owner HITS and HITS again. Skilled, professional, martial-arts trained. Steve blocking one, two, the third hit connects, sends Steve REELING back, crashing through the watch-repair table. The Owner leaps at him with the rack. Steve is BARELY able to catch the end before it impales him. The two men, BREATHING, STRUGGLING, the Owner FORCING the point lower towards Steve's face... ... Blood pools on Steve's shirt. Steve and the Owner both track it. The man is bleeding badly from the bullet wound. A split-second calculation and the man abandons the coat- rack, races across the room as Steve clambers to his feet. The man reaches the far wall, hits a RELEASE. The wood paneling slides open, revealing a CAR-15 fully automatic assault rifle with a silencer. The man grabs it, opens up! Bullets CHEW through furniture, drywall, glass searching for Steve who DIVES into the hallway, retreating as the man comes forward, firing in deadly precise BURSTS. Steve hides behind a wall which ERUPTS, blown to bits. He stumbles through a doorway into a KITCHEN. \nINT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nStillness. The woman and Bishop, staring forward, watching another of her videos. Another late-night diary. She's in a long shirt and panties, leaning close to the camera. \nWOMAN ON CAMERA \n(QUIET) Do you know what I dreamed? I dreamed you and I had a child... Bishops turns from the screen, walks away. Beat, she silences the TV, moves to join him. \nWOMAN I know, it's crazy. I don't want to pin you down. I know you need your freedom. I just... sometimes I miss you so much... He's staring at her, oddly. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) What? A beat. His eyes move down to her sofa where another man's tie has been discarded. A moment, then she shakes her head, angry with herself. The pretense dropping. The real woman scooping up the tie, tossing in a drawer. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Really, I am. I just... You didn't give me any warning this time. \n(BEAT) I'm sorry, Bishop. It won't happen again. \nBISHOP \n(NODDING) It's okay. Really. It's okay. \nINT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWITH THE OWNER. Holding the CAR-15. Listening for his target. His hand moves to the wound in his side, comes away covered in blood. Another decision, the man slides the weapon over his shoulder, retreats... ...MOVING with the man, through his apartment. He reaches his BATHROOM, blows inside. Tosses the toilet tank to the side, reaches in and comes out with a military-grade STIM needle which he JAMS into his own thigh. A MOMENT with the Owner, feeling the drug course through his system, giving him strength... \nSteve comes out of nowhere, HITS the man in the head with a heavy copper pot, sending him reeling back into the tub. Steve starts forward, DIVES to the side as the man opens back up, full auto, bullets CHEWING everything... CAR-15 finally clicks empty. Steve rises... and the Man is on him, kicking him. Steve, rolling away. The man PULLING him back. WHAM! WHAM! Steve takes brutal punches to the head and face. Blocks one and they GRAPPLE, rolling in the tight space of the hallway, the man coming up on top, pinning Steve's arm, SLAMMING him in the ribs. Something SNAPS. Steve SCREAMS, surges up with the man... smashing him THROUGH a small table, winding up on top of him, his hand around the owners throat... The two men... eye to eye. Fierce, deadly. Steve SQUEEZING the life out of him. The man's free arm HITTING Steve, OVER and OVER. Brutal body blows. Steve takes the punishment... continues to Squeeze... ...Finally, the man weakening. In his face... a dull resignation. \nOWNER \n(WEAKLY) Who... are... you? Steve doesn't answer, just keeps PRESSING. And finally... the man's eyes film over. He dies. Steve just KEEPS PRESSING. Locked. Horrified. Staring into the dead man's face. Finally, he rolls off. Flops back against the wall, broken, bleeding, weeping... He SCREAMS. From the heart, the guts, releasing EVERYTHING. \nINT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBishop sitting at the woman's dining room table. Carefully, she comes and takes the seat opposite him. No pretense. The professional, not the actor. \nWOMAN Hey, Bishop. You okay? He stares into his wine. Raises the glass to drink. His hand shakes. \nBISHOP Do you remember, what you wanted to be, when you were a little girl? She hears it, it wounds her. Looks down. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I was thinking of me. She looks up, clear eyes. She's tough. \nWOMAN No, it's okay. I wanted to be a Marine Biologist. I used to watch those Jaques Cousteau movies and just... dream. \nBISHOP What happened? \nWOMAN \n(BEAT) I was beautiful. He hears the simple truth of it, nods, respectful. He rises and goes to the music box on the mantle, takes out his wallet and removes the twenty $100 bills. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Don't worry about it this time. On the house. A beat. Then he slides the money under the box as before. \nBISHOP We all gotta make a living. He leaves, grabbing the doll as he goes. She watches him go, strangely. Sadness breaking through her cool. \nINT. LOCAL GROCERY - NIGHT \n(MORE) \nBISHOP (CONT'D) My father was very good, better than I'll ever be. But no one controls 100%. The nature of the work is that some people know who you are and what you do. \n(BEAT) A man told his girlfriend, to impress her. The girlfriend told some people she owned money to... Bishop finishes his glass of water. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) I was young. It took me four months to find the people, another to find the girl, and she gave me the Man. That's how I... \"got into it.\" \nSTEVE You ever wish you just... walked away? Let it go? \nBISHOP Sure. Every day. But I wasn't wired that way. \n(BEAT) What about you? Beat. Steve and Bishop, oddly locked... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three SMALL EXPLOSIONS in the kitchen. FLAMES shoot out of the galley. A cook stumbles out, on fire. A waiter douses him with water. People SCREAM! Alarms BLARE! Steve and Bishop. They haven't moved a muscle. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Here we go... And they're MOVING. \nINT. SECURITY STATION, EMBASSY - EVENING \nSECURITY takes a call as another man studies his monitor: People fleeing the building across the street, smoke. \nSECURITY Fire in the restaurant. (into radio, Turkish) Patrols two and five, we're closing down the front entrance. \nINT. SUITE, EMBASSY - EVENING \nThe MARK stands at her closet, starting to unbutton her shirt to change for her swim. She pulls it closed as one of her security knocks and pushes into the room from a balcony. \nSECURITY PRO Excuse me, 'mam. There's a fire next door, nothing to worry about. The Mark nods. The man locks the door behind him, crosses the room, leaves through the main door, professional. \nINT. STAIRWELL - EVENING \nSteve and Bishop push UPWARDS through a stream of people flooding DOWN the emergency stairs. They reach a heavy door, locked and alarmed. Beat. Three people burst out from the inside. Steve catches the door and they're through... \nINT. LAW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nA few LAWYERS and a SECRETARY still collecting their things look up as Bishop and Steve push in, holding up badges. \nSTEVE Hey! You need to get out! Whole building is going up! Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave. They move down five doors, push into... \nINT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nA private office. Desk, computer, a handwritten note reads \"Leave mail here, will be back Wednesday.\" A box from UPS which Bishop TEARS open. Inside, what looks like a large WEAPON. Steve goes to the windows, pushes them open. P.O.V. - THE EMBASSY ACROSS: Changing its security pattern. Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors. Below, the excess manpower is channeled to the front. Bishop turns, FIRES OUT THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across, SINKS into the wall of the embassy 30 feet away. Bishop HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the box. Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it. He crosses the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he returns, Bishop's already secured the cable outside. \nBISHOP Ready? \nSteve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under their clothing. He steps out onto the ledge with Bishop, closes the window behind him. Bishop lets himself fall backwards. \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nFlashing light of the fire trucks. No one sees the two figures sliding silently from building to building above, disappearing over a 4th story railing. \nEXT. BALCONY, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nSteve lands next to Bishop who unfastens the cord they used to cross, spools it back to them. A look. No way back now, and no trace left behind. Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy Security. A quick lock pick, and they slip inside. \nINT. ROOF LEVEL, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nElevator doors open and the Mark gets out. She nods to the guard on duty, heads into a changing room. \nINT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nTwo guards monitor screens: Corridors, rooms, entrances and exits. Pairs of guards make their rounds. CLOSING IN ON ONE PAIR. Something about them... The guard squints just as the image CHANGES, showing another part of the embassy. The guard hits a toggle, returns the previous image... But Bishop and Steve are gone. \nSteve lands hard in a cart of towels. Rises and pushes himself out of the way just in time for Bishop who grabs the pack he tossed down, shoulders it, and they're MOVING again, now through sub-corridors. \nSTEVE Alright, you gotta admire that. You gotta admit, we are a spooky good team... \nThey PUSH through a set of old doors, move fifteen feet to a metal roll-down door. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) It's like one moment we're there... the next moment... He ROLLS UP the door. STARES at a NEW WALL OF CEMENT BRICKS. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) ...we're fucked. Bishop takes in the problem, starts to solve it. He tracks left right, considering options... \nSTEVE (CONT'D) There wasn't any sign of this on the plans. I went over them fifty times!! This isn't supposed to be here! This can't be here! Bishop holds up a finger. \"Shhhhhh\" They LISTEN. A soft \"beeping.\" Both men PEER around the edge of the metal door to where a small box with a red light BLINKS. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Bishop... what do we do!? \nBISHOP Duck... Steve looks at Bishop and BOOM! Doors BLOW OPEN, THREE GUARDS burst through, machine guns raised and SPITTING... Steve hits the deck. Watching Bishop, it's like everything we've seen so far was in slow motion. This is the real thing, unleashed. Bishop WRAPS the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a shield to catch the fire from the other two. The man SCREAMS as his arm breaks. Bishop gets control of his weapon, focuses it on the other two. One is BLOWN back. The other DIVES for cover. Fluid, Bishop REVERSES the man, pushes him AWAY from him, coming up with TWO of the man's Flash-bangs in each hand. Each hand DIALS the grenade's timers to two different settings, simultaneously POPPING the levers. Second attacker FIRES a burst which Bishop DUCKS, the bullets stitching across the first attacker, SLAMMING him back, his rounds TEARING into the ceiling, showering Steve in debris. Bishop THROWS the first grenade which reaches the attacker just as he rises for another shot. BOOM! \nAnother down as ANOTHER ATTACKER dives through the door at Bishop who wraps the man up, his fingers finding pressure points on the man who goes limp in his arms, dead. ON STEVE. On the floor, witnessing everything. Even in the chaos, recognizing the move. Bishop SHOVES the last grenade down the front of the dead attacker's clothes, wheels him around, PRESSING him against the concrete brick wall... ... TWO more Security kick open a door, guns fire! Bishop goes horizontal, his legs CRUSHING the one man against the metal Grate even as he returns fire at the other two who fall back and BOOM! The grenade goes off! Bishop is HURLED against the far wall. SMOKE AND DEBRIS fill the space. Bishop MOVES, hauling Steve to his feet and shoving him into the ragged hole blown in the brick wall even as bullets trace after them. A bullet catches Bishop in the side, he sprawls, then LEAPS towards the hole... \nINT. UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT \nCover in the floor is tossed aside. Bishop and Steve emerge, move 6 feet to a non-descript Buick. Climb in. The keys are waiting, Bishop starts it up, drives up the ramp. Next to him, Steve is catatonic, lost. As he drives, Bishop RIPS a strip from his shirt, pads the wound in his side. \nBISHOP Hey! Hey! You still here? \nSTEVE ...It was my fault. I was in charge of the exit. I looked at every work order, every entry in the building logs... \nBISHOP No one controls 100% That's the nature of the beast. Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last corner, ACCELERATING at the closed gate in front of them, a Turkish guard waving his arms frantically... \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nFiretrucks and ambulances already crowd the streets. There's just no time or extra manpower left to react to the Buick which plows through the gate of the locked garage. \nINT. BUICK- CONTINUOUS \nTwo blocks behind, a single police car follows. Bishop takes a hard turn, moving FAST. \nBISHOP Hey! You did good in there. You hear me?. It was asking a lot. You came through. Steve nods, processing, accepting. Another TURN. Bishop slides the car to a stop in a covered lot. Across from them, Bishop's own Cobra waits. Behind them, the police car tears by, lost. \nINT. BISHOP'S CAR - NIGHT \nBishop drives down the small lane leading to his home. Steve is staring out his window, deep in thought. Finally, looks over. For the first time takes in Bishop's injuries. \nSTEVE You're bleeding. \nBISHOP ...Yup. \nSTEVE So back there. That was one hundred percent? Bishop looks over, gives nothing. Tiny smile. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nDoor opens and Bishop and Steve come in. Steve plops in a chair, head in his hands. A beat, and then MUSIC filters in. Neil Young's \"Needle and the Damage Done.\" He raises his head, sees light glowing from the study. \nINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nBishop sits in a chair, eyes closed. Steve comes in, stares at Bishop. Looks over and admires the surface of the spinning record... \nSTEVE Do you think you know it, when you've made the mistake you won't survive? Or will it be like the Marks? Wake up on top of the world, never know... \nSteve glances into the open cabinet where Bishop keeps his vinyl, FREEZES. Comes out with an signed album. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) ...Oh my God. This is a signed Hendrix Axis, 1967 release. This has gotta be worth... we have to play this. You have to play this. \nDEAN You look like shit. \n(BEAT) How does Harry McKenna's son figure in? \nBISHOP He's going to be working with me from now on. \nDEAN You sure that's wise? \nBISHOP Do I need your permission? \nDEAN No... And for the record, I don't believe you'd ask for it. Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the set of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life, muted. News reports featuring the killing of the Turkish Embassador. Shots of the woman, smiling. Helicopter shots of the pool structure. Words scroll: \"Terror on our soil.\" \"Assassination!\" \"US Envoy ejected from Turkey...\" \nDEAN (CONT'D) \n(POINTING) That was my baby. But my baby has turned into an epic shit-storm and so when the man who caused said epic shit storm suddenly decides to do some soul-searching... \n(PLAINLY) What are you doing, Bishop? \nBISHOP The mistake was mine, not the kid's. \nDEAN \nI DON'T CARE. Dean leans in, intense. Bishop watches the screens. A screen changes to a commercial for a Bahamas resort. \nDEAN (CONT'D) I am on some very fucking thin ice right now which means you are on some very fucking this ice as well. \nBISHOP Someone I trained. That could be worth a lot to you. Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the interior blinds, raises one. From here they can see out over the office. Glimpses of a dozen conversations. Other men and women at work. More than a couple glance over towards Dean's office. A predatory vibe. \nDEAN And here I thought we were both going to live forever. Bishop smiles. Dean stares at him. Bishop stares back. Suddenly, this becomes the moment, the decision... \nDEAN (CONT'D) You know, in this business, you only get one mistake. (off the flatscreens) So nothing more like that. You take full responsibility. \nBISHOP Yes. The two men, face to face. Then Dean's phone rings. He turns to it, snaps it up. \nDEAN \n(ON PHONE) Hey, Stanley. Yes, we're all sorted out. I just need you to -- \nBISHOP The hit, on the woman. What was the reason? Dean looks back, surprised, angered. \nDEAN \n(ON PHONE) I'm calling you back. Dean clicks off, takes in this change of rules. A dead seriousness infects his voice. Fear. \nDEAN (CONT'D) You know, this foul-up, McKenna's son, it's all got some people's panties in a real twirl. \n(BEAT) This isn't the time for questions. This is the time for survival. Everyone... is expendable. Beat. Dean turns away, picks up the phone again. \nDEAN (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Yeah, get me Stan again... \nEXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON \nSteve lays out by his pool, sunglasses, baking under the sun as his group of hangers-on swarm around him. Play, dance, splash. He's immune to all of it. Louise climbs from the pool, water drips off her perfect form. She nestles in behind Steve, her hands running over his body. He stares straight ahead, as if she didn't exist. \nLOUISE Come on, baby. What's the matter? Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a DHL Van pulling up, the driver heading toward him. Steve lowers his glasses. \nEXT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING \nSeen from far away, the sedan pulls up. Bishop gets out. \nMODEL God, I love those. Which ones -- \nBISHOP Mr. KcKenna has a creative relationship with the truth. I don't actually... The model glances around, unsure... \nMODEL Oh, okay. That's funny. So what do you do? \nSTEVE Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do? Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down. BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Come on, Mr. Bishop. We're all waiting. Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then Bishop is up and moving through the crowd, pushing by people LAUGHING, DANCING. He almost runs into a bright blue-haired woman on the arm of a jockish RAPPER. \nBISHOP Excuse me... He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the Woman. She's utterly different than we've seen her. Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick, bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Hi. \nWOMAN Hi... This is strange. The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High- fives all around. He glances around for his date... \nBISHOP Is he your...? \nWOMAN No, just a job. (off his nod) I have to... \nBISHOP I know. Go on. She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES... ... and suddenly she's back with him. No words. Lights and sound and dance around them. She leans forward, kisses Bishop once. Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse. Bishop... staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve's voice fills the outdoor space, amplified. \nSTEVE Ladies and gentlemen! The man of the hour! A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes space for him. Steve's near the DJ, speaking on a mic. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) I know that not many of you know my friend. My good, dear... friend. I mean, he's a man of few words... And he's an art lover! Did you know that? His home is covered with work. It's amazing, what you can find in there. Amazing. A weird beat. Steve, smiling fierce. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Happy birthday, Arthur. Behind Steve, a covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls the cover off a PORTRAIT of Bishop, clearly done by the Artist he collects. The image is twisted, vivid, disturbing. As the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE the ARTIST himself now comes forward, Steve's arm around his shoulder and bumping fists before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop's hand. Faces BEAM. People CLAP. On Bishop, just looking at Steve who stares back... unreadable. \nEXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nBishop bangs out a door into the front drive, makes it to his car, fumbles for his keys. Sweating, off-kilter. \nSTEVE (O.S.) Hey, you forgot something. Steve's there, holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it. \nBISHOP Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm just not used to -- \nSTEVE No worries, man. It's your party. You can leave it. \n(BEAT) It's true, isn't it? What you said to me the first time we met. \nBISHOP What's that? \nSTEVE This thing we do. Finally, you always do it alone. Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces himself to stop. \nBISHOP Steve... thank you. \nSTEVE Uh-oh. I can feel some male bonding coming. We gonna hug it out, Bishop? \nBISHOP No, I'm serious. Thank you. People don't... Anyway, it's been a long time, since someone did something for me. Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark. \nSTEVE Happy Birthday, Arthur. Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink, and he turns and is gone, back to the party. Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away. \nINT. BISHOP'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop drives the car out of McKenna's estate, pulls out onto the street. He starts to accelerate away... then STOPS the car in the middle of the street. ON BISHOP. Fighting what his guts are screaming at him. Losing it, POUNDING on the steering wheel. Suddenly still... \nEXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nParty rages on, oblivious to the absence of its recipient. Suddenly faces turn UPWARDS... to where Steve is looking down on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool. \nSTEVE \nBISHOP On your four. You see him? Coming up, a MAN in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear where's he's wired. Steve and Bishop come abreast of him. WHAM! Steve pushes him down into the garbage alley between two homes. WHAM! WHAM! The man drops. Steve comes back, the man's gun palmed. Offers it to Bishop. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) No. You're the shooter. \nSTEVE When? \nBISHOP You'll know when. WITH THEM, MOVING, taking the corner onto the main street in front of the large building. \nINT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nDean's eyes track the outside, the limo making the final turn onto the street. Security visible ahead. \nDEAN \n(ON PHONE) Hey... Listen, I need you to go out of town for a few days. No, I know, but you have to trust me. \n(MORE) \nDEAN (CONT'D) Just go -- no, don't tell me where. Just go, okay. Okay? Yes, I'll call you soon, I gotta go... \nEXT. DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nSteve and Bishop, MOVING. They pass directly behind a COMMAND VEHICLE. Security on headsets, watching monitors. LOCAL POLICE are also working, one COP in particular guarding the corner of the perimeter. Bishop nods to Steve who heads up the stairs towards the building. Bishop checks his watch, looks down the street where DEAN'S LIMO and escort have turned the corner. Bishop moves to the cop, stands in front of him. The guy patiently puts a hand on him, moving him on. Bishop doesn't move. The cop FROWNS. A needle hits a record's surface. \"Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name...\" \nI/E. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS Suddenly dropping into Dean's POV as his limo pulls up to the steps. Chaotic motion, LIGHT STREAMING IN as the car door opens, security handlers reach in. We MOVE, fast up steps lined by City POLICE. One of the police turning his head, staring at Dean. Bishop. ON DEAN. Suddenly frozen. His handlers unsure what's going on, alert that something's not right. \nDEAN ...Bishop? Bishop does NOTHING. Security reads Dean's fear, closes on Bishop even as Dean himself starts to BACK AWAY, separating himself from his own security, now turning to RUN... ... Straight into Steve, gun raised. A small moment frozen in time as Dean understands his end... BANG BANG! - BANG! Steve double-taps Dean in the chest, then one to head. And CHAOS begins its rule. Security which were closing on Bishop now REVERSE, draw weapons and FIRE at Steve who drops down in the small cement crease between stairs and statues. ON STEVE. Ducked low, bullet shattering granite and marble around him, LAUGHING. The first glimpse of something WRONG inside this young man. \nACROSS THE STEPS Bishop, for the moment forgotten by the security who have reversed to deal with Steve, suddenly ANIMATES. Perfect timing, the security REVERSING again as Bishop draws his gun and FIRES, over and over, clipping officers and security in the legs as he SPRINTS down the steps towards... \nINT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nBishop lands inside the limo, pulls the door shut as bullets \"thunk\" into armored sides and spider bullet-proof glass. The DRIVER looks back through the opening, surprised, just in time for Bishop to grab him by the collar and HAUL him into the back at the same time slipping through the opening and sliding into the driver's position. As he slams the shifter into REVERSE men line up in front, OPEN UP with weapons. \nEXT. DC STREET - CONTINUOUS \nWHEELS SMOKE, Limo ACCELERATES backwards, angling UP THE STEPS. Security DIVE ASIDE as the Limo clears the rail, comes down HARD just across from the small alcove Steve's pressed into. The passenger door opens. \nBISHOP Get in. Security are standing up, opening up, as Steve DIVES forward. \nINT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nSteve lands awkward in the front seat as Bishop throws the limo into drive, floors it DOWN the steps of the building, men diving aside, swerving onto the street. \nSTEVE Thanks. \nBISHOP Behind you. Steve has half a second to puzzle this one as the Driver grabs him from behind, HAULS him backwards. Bishop eyes his mirrors, counting the number of vehicles pursuing. Eyes makes calculations, gets distracted for a moment from the RAGING FISTFIGHT between Steve and the Driver occurring in the rear compartment. \nBishop raises the divider, steps on the gas. \nEXT. DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nEngine WHINES, Limo surges forward, pursuit cars dropping off. There are no turns, no spins. This is straight-line acceleration circa FRENCH CONNECTION. Bishop guides the limo faster and faster, blasting across intersections, timing his spacing to inches, no margin for error. Around him, pursuit cars aren't as good, they VEER off into crashes, clip traffic, SPIN out of control. \nINT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nIn front of Bishop, intersection after intersection of cross- cutting traffic. Bishop speeds up or slows just a fraction, making space for the limo, BARELY. He notices a hand-held automatic weapon secured to the dash, grabs it, checks his mirrors. IN THE REARVIEW: Bishop watches a pursuit car T-BONED by a truck, then his view is blocked by STEVE and the DRIVER as they wrestle and fight. Over his initial surprise, the Driver's trained, and good. He locks Steve up, SLAMS him against the window, choking him. UP AHEAD. Bishop sees a traffic jam LOOMING ahead, the limo closing at 100 mph, no alternatives. He lowers the divider. \nBISHOP Get in front. \nSTEVE Working on that... \nSTEVE AND BISHOP Almost at the same exact moment, the men switch their aim back to each other. Both men, controlling emotion and body. Gasping for breath, bleeding. \nBISHOP ...Why? \nSTEVE You don't know? Tense beat. Glimpsed through shattered windows, SWAT arrives, takes the perimeter. They're being surrounded. Suddenly an SUV pulls into view between the restaurant and the SWAT and Police position, a confused and frightened WOMAN at the wheel. Police SHOUT at her, confusing her more. Steve makes a decision. Lowers his weapon, grabs a napkin, ties it to hide his features. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Cover me. And with that Steve is RUNNING towards the outside... \n... BEHIND STEVE, Bishop steps out, gun in each hand. Clean shot of Steve's back. He opens up. Bullets tracing around Steve, pushing the men back just long enough for Steve to reach the SUV, haul open the door. \nINT. SUV - CONTINUOUS \nThe WOMAN screams as Steve pushes her aside, takes the wheel. She scratches back, one hand ripping the bandana away from Steve's face. He STARES at her for one deadly second. \nINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS \nBishop FLINCHES as the sound of the SHOT come from the SUV. The passenger door opens and the woman climbs out as the SUV ACCELERATES away, cops and SWAT firing after it. BISHOP'S P.O.V.: The woman watches her car go, then turns and sits on the pavement. Her hand moves to her chest, comes away bloody. ON BISHOP. Angry like we've never seen him. Cold. Furious. The stupid waste of it all. He meets the woman's gaze. She dies looking at him. Helicopters clatter above, bullets plink into dishware and hardwood. Bishop just stares at the woman for a long beat, then he turns away, back into the building. It is... over. \nEXT. DC STREETS - DAY (LATER) \nSWAT approaches the SUV, slammed against another car. Shielded men throw the door open. It's empty. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY (LATER) \nSWAT move into the restaurant Bishop was last seen in. Guns lined, checking corners. But there's no sign of Bishop. \nINT. DC FLAT - AFTERNOON \nBishop enters the flat. Cool afternoon breeze blows through curtains. He stops, stares at the couple who owned the flat who now lie motionless. Small holes in the red-stained pillowcases over their heads. Steve has been here. Bishop swallows, angry. He forces himself back to the task at hand. Breaking down the never-fired weapon. He works efficiently, silently. \nINT. AIRPORT - EVENING \nBishop sits at the gate, waiting to board his plane. He watches families get ready, college kids laughing. On the silent TVs, CNN shows footage of the aftermath of the gunfight in the street. \"Eight dead.\" A US Attorney speaking at a press conference. \nUS ATTORNEY ...Something is wrong in this country. But today because of the actions of a few cowardly men, we may never know the true face of -- A voice announces boarding, drowning out the TV. Bishop collects his things. \nINT. LOCAL GROCERY - NIGHT \nGrocer glances at Bishop's two grocery bags, then to the clock: 7:10. Sophie reads her book with her doll. A CAR speeds by outside. Sophie tracks it, looks at her father. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nKey in the lock, Bishop enters, stands in his living room. TENSE. WAITING. Nothing. \nINT. BISHOP'S GYM - NIGHT \nBishop stands in front of his machines, still. Reaches out, touches one. Waiting. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME- NIGHT \nBishop sits across from the portrait of himself, finishes the last bite of his dinner. He takes the plate, walks into the kitchen and to the sink, washes the plate... His cat curls around his legs, purrs. Bishop takes a scrap off the plate, bends down and feeds it to her. She starts to eat, then her EYES NARROW... WHAM! Steve hits him from out of nowhere. Bishop sprawls as Steve LOOMS, gun lined! WHAM! Bishop hits Steve with the fridge door, knocks the gun out of his hands, it skitters along the floor. Bishop moves towards it, Steve swings a knife. Bishop catches the blow, but Steve HAULS down on the bad shoulder. Bishop SCREAMS as something gives, stumbles back as Steve swings again, Bishop turning, catching the blade in his shoulder. \nBishop reels back against the wall as Steve picks up the gun and BANG! BANG! BANG! Fires as Bishop flees the room. Steve follows, keeping his shots controlled. Slugs chew into walls, furniture as Bishop dives out the front door. Steve advances, re-loading. \nSTEVE You know, when they came to me... I said \"Are you sure?\" Bishop?\" But They're right, aren't they? \nEXT. BISHOP'S HOME - CONTINUOUS \nSteve steps out onto the porch. \nSTEVE ...You don't really like the work anymore. Bishop's voice comes from the darkness near the barn. \n", "test1_input": "BISHOP (CONT'D) You got what you came for, congratulations. You're done Go back to your friends, your women, your whole beautiful life. \n(POINTING) That used to be my front door. Try to close it on the way out. Bishop starts to go. Steve's words stop him. \nSTEVE Bishop. Those things... they don't mean anything to me. This, makes sense. I don't know why. But I think I was meant to do this. \n(BEAT) And like you said, you could use someone. Bishop studies Steve a long beat. Shakes his head, goes into his study. Steve follows. \nINT. STUDY - NIGHT \nBishop fires up the computer hooked to the printer. He glances over. Steve is standing in the doorway. Bishop tosses Steve the jump-drive. Steve studies it, slots it into the computer. Almost instantly, the phone rings. Bishop punches on SPEAKER. The same silence. \nBISHOP We should all be so lucky. The phone goes dead. The light on the drive turns GREEN. Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages... ON BISHOP and STEVE. Watching the pages feed out. PHOTOS: A new Mark at an elegant gathering of powerful men and women. Tall, powerful, entitled. His arm around a Turkish beauty in an elegant black one-piece. Emerging from a limousine at a large public event. Security EVERYWHERE. The same beauty on his arm. Charts. Height, weight, medical history. Bank accounts, figures. Leases, deeds of property. A LAST PHOTO: Peeling out of the printer... THE WOMAN, the beauty, in a diplomatic power-suit. \nA second to realize: She's the mark. More pictures, we've seen this woman on television recently. ON BISHOP AND STEVE, reacting. Then Bishop gestures towards the large empty wall, waiting. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) You get started. I'll make coffee. \nSTEVE Bishop... Nemesis. Devine Retribution. ...What did she do? Beat. Unsaid questions asked, unanswered. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Okay. Okay. Forget I asked. \nEXT. EMBASSY - DAY \nSeen through 30x telescope. The images MAGNIFIED, FLAT. The view unstable, moving. Just the low SOUND OF WIND. Panning over upper-floor windows, hesitating on a pair of armed security, making their rounds. Camera \"clicks\" then move on. Finds the ENTRANCE. A line of people moving through a metal detector. One young man in particular... \nEXT. ENTRANCE, EMBASSY - DAY \nSteve collects his cell phone from the other side of a metal detector, slots a bluetooth and heads in. Bishop's voice fills his ears. \nBISHOP (O.S.) Slow down as soon as you get inside. Security station will be to your left... Steve passes through a door, pauses as two guards talk in the open doorway to a security control room. Monitors visible. \nBISHOP (O.S.) (CONT'D) How many views? \nSTEVE (eyes moving fast) Sixteen, no, eighteen. Four second intervals. One of the men notices Steve who starts forward to ask a question. The man points him down the hallway towards the consulat's reception. Steve's eyes track monitors. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Make that four and a half seconds. \nINT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS \nBishop is sighting through a camera affixed to the telescope, headphones on. He's on the 14th floor of a skyscraper under construction. Cement pillars and steel-work. \nSTEVE (O.S.) These guys are packing Israeli-made Uzis. Couple are actual military. Bishop takes in the other buildings across the street, then moves his sight up the embassy, adjusts a control P.O.V. - THROUGH THE SCOPE: Large tinted glass windows suddenly turn transparent. Bishop scans, find The Mark's HUSBAND on the bed watching TV, bored. He scans again... finds The Mark in the adjoining room, on the phone and ANGRY. Bishop touches a switch on the telescope and a small LASER projects. The woman's voice fills Bishop's headset: \nTURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE No, we're literally locked in here. I'm supposed to be presenting at the UN but I can't do that if everyone is going to panic about security... \nINT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS \nBishop's scope zoomed in TIGHT on the Mark, staring at herself in the bathroom mirror. She's brave. \nTURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE ...This is America. People don't just kill people here. Then she shuts the door. Bishop moves his focus upwards to a glassed-in terreriam-like structure on the rooftop. An indoor swimming pool. \"Click.\" \"Click.\" More pictures. \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING \nThe SAME pictures, now tacked up. MOVING over the wall. Meticulous study, days of work: BLUEPRINTS of the building. Service corridors highlighted, surveillance cameras marked, pictures tacked to locations. Magazine and newspaper clippings about the Mark, showcasing her beauty. \nHeadlines: \"The new (and beautiful) face of Turkey.\" \"The face that said \"no\" to America.\" Other materials: Doctor's reports. Time-tables, intervals circled, holes noted. Steve and Bishop studying everything. Bishop, almost trance- like. Steve pacing. \nBISHOP Work it again. \nSTEVE She never leaves. It's like they know we're coming. \n", "test1_true": "STEVE Falls off the rooftop. \nBISHOP Falls or jumps? Steve moves to the wall of pictures, his gaze lingering on shots of her on vacation is a swimsuit. \nSTEVE \n(SMILING) I tell you one thing, killing her is not the first thing that jumps to mind... what? Bishop HEARS this, frowns, moves forward. His eyes scan: The Mark at the pool, getting ready to swim. The security... \nBISHOP Nothing. I'm going for a run. You wanna come? \nSTEVE Let me ask you something. You ever not feel like running 5 miles? \nEXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER \nBishops sprints/runs through the woods around his house. Body pushed to limit. In his eyes, his mind somewhere far- off, working... \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING \nSteve, alone in Bishop's home. He moves from room to room. He hits the kitchen, looks in the fridge, makes a face at the empty shelves, the bottles of supplements. He moves on, pauses to stare at the gas fireplace in the study... moves on towards Bishop's bedroom, takes in the king bed. Runs a finger across the headboard, dusty. He STARES at the large painting across from the bed... \nBISHOP (O.S.) You like it? Steve REACTS. Didn't hear Bishop come in. \nSTEVE I don't know. Feels disturbed. \nBISHOP Always made me feel... understood. \n(BEAT) Come on. \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nSteve follows Bishop to the wall of research on the female mark. Bishop points to some OLD RESEARCH on the Mark, glamorous. She was a model. \nBISHOP The Mark is a beautiful woman. Before arriving at her current position, she enjoyed the way men looked at her. That's gone now. She needs to be taken seriously. She hates that men only see the beauty. Magazines, heads of state, all focusing how what a piece of tail she was. Like you did. Steve SQUINTS... Bishop slaps a picture of the pool, the Mark swimming. Two SECURITY AGENTS positioned. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Why is he standing here? Wouldn't he get better coverage... here? \nSTEVE ...He can't see her. \nBISHOP He can't see her. Neither of them can. Beat. PHONE RINGS. Bishop snaps it up. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Bishop. \nDEAN (O.S.) Hey, Bishop. Catch you at a bad time? Bishop doesn't respond. Waits... \nDEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Always the conversationalist. Anyway, just calling to say we'd like you to go ahead with this one. As soon as you can. Click. Phone goes dead. Bishop hangs it up. Steve looks at him, anticipating... Bishop nods. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DUSK \nNice downtown joint. Businesspeople dine. Second-story tinted glass looking out over downtown. TRACKING over faces, laughing, drinking, relieved to be done for the week... Finding Bishop, sitting alone, watching the people. The flirtations, the animosities... He looks down at the street below where a UPS driver has exited the building. Steve breaks the frame, sits down across from Bishop. \nBISHOP Run it again. \nSTEVE Patrol number three moves down the service corridor at 18:50. Five minute window after to make it up top. Three minute climb to position. That's 18:54. Three minute window to engage. Shake, stir, add lime and enjoy. Bishop smiles, looks away. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) How'd you get into it? Bishop looks back, surprised. Checks his watch. \nBISHOP ...This business, it's not like there's a degree you can go get. It's like most trades, it gets passed down. \n(BEAT) \n", "test1_id": 2427, "test2_input": "Bishop weaves his way into an alley to piss. Relieves himself on a wall. Done, he zips up, turns... WHAM! One of the Ex-Cons catches him across the face with a punch. Bishop reels back against the wall. \nBISHOP ...More. WHAM! WHAM! Bishop takes the punches, no defense. Face punished. The guy backs off, slightly winded. \nEX CON Dude, you don't want any more, give us that money. Bishop shakes his head. WHAM! WHAM! Two more hits to the body. Bishop just keeps taking the punishment. Seems to relish it. Spits blood. \nBISHOP Look, I'll give you my money, but you have to promise me you won't spend it all on lipstick and tampons. Ex Con #2 pulls a gun, puts it to Bishop's head. \nEX CON #2 You wanna die right here, motherfucker? Bishop raises his eyes to the man. Not so drunk after all. \nBISHOP ...Thank you. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nBishop sits at his dining room table, staring straight ahead. His face is cut, his flesh swollen. He STARES. If paranoia and loneliness had a face, this is it. REVERSE to find the Artist's portrait of him, hung on the wall across, a surreal and distorted mirror. He chews his food steady, even, acutely aware he's being watched. We LINGER on the small camera eye tucked in the high corner of the room, staring down... \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nSteve sits half-naked in the office chair, the high-tech wall illuminated in front of him. In the bed in the other room, the two women are asleep, nude, draped over each other. Steve watches Bishop leave his table. He hits a control and the image SHIFTS, picks up Bishop checking his mail, grabbing a baseball cap from a rack as Bishop moves to his den, settles into a chair facing the television. Can't see his face, just the back of the cap on his head, the tv screen, set to white static. He touches a key and the IMAGE ZOOMS IN on Bishop, moving slightly... \nLOUISE (O.S.) \n(SLEEPY) Steve...? Where are you, baby? \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nThe TV purrs static, white flickering light fills the room. We SLOWLY TURN, reversing, to find: The baseball cap, held up at the top of the chair by a pillow. No sign of Bishop. \nEXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT \nBishop moves through shadows. He knows the positions of the cameras, avoids them, heads towards his BARN. \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nBishop enters, turns on lights. He threads his way through his collection of beautiful automobiles until he reaches the far wall. He ROLLS up a large steel door... ... revealing a wall, COVERED with his research on Steve. Lots of it, weeks of work. He moves forward to a paper that lists stats about Steve that includes a blank space for \"Occupation:\" Bishop fills it in: \"Mechanic.\" \nSuddenly LIGHTS wash across the space. Bishop glances out: A VAN is making it's way up the drive. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nThe wall-sized monitor glows Steve's face as he watches the DHL driver get out, makes his way to the door, knock... Steve's eyes flick to what he can see of Bishop, asleep in the chair. No movement... Steve LEANS FORWARD, interested. The DHL Driver knocks again, rings the bell. Still no motion... and then Bishop RISES from the chair, makes his way to the door. Steve watches Bishop signing, closing the door and moving into his living room where he opens the package, considers the small jump-drive that slides into his hands. ON STEVE. Watching. \nINT. BISHOP'S STUDY - MORNING \nCLOSE on Bishop's weighted RP turntable. The needle coming down... touching spinning vinyl. Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" croons out. ON BISHOP, tacking up pages, photographs, financials. We don't get a clear look, but some pages are redacted, there's government letterhead. Personnel files, budgets, itineraries. Many stamped \"CLASSIFIED.\" Bishop draws lines, connections. Tosses some pages down, pins others higher. Working it. He backs off, stares through us. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOME - MORNING \nSteve pushes in, looks around, tracks towards the study. \nSTEVE Hello? Bishop? He enters the study, sees the WALL, the night's work. In the center, a photograph of Dean, Bishop's boss. \nBISHOP (O.S.) There you are. Bishop is leaning in from outside. Nods to Steve. \nSTEVE So who is he? \nBISHOP ...US Government. NSA. Very well protected. \nSTEVE What happened to you? \nBISHOP You should see the other guy. Bishop TOSSES Steve an object, goes back outside. Steve looks at it. A WELDER'S helmet with visor. \n", "test2_true": "Steve comes out to find Bishop working intently on a chemical project. He's pouring a black plastic-like substance into a shallow mold creating a Quarter-sized object. EXTREME CARE. \nSTEVE What's that? \nBISHOP This... is liquid Semtex with a built in combustible. Very volatile. Nice and shiny once it dries. But don't... scratch it. Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the coin-sized disc, then backs off, by Steve, back into \nINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nSTEVE So that's how we take him out? \nBISHOP (shaking his head) No. That's just to focus the mind. \nSTEVE You makes bombs to focus your mind. \nBISHOP What do you do? (beat, off the Wall) This one's different. They want it fast, and they don't want it to look like an accident. Someone wants to send a message. \nSTEVE Like with my father. \nBISHOP Yes. Like that. \nSTEVE Didn't think that was your style. \nBISHOP \n(BEAT) First time for everything. Steve looks at Bishop. BOOM! Outside the explosion CONCUSSES against the house. A window CRACKS. Steve crouches, hands covering his head. \nSTEVE Jesus... Bishop puts a hand out. \nBISHOP There's something I haven't told you. \nSTEVE What? \nBISHOP ...I broke a rule. I brought you in without asking. So this hit, is a test. Of us, of our arrangement. (beat, off Dean's picture) If that man is breathing three days from now... then they'll need to make an example of us. Do you understand? Steve ... nods. Takes Bishop's hand who pulls him up. \nSTEVE So what you're saying is you and I are stuck with each other. \nBISHOP I'm sorry. \nSTEVE ...For what? \nBISHOP For getting you into this -- \nSTEVE I knew what I was doing. Bishop considers, nods. \nBISHOP Get packed. \nINT. TENEMENT - DAY \nSteve and Bishop push in, backpacks on. Trash, bad lighting, sad people in dirty hallways. They start up a long flight of stairs. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, TENEMENT - DAY \nSteve and Bishop push out onto this dilapidated rooftop, Washington DC spread out around them. They unpack gear from the backpacks. Tripod, camera and telescope are quickly assembled. Bishop steps back, lets Steve take the first look. Bishop takes notes. \nSTEVE ...I count six... no seven at the main door. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: The front entrance of the NSA building. The security check Bishop went through. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Jesus they've got US Marines in there. Two at the door, one... maybe another two out of sight. Bishop considers Steve, locked to the telescope, the sharp point of the pen in his hand... \nBISHOP (O.S.) Fifth floor, corner office. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Steve finds Dean, at his desk, talking on the phone. Animated. \n", "test2_id": 2428, "test3_input": "STEVE ... Alright, got him. He's at his desk. We could take the shot right from here. \nBISHOP Glass is three inches thick... Steve moves his hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before to listen with... \nBISHOP (CONT'D) And has laser sensors. \nSteve laughs, suddenly walks away from the telescope. Bishop goes to it, takes up the watch. \nSTEVE Alright, fine. What are we doing here? Who is this guy? P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean shouts into the phone, slams it down. Leaves his office. Bishop pulls away from the telescope, hunkers down to wait. \nBISHOP Starting to get it? \nSTEVE Yeah, I'm getting that this isn't a job. It's just a really complicated... suicide. Bishop smiles. Steve moves off, restless. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, TENEMENT - NIGHT \nWhole day has passed. Bishop hasn't moved, stares across at the NSA building, the corner office. Steve sits nearby. \nSTEVE You know, you can front sonofabitch all you want, Bishop. You're scared, too. You don't really know how we're going to pull it off, do you? You ever think there's some things that just can't be done? \nBISHOP Everyone has a death -- \nSTEVE Really? Because, this guy? I look at this guy, I don't see his death. I see my death. And I don't particularly like the view. Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean's office, returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean back at his desk. He looks exhausted. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) And you know, as much as I like the quality time, unless you can read lips, I don't exactly see what we're doing here... \nSteve glances at Bishop's pad where he's transcribing words: \"No, no, tomorrow. I'm sick of this, this is my life we're taking about. You're bringing me in. Give me a time and a place...\" \nSTEVE (CONT'D) You read lips. Bishop glances at Steve, puts his eye back to the camera. P.O.V. THROUGH THE LENS: EXTREME CLOSE on Dean's desk. A piece of paper on the blotter. \"Click.\" \"Click.\" Bishop pulls the memory-card from the camera. \nBISHOP \n(INNOCENTLY) You any good with computers? \nINT. BISHOP'S BARN - DAY \nBishop is working on his classic Mustang. He's got the steering column apart, working the mechanism. Focused. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nSteve is in front of the electronic wall of info on Bishop. His hospital report open. In a separate window, video feed of the real Bishop in his barn working on his car. Steve marks the injury on Bishop, then opens a new window. Multiple images of the scrap of paper on Dean's desk. Steve gets to work enlarging, rotating, skewing the images... Music and LAUGHTER filter in from outside. Steve becomes aware of the noise from outside, frowns. \nEXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER \nSteve emerges onto the high balcony overlooking the never- ending party. He raises a GUN and fires into the air. Faces, startled look up at him. \nSTEVE Everybody out. I'm serious. Get the fuck off my property. A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in hand, moves towards Steve, confused. \nLOUISE Steve, baby...? \nSteve levels the gun at her. \nSTEVE You, too. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nSteve comes back into his office, facing the wall. He tosses the gun on the table, gets back to work. Glances at one of the other open windows that shows Bishop at his fridge, pouring himself filtered water. Steve's hands fly. The images are pieced together, enlarged, skewed until nonsensical markings resolve into an address. Steve punches it into a search window, waits a beat, then eyes scan over the list of returns, lock onto something. He picks up the phone, punches a number. Watches as Bishop's phone rings, watches Bishop answer it. \nBISHOP (O.S.) Did you get it? \nSTEVE It's the US Attorney's office in New York. He's running. He's trying to get out. Steve, trying to read Bishop's face, ZOOMING in. \n", "test3_true": "BISHOP (O.S.) Does it make a difference? \nSTEVE ...No, I don't suppose it does. A beat. The two men, far separated. \nBISHOP (O.S.) Do the angles. Find us a shot. \nEXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING \nSteve and Bishop step out of the airport with bags, hail a taxi and climb in, headed into DC. \nSTEVE (V.O.) Security's going to have the actual street locked down. But there's a residential street, perpendicular. \nEXT. DC STREETS - MORNING \nUpscale streets lined with brownstone walk-ups. Steve and Bishop walk with roller bags and a shoulder tube past mothers and Nanny's ushering their children to school. \nSTEVE (V.O.) High-end people. They'll put up with a sweep, but they're not going to allow an agent to spend the day. They reach an address. Bishop puts on a hat, some sunglasses, slaps a badge onto his jacket that reads \"DC Municipal Utilities.\" He trots up the the half-flight, rings the bell of an elegant brownstone. \nINT. DC FLAT - MORNING \nNice. Lace curtains. Classic living room. Magazine racks, grand piano, original art. \nSTEVE Besides, the angle isn't right, too flat. Except when they hit the stairs. It'll spread the group vertically. It's... the shot. Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each opens their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal. From a clock, a firing mechanism. From the tube, an aluminum barrel holds a fishing rod. The rod is discarded, the barrel is attached to a hard plastic stock. AA Batteries are opened and slender shells are removed from each. As this strange choreography continues in silence, we PAN ACROSS to the dining room where a WOMAN and a MAN are bound and tied, pillowcases cinched over their heads. Their bindings allow them to hold each other's hands which they do, tight. They're terrified, but okay. Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the home-made rifle, a telescope, lifted from a child's gift box, snaps it on top of the rifle. \nINT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - DAY \nDean squints in the back of his limo as it pulls into daylight. He's on the phone, eyes darting, nervous. \nDEAN (O.S.) Look, I don't care. Find her, I need to talk to her right now... \nINT. DC FLAT - DAY \nBishop puts the rifle to his shoulder, sights. Behind him, Steve slips a blade from the crease of his suitcase, considers it, looks back to Bishop. \nSTEVE You ever worry about the right and wrong of it all? I'm not talking about God, just... (tapping his chest) Whatever you feel here. BISHOP'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE: The US Attorney building. The security detail. The steps leading to the street. \nBISHOP It's a little late for -- \nSTEVE Come on. You're telling me you've never done anything just because it was the right thing to do, even if it didn't make any sense? You never took a chance like that? Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch. \nBISHOP Once I did... \nSTEVE How'd that work out for you? Beat. Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large truck, which has stopped trying to make the turn. \nBISHOP We have a problem... Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives. Nothing. He sets the rifle down, thinking as Steve takes in the new situation. \nSTEVE There's no shot. What do we do? There's no shot. \nA moment more, and then Bishop MOVES. We travel with him, to the entryway. Keys, hats, jackets, sunglasses. Bishop grabs a hat, tosses one to Steve. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Bishop...? And Bishop's out. \nEXT. US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe TRUCK, wedged in. The security detail, suspicious of the truck. COPS get involved. Men speak into radios. \nEXT. DC BROWNSTONE - AFTERNOON \nMOVING with Bishop, Steve following. Hats and sunglasses. They descend the steps onto the sidewalk, closing on the US Attorney building ahead. Steve comes abreast of him as they move down the street. \n", "test3_id": 2429}

The nature of the work is that some people know who you are and what you do. \n(BEAT) A man told his girlfriend, to impress her. The girlfriend told some people she owned money to... Bishop finishes his glass of water. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) I was young. It took me four months to find the people, another to find the girl, and she gave me the Man. That's how I... \"got into it.\" \nSTEVE You ever wish you just... walked away? Let it go? \nBISHOP Sure. Every day. But I wasn't wired that way. \n(BEAT) What about you? Beat. Steve and Bishop, oddly locked... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three SMALL EXPLOSIONS in the kitchen. FLAMES shoot out of the galley. A cook stumbles out, on fire. A waiter douses him with water. People SCREAM! Alarms BLARE! Steve and Bishop. They haven't moved a muscle. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Here we go... And they're MOVING. \nINT. SECURITY STATION, EMBASSY - EVENING \nSECURITY takes a call as another man studies his monitor: People fleeing the building across the street, smoke. \nSECURITY Fire in the restaurant. (into radio, Turkish) Patrols two and five, we're closing down the front entrance. \nINT. SUITE, EMBASSY - EVENING \nThe MARK stands at her closet, starting to unbutton her shirt to change for her swim. She pulls it closed as one of her security knocks and pushes into the room from a balcony. \nSECURITY PRO Excuse me, 'mam. There's a fire next door, nothing to worry about. The Mark nods. The man locks the door behind him, crosses the room, leaves through the main door, professional. \nINT. STAIRWELL - EVENING \nSteve and Bishop push UPWARDS through a stream of people flooding DOWN the emergency stairs. They reach a heavy door, locked and alarmed. Beat. Three people burst out from the inside. Steve catches the door and they're through... \nINT. LAW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nA few LAWYERS and a SECRETARY still collecting their things look up as Bishop and Steve push in, holding up badges. \nSTEVE Hey! You need to get out! Whole building is going up! Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave. They move down five doors, push into... \nINT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nA private office. Desk, computer, a handwritten note reads \"Leave mail here, will be back Wednesday.\" A box from UPS which Bishop TEARS open. Inside, what looks like a large WEAPON. Steve goes to the windows, pushes them open. P.O.V. - THE EMBASSY ACROSS: Changing its security pattern. Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors. Below, the excess manpower is channeled to the front. Bishop turns, FIRES OUT THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across, SINKS into the wall of the embassy 30 feet away. Bishop HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the box. Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it. He crosses the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he returns, Bishop's already secured the cable outside. \nBISHOP Ready? \nSteve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under their clothing. He steps out onto the ledge with Bishop, closes the window behind him. Bishop lets himself fall backwards. \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nFlashing light of the fire trucks. No one sees the two figures sliding silently from building to building above, disappearing over a 4th story railing. \nEXT. BALCONY, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nSteve lands next to Bishop who unfastens the cord they used to cross, spools it back to them. A look. No way back now, and no trace left behind. Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy Security. A quick lock pick, and they slip inside. \nINT. ROOF LEVEL, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nElevator doors open and the Mark gets out. She nods to the guard on duty, heads into a changing room. \nINT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nTwo guards monitor screens: Corridors, rooms, entrances and exits. Pairs of guards make their rounds. CLOSING IN ON ONE PAIR. Something about them... The guard squints just as the image CHANGES, showing another part of the embassy. The guard hits a toggle, returns the previous image... But Bishop and Steve are gone. \n", "test1_true": "The Mark pulls the straps of her swimsuit up over her shoulders. Stares in a mirror as she tucks strands of hair under a swim cap. \nINT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT \nQuiet, lit from overhead by large halogen lights hanging from the hanger-like beam structure. Dark shadows in the corners. The low sound of water lapping, light reflecting off the water, moving over walls. \nThe Mark enters, and hangs up her robe. She goes to the edge of the pool, looks down into the water, then glances up at the GUARD who's stationed across the space. He nods back to her, moves to the lower space, giving her a little privacy. \nEXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT \nA second guard looks in, rudely checks out the Mark as she DIVES into the water and out of sight. He shrugs, looks back out at the roof, lifting a cigarette to light... pauses. ACROSS THE ROOF, an access door is open. \nINT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT \nThe Mark swims, hard. Cutting through the water. She reaches the far wall and kick-turns against it. UNDERWATER. Her body passing above us. Silhouetted by the strong halogen lights above her. ONLY THE THROBBING SILENCE \nOF UNDERWATER. ACROSS THE SPACE. The indoor guard checks in on his radio. Looks up as the DOOR nearest him swings open. He rises, approaches the door, curious. Looks out. HIS P.O.V.: The rooftop, lit by security lights, the strobing of the firetrucks below. Dark shadows. He hears a RUSTLING, a BANGING. Torn, he glances backwards. Can't see the Mark in the pool from here, but can hear her strokes. \nWITH THE MARK She kicks hard, dives under... And we're in her P.O.V. The far wall approaching, then we REVOLVE as she turns, now looking UP at the surface as she backstrokes to the surface, BREAKING THE SURFACE, now swimming face up to the bright lights hanging from the girdered ceiling. \nEXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT \nThe second Guard tests the door. Seems fine. Takes out his flashlight and plays it over the roof. Sees nothing. We REVERSE to find Steve there, tucked away, just out of sight. \nACROSS THE ROOF The first guard reaches the source of the noise: A plastic bag, caught in a revolving air vent. He pulls it free. \nINT. INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS \nWith the Mark, coming out of another turn, still backstroke, looking up. She makes it half way across the pool... pauses. She slows... floating, staring upwards into the light. HER P.O.V. The lights. But it's like she senses something beyond them, puts a hand up to shield her eyes... \nAND BISHOP DROPS FROM THE CEILING, FREE-FALL, COMING STRAIGHT \nDOWN AT HER!!!! She opens her mouth to scream... WHUUMPH! He goes in, taking her with him underwater, his momentum carrying them both several feet under. She TWISTS in his arms, fighting. Screaming, bubbles FLOWING from her mouth! ABOVE THE SURFACE. It's silent. No sign of the violent struggle going on below the surface. ACROSS THE ROOM. Guard number one returns, glances up towards the pool. Doesn't hear anything. He sits back in his chair. UNDERWATER. The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in it's inevitable conclusion. The Mark writhes and jerks but Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her away from the surface. Finally, the fight goes out of her. She goes limp in his arms. He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her go, rising slowly to the surface. AT THE SURFACE. Bishop just breaks, breathing in, silent. He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his post. ACROSS THE ROOM. The guard glances back towards the pool, hasn't heard anything for a little bit... BAM! BAM! BAM! A new noise from outside gets his attention again. He heads out, hand on his sidearm... \nEXT. POOL STRUCTURE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nThe guard approaches the same door Guard #2 already checked, banging in the wind. Open again. He starts to move towards it when a FIGURE looms, he almost draws his weapon, breathes relief when he makes Guard #2. \nGUARD #2 (TURKISH) It's the second time it's come open. She still swimming? \nINT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT \nThe two Guards come into the pool area. On the far wall, the shower is running, a towel has fallen over the drain and the water is flowing down and into the pool. One of the men steps forward, concerned... \nGUARD #2 (TURKISH) Oh hell... The Mark floats face-up in the pool, just under the surface. \nINT. CHANGING ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT \nBishop has already shed his wet clothing, pulls on dry clothes as Steve comes into the room. They barely acknowledge each other, business. Bishop stuffs the wet clothes in a bag, dumps it into a LAUNDRY chute. \nSTEVE How did it go -- \nBISHOP Not yet. As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES. Excited voices come on over an embassy wide PA System. VOICES from the next room. Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick, puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and DROPS. ACROSS THE ROOM. The door to the dressing room opens, armed guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on radios. The room is empty. \nINT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS \nTight, PITCH BLACK except for the eerie glow coming from the glowsticks Bishop and Steve have in their teeth. They slide FAST, the sides of the tube RUSHING up at them. And then suddenly a dim LIGHT at the bottom, rising fast... \nINT. SERVICE ROOM, EMABASSY - CONTINUOUS \n", "test1_id": 2427, "test2_input": "MODEL God, I love those. Which ones -- \nBISHOP Mr. KcKenna has a creative relationship with the truth. I don't actually... The model glances around, unsure... \nMODEL Oh, okay. That's funny. So what do you do? \nSTEVE Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do? Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down. BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Come on, Mr. Bishop. We're all waiting. Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then Bishop is up and moving through the crowd, pushing by people LAUGHING, DANCING. He almost runs into a bright blue-haired woman on the arm of a jockish RAPPER. \nBISHOP Excuse me... He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the Woman. She's utterly different than we've seen her. Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick, bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Hi. \nWOMAN Hi... This is strange. The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High- fives all around. He glances around for his date... \nBISHOP Is he your...? \nWOMAN No, just a job. (off his nod) I have to... \nBISHOP I know. Go on. She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES... ... and suddenly she's back with him. No words. Lights and sound and dance around them. She leans forward, kisses Bishop once. Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse. Bishop... staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve's voice fills the outdoor space, amplified. \nSTEVE Ladies and gentlemen! The man of the hour! A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes space for him. Steve's near the DJ, speaking on a mic. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) I know that not many of you know my friend. My good, dear... friend. I mean, he's a man of few words... And he's an art lover! Did you know that? His home is covered with work. It's amazing, what you can find in there. Amazing. A weird beat. Steve, smiling fierce. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Happy birthday, Arthur. Behind Steve, a covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls the cover off a PORTRAIT of Bishop, clearly done by the Artist he collects. The image is twisted, vivid, disturbing. As the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE the ARTIST himself now comes forward, Steve's arm around his shoulder and bumping fists before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop's hand. Faces BEAM. People CLAP. On Bishop, just looking at Steve who stares back... unreadable. \nEXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nBishop bangs out a door into the front drive, makes it to his car, fumbles for his keys. Sweating, off-kilter. \nSTEVE (O.S.) Hey, you forgot something. Steve's there, holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it. \nBISHOP Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm just not used to -- \nSTEVE No worries, man. It's your party. You can leave it. \n(BEAT) It's true, isn't it? What you said to me the first time we met. \nBISHOP What's that? \nSTEVE This thing we do. Finally, you always do it alone. Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces himself to stop. \nBISHOP Steve... thank you. \nSTEVE Uh-oh. I can feel some male bonding coming. We gonna hug it out, Bishop? \nBISHOP No, I'm serious. Thank you. People don't... Anyway, it's been a long time, since someone did something for me. Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark. \nSTEVE Happy Birthday, Arthur. Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink, and he turns and is gone, back to the party. Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away. \nINT. BISHOP'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nBishop drives the car out of McKenna's estate, pulls out onto the street. He starts to accelerate away... then STOPS the car in the middle of the street. ON BISHOP. Fighting what his guts are screaming at him. Losing it, POUNDING on the steering wheel. Suddenly still... \nEXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nParty rages on, oblivious to the absence of its recipient. Suddenly faces turn UPWARDS... to where Steve is looking down on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool. \nSTEVE \n", "test2_true": "STEVE (CONT'D) I despise each and every one of you! MORE SHOUTS, LAUGHTER. Steve LEAPS out into space. Perfect huge swam dive... falling... HITTING the water. A moment of silence... did he? Was that deep enough...? Steve ERUPTS out of the water. Party ROARS back into life. \nEXT. GROUNDS, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nHigh above the festivities. Bishop slips over the wall, makes his way down towards the estate. \nINT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER \nDark and empty in here, party raging outside. Bishop enters Steve's bedroom. Messy, the bed unmade. A woman's underthings lying on the floor. Bishop surveys the room, checks drawers, peers down into the party below. He can see Steve in the middle of it all, Louise on his arm, his hand on her ass. Bishop moves to the office door, locked. He slides a pick- set out of his pocket, gets to work. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nThe door lock \"clicks\" and Bishop enters, closes the door after himself and locks it, turns around... The room has been STRIPPED of everything that was in here last time. GONE are the paintings, the portraits, the mementos. All traces of Harry McKenna, removed. Instead, a SINGLE desk inhabits the center of the room, a small computer monitor and keyboard centered on it. Bishop comes around, touches a key on the keyboard. The monitor glows to life with a single \"PASSWORD\" prompt. Bishop stares at it. He sits, staring, concentrating... \nEXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nSteve has moved to the edge of the raised patio, looking down into the valley. His eyes still, deep, impossible to read. \nLOUISE Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some amazing E. You need to come try... Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think he might slap her, then: \nSTEVE Give me a moment. I'll be right there. We'll do that amazing E. And he looks away, back down over the view. A resigned loneliness settling into his features. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER) \nBishop, just staring at the password prompt which throbs in front of him. Beat. His eyes flick across to the few books lying on the desk. Weaponry, physiology... Greek Mythology. Bishop reaches forward, types \"Nemesis.\" Hits ENTER. A moment... and then our minds are blown. The entire wall of the room in front of Bishop glows to life. It's a one large high-resolution monitor. On it, glows an infinitely detailed work-up on Bishop. A photograph on him glows at the center of the screen, changing every three or four seconds to another. This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century. Accounts, Medical charts, psych profile, associates, residence... Bishop approaches... takes it in. Touches \"Accounts\" and the window SPREADS OUT across the whole wall. Multiple windows, all of Bishop's money, displayed in real time, the numbers subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets. Another window above is labeled \"Associates.\" Bishop touches this one and the financial windows are replaced with a collage of FACES. Not too many. We recognize the Store Owner and his Daughter. Steve himself. An older man \"Gerald Bishop,\" Bishop's father. And a photo of the Woman. Bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out from the single. Many stills, but several are in motion, looping: Childhood movies. A commercial done as a teen. A blue movie when she was 20. Bishop's eyes settle on a video image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the middle of the dancing party. The woman leaning to him, kissing him. Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image labeled \"Residence.\" INSTANTLY, the images are replaced with images of the interior and exterior of Bishop's home. Bishop stares at them, confused. SQUINTS... realizing that in one of the images, the trees lightly sway in the breeze. \nBISHOP Huh. His eyes dart to an image of his DINING ROOM. It looks like a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the frame. Bishops' eyes dart, moving from frame to frame. The whole interior of his life. His living room, bedroom, study, gym. All live feeds. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) Son of a bitch... \nINT. BEDROOM, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER) \nDoor BURSTS open, Steve pushing in, his arms wrapped around Louise and another gorgeous woman from the party. As the two women hit the bed, start undressing each other, Steve takes a moment -- sensing. Something not right. He pulls keys from his pocket, unlocks the study door, peers in. \nSTEVE'S P.O.V.: THE STUDY - EMPTY \nLOUISE (O.S.) Come on, Steve. We need you. \nINT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT \nLow end. Mean men and loose women. Metal on the juke. Duct- taped naugahyde. Bartender on parole. Eyes raise as Bishop pushes in, scattered focus, hits the bar. \nBISHOP Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it. Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash. $100s and $20s. Eyes track. At a booth, two EX CONS lock onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger raised FU tattoo on his bare shoulder. Bishop pushes $100 forward. \nBARTENDER That's too much. Bishop grabs the shot, down it. Pushes the empty shot and the cash back at the bartender. \nBISHOP I'm not going anywhere. \nAN HOUR LATER Another shot is put down on the bar, empty. Bishop wipes watery eyes, nods to the bartender to hit it again. Bishop stares at the drink, then his attention is drawn to the bar TV. Footage from the protests in Turkey is narrated by a news anchor, speaking. \nFEMALE NEWS ANCHOR ...Intelligence services can listen to our calls. But what about the rest of the world? \n(MORE) \nFEMALE NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D) Well, today the answer seems to be 'No\" as outrage over the assassination of the Turkish envoy Bahar Miryem has forced the US to reverse its position, now saying that it will not make it support of Turkey's EU bid contingent on its cooperation in the security agreement. Miryem had always advocated for Turkish autonomy from \nBartender hits a remote, annoyed. Channel changes to a 70's Charles Bronson flick. Bishop blinks, shakes his head... He collects himself, weaves out of the bar. The Ex-Cons watch him go. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 2428, "test3_input": "STEVE ... Alright, got him. He's at his desk. We could take the shot right from here. \nBISHOP Glass is three inches thick... Steve moves his hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before to listen with... \nBISHOP (CONT'D) And has laser sensors. \nSteve laughs, suddenly walks away from the telescope. Bishop goes to it, takes up the watch. \nSTEVE Alright, fine. What are we doing here? Who is this guy? P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean shouts into the phone, slams it down. Leaves his office. Bishop pulls away from the telescope, hunkers down to wait. \nBISHOP Starting to get it? \nSTEVE Yeah, I'm getting that this isn't a job. It's just a really complicated... suicide. Bishop smiles. Steve moves off, restless. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, TENEMENT - NIGHT \nWhole day has passed. Bishop hasn't moved, stares across at the NSA building, the corner office. Steve sits nearby. \nSTEVE You know, you can front sonofabitch all you want, Bishop. You're scared, too. You don't really know how we're going to pull it off, do you? You ever think there's some things that just can't be done? \nBISHOP Everyone has a death -- \nSTEVE Really? Because, this guy? I look at this guy, I don't see his death. I see my death. And I don't particularly like the view. Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean's office, returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean back at his desk. He looks exhausted. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) And you know, as much as I like the quality time, unless you can read lips, I don't exactly see what we're doing here... \nSteve glances at Bishop's pad where he's transcribing words: \"No, no, tomorrow. I'm sick of this, this is my life we're taking about. You're bringing me in. Give me a time and a place...\" \nSTEVE (CONT'D) You read lips. Bishop glances at Steve, puts his eye back to the camera. P.O.V. THROUGH THE LENS: EXTREME CLOSE on Dean's desk. A piece of paper on the blotter. \"Click.\" \"Click.\" Bishop pulls the memory-card from the camera. \nBISHOP \n(INNOCENTLY) You any good with computers? \nINT. BISHOP'S BARN - DAY \nBishop is working on his classic Mustang. He's got the steering column apart, working the mechanism. Focused. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT \nSteve is in front of the electronic wall of info on Bishop. His hospital report open. In a separate window, video feed of the real Bishop in his barn working on his car. Steve marks the injury on Bishop, then opens a new window. Multiple images of the scrap of paper on Dean's desk. Steve gets to work enlarging, rotating, skewing the images... Music and LAUGHTER filter in from outside. Steve becomes aware of the noise from outside, frowns. \nEXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER \nSteve emerges onto the high balcony overlooking the never- ending party. He raises a GUN and fires into the air. Faces, startled look up at him. \nSTEVE Everybody out. I'm serious. Get the fuck off my property. A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in hand, moves towards Steve, confused. \nLOUISE Steve, baby...? \nSteve levels the gun at her. \nSTEVE You, too. \nINT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS \nSteve comes back into his office, facing the wall. He tosses the gun on the table, gets back to work. Glances at one of the other open windows that shows Bishop at his fridge, pouring himself filtered water. Steve's hands fly. The images are pieced together, enlarged, skewed until nonsensical markings resolve into an address. Steve punches it into a search window, waits a beat, then eyes scan over the list of returns, lock onto something. He picks up the phone, punches a number. Watches as Bishop's phone rings, watches Bishop answer it. \nBISHOP (O.S.) Did you get it? \nSTEVE It's the US Attorney's office in New York. He's running. He's trying to get out. Steve, trying to read Bishop's face, ZOOMING in. \n", "test3_true": "BISHOP (O.S.) Does it make a difference? \nSTEVE ...No, I don't suppose it does. A beat. The two men, far separated. \nBISHOP (O.S.) Do the angles. Find us a shot. \nEXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING \nSteve and Bishop step out of the airport with bags, hail a taxi and climb in, headed into DC. \nSTEVE (V.O.) Security's going to have the actual street locked down. But there's a residential street, perpendicular. \nEXT. DC STREETS - MORNING \nUpscale streets lined with brownstone walk-ups. Steve and Bishop walk with roller bags and a shoulder tube past mothers and Nanny's ushering their children to school. \nSTEVE (V.O.) High-end people. They'll put up with a sweep, but they're not going to allow an agent to spend the day. They reach an address. Bishop puts on a hat, some sunglasses, slaps a badge onto his jacket that reads \"DC Municipal Utilities.\" He trots up the the half-flight, rings the bell of an elegant brownstone. \nINT. DC FLAT - MORNING \nNice. Lace curtains. Classic living room. Magazine racks, grand piano, original art. \nSTEVE Besides, the angle isn't right, too flat. Except when they hit the stairs. It'll spread the group vertically. It's... the shot. Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each opens their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal. From a clock, a firing mechanism. From the tube, an aluminum barrel holds a fishing rod. The rod is discarded, the barrel is attached to a hard plastic stock. AA Batteries are opened and slender shells are removed from each. As this strange choreography continues in silence, we PAN ACROSS to the dining room where a WOMAN and a MAN are bound and tied, pillowcases cinched over their heads. Their bindings allow them to hold each other's hands which they do, tight. They're terrified, but okay. Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the home-made rifle, a telescope, lifted from a child's gift box, snaps it on top of the rifle. \nINT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - DAY \nDean squints in the back of his limo as it pulls into daylight. He's on the phone, eyes darting, nervous. \nDEAN (O.S.) Look, I don't care. Find her, I need to talk to her right now... \nINT. DC FLAT - DAY \nBishop puts the rifle to his shoulder, sights. Behind him, Steve slips a blade from the crease of his suitcase, considers it, looks back to Bishop. \nSTEVE You ever worry about the right and wrong of it all? I'm not talking about God, just... (tapping his chest) Whatever you feel here. BISHOP'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE: The US Attorney building. The security detail. The steps leading to the street. \nBISHOP It's a little late for -- \nSTEVE Come on. You're telling me you've never done anything just because it was the right thing to do, even if it didn't make any sense? You never took a chance like that? Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch. \nBISHOP Once I did... \nSTEVE How'd that work out for you? Beat. Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large truck, which has stopped trying to make the turn. \nBISHOP We have a problem... Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives. Nothing. He sets the rifle down, thinking as Steve takes in the new situation. \nSTEVE There's no shot. What do we do? There's no shot. \nA moment more, and then Bishop MOVES. We travel with him, to the entryway. Keys, hats, jackets, sunglasses. Bishop grabs a hat, tosses one to Steve. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Bishop...? And Bishop's out. \nEXT. US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe TRUCK, wedged in. The security detail, suspicious of the truck. COPS get involved. Men speak into radios. \nEXT. DC BROWNSTONE - AFTERNOON \nMOVING with Bishop, Steve following. Hats and sunglasses. They descend the steps onto the sidewalk, closing on the US Attorney building ahead. Steve comes abreast of him as they move down the street. \n", "test3_id": 2429}

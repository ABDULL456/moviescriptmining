JAMES (CONT'D) And we need to bring awareness, and Mr. President, we need to bring the super heavy funk. 
We widen to see 5'7" James looking up to the 6'4" Lyndon Johnson. President Johnson shakes James' hand.

Ben Bart is playing golf with several friends. Bart drives the ball straight and hard. We watch as the ball land three hundred yards down the runway. 
Back on the tee box. Ben Bart lays face down dead in the turf. His friends race to his side in shock. 
CLOSE ON: 
Ben's face is pressed sideways on the grass.      His opened, dead eyes stare right at us. 
130    EXT. CEMETERY - DAY                                             130 
A casket lays at the bottom of a grave that has been dug. TEN MALE FUNERAL ATTENDEES IN SUITS AND YAMMAKAS take turns shoveling dirt onto Ben Bart's casket. 
Dede and James stand to the side. Completely distraught. James starts to panic and lowers to the ground. Dede catches him under the arm. 
One of the men approach James with the shovel.      James can't bring himself to put dirt on the casket. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO. LOS ANGELES. NIGHT. 
BAND MEMBERS FITTED WITH THEIR AFRICAN DASHIKIS are rolling a funky vamp together into a groove. Clyde hits a fat `pop pop' beat. Sweet Charles locks the bass line in to the beat. Country finds a chunky B-flat-9 rhythm on the guitar and the groove takes shape. 
The door opens. James and Teddy walk in. James and Teddy's hair is cut into a short natural. Everyone looks at each other. 
JAMES Hit it. 
The band starts. James makes a few adjustments. Jimmy Nolen strikes up a womp-womp sound on a single string. The horns do the James trademark ladidadidat. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Quit it. (he pushes the intercom to the booth) Bring `em in. 
The door opens. 32 children enter the room. Most kids are black, except for a few Mexican children. Dede and Teddy are there, along with some of James' other kids. 
JAMES (CONT'D) How we all doin'. Hope this ain't too late for you folks. 
James and Teddy stand before the group.   James puts his arms around Teddy as he addresses the kids. 
JAMES (CONT'D) I brought you all here today so I could tell you something very important. I want you all to know that you can do or be anything you want in this world. Don't let anybody tell you anything different. You understand? When I was a boy I used to shine shoes in front of radio station. Now I own that radio station. You got to build it. And then you gotta learn it... and that's when you earn it. 
James gets all the kids around one mic.   He puts Dede and Teddy to the side of the kids. 
CUT TO: 
Later everyone is cued. Maceo whispers to Pee Wee Ellis. 
MACEO You think they fuck up he gone take they pocket money. 
Pee Wee laughs and nods his head. 
JAMES We ready fellas? 
The groove starts again. James flies into I'm Black and I'm Proud. 
WHICH PLAYS OVER ADDRESSING US DIRECTLY 
JAMES (CONT'D) I think about a lot of things. About problems. About solutions. You know one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got in this country...is letting a person feel that they important. Feel that they somebody. It's it. Man can't get hisself together... ...until he know who he is and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from! WHERE WE ALL COME FROM! 
James leaves us and continues with the song.   He looks to the children 
JAMES (CONT'D) Say it loud! 
They scream into the mic. 
CHILDREN I'm Black and I'm Proud! 
James catches eyes with Teddy. He nods proudly. Teddy smiles.

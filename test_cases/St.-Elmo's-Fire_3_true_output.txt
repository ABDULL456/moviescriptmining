KEVIN I wouldn't strike a match near his blood. 
BILLY 
(TO COPS) Hey, watch my sax... 
(TO NURSES) . You girls believe in premarital sax? They laugh as Alec barks at him. 
ALEC Billy -- four months after graduation and you're still acting like every night's a fraternity party. Aren't you even concerned about Wendy? 
BILLY 
(TRUE PANIC) Wendy? Jesus, how bad is it? 
KEVIN Severe. She might have finally exceeded the limit on her father's Visa. Billy smiles with relief as the Cops lead him toward their car. 
ALEC Will you both get serious. He's being arrested for drunk driving. 
BILLY Drunk maybe. But I don't know if you could call that driving. Wendy, Leslie and Jules come from the hospital, just in time to see Billy being put into the cop car. Wendy rushes to Billy and they embrace. 
BILLY Sorry, babe... sorry. 
WEHDY We'll be right behind you! They all move toward Alec's car except Kirbo, who sud- denly notices'someone. He becomes mesmerized as he falls away from the group and starts back for the hospital.

DALE Almost. I'm finishing my clinical. 
KIRBO Dale Biberman. I can't believe it. Do you still like Woody Allen movies? There is a big COMMOTION at the other and of the hail. 
DALE I've got to go. Nice seeing you. She races down the hall, joining paramedics wheeling in a large black man on a gurney. His hysterical wife runs screaming behind them.

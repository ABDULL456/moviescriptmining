{"train": "COCO \nOriginal story by \nLee Unkrich, Jason Katz, Matthew Aldrich & Adrian Molina \nScreenplay by \nAdrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich \nEXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK \nA path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward... \nCARD: DISNEY PRESENTS \nCARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM \nThe smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado \u00ad- cut paper banners -- that sway gently in the breeze. \nPAPEL PICADO CARD: \"COCO\" \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born. \nA story begins to play out on the papel picado. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) See, a long time ago there was this family. \nThe images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) The pap\u00e1, he was a musician. \nThe pap\u00e1 plays guitar while the mother dances with her daughter. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) He and his family would sing, and dance, and count their blessings... (beat) But he also had a dream... to play for the world. (beat) And one day he left with his guitar... and never returned. \nThe man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching her pap\u00e1 leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her mam\u00e1, hardened. \nShe shuts the door. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) And the mam\u00e1...? She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician! (beat) After banishing all music from her life... \nThe woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and records. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) She found a way to provide for her daughter... (beat) She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. (beat) She could have made candy! \nAmongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up pi\u00f1ata which bursts with candy... \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Or fireworks! \nFireworks go off in the background... \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers! \nSparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst other linens... \nMIGUEL (V.O.) But no... she chose shoes... \nOn the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law. \nShe introduces a suitor to the family business. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business. \nIn the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family! \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Music had torn her family apart, but shoes held them all together. (beat) You see, that woman was my great- great grandmother, Mam\u00e1 Imelda. \nTILT DOWN from the papel picado to the \nOFRENDA ROOM - DAY \nwhere a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The photo features MAM\u00c1 IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his face has been torn away. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) She died WAY before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on D\u00eda de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead... (beat) And her little girl? \nFade from the face of the little girl to present day MAM\u00c1 COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker wheelchair. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) She's my great grandmother, Mam\u00e1 Coco. \nA boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek. This is our narrator, MIGUEL. \nMIGUEL Hol\u00e1, Mam\u00e1 Coco. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO How are you, Julio? \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Actually, my name is Miguel. Mam\u00e1 Coco has trouble remembering things... But it's good to talk to her anyway. So I tell her pretty much everything. \nQUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mam\u00e1 Coco: \nEXT. COURTYARD \nMIGUEL I used to run like this... \nMiguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists.           Then he switches to flat palms. \nRunning past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce and tosses the vendor a coin. \nMIGUEL Muchas gracias! \nSTREET VENDOR De nada, Miguel! \nAs Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes. The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel, who laughs. \nMIGUEL Hey, hey!    Dante! \nMiguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head. \nMIGUEL Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake. Fist bump. \nDante obeys to the best of his ability. \nMIGUEL Good boy, Dante! \nMiguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples back into the trash can. \nCUT TO: \nMARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER \nMiguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the square with music. \nMIGUEL (V.O) I know I'm not supposed to love music -- but it's not my fault! (beat) It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz... \nMiguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the heart of the plaza. \nMIGUEL (V.O) ...The greatest musician of all time. \nA tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the base of the statue. \nTOUR GUIDE And right here, in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history! \nCUT TO: \nCLIPS of de la Cruz in his hay day: playing as a young man in the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car... \nMIGUEL (V.O.) He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him. \nMORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull guitar with flourish and flair. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar... He could fly! \nA CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It's-- \nA CLIP of de la Cruz performing in a fancy nightclub. \nDE LA CRUZ (singing) REMEMBER ME THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE REMEMBER ME DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART REMEMBER ME (MORE) \nDE LA CRUZ (CONT'D) THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR REMEMBER ME EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE... \nMIGUEL (V.O.) He lived the kind of life you dream about... Until 1942... \nAs the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying. \nDE LA CRUZ UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN REMEMBER ME! \nDe la Cruz is subsequently crushed by a giant bell. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) When he was crushed by a giant bell. \nCUT TO: \nMARIACHI PLAZA - DAY \nMiguel gazes up at the statue of de la Cruz in awe. \nMIGUEL (V.O) I wanna be just like him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER \nMiguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the window. He catches a glimpse of de la Cruz's signature skull guitar. \nMIGUEL (V.O.) Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling... like we're connected somehow. Like, if HE could play music, maybe someday I could too... \nEXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) ...If it wasn't for my family. \nPLAZA MARIACHI (playful) Ay, ay, ay, muchacho. \nMIGUEL Huh? \nPLAZA MARIACHI I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story. \nMiguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining. \nMIGUEL Oh, yeah, sorry. \nHe goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines, the mariachi plucks his guitar idly. \nINT. RIVERA WORKSHOP \nThe Rivera workshop is abuzz with family making shoes. WHOMP! Miguel is plopped onto a stool, ready for a lecture. \nABUELITA I found your son in Mariachi Plaza! \nPAP\u00c1 (disappointed) Miguel... \nMAM\u00c1 You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza. \nMIGUEL I was just shining shoes! \nT\u00cdO BERTO A musician's shoes! \nGasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof. \nMIGUEL But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is. \nPAP\u00c1 If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza. \nMIGUEL (blurting) But what about tonight? \nPAP\u00c1 FRANCO What's tonight? \nMIGUEL Well they're having this talent show- \nAbuelita perks her ear, suspicious.          Miguel squirms, deciding whether to go on. \nMIGUEL And I thought I might... \nMam\u00e1 looks at Miguel, curious. \nMAM\u00c1 ...Sign up? \nMIGUEL Well, maybe? \nPRIMA ROSA (laughing) You have to have talent to be in a talent show. \nPRIMO ABEL What are YOU going to do, shine shoes? \nThe shoe from the ceiling falls back down on Abel's head. \nABUELITA It's D\u00eda de los Muertos -- no one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family. \nShe deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms. \nABUELITA Ofrenda room. V\u00e1monos. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFRENDA ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMiguel follows his Abuelita to the family ofrenda, holding the pile of flowers as she arranges them on the altar. \nABUELITA Don't give me that look. D\u00eda de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. (beat) We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over. That is very important! If we don't put them up, they can't come! (beat) We made all this food -- set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where. \nShe looks up to find Miguel sneaking away. \nABUELITA (CONT'D) Where are you going? \nMIGUEL I thought we were done... \nABUELITA Ay, Dios m\u00edo... Being part of this family means being HERE for this family... I don't want to see you end up like-- \nAbuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician. \nMIGUEL Like Mam\u00e1 Coco's pap\u00e1? \nABUELITA Never mention that man!      He's better off forgotten. \nMIGUEL But you're the one who-- \nABUELITA Ta, ta, ta-tch! \nMIGUEL I was just-- \nABUELITA Tch-tch! \nMIGUEL But-- \nABUELITA Tch! \nMIGUEL I-- \nABUELITA Tch-tch! \nMAM\u00c1 COCO Pap\u00e1? \nThey look to find Mam\u00e1 Coco agitated. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO (CONT'D) Pap\u00e1 is home...? \nABUELITA Mam\u00e1, c\u00e1lmese, c\u00e1lmese. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO Pap\u00e1 is coming home? \nABUELITA No Mam\u00e1.   It's okay, I'm here. \nThe tape ends with an interview clip. \nINTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP) Se\u00f1or de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment? \nDE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) I had to have faith in my dream. No one was going to hand it to me. It was up to me to reach for that dream, grab it tight, and make it come true. \nMIGUEL ...and make it come true. \nThe tape ends. The words sink into Miguel.        He reaches for the flyer for the plaza \"TALENT SHOW.\" \nMIGUEL No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta seize my moment! \nDante wags his tail, panting happily. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIVERA COMPOUND - SUNSET \nChildren run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to the family compound. \nABUELITA D\u00eda de los Muertos has begun! \nIn the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter marigold petals from their baskets. \nMAM\u00c1 No, no, no, no, no. \nMam\u00e1 corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to the front gate. \nMAM\u00c1 (CONT'D) We have to make a clear path. The petals guide our ancestors home. We don't want their spirits to get lost. We want them to come, and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda, s\u00ed? \nAs Mam\u00e1 teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching his guitar. \nSuddenly T\u00edo Berto and Pap\u00e1 round the corner carrying a small table from storage. \nPAP\u00c1 Mam\u00e1, where should we put this table? \nMiguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees them. \nABUELITA In the courtyard, mijos. \nPAP\u00c1 You want it down by the kitchen? \nABUELITA S\u00ed.   Next to the other one. \nINT. OFRENDA ROOM \nMiguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mam\u00e1 Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda table. \nMIGUEL Get under, get under! \nABUELITA (O.S.) Miguel! \nMiguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda room darkened by three figures. \nMIGUEL Nothing! \nHis Abuelita and parents stare straight at him.     A pit grows in his stomach; he's been caught. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) Mam\u00e1 -- Pap\u00e1, I-- \nPap\u00e1 lifts his finger to silence his son. \nPAP\u00c1 Miguel... (beat) Your Abuelita had the most wonderful idea! (beat) We've all decided -- it's time you joined us in the workshop! \nAbuelita hands Pap\u00e1 a leather apron, which he hangs over Miguel's shoulders. \nMIGUEL What?! \nPAP\u00c1 No more shining shoes -- you will be making them! Every day after school! \nAbuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing.      She squeezes his cheeks, full of pride. \nABUELITA Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition! And on D\u00eda de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud! \nShe gestures to the shoes adorning the ofrenda. \nABUELITA (CONT'D) You'll craft huaraches just like your T\u00eda Victoria. \nPAP\u00c1 And wingtips, like your Pap\u00e1 Julio-- \nMiguel crosses away from the ofrenda. \nMIGUEL But what if I'm no good at making shoes? \nPAP\u00c1 Ah, Migue... You have your family here to guide you... (beat) You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...? \nMIGUEL ...A shoemaker. Through and through. \nPap\u00e1 swells. \nPAP\u00c1 That's my boy! (calling out) Berto, break out the good stuff, I wanna make a toast! \nPap\u00e1 heads out of the room, Mam\u00e1 follows. Last is Abuelita, who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves. \nWith the family gone, Miguel deflates. \nAbuelita smashes it to bits! \nABUELITA There. No guitar, no music. (softening) (MORE) \nABUELITA (CONT'D) Come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family. \nShe reaches out to comfort Miguel, but he is hurt beyond repair. \nMIGUEL I don't wanna be in this family! \nHe snatches the photo from Pap\u00e1 and bolts out of the hacienda. \nPAP\u00c1 Miguel!   MIGUEL! \nEXT. SIDE STREET \nMiguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away. Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza \"TALENT SHOW.\" \nEXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - EVENING \nMiguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo. \nMIGUEL I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up? \nSTAGE MANAGER You got an instrument? \nMIGUEL No... But if I can borrow a guitar-- \nSTAGE MANAGER Musicians gotta bring their own instruments... (walking away) You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list. \nMiguel looks distraught. \nMOMENTS LATER: \nMiguel approaches any musician he can find. \nMIGUEL Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar? \nMUSICIAN #1 Sorry, muchacho. \nCUT TO: \nMIGUEL You guys have a spare guitar? \nMUSICIAN #2 No. \nCUT TO: \nMIGUEL I need a guitar, just for a little bit-- \nMUSICIAN #3 Get outta here, kid! \nDisheartened, Miguel walks away.       He finds himself facing the statue of de la Cruz. \nMIGUEL Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do? \nNo answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of the statue that reads \"Seize Your Moment!\" Miguel looks at the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea. \nEXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER \nA sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves. \nMiguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from one shadow to the next. \nDante suddenly catches up to Miguel.         He barks excitedly. \nMIGUEL No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! C\u00e1llate! Shhh! \nMiguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and chucks it. Dante bounds after the food. \nEXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM \nMiguel slinks around the side of the tomb.   He looks in one of the windows. \nInside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked. \nMore fireworks shoot into the sky. \nMIGUEL I'm sorry... \nTiming to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb. \nINT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM \nMiguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly moving the lid. He stifles a gasp. \nHe crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust, revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the portrait of de la Cruz. \nMIGUEL Se\u00f1or de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this. \nHeart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount. Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum begin to sparkle. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment! \nHe backs up, in full view of the painting. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did! \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO (CONT'D) And you can see us?! \nT\u00cdA ROSITA charges through Pap\u00e1 Julio, sending his bones scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight. \nT\u00cdA ROSITA Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to! \nMiguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for air. \nMIGUEL (muffled) Remind me how I know you? \nT\u00cdA ROSITA We're your family, mijo! \nT\u00eda Rosita's ofrenda photo flashes in Miguel's memory. \nMIGUEL T\u00eda... Rosita? \nT\u00cdA ROSITA S\u00ed! \nHe looks at Pap\u00e1 Julio, whose head is still turned the wrong way. T\u00cdA VICTORIA straightens it. \nMIGUEL Pap\u00e1 Julio? \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO Hola. \nMIGUEL T\u00eda Victoria? \nT\u00eda Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical. \nT\u00cdA VICTORIA He doesn't seem entirely dead. \nA living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form. \nT\u00cdA ROSITA He's not quite alive either... \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO We need Mam\u00e1 Imelda. She'll know how to fix this! \nSuddenly twin skeleton gents run, huffing, toward the family. \nT\u00cdO FELIPE (huffing) Oye! \nT\u00cdO OSCAR (winded) It's Mam\u00e1 Imelda-- \nT\u00cdO FELIPE (huffing) --She couldn't cross over! \nThe others gasp. \nT\u00cdO OSCAR She's stuck-- \nT\u00cdO FELIPE --On the other side! \nMiguel sees pictures of his T\u00edo Oscar and T\u00edo Felipe flash in his memory. \nMIGUEL T\u00edo Oscar?     T\u00edo Felipe? \nT\u00cdO OSCAR Oh, hey Miguel. \nT\u00eda Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel. \nT\u00cdA VICTORIA I have a feeling this has something to do with you. \nT\u00cdA ROSITA But if Mam\u00e1 Imelda can't come to us... \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO ...Then we are going to her! V\u00e1monos! \nPap\u00e1 Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes through the cemetery, trailed by Dante. \nEXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER \nMiguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a corner. \nHis gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before them. \nMIGUEL Whoa... \nThe bridge extends into the mist.        A stream of skeletons amble across for the holiday. \nThe family passes through an invisible barrier onto the bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel hesitates at the threshold. \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO Come on, Miguel. It's ok. \nMiguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his feet. Dante takes off. \nMIGUEL Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up! \nMiguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes some petals into Miguel's face. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) You gotta stay with me, boy.       We don't know... where... \nOut of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up. \nMIGUEL This isn't a dream, then.        You're all really out there... \nT\u00cdA VICTORIA You thought we weren't? \nMIGUEL Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins. \nT\u00cdA VICTORIA Miguel, vitamins are a real thing. \nARRIVALS AGENT Welcome back, amigos! Anything to declare? \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO As a matter of fact, yes. \nThe family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive. \nMIGUEL Hola. \nThe arrivals agent's jaw literally drops. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION \nMiguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across an arching second floor walkway. \nVOICE OVER P.A. Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta Gonzales-Ramos, please report to Level 7. \nDante happily trots alongside.       Miguel looks up to see gondolas traveling by. \nMIGUEL Whoa... \nSkeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel notices T\u00edo Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation. \nT\u00cdO OSCAR I miss my nose... \nAt the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with \"DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS.\" The family passes through. \nINT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS \nInside, they find case workers helping travelers work out holiday snafus. \nDISTRESSED TRAVELER C'mon! Help us out amigo... We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight... \nCUT TO: \nMIFFED WIFE We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's family for D\u00eda de Muertos! \nCUT TO: \nIn a far corner, one traveler in particular is raising hell. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA I demand to speak to the person in charge! \nA beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mam\u00e1 Imelda tears into her. \nCASE WORKER I'm sorry, se\u00f1ora, it says here no one put up your photo-- \nMam\u00e1 Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's desk. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies! \nIn a swift movement, Mam\u00e1 Imelda removes her shoe and smacks the computer. \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO Mam\u00e1 Imelda? \nShe turns her shoe on Pap\u00e1 Julio, who leans back and yelps. Mam\u00e1 Imelda softens. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda. \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO Well, we never made it to the ofrenda... \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA What?! \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO We ran into... um... \nMam\u00e1 Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel. \nMiguel looks at Mam\u00e1 Imelda.       Her photo flashes before him. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Miguel? \nMIGUEL Mam\u00e1 Imelda... \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA What is going on? \nJust then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out. \nCLERK You the Rivera family? \nThe computer short circuits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLERK'S OFFICE \nCLERK Well, you're cursed. \nThe family gasps. \nMIGUEL What?! \nThe clerk searches through a huge stack of papers. \nCLERK D\u00eda de los Muertos is a night to GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from the dead. \nMIGUEL But I wasn't stealing the guitar! \nMiguel and Dante burst out the door and rush down the stairs. H\u00e9ctor's arm snaps to get Miguel's attention. Miguel realizes it's no longer attached to H\u00e9ctor's body. The arm signals backwards to H\u00e9ctor who is ten paces behind. \nH\u00c9CTOR Esp\u00e9rame chamaco! \nMiguel throws the arm back to H\u00e9ctor an they disappear into a dense crowd. \nMoments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving doors. Mam\u00e1 Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's nowhere to be found. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Ay, he is going to get himself killed... I need my spirit guide, Pepita. \nMam\u00e1 Imelda looks to the night sky, puts two fingers to her mouth, and lets out a piercing whistle. \nFWOOOMP! A giant winged jaguar lands in front of Mam\u00e1 Imelda. She turns to the family. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Who has that petal Miguel touched? \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO Here! \nPap\u00e1 Julio steps forward with a marigold petal.      He creeps forward, jittery, holding it out for Pepita. \nPAP\u00c1 JULIO Nice alebrije... \nPepita sniffs the petal's scent. \nSuddenly Pepita's head darts, narrowing in on the scent.         She takes to the air. \nEXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT \nMiguel sits on a wooden crate. H\u00e9ctor uses his thumb to smudge black and white shoe polish on the boy's face. \nH\u00c9CTOR Hey, hey, hold still. (beat) Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da! \nH\u00e9ctor opens a small mirror.       Miguel's face is painted to look like a skeleton. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) Dead as a doorknob. (beat) So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on D\u00eda de Muertos. (beat) Unless you're me. \nMIGUEL You don't get to cross over. \nH\u00c9CTOR No one's ever put up my picture... (beat) But you can change that! \nHe unfolds an old picture.        In it is a young, living H\u00e9ctor. \nMIGUEL This is you? \nH\u00c9CTOR Muy guapo, eh? \nMIGUEL So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home? \nH\u00c9CTOR Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! (beat) One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. (upbeat) So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible? \nMIGUEL Mmm, nope. \nH\u00c9CTOR Don't yank my chain, chamaco.      You gotta have SOME other family. \nMIGUEL ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself. \nMiguel marches out of the alley, whistling for Dante to follow. \nH\u00c9CTOR Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUSTLING STREET \nThey make their way through a pedestrian path. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) ...It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. (beat) What are you doing? \nMiguel slink-walks next to H\u00e9ctor goofily. \nMIGUEL I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in. \nH\u00c9CTOR No, skeletons don't walk like that. \nMIGUEL It's how you walk. \nH\u00c9CTOR No, I don't. \nMiguel keeps walking funny. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) Stop it! \nMiguel notices a billboard advertising \"ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ'S SUNRISE SPECTACULAR!;\" \"Remember Me\" blares from attached speakers. \nMIGUEL Whoa...\"Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!\" Qu\u00e9 padre! \nH\u00c9CTOR Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of D\u00eda de Muertos. \nMIGUEL And you can get us in! \nH\u00c9CTOR Ahhhh-- \nMIGUEL Hey, you said you had front row tickets! \nH\u00c9CTOR That... that was a lie.      I apologize for that. \nMiguel gives H\u00e9ctor a withering look. \nMiguel brightens.     Frida turns back to the rehearsal. \nFRIDA The dancers exit, the music fades, the lights go out! And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage! \nA silhouette rises from a trap door.         Miguel leans forward. \nA spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a mannequin. \nMIGUEL Huh? \nFRIDA He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers-- \nMiguel hustles up to Frida. \nMIGUEL Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? \nFRIDA Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals. He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower. \nShe gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in the distance, atop a steep hill. \nSuddenly H\u00e9ctor rounds the corner, out of breath. \nH\u00c9CTOR Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities... \nH\u00e9ctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled. \nMIGUEL You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party. \nH\u00c9CTOR That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal? \nMIGUEL If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? \nH\u00c9CTOR He's YOUR great-great grandpa.   How come he didn't invite YOU? \nH\u00e9ctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians. \nH\u00c9CTOR Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party? \nGUSTAVO It's the hot ticket. But if you're not on the guest list you're never getting in, Chorizo... \nMUSICIANS Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito! \nH\u00c9CTOR Ha ha, very funny guys.      Very funny. \nMIGUEL Chorizo? \nGUSTAVO (to Miguel, re: H\u00e9ctor) Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on, ask him how he died! \nMiguel looks to H\u00e9ctor, eyebrow cocked. \nH\u00c9CTOR I don't want to talk about it. \nGUSTAVO He choked on some CHORIZO! \nThe musicians laugh.     Miguel tries to stifle a giggle. \nH\u00c9CTOR I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference! \nMore laughter. \nH\u00c9CTOR (to Miguel) This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks! \nMIGUEL Hey, I'm a musician. \nH\u00c9CTOR You are? \nGUSTAVO Well, if you really want to get to Ernesto, there IS that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party... \nMiguel's wheels start turning. \nH\u00c9CTOR No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think-- \nMiguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal transformation. \nMIGUEL I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing. \nMiguel looks up to H\u00e9ctor. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) You know where I can get a guitar? \nH\u00e9ctor sighs. \nH\u00c9CTOR I know a guy... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT \nPepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner. She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light. She sniffs out the spot where H\u00e9ctor painted Miguel's face, finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl. \nThe Dead Riveras follow after her. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Have you found him, Pepita?      Have you found our boy? \nPepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint.   It glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect. \nT\u00cdA ROSITA A footprint! \nCHICHARR\u00d3N Like the time you promised to bring back my van? \nH\u00c9CTOR Uh... \nCHICHARR\u00d3N Or my mini-fridge? \nH\u00c9CTOR Ah, you see\u00ad- \nCHICHARR\u00d3N Or my good napkins? My lasso?    My femur?! \nH\u00c9CTOR No, no, not like those times. \nCHICHARR\u00d3N Where's my femur?! You-- \nChicharr\u00f3n raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden flicker flashing through his bones. H\u00e9ctor rushes forward. \nH\u00c9CTOR Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo? \nCHICHARR\u00d3N I'm fading, H\u00e9ctor. I can feel it. (looking to guitar) I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to. (beat) You play me something. \nH\u00e9ctor looks surprised. \nH\u00c9CTOR You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid-- \nCHICHARR\u00d3N You want it, you got to earn it... \nH\u00e9ctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharr\u00f3n and takes the instrument. \nH\u00c9CTOR Only for you, amigo.     Any requests? \nH\u00e9ctor begins tuning the guitar. \nCHICHARR\u00d3N You know my favorite, H\u00e9ctor. \nH\u00e9ctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharr\u00f3n smiles. Miguel's eyes go wide at H\u00e9ctor's skill. \nH\u00c9CTOR (singing) WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA, HER EYES EACH A DIFFERENT COLOR. HER TEETH STICK OUT, AND HER CHIN GOES IN, AND HER... \nH\u00e9ctor eyes Miguel. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) ...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR. \nCHICHARR\u00d3N Those aren't the words! \nH\u00c9CTOR There are children present. (continuing) HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR, SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE. AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY, SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE! \nH\u00e9ctor finishes with a soft flourish. \nChicharr\u00f3n is tickled, joyful.       For a moment he's present and bright. \nCHICHARR\u00d3N Brings back memories.     Gracias... \nHis eyes close.    He looks at peace.        H\u00e9ctor looks sad. \nSuddenly, the edges of Chicharr\u00f3n's bones begin to glow.         A soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust. \nMiguel is stunned, concerned. \nH\u00e9ctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharr\u00f3n's glass, which is still full. \nMIGUEL Wait... what happened? \nH\u00c9CTOR He's been forgotten. (beat) When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the \"Final Death.\" \nMIGUEL Where did he go? \nH\u00c9CTOR No one knows. \nMiguel has a thought. \nMIGUEL But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back... \nH\u00c9CTOR No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories... \nMiguel is deep in thought. \nH\u00e9ctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) Hey, it happens to everyone eventually. \nHe gives Miguel the guitar. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) C'mon \"de la Cruzcito.\" You've got a contest to win. \nH\u00e9ctor throws open the curtain and exits.      Miguel looks back at the glasses, then turns and follows. \nEXT. LAND OF THE DEAD \nH\u00e9ctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley. Miguel holds H\u00e9ctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while H\u00e9ctor fiddles on the guitar idly. \nMIGUEL You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one. \nH\u00c9CTOR How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows. \nH\u00e9ctor plays a fancy riff, but botches the last note. \nMIGUEL No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time? \nMIGUEL 'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it. \nH\u00c9CTOR Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time! \nH\u00e9ctor looks in Miguel's eyes.       The kid is sincere.   Despite himself, H\u00e9ctor softens. \nH\u00c9CTOR Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. (beat) Okay. (beat) Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM! \nMiguel perks, surprised that H\u00e9ctor wants to help. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) First you have to loosen up.     Shake off those nerves! S\u00e1quenlo s\u00e1quenlo, s\u00e1quenlo! \nH\u00e9ctor does a loose-bone skeletal shimmy and Miguel copies. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) Now gimme your best grito! \nMIGUEL My best grito? \nH\u00c9CTOR Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you. \nMIGUEL (uncertain) Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay... \nDante whimpers. \nH\u00c9CTOR Oh, c'mon kid... \nOn stage, Los Chachalacos wrap up to raucous applause. \nSTAGEHAND De la Cruzcito, you're on now! \nH\u00c9CTOR Miguel, look at me. \nSTAGEHAND Come on, let's go! \nH\u00c9CTOR Hey!     Hey, look at me. (beat) (MORE) \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go! \nEMCEE (O.S.) We have one more act, amigos! \nMIGUEL H\u00e9ctor... \nH\u00c9CTOR Make 'em listen, chamaco!        You got this! \nEMCEE (O.S.) Damas y caballeros! De la Cruzcito! \nThe crowd applauds as Miguel is led on stage. \nH\u00c9CTOR Arre pap\u00e1!     Hey! \nH\u00e9ctor's face contorts with a mix of encouragement and dread. \nON STAGE \nMiguel slowly takes the stage, guitar in hand.         He's blinded by the lights and squints out at the audience.         He's frozen stiff. \nOFF STAGE \nH\u00c9CTOR (to Dante) What's he doing? Why isn't he playing? \nON STAGE \nPanic is painted across Miguel's face. \nAUDIENCE MEMBER (O.S.) Bring back the singing dogs! \nThe crowd begins to murmur impatiently.         Miguel looks to H\u00e9ctor in the wing. \nH\u00e9ctor makes eye contact with Miguel and does the \"loosen up\" bone shimmy. \nOn stage Miguel shakes off his nerves.       Deep exhale and... \nMIGUEL HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI! \nThe sound is full-throated and resonant. People in the audience whistle and whoop. Some return the grito, some applaud lightly. His brows go up and he begins his guitar intro. \nMIGUEL (singing) WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU SAY PUT THEM ON YOUR HEAD AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR \nAs the audience warms up, so does Miguel.      H\u00e9ctor perks up, he's got this! \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) YOU MAKE ME UN POCO LOCO UN POQUI-TI-TI-TO LOCO THE WAY YOU KEEP ME GUESSING I'M NODDING AND I'M YES-ING I'LL COUNT IT AS A BLESSING THAT I'M ONLY UN POCO LOCO... \nINSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE. Dante grabs H\u00e9ctor by the leg and drags him onto the stage with Miguel. \nH\u00c9CTOR No, no, no, no... \nOnce in the spotlight, H\u00e9ctor warms up and busts out some percussive footwork to Miguel's guitar. \nMIGUEL Not bad for a dead guy! \nH\u00c9CTOR You're not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso! \nCUT TO: \nEDGE OF AUDIENCE \nA ripple of glowing footprints leads Pepita and the Dead Riveras to the edge of the audience. \nMiguel's soul pours into the strings as he approaches his hero-- \nMIGUEL FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG-- \nSPLASH!   Miguel tumbles into the indoor pool. \nThe party-goers gasp, but it's Ernesto who rolls up his sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge. \nDE LA CRUZ Are you all right, ni\u00f1o? \nMiguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run, revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide. The crowd gasps and murmurs. \nDE LA CRUZ It's you... you, you are that boy, the one who came from the Land of the Living. \nMIGUEL You... know about me? \nDE LA CRUZ You are all anyone has been talking about! Why have you come here? \nMIGUEL I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson. \nMore murmuring from the crowd.       De la Cruz is shocked. \nDE LA CRUZ I... have a great-great grandson? \nMIGUEL I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you. (beat) (MORE) \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would? \nDE LA CRUZ My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen? \nMiguel hugs de la Cruz who sweeps Miguel up onto his shoulders, showing him off to the room. \nDE LA CRUZ I HAVE A GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON! \nThe crowd roars. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER \nCROWD Look, it's Frida! \nThe silhouette of Frida Kahlo steps up to the security guard. \nH\u00c9CTOR Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. \nThe security guard lets her in immediately.     No need to check the list. \nSECURITY GUARD It is an honor, se\u00f1ora! \nH\u00c9CTOR Gracias... \nHector steps onto the funicular, readjusting his unibrow to maintain his diguise. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION \nQuick cuts over instrumental version of \"Remember Me:\" \nDe la Cruz barges into several conversations, proudly introducing Miguel. He seems almost giddy. They wedge themselves into a group laughing in the garden (which includes Jorge Negrete & Pedro Infante): \nDE LA CRUZ Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you met my great-great-grandson? \nCUT TO: \nDe la Cruz and Miguel ride up on horseback while guests play polo: \nDE LA CRUZ My great-great grandson! \nCUT TO: \nIn the parlor: \nDE LA CRUZ He's alive! And a musician to boot! \nCUT TO: \nMiguel chats away with de la Cruz and guests. \nMIGUEL Dimple.   No dimple.      Dimple.   No dimple. \nDe la Cruz laughs, delighted. \nDE LA CRUZ No dimple! \nCUT TO: \nA film clip is projected in the main hall. \nON SCREEN: Don Hidalgo turns raising two glasses.         Miguel acts along with the clip. \nDON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) To our friendship!... \nDON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP)                        MIGUEL ...I would move Heaven and            ...I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.              Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!                                Salud! \nIn the clip Don Hidalgo and de la Cruz drink.        De la Cruz spits. \nHe looks from the picture to the gray, faded skeleton who kneels before him. H\u00e9ctor looks weak. \nDE LA CRUZ My friend... you're being forgotten... \nH\u00c9CTOR And whose fault is that? \nDE LA CRUZ H\u00e9ctor, please-- \nH\u00c9CTOR Those were MY songs you took.     MY songs that made YOU famous. \nMIGUEL W-What? \nH\u00c9CTOR If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them-- \nMIGUEL That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs. \nH\u00c9CTOR (to de la Cruz) You wanna tell him, or should I? \nDE LA CRUZ H\u00e9ctor, I never meant to take credit. (beat) (MORE) \nDE LA CRUZ (CONT'D) We made a great team but -- you died and I -- I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive. \nH\u00c9CTOR Oh, how generous. \nMIGUEL You really did play together... \nH\u00c9CTOR Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up-- \nDE LA CRUZ H\u00e9ctor... \nH\u00c9CTOR --And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl. \nDe la Cruz looks at the photo, deliberating. \nH\u00c9CTOR Ernesto... Remember the night I left? \nDE LA CRUZ That was a long time ago. \nH\u00c9CTOR We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now. \nMIGUEL Heaven and earth?     Like in the movie? \nH\u00c9CTOR What? \nMIGUEL That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, \"El Camino A Casa.\" \nH\u00c9CTOR I'm talking about my real life, Miguel. \nMIGUEL No, it's in there.    Look. \nMiguel looks around and points to the movie clip projected across the room. \nFILM CLIP: \nDON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) Never were truer words spoken. This calls for A TOAST! To our friendship! I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. \nMIGUEL But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink... \nDON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) Salud! \nIn the clip Don Hidalgo and de la Cruz drink.      De la Cruz spits his drink. \nDE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) Poison! \nH\u00e9ctor's gears are turning too. \nH\u00c9CTOR That night, Ernesto.    The night I left... \nFLASHBACK: \nINT. MEXICO CITY HOTEL ROOM \nH\u00e9ctor throws a songbook in a suitcase, shuts it.     He grabs his guitar case like he means to leave. \nH\u00c9CTOR (V.O.) We'd been performing on the road for months. I got homesick -- and I packed up my songs... \nYOUNG DE LA CRUZ You wanna give up now? When we're this close to reaching our dream? \nYOUNG H\u00c9CTOR This was your dream. You'll manage. \nYOUNG DE LA CRUZ I can't do this without your songs, H\u00e9ctor-- \nDe la Cruz grabs young H\u00e9ctor's suitcase, but H\u00e9ctor pulls away. \nYOUNG H\u00c9CTOR I'm going home, Ernesto. (beat) Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up. \nDe la Cruz looks angry.      For a moment his face darkens.    But he composes himself. \nYOUNG DE LA CRUZ Oh, I could never hate you. If you must go, then I'm... I'm sending you off with a toast! \nDe la Cruz pours a couple of drinks.         He gives one to H\u00e9ctor. \nYOUNG DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D) To our friendship. I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud! \nThey both drink. \nEXT. EMPTY STREET \nMIGUEL No, NO! \nEXT. DE LA CRUZ'S TOWER \nThe guards drag Miguel out the back of de la Cruz's mansion. \nMIGUEL Let go! \nThey throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind the estate. \nINT. CENOTE \nMIGUEL NO!   AHHHHHH! \nHe falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a stone island in the center. \nMIGUEL Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna go home! \nMiguel collapses on the stone island. \nHis soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders.        The skeletal transition is almost complete. \nA moment of silence.     He is alone. \nSuddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. H\u00e9ctor emerges from the darkness, looking beat up. H\u00e9ctor stumbles. \nMIGUEL H\u00e9ctor? \nH\u00c9CTOR Kid? \nMIGUEL Oh, H\u00e9ctor! \nThey run to each other.      H\u00e9ctor embraces Miguel.   But Miguel is overcome with shame. \nMIGUEL You were right. I should have gone back to my family-- \nH\u00e9ctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking. \nH\u00c9CTOR Hey -- hey, hey... \nMIGUEL They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen-- \nH\u00c9CTOR Hey, it's okay... \nMIGUEL I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda. \nH\u00e9ctor holds Miguel to his chest.       Miguel is tense. \nH\u00c9CTOR Hey, chamaco, it's okay.         It's okay. \nMIGUEL I told them I didn't care. \nSuddenly, a golden flicker flutters through H\u00e9ctor's bones, and he falls to his knees. \nH\u00c9CTOR Hhuuh! \nMIGUEL H\u00e9ctor!   H\u00e9ctor-- \nH\u00c9CTOR She's... forgetting me. \nMiguel looks at H\u00e9ctor with concern. \nMIGUEL Who? \nH\u00c9CTOR My daughter... \nMIGUEL She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge... \nH\u00c9CTOR I just wanted to see her again... (beat) I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her pap\u00e1 was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. (beat) My Coco... \nA chill runs through Miguel. \nMIGUEL Coco? \nMiguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician. \nMiguel shows the photo to H\u00e9ctor.       H\u00e9ctor is confused; it's like he's seen a ghost. \nH\u00c9CTOR Where... where did you get this? \nMIGUEL That's my Mam\u00e1 Coco. That's my Mam\u00e1 Imelda. Is that... you? \nGears turn in both of their heads. \nH\u00c9CTOR We're... \nH\u00c9CTOR                              MIGUEL ...family?                           ...family? \nH\u00e9ctor is as shocked as Miguel.       He looks at his great-great grandson. \nHe looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he becomes saddened. \nH\u00c9CTOR I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. (beat) You know the worst part? (beat) Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... (beat) But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world... \nMIGUEL You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her... \nH\u00c9CTOR ...Ever again. \nThey dismount from Pepita. H\u00e9ctor falls off first but gets up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick. \nImelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight hug. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time! \nImelda's eyes fall on H\u00e9ctor, who holds his hat in his hands sheepishly. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA And you! How many times must I turn you away? \nH\u00c9CTOR Imelda-- \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death! (beat) I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole! \nMiguel steps between Imelda and H\u00e9ctor. \nMIGUEL I wasn't in there `cause of H\u00e9ctor. He was in there `cause of me. (beat) He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family. \nMam\u00e1 Imelda looks at H\u00e9ctor, shocked to hear the sentiment. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get H\u00e9ctor's photo. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA What? \nMIGUEL So he can see Coco again.        H\u00e9ctor should be on our ofrenda.        He's part of our family-- \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA He left this family! \nMIGUEL He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him! \nStartled, she looks to H\u00e9ctor for confirmation. \nH\u00c9CTOR It's true, Imelda. \nImelda wrestles with her emotions. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise and I'm just supposed to forgive you? \nH\u00c9CTOR Imelda, I-- \nH\u00e9ctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded.   Imelda gasps. \nMIGUEL H\u00e9ctor? \nH\u00c9CTOR I'm running out of time.         It's Coco... \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA She's forgetting you... \nMIGUEL You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA (to H\u00e9ctor) I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but-- \nH\u00c9CTOR This is my fault, not yours. (beat) I'm sorry, Imelda. \nMam\u00e1 Imelda, holding in her emotions, turns to Miguel. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Miguel, if we help you get his photo... you will return home?          No more music? \nMIGUEL Family comes first. \nMam\u00e1 Imelda considers.      She turns to H\u00e9ctor. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA I -- I can't forgive you.        But I will help you. \nMiguel smiles. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA (to Miguel) So how do we get to de la Cruz? \nMiguel furrows his brow. \nMIGUEL I might know a way... \nEXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN \nCrowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to their seats as the lights begin to dim. \nON STAGE \nFrida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The \"seeds\" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the painted on unibrow. \nThe dancers roll out of the \"flaming\" papaya and gyrate their bodies nonsensically. \nA giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all the dancers slink to it. \nIn the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights and to the wings of the stage. \nSTAGE WING \nFRIDA Good luck, muchacho. \nMIGUEL Gracias Frida! \nINT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor, shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow. \nMIGUEL Ow! \nMiguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, H\u00e9ctor, T\u00eda Victoria, and T\u00eda Rosita hurry up the stairs after de la Cruz. \nMIGUEL Hurry, come on! \nPap\u00e1 Julio, T\u00edo Oscar, and T\u00edo Felipe block the guards from following the others. \nON STAGE \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen... the one, the only... ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ! \nThe platform rises onto the stage and the spotlight falls on Imelda. Neon letters blast brightly behind her, spelling \"ERNESTO!\" The audience bursts into applause! \nCROWD MEMBER Nesto! \nImelda appears onscreen for all to see. \nSTAGE WING RIGHT \nDe la Cruz rushes up a staircase and arrives in the wings. He gets the attention of his guards and points to Imelda. \nDE LA CRUZ Get her off the stage! \nHis guards hustle onto the stage, scaling the set to get to her. \nSTAGE WING LEFT \nMiguel, H\u00e9ctor, Victoria, and Rosita emerge to see Imelda spotlit above them. \nON STAGE \nDe la Cruz's guards begin to approach Imelda.   She is frozen, unable to move. \nMIGUEL (O.S.) Sing! \nMam\u00e1 Imelda looks down and sees Miguel in the wing. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) SING! \nImelda, seeing that the guards are approaching, closes her eyes, grasps the mic, and follows Miguel's instructions. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA (singing) AY DE M\u00cd, LLORONA LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE... \nSTAGE WING LEFT \nH\u00e9ctor's mouth gapes open.      T\u00eda Victoria and T\u00eda Rosita go wide-eyed. \nMiguel sets H\u00e9ctor up with a guitar, then adjusts a mic stand in front of him. H\u00e9ctor plays the guitar, its sound amplified through the stage speakers. \nON STAGE \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA AY DE M\u00cd, LLORONA LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE... \nThe guards reach the edge of her spotlight but stop short, not wanting to interrupt the performance. \nImelda takes the spotlight with her as she descends the on stage staircase. As she comes down, she makes eye contact with her husband in the wing. He smiles as he accompanies her. Imelda's eyes glint, touched to see him supporting her. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA, NO DEJAR\u00c9 DE QUERERTE. NO DEJAR\u00c9 DE QUERERTE! \nAs H\u00e9ctor accompanies Imelda, she becomes more confident. The audience begins to clap. \nDe la Cruz grunts in frustration. \nSoon, the stage conductor joins with more instrumentation, which kicks into high gear. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA ME SUB\u00cd AL PINO M\u00c1S ALTO, LLORONA, A VER SI TE DIVISABA. \nShe doubles down on her performance, taking the spotlight with her as she moves to put distance between her and the guards. \nImelda continues to vamp, trying to navigate away from the guards and toward her family. One guard blocks her way, but she grabs him and forces him to dance. Scared of the spotlight, he runs away. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA COMO EL PINO ERA TIERNO, LLORONA AL VERME LLORAR, LLORABA. (MORE) \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA (CONT'D) AY DE M\u00cd, LLORONA, LLORONA, LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE... \nShe heads to leave the stage when she is stopped by a hand on her wrist. A voice joins her in harmony, the spotlight widens to reveal Ernesto de la Cruz singing too. The crowd goes wild. \nDE LA CRUZ/MAM\u00c1 IMELDA AY DE M\u00cd, LLORONA, LLORONA LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE... \nHe dances Imelda around the stage, all the while trying to get to H\u00e9ctor's photo. \nDE LA CRUZ/MAM\u00c1 IMELDA Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA, NO DEJAR\u00c9 DE QUERERTE. \nDE LA CRUZ Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA, NO DEJAR\u00c9 DE QUERERTE. NO DEJAR\u00c9 DE QUERERTE! \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Let go of me! \nDE LA CRUZ NO DEJAR\u00c9 DE QUERERTE! ...AY, AY, AY! \nAt the finale of the song, Imelda stomps her heel into de la Cruz's foot on his high note, causing him to let her go. She runs off stage with the photo. \nBACKSTAGE \nImelda arrives off stage and, somewhat high on adrenaline, she embraces H\u00e9ctor. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA I forgot what that felt like. \nH\u00e9ctor is taken by surprise. Imelda, realizing the impropriety, pulls away from him awkwardly. \nMIGUEL AHHH! \nH\u00c9CTOR NO! \nThe family runs to the ledge, horrified. \nT\u00cdO OSCAR/T\u00cdO FELIPE Miguel! \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Miguel! \nCUT TO: \nSTADIUM \nThe audience gasps.     Some shrieks. \nBACK TO: \nBACKSTAGE \nDe la Cruz crosses from the ledge, past H\u00e9ctor, who remains collapsed on the floor, breathless. \nDE LA CRUZ Apologies old friend, but the show must go on... \nCUT TO: \nMiguel is in free fall, the photo still in his hand. As the wind whips against his face, he hears a faint howling. \nDante slices downward through the air, catches Miguel's shirt in his teeth, and opens his wings. He and Miguel jerk upward, but the photo falls from Miguel's hands and is gone from sight. \nMiguel and Dante twist in the air, Dante trying to slow their decent but the two of them are too heavy. Miguel's shirt rips and Dante loses him. \nMiguel plummets toward the base of the tower. Suddenly Pepita flies in and scoops up Miguel. Dante follows close behind. Miguel looks over the side of Pepita down towards the water. \nThe photo is lost. \nBACK TO: \nBACKSTAGE \nDe la Cruz steps up to the curtain, slicks back his hair, and emerges to his audience. \nON STAGE \nDe la Cruz is found by a spotlight. \nDE LA CRUZ Ha ha! \nHe is met with boos.      He looks confused. \nCROWD Boo!    Murderer! \nDE LA CRUZ Please, please, mi familia... \nAUDIENCE MEMBER Get off the stage! \nMore booing.    De la Cruz tries to kick up the orchestra. \nDE LA CRUZ Orchestra!     A-one-A-two-A-one-- \nThe conductor snaps his baton.        More booing. \nDE LA CRUZ (singing) REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO-- (beat) Hey!-- \nThe crowd pelts de la Cruz with fruit and offerings. \nCROWD MEMBER Look! \nCrowd members point up to the screen. Pepita rises above the ledge with Miguel on her back. Miguel slides off her wing and runs to his family. \nCROWD MEMBER He's alright! \nThe crowd cheers.     There are sighs of relief. \nDe la Cruz, seeing this     play out on screen, realizes his backstage treachery has     been projected to the whole world. He watches horrified as     the image of Pepita grows larger and larger on the screen as     she prowls past the camera. \nDe la Cruz begins to back up just as Pepita emerges through the curtain, eyes locked on him. \nDE LA CRUZ Nice kitty... \nSuddenly Pepita head-butts de la Cruz and lifts him into the sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. \nDE LA CRUZ AAAHHHH! Put me down! No, please! I beg of you, stop! Stop! NO! \nShe swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over the audience. \nDE LA CRUZ NO!   AAAHHH! \nHe flies out of the stadium, hitting a giant church bell in the distance. The stadium erupts in cheers. \nIn the midst of the cheering, an unsuspecting crowd member returns from concessions. \nCROWD MEMBER What did I miss? \nBACK TO: \nBACK STAGE \n", "test1_input": "CLERK (to Imelda) Then you hand the petal to Miguel. \nImelda extends the petal to Miguel, who reaches for it. \nHe grabs the petal. WHOOOOSH!        He's consumed by a whirlwind of petals and disappears. \nDE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT \nHe reappears in a whirlwind of petals. It seems like he's solid. He runs to the window and looks out. \nMIGUEL No skeletons! \nMiguel laughs, relieved. Then, a mischievous smile on his face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar. \nMiguel quickly grabs the guitar. \nMIGUEL Mariachi Plaza, here I come-- \nHe takes two steps toward the door, then WHOOOOSH! \nCLERK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME \nMiguel appears back in the clerk's office in another flash of the marigold whirlwind, without the guitar. The family turns, shocked to see him back so soon. \nMiguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding position. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Two seconds and you already break your promise! \nMIGUEL This isn't fair, it's my life!     You already had yours! \nMiguel grabs another petal, he marches over to Pap\u00e1 Julio. \nMIGUEL Pap\u00e1 Julio, I ask for your blessing. \nPap\u00e1 Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) T\u00eda Rosita? Oscar? Felipe?       T\u00eda Victoria? \nThey all shake their heads. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Don't make this hard, mijo.      You go home my way, or no way. \nMIGUEL You really hate music that much? \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA I will not let you go down the same path he did. \nMiguel gets an idea.     He pulls the photo out and turns from the group. \nMIGUEL The same path he did. \nHe gazes at the man with no face. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) (to himself) He's family... \nT\u00cdA VICTORIA Listen to your Mam\u00e1 Imelda. \nT\u00cdO OSCAR She's just looking out for you. \nT\u00cdA ROSITA Be reasonable. \nMiguel starts back toward the door. \nMIGUEL Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom.

STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER \nMiguel hustles down a staircase with Dante. Once on the ground floor, they huddle beneath the staircase. He looks to the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. T\u00edo Oscar asks a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie. \nMiguel scopes the ground floor and spies a revolving door exit. \nMIGUEL V\u00e1monos. \nMiguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole, and heads out. Dante pads after him. \nPATROLWOMAN We got a family looking for a LIVING BOY. \nMIGUEL If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa. \nThe exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN. \nPATROLMAN Hold it, muchacho. \nMiguel's hoodie loosens to reveal his living face. \nPATROLMAN Ahh! \nThe patrolman frantically grabs for his walkie-talkie. \nPATROLMAN I've found that living boy! \nA large family passes between Miguel and the officer, chatty, arms full of offerings. \nPATROLMAN Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me folks!

He overhears an exchange in a nearby cubicle. \nCORRECTIONS OFFICER ...disturbing the peace, fleeing an officer, falsifying a unibrow... \nH\u00c9CTOR That's illegal? \nCORRECTIONS OFFICER VERY illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo. \nH\u00c9CTOR Amigo? (verklempt) Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... (misty) I've just had a really hard D\u00eda de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now. \nH\u00e9ctor leans gratefully toward the officer, overwhelmed with mock emotion. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while. \nH\u00e9ctor spies a de la Cruz poster at the officer's workstation. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show! \nMiguel perks at the mention of de la Cruz. \nCORRECTIONS OFFICER Uh-- \nH\u00c9CTOR I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him!

And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing. \nH\u00c9CTOR That's weirdly specific. \nMIGUEL He's my great-great-grandfather. \nH\u00c9CTOR He's your wha-whaat...? \nHector's eyes drop into his mouth. He pops them back up with a punch to his jaw. Miguel is a little grossed out. \nH\u00e9ctor turns to conference with himself. \nH\u00c9CTOR (CONT'D) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait...

He can't help me! \nDante grabs onto his hoodie sleeve. Miguel tries to shake him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here! \nMiguel yanks his hoodie away from Dante, who shrinks back, rebuffed. The scuffle has drawn the eyes of the crowd. \nStartled skeletons see Miguel's arms.        He hurries to get his hoodie back on. \nCROWD MEMBERS It's him! / It's that living boy! / I heard about him. / Look! / He's alive! / The boy's alive. \nMiguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding. In the distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path!

I am giving you my blessing and you are going home! \nMIGUEL I don't want your blessing! \nMiguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley staircase. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA Miguel!

(reminiscing) I remember that feeling, when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly... there was something in my life that mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world. \nMam\u00e1 Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory. \nMAM\u00c1 IMELDA (CONT'D) We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted.

El Santo! (giddy) I'm a big fan. \nThe security guard sheepishly holds up a camera. \nSECURITY GUARD You mind if I-- \nEl Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take the photo. \nSECURITY GUARD Gracias, se\u00f1or! \nThe security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads past the velvet rope.

It is hopeless... \nDE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) You must have faith, sister. \nNUN (FILM CLIP) Oh but Padre, he will never listen. \nDE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) He will listen... to MUSIC! \nThe passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd. \nMiguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn. The DJ fades the music. \nGarnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar.   More guests turn. \nAs a hush falls on the crowd, the sound of Miguel's guitar becomes singular. \nMIGUEL (singing) SE\u00d1ORAS Y SE\u00d1ORES BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES SE\u00d1ORITAS Y SE\u00d1ORES TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT BRINGS ME JOY! \u00a1QU\u00c9 ALEGR\u00cdA!

Abuelita steps forward to intervene but Pap\u00e1 places a hand on her shoulder. \nPAP\u00c1 Mam\u00e1, wait-- \nMiguel starts to sing \"Remember Me\" the way H\u00e9ctor sang it... softly, from the heart. \nMIGUEL (singing) REMEMBER ME THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE REMEMBER ME DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY \nMAM\u00c1 Look... \nThe glimmer in the Mam\u00e1 Coco's eyes grows brighter with every note. Memories flood in, filling the vacancy of her expression with life. Her cheeks soften and plump. Her lips arc into a smile. \nMIGUEL FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY, I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART (MORE) \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) REMEMBER ME THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR \nMiguel sings gently, with love. \nMam\u00e1 Coco's brows slope up, delighted.          The song seems to bring her back to life. \nAbuelita can't speak.     None of them can. \nBrimming, Mam\u00e1 Coco joins Miguel in song -- her voice scratchy with age, his clear with youth. \n", "test3_true": "Tears stream down Abuelita's face; she's witnessing a miracle. \nMam\u00e1 Coco looks to her daughter, and is troubled by her tears. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO Elena?   What's wrong, mija? \nABUELITA Nothing Mam\u00e1. Nothing at all. \nMam\u00e1 Coco turns to Miguel. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO My pap\u00e1 used to sing me that song. \nMIGUEL He loved you, Mam\u00e1 Coco.         Your pap\u00e1 loved you so much. \nA smile spreads across Mam\u00e1 Coco's face.          She's waited a long time to hear those words. \nShe turns to her nightstand, hand shaking.          She opens a drawer and pulls out a notebook. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO I kept... his letters... poems he wrote me... and... \nMam\u00e1 Coco leafs through the book to reveal a torn scrap of paper. She hands it to Miguel. It's the missing face from the photo -- H\u00e9ctor's face. \nMiguel pieces the picture back together, finally seeing H\u00e9ctor as he was in life, a young, handsome man. \nMam\u00e1 Coco smiles. She finds the words slowly, but she speaks with fondness and love. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO Pap\u00e1 was a musician. When I was a little girl, he and Mam\u00e1 would sing such beautiful songs... \nThe family gathers close to listen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - MORNING \nTITLE CARD: ONE YEAR LATER \nThe cemetery is once again filled with families cleaning off head stones and laying flowers. \nEXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM \nNot as many offerings this year, not as many fans. No mariachi band. Someone has hung a sign \"FORGET YOU\" on the bust of de la Cruz. \nTOUR GUIDE (O.S.) And right over here, one of Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures... \nEXT. RIVERA WORKSHOP \nThe tour guide stands in front of the Rivera shoe shop. Tourists crowd in, taking pictures of the skull guitar and framed letters H\u00e9ctor wrote to Coco. \nTOUR GUIDE (CONT'D) The home of the esteemed songwriter H\u00e9ctor Rivera! The letters H\u00e9ctor wrote home for his daughter Coco contain the lyrics for all of your favorite songs, not just \"Remember Me\". \nEXT. COURTYARD \nWe travel through the courtyard catching glimpses of holiday preparation. Prima Rosa and primo Abel hang papel picado. Pap\u00e1 and Mam\u00e1 work on tamales. T\u00edo Berto sweeps the cobblestones as the little cousins play. \nMIGUEL (O.S.) And that man is your Pap\u00e1 Julio... \nINT. OFRENDA ROOM \nMiguel holds his baby sister SOCORRO (10 months) in his arms and points out all of the family members. \nMIGUEL (CONT'D) ...And there's T\u00eda Rosita... and your T\u00eda Victoria... and those two are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't just old pictures -- they're our family -- and they're counting on us to remember them. \nAbuelita approaches and smiles to see her grandson passing on the tradition. Then she places a picture frame on the ofrenda, a photo of Mam\u00e1 Coco. She looks to Miguel who puts his arm around her. \nNext to Mam\u00e1 Coco's picture sits the photo of Mam\u00e1 Imelda and H\u00e9ctor, taped back together. Restored. \nCROSS FADE TO: \nEXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION \nH\u00e9ctor waits in the departures line nervously. \nMIGUEL (O.S.) (singing) SAY THAT I'M CRAZY OR CALL ME A FOOL \nDEPARTURES AGENT Next! \nH\u00e9ctor steps up to the monitor. The agent recognizes him. H\u00e9ctor chuckles nervously. The monitor scans him. DING! \nDEPARTURES AGENT Enjoy your visit, H\u00e9ctor! \nMIGUEL (O.S.) (singing) BUT LAST NIGHT IT SEEMED THAT I DREAMED ABOUT YOU \nH\u00e9ctor's chest swells. \nEXT. FOOT OF THE BRIDGE \nH\u00e9ctor exits from the Marigold Grand Central Station. Mam\u00e1 Imelda waits on the cobblestones to greet him. They kiss. Then he hears a familiar voice. \nMAM\u00c1 COCO Pap\u00e1! \nH\u00e9ctor turns to see his daughter approaching.   He opens his arms to give Coco the biggest hug. \nH\u00c9CTOR Coco! \nMIGUEL (O.S.) (singing) WHEN I OPENED MY MOUTH WHAT CAME OUT WAS A SONG AND YOU KNEW EVERY WORD AND WE ALL SANG ALONG \nEvery moment together is a miracle and he holds Coco like he knows it. Soon Coco, H\u00e9ctor, and Imelda join hands. The petals of the bridge glow as they step forward. The family crosses together. \n", "test3_id": 2825}

LARRY A what? What are you talking about? She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved: 
JUDY You always act so surprised. As she leaves: I have begged you to see the Rabbi. 
FADE IN LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a pile of blue books. Cold blue light sweeps across him and he looks up. 
A short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old flannel dressing gown stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar of orange juice. He tips the jar back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the back of his neck LARRY stares at him. 
FADE OUT 
BLEGEN HALL LARRY enters the departmental office. His eyes are red-rimmed and dark-bagged. He has beard stubble. The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing. 
SECRETARY Messages, Professor Gopnik. He takes the two phone messages. 
HIS OFFICE LARRY looks at the messages: WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton OF Columbia Record Club 
CALLED. REGARDING: "2Â°d attempt. Please call." WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman 
CALLED. REGARDING "Let's have a good talk." A knock brings his look up. 
LARRY Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE. CLIVE Park enters the office. 
. Have a seat. LARRY uses a key to open the top left desk drawer. He takes out the envelope. We had, I think, a good talk, the other day, but you left something that- 
CLIVE I didn't leave it. 
LARRY Well--you don't even know what I was going to say. 
CLIVE I didn't leave anything. I'm not missing anything. I know where everything is. LARRY looks at him, trying to formulate a thought. 
LARRY Well... then, CLIVE, where did this come from? He waves the envelope. . This is here, isn't it? CLIVE looks at it gravely. 
CLIVE Yes, sir. That is there. 
LARRY This is not nothing, this is something. 
CLIVE Yes sir. That is something. A beat. . What is it. 
LARRY You know what it is! You know what it is! I believe. And 
you know I can't keep it, CLIVE. 
CLIVE Of course, sir. 
LARRY I'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my suspicions about where it came from. Actions have consequences. 
CLIVE Yes. Often. 
LARRY Always! Actions always have consequences! He pounds the desk for emphasis. In this office, actions have consequences!

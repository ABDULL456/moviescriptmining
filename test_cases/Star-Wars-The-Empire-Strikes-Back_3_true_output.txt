Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics. 
VADER You have learned much, young one. 
LUKE You'll find I'm full of surprises. 
Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and sending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls away as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy. 
VADER Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to be true. 
LUKE No! 
Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord. 
Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword. 
VADER All to easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. 
Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal begins to pour into the pit. 
Vader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet. 
VADER Impressive... most impressive. 
Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the steaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights his sword as well. 
VADER Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. 
Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as Vader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward. 
VADER Only your hatred can destroy me. 
Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader. He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to fill up with steam. 
Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of collapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit. 
INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM 
Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the reactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters. 
Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack. 
Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield. 
A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it. Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. Small tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader. 
A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window. 
INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT 
Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his deactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to scramble up. 
INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM 
Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a moment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando punches desperately at the door's control panel. 
LANDO The security codes has been changed! 
THREEPIO Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. 
Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps and scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's intercom. 
LANDO Attention!  This is Lando Calrissian.  The Empire has takes control of the city.  I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. 
Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out underneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away. 
LANDO This way. 
Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way. 
THREEPIO Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. 
INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR 
In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city. Some carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction. Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide. 
Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back at them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude. 
THREEPIO What are you talking about?  We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon.  It's fixed!  Just open the door, you stupid lump. 
Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep from Artoo - and the door snaps open. 
THREEPIO (to Artoo) I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! 
Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes outside. 
EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK

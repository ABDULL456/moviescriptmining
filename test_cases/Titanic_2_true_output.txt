Old Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow of the screens. She holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her gnarled hands. 
BODINE 
We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all. 
OLD ROSE 
No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now, not to anyone. 
(to Lizzy) 
Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me, in every way that a person can be saved. 
(closing her eyes) 
I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory.

305 EXT. OCEAN FLOOR / TITANIC WRECK 
The Mir submersibles make their last pass over the ship. We hear Yuri the pilot on the UQC: 
YURI 
Mir One returning to surface. 
The sub rises off the deck of the wreck, taking its light with it, leaving the Titanic once again it its fine and private darkness. 
CUT TO: 
306 EXT. KELDYSH DECK 
A desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress. There is music and some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are dancing. Bodine is getting drunk in the aggressive style of Baker Joughin. 
Lovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. Lizzy comes to him, offering him a beer. She puts her hand on his arm. 
LIZZY 
I'm sorry. 
LOVETT 
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time. 
Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of the ship. 
LOVETT 
Oh shit. 
CUT TO: 
307 EXT. KELDYSH STERN DECK 
Rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blows in the wind. Her feet are bare. Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is praying. 
ON LOVETT AND LIZZY running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass. 
ROSE reaches the sern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. Her ancient foot steps up on the gunwale. She pushes herself up, leaning forward. Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below. 
LOVETT AND LIZZY run up behind her. 
LIZZY 
Grandma, wait!! Don't-- 
ROSE TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she has something in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard. 
It is the "Heart of the Ocean". 
Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime. 
ROSE 
Don't come any closer. 
LOVETT 
You had it the entire time?! 
FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. The photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her hands in her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace. She stares at it in amazement. 
BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension. 
ROSE 
The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help. 
She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys come up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand. 
BODINE 
Holy shit. 
LOVETT 
Don't drop it Rose. 
BODINE 
(a fierce whisper) 
Rush her. 
LOVETT 
(to Bodine) 
It's hers, you schmuck. 
(to her) 
Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second. 
ROSE 
I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs. 
The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand... 
LOVETT 
Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once. 
He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her at the stern of Titanic. 
Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his quest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is mesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined. 
LOVETT 
My God. 
His grip tightens on the diamond. 
He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep. 
ROSE 
You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count. 
His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond out of his hand. He feels it sliding away. 
Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail. Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear forever. 
BODINE 
Aww!! That really sucks, lady! 
Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HE LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy. 
LOVETT 
Would you like to dance? 
Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars. 
308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end over end, into the infinate depths. 
CUT TO: 
309 INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH 
A GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures: 
Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studio publicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rose with her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children and grandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived well. 
THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with its rollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life. 
We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profile shot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else. 
CUT TO: 
BLACKNESS 
310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by a kind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost like we are flying. 
WE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. The rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is transformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing chandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in tie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful. 
IN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen and ladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with his back to us... he turns and it is Jack. Smiling he holds his hand out toward us. 
IN A SIDE ANGLE Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers, officers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence of the abyss.

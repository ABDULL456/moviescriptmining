WOMAN (interrupting) This is very interesting.  You get your ideas for your column from life.  You start up a conversation with a woman in a bar, attack her choice of reading material, try and get a rise out of her while you contemplate whether or not she's worth hitting on. 
IKE No, I can't hit on you until I get an idea. 
She starts throwing darts. 
WOMAN That's flattering. 
IKE No, you don't understand. 
The Woman goes to her bar stool, gathering her bag and leaves a tip for the Bartender. 
WOMAN I think I do understand.  So my not responding to your baiting me will inspire one of those potential bitter diatribes you love to write about women and all the things we do to drive men crazy? 
IKE (taken aback) I don't write bitter diatribes about women... very often. 
She whacks him with a newspaper, then shakes his hand. 
WOMAN Only when the ideas aren't flowing, huh?  Well, it was very nice to meet you, one-minute man. 
The Woman leaves the bar. 
IKE (as she exits) That's last minute man. (then, louder) And it's the quality that counts. 
BARTENDER You know, for a good looking man, you strike out a lot. 
MAN I've seen much worse. 
The phone rings.  Te Bartender answers it as Ike sits back on his bar stool.  Ike grabs the woman's magazine that she left on the bar and starts glancing at it.  The Man at the bar has heard the whole thing. 
MAN (cont'd) I said, I've seen much worse. 
Ike looks at the Man with reservation.  The Man is George Swilling. 
IKE Excuse me? 
MAN The brush-off. 
Ike gets up and moves to the dart board.  He removes the darts. 
MAN (cont'd) I've witnessed far more treacherous and nefarious exits than that.  At least she castigated you in private. 
IKE Not as private as I thought. 
Ike turns slightly, giving the man his back. 
IKE (cont'd) Kevin, you've got some napkins? 
BARTENDER Writing or wiping? 
IKE Give me a pen. 
The Bartender gives him cocktail napkins and a pen.  Ike starts making notes.  Ike looks up from his writing.  The Man gets up and starts throwing darts. 
MAN (throwing darts hard) Ah, come on.  They deserve it.  They love you, they hate you, they're hot, they're cold, they're high, they're low... 
IKE ... They're up, they're down.  It's really fun making this list with you, but I've got a column to go write. 
BARTENDER Ike. 
MAN (undeterred) But you don't have a really superb idea! Well, there's a girl from my hometown you could write about. 
Ike moves to the Bartender and pays him. 
BARTENDER (to Man) Excuse me, we don't need any new ideas. 
MAN She likes to dump grooms right at the altar.  They call her "The Runaway Bride". 
Both Ike and Bartender turn and stare. 
MAN She performed the travesty seven or eight times.  Right at the altar she turns around and runs like hell. Bolts. 
Ike turns and heads for the door.  The Man calls after him, getting up from his stool without stopping his enthusiastic story. 
MAN (cont'd) Adios.  Plows down the aisle, knocking old ladies out of her way like the running of the bulls at Pamplona.  And guess what? 
IKE I give up. 
MAN She has the next victim all lined up. She's twirling another body on the spit. 
Ike stops in his tracks.  He turns back around in spite of himself. 
MAN (beginning his story) Imagine if you will, a small town in Maryland...

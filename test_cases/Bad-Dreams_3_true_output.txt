BERRISFORD I've looked in on you from time to time... but that's hardly an introduction. You've been transferred into my care, Cynthia. I*m Doctor S. A. Berrisford, Consulting Chief of Neuropsychiatry and head of the Berrisford Clinic. 
CYNTHIA (fumbling it) C-consulting Cheev-- Chief of-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
BERRISFORD Oh, forget all that.   Just call me what my staff does. 
CYNTHIA What's that? 
BERRISFORD God. 
Cynthia LAUGHS. She likes this man's directness, the way he doesn't condescend to her. 
22   INT./EXT. SUN DECK OR DAY ROOM - DAY                               22 Berrisford parks her and site down across from her. 
CYNTHIA What... what kind of doctor did you say you were? 
Berrisford notices one of the tissues on his neck.    Scowls, flicks it away. 
BERRISFORD Obviously, I'm not a surgeon. (as she laughs) I'm a psychiatrist. 
CYNTHIA (puzzled) Why do I need a psychiatrist? 
BERRISFORD Cynthia, you've been out of touch with reality for over ten years. Your recovery goes beyond your muscle tone... You have to ease into life... into interacting with other people again. Into a world that's changed so much that sometimes I get confused by it. (taking out an appointment book) Now, my assistant Dr. Goldman has a group therapy session every day... I'm putting you down for it, starting tomorrow... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA (unsure) Group therapy? But-- 
WASSERMAN'S VOICE Dr. Berrisford? 
23   NEW ANGLE                                                         23 Revealing Wasserman.    He shows his badge to the doctor. 
WASSERMAN I'm Lieutenant Wasserman. I left a message with your secretary...? 
BERRISFORD (rising, meeting him halfway) And I left one with your desk sergeant. (a hard whisper) I told you this would have to wait. You shouldn't even be here-- 
24   FAVORING CYNTHIA                                                  24 She can't help but listen as they continue in lowered tones. 
WASSERMAN I've waited fifteen years. That's long enough. Now I want to speak with Miss Weston. 
BERRISFORD Miss Weston is still recovering and is in no condition for a prolonged interrogation. 
WASSERMAN (tight smile) Then don't prolong it. I'll be brief with her, I'll be gentle with her-- 
BERRISFORD I'll let you know when she's ready-- 
CYNTHIA E--excuse me... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
25   ANGLE                                                            25 They turn and look at her. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Doctor Berrisford, what's this all about...? This man wants to talk to me...? 
Berrisford starts to answer, but Wasserman rushes in. 
WASSERMAN (quietly, slowly, as if to a child) That's right, Miss Weston. I just have a few easy, simple questions. (patient, phony smile) About you... and about Unity House. 
Cynthia looks at him strangely, turns to Berrisford. 
CYNTHIA (sotto) Why is he talking like that? Is he one of your patients? 
Wasserman burns.   Berrisford LAUGHS. 
BERRISFORD Lieutenant Wasserman is a police officer. And the word "patience" isn't part of his vocabulary. 
Wasserman scowls, not enjoying being the butt of a joke.    He resumes his normal tons, which is far from diplomatic. 
WASSERMAN Miss Weston. What's the last thing you remember before... 
CYNTHIA --Before the accident?   Nothing. 
WASSERMAN Then how do you know it was an accident? 
BERRISFORD Lieutenant!

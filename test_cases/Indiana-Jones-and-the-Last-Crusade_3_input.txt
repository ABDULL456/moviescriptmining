KNIGHT I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. 
The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY. 
INDY (gulp) Listen, I don't have time to explain, but 
At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups. 
DONOVAN Which one is it? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
KNIGHT You must choose. (beat) But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life the False Grail will take it from you. 
DONOVAN I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it? 
ELSA Let me choose. 
DONOVAN Thank you, Doctor. 
ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors. 
ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. 
DONOVAN instantly takes it from her. 
DONOVAN Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings. 
DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water. 
DONOVAN Eternal life! 
DONOVAN drinks from the goblet. 
Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA. 
DONOVAN What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .? 
He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes. 
ELSA gasps and screams. 
DONOVAN What. . . is . . . happening. . . ? 
His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.

INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL. 
KNIGHT He chose...poorly. 
INDY studies the array of chalices. 
ELSA It would not be made out of gold. 
INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug. 
INDY That's the cup of a carpenter. 
He and ELSA exchange a look. 
INDY There's only one way to find out. 
INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows. 
A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal. 
KNIGHT You have chosen wisely. But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. That is the boundary and the price of immortality. 
CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return. 
INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail. 
The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put down their guns and kneel. 
INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips. 
HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes. 
HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns to Henry's face. 
HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more... 
NAZI SOLDIERS 
run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them. 
SALLAH Drop your guns. Please. 
The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender. 
INDY (to HENRY) Dad, come on. Get to your feet. 
ELSA 
steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with possession of the Grail.

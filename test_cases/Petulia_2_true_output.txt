David rushes to Petulia. Of course the orange did no damage whatever, but there is an abrupt tension between them. He flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange, 
DAVID Papa went with her at the last minute. Petulia REACTS, shocked. 
DAVID 
(CONTINUING) She was so pale and seared. They aren't even pressurized. The plane. You suck on a tube and hope it's oxygen. 
S During this he has peeled the orange and torn it into segments, which he now tries to feed her. 
DAVID Open. 
PETULIA How could he have gone? Just like that? 
DAVID Where mama is concerned, papa is a very loving man. Open. Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems about to leave the yacht. 
DAVID Please don't. 
PETULIA He Dromised; 
DAVID Honey. It'll be okay, Cross my heart. 
0 PETULTA He promised. 
0 97C Continued A middle-aged couple are passing by on their way to their luxurious yacht which is anchored close by. They are trailed by a rather tacky Mari-ache trio, 
W OMAN Hello there you gorgeous people. Everyone's invited for Margueritas and cha-cha-cha. 
PETULIA 
(DAZEDLY) Mr. and Mrs. Danner are gone, 
WOMAN (a`s corny as this) Oooh la la; Lucky you; The group goes off, toward their yacht. Petulia doesn't know what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly, Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great. 
97D EXT. YACHT NIGHT 
Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight David is humming along with the music. 
PETULIA We didn't have to come back this early.. 
DAVID You're still not one hundred per cent well. They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside. Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps into the cabin. 
97E INTO CABIN 
DAVID Icy hands. 
PETULIA Warm heart. 
97E Continued 
DAVID So they say, Petulia says nothing. She begins undressing, 
DAVID 
(CONTINUING) I didn't tell papa to leave. She doesn't answer. 
DAVID 
(CONTINUING) He only had the clothes on his back. She doesn't answer. 
DAVID

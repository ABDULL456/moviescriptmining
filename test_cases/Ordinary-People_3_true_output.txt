JEANNINE That was dumb. Forget it. Just forget it. Now start over. 
CONRAD Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett... 
JEANNINE (interrupting) ) I'd love to. When? 
Conrad laughs. 
74   EXT. STREET JARRETT'S HOME ­ DAY                           74 
[Happy music] Calvin and Conrad happily come back home with a Christmas tree on top of car. 
75   INT. JARRETT'S LIVING ROOM ­ DAY                           75 
Christmas tree standing in living room ready to be decorated. Bet silently comes in. Calvin finally notices she is here. 
CALVIN I didn't see you there. What do you think? 
BETH (cold) Fine. 
CALVIN Rawlins used to have such great Scotch pines. And they all look like skeletons this year. 
Conrad comes in with a box of chritsmas tree decorations 
CONRAD Hi. What do you think? 
(CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED:                                                 75 
BETH (cold) Very nice. 
Conrad and Calvin stop at the tone of her voice. 
CALVIN What's wrong? 
BETH (cold) Why don't you ask him what's wrong? Maybe you won't have to hear it from Carol Lazenby. 
CALVIN Hear what? 
CONRAD Dad, I quit the swim team. 
CALVIN What? 
BETH Carol thought I knew. Cos why wouldn't I? It happened over a month ago. 
CALVIN Quit? When? Where have you been every night? 
CONRAD Nowhere. Around. The library mostly. 
CALVIN Why didn't you tell us, Connie? 
CONRAD I don't know, I didn't think it mattered. 
CALVIN What do you mean? Why wouldn't it matter? Of course it matters. And... 
BETH (interrupting) No, that was meant for me, Calvin. 
CALVIN What was meant for you? 
(CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED:                                                   75 
BETH It's really important to try to hurt me. Isn't it? 
CONRAD Don't you have that backwards? 
BETH Oh? And how do I hurt you? By embarrassing you in front of a friend? Poor Beth! She has no idea what her son is up to! He lies and she believes every word of it. 
CONRAD I didn't lie! 
BETH You did! You lied everytime you came into this house at 6:30 ! If it's starting all over again, the lying, the covering up, the disappearing for hours, I will not stand for it! I can't stand it! I really can't! 
CONRAD Well don't then! Go to Europe! 
CALVIN Connie! Now, Connie! Connie!... 
CONRAD Cos the only reason she cares, the only reason she gives a fuck about it... 
CALVIN Connie!... 
CONRAD ...is because someone else knew about it first! 
CALVIN Just stop it, Connie! ... 
CONRAD No! You tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing! And I know why she never came to the hospital, she's busy going to goddamn Spain and... goddamn Portugal! Why should she care if I'm hung up by the balls out there? 
(CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED:                                                 75 
BETH Maybe this is how they sit around and talk at the hospital, but we're not at the hospital now. 
CONRAD You never came to the hospital! 
CALVIN How   do you know she never came? You   know she came but she had the flu   and couldn't come inside, but she   came. 
CONRAD Yeah! She wouldn't have had any flu if Buck was in the hospital! She would have come if Buck was in the hospital! 
BETH Buck never would've been in the hospital! 
Conrad takes his head between his hands and runs upstairs. 
CALVIN That's enough! That is enough!

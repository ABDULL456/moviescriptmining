He opens the case and takes the trumpet out. 
He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, a smile on his lips. 
He starts to play SAETA. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT 
Back to the opening scene.  The whole room ablaze.  Danny lying on the bed, playing the horn. 
DANNY (V.O.) So what is it?  Who am I after it's all said and done? 
Pieces of the roof start falling in. 
DANNY (cont'd) Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne? (beat) Avenging angel or plain old Judas? 
He stops playing. 
DANNY (cont'd) (weakly) You decide, friend.  You decide. 
He closes his eyes. 
DANNY (cont'd) I'm too tired ... so you decide. 
He drops his trumpet and lays his head back. 
CUT TO: 
BLACK SCREEN 
THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames. 
CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room. 
DANNY (V.O.) Oh shit. What is this? 
Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway. 
Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float. 
DANNY (cont'd) Am I dead? 
A linoleum floor rushes underneath. 
DANNY (cont'd) Linoleum.  This must be hell. 
Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ... 
...  A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF.  The tattoo smiles and speaks. 
TATTO (warped, distorted) Hang in there buddy. 
Stairs rush by underneath.  Then another hallway. 
DANNY'S P.O.V.  - a bright white light at the end of the hall. 
DANNY (cont'd) Oh no.  What a fucking clich√©. 
On Danny's face, floating through the hall.  His eyes fluttering. 
MOVING TOWARDS the light.  Closer.  Closer. 
Danny's eyes close, his head droops. 
FADE TO WHITE: 
CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open. 
DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ... 
... JIMMY staring down at him with concern. 
Danny blinks his eyes again.  Looks up at ... 
... A PARAMEDIC working on him. 
Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy. 
Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his face. 
The paramedic continues to work on Danny.  His eyes slowly close. 
FADE OUT. FADE IN: 
EXT. THE CITY - DAY 
Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop.  He looks like a new man. 
DANNY (V.O.) Well, I've had some time to think about it and it's pretty simple after all.  I guess it's like the man said - "Man is the measure of all things." I should know.  I ran the gamut. Avenging Angel, Judas, loving husband, prodigal son, prince of Denmark.  I was all of those things. (beat) Tom Van Allen got his revenge. Good for Tom.  And Danny Flynne? He got gut-shot for being the low-life rat that he was.  Sucks for him. (beat) But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead. 
Danny looks through the window of the shop. 
Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee. 
DANNY (cont'd) But what about this guy? Who is he? 
Danny enters the shop.

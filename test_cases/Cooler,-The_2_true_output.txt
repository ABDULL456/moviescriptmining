PINKERTON What the fuck you smiling at, bitch? 
Pinkerton starts to lose it. Security moves in, right on time. Natalie shoots Bernie a satisfied look. He averts his eyes shyly and limps away. She stares after him for a moment. 
INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT 
BUDDY STAFFORD, the Paradise Lounge's star attraction, is performing on stage. He's a poor man's Tony Bennett. Mid to late 60's. A staple at the Paradise for the last 20 years. 
The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, almost tripping over his microphone cable. 
Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in a boxer's defensive stance. It's classic Buddy Stafford schtick. 
From somewhere across the lounge, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN jumps up and throws her panties at Buddy. Buddy catches them and waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by... 
We PAN ACROSS to Shelly seated at his corner booth, in the company of Nicky Fingers, Larry and Marty. 
TIGHT ON SHELLY as he focuses on Buddy. A smile threatens his patented stoicism. He's flashing back on the old days. 
While Nicky and Marty are clearly enjoying Buddy's performance, Larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes. 
We take on LARRY'S POV of Buddy -- 
SLOW MOTION CLOSE-UPS of BUDDY SINGING. The MUSIC SLOWED DOWN with the action, emphasizing Buddy's lack of energy. 
Sweat dripping off Buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny jewels against his microphone. Buddy's tired eyes. Shaking hands around the mic. 
SMASH CUT to real time APPLAUSE as Buddy reaches the end of the song. Larry is the only one not clapping. RACK ACROSS to Shelly as he picks up on this. 
INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT 
Shelly approaches Buddy's dressing room. He enters without knocking... 
INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
...to find a trembling Buddy hunched over on a sofa, hugging himself. Buddy immediately sits up... 
BUDDY Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me into going on. (massages his throat) It's definitely strep. 
SHELLY You were velvet out there, pops. Silk. 
Shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to Buddy. We see a room number scribbled on the crotch area. 
SHELLY They were hanging on the door outside. Forget your tonsils. When the muff confetti stops coming, that's when you got yourself a problem. 
BUDDY (dangling the panties on his finger) You get a receipt? 
SHELLY Excuse me? 
BUDDY Charmayne's in the lobby. They got these on sale in the window. Victoria Secret's Valentine's Collection. And the broad waiting in the room, what she set you back? Always Grade-A for Ol' Buddy. 
SHELLY Are you kidding me? Gimme that. (snatches the panties away from Buddy) You don't fucking deserve this. All those ladies going home with a sweet breeze between their legs because you still do it for them and you're fingering me for some kinda Buddy Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you, old man. 
Shelly feigns as if he's leaving. 
BUDDY (affectionately) Get back here, you prick. Hand it over. 
Shelly throws the panties back at Buddy. Buddy just stares at him with pained eyes, waiting for something else. Sweat mirror balls his wrinkled forehead. 
Shelly nods. Removes a foil package from his pocket. Hands it to Buddy. The singer rushes over to his dressing table. 
Unwraps his works. Rubber tubes his forearm. Trembling hands juggle lighter and hypodermic. 
Shelly takes a seat on the sofa. Buddy, euphoric as the dope hits the spot. Tears in his eyes. He picks up on Shelly's somber expression in the mirror.

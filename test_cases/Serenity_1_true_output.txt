SIMON Guests? I earn my passage, Captain -- 
MAL And it's time your little sister learned from your fine example. 
SIMON I've earned my passage treating bullet holes, knife wounds, laser burns... 
MAL Some of our jobs are trickier than others -- 
SIMON And you want to put my sister in the middle of that. 
MAL Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'. It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine. The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of: 
INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUING 
Into which the two men step. 
SIMON She's a seventeen year old girl. A mentally traumatized sevente-- 
J 
MAL She's a reader. Sees into the truth of things; might see trouble before it's coming. Which is of use to me. 
SIMON And that's your guiding star, isn't it? What's of use. 
MAL 
(LAUGHS) Honestly, doctor, I think we may really crash this time anyway. Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm. 
SIMON Do you understand what I've gone through to keep River away from the Alliance? 
MAL I do, and it's a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves. 
SIMON Are you threatening to -- 
MAL I got one purpose here: keep this boat in the air. I take the jobs I get -- which is less and less, case you ain't been keeping track. He starts away, Simon still keeping pace. 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) Every year since the war the Alliance pushes just a little further out towards the rim. Makes it a chore for naughty men like us to slip about -- and keeping you two on board means working twice as hard to avoid the law. Means turning down a score of honest jobs.

INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING 
They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity. 
MAL So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you. Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him: 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) Things get gritty I will keep her from the fray, but she's coming. Best you get her ready. As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it. 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this boat out before we get flattened? 
ZOE Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody flies like my mister. The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on the catwalk, and track with them to find: 
SIMON River... She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose summer dress draped over her small frame. 
RIVER I know. We're going for a ride. 
EXT. LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY 
Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens. 
INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING 
The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship. The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to River in the back: 
SIMON Now, River, you stay behind the others. If there's fighting you drop to the floor or run away. It's okay to leave them to die. River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother. 
RIVER I'm the brains of the operation.

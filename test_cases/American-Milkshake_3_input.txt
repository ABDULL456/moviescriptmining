The team of Blair Blazers sit together, their heads moving in unison, following the action. 
At the end of the bench are ARIUS and Jolie. ARIUS, covered in sweat, is a tall thin, care-free, light-skinned black kid. He has a huge scar on his head, a thick red headband and band- aids over his earrings. 
Jolie is bone dry and still in his warm up suit. 
ARIUS Now it comes with two free controllers and the game. 
JOLIE (not paying attention) Oh yeah. 
ARIUS Yeah. We were playing that joint at my place and one of the cheerleaders was all confessing how cute she thinks you are. 
JOLIE (EXCITED) Which one? 
ARIUS (points to the cheerleader BENCH) Christine Ortanyez. 
Jolie focuses in on a particularly cute Panamanian cheerleader - CHRISTINE ORTANYEZ. 
JOLIE POV: slow motion of Christine - taps her palms and does a leg kick then looks directly at us. 
COACH DALE Jolie! 
Jolie flinches. 
Coach Dale - in afine suit and gold rimmed glasses - glares. 
COACH DALE(CONT'D) Get Pistol. 
Jolie rips off his warm-ups in a panic. The shirt gets stuck over his head, then he trips over his pants. 
His teammates look on with various expressions of concern and laughter. 
A cheerleader from the opposing team points and giggles. 
REDHEAD GRUNGE KID (O.S.) Unsnap it! 
Struggling, Jolie frees himself. 
Coach Dale shakes his head and so does the fat black man directly behind him. Their expressions match exactly. 
The old white referee blows his whistle hard - game over. 
All the Blazers start high-fiving each other but Jolie. 
INT. JOLIE'S MESSY ROOM - NIGHT 
A six foot long poster of a '91 Lamborghini Countach covers the wall. A Nerf basketball hoop hangs on the closed door. 
Haroon is dressed up as a woman, using a wig, socks as breasts, and a sheet as a skirt. 
HAROON Come on man, we've gotta nail the Marion Barry skit tomorrow or I'm gonna get a B in English. 
JOLIE I don't feel like it. I told you. 
Jolie throws an African hat and tap shoes off his bed and they smash against the wall. 
HAROON Dude, it's was just a preseason game, come on. 
JOLIE Man, if I can't get in when we're up thirty in the preseason then I'm never gonna play. 
Jolie pulls off his jersey and throws it down. He picks up a switch blade and looks at his warped reflection. 
HAROON He tried to put you in the game. 
JOLIE Yeah, for thirty seconds. 
There's a knock on the door. 
Jolie wipes a teary eye and straights up. 
ELLIOTT, Jolie's oddly old dad - enters with a bright orange Nerf ball off the bedside table. 
ELLIOTT Three. Two. (PUMP FAKE) One. 
Elliott dunks and freezes in mid air. 
He makes the sounds of a sold out crowd, animatedly, in a comforting way.

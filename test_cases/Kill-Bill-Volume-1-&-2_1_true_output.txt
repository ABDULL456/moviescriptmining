BILL So we drove down to the beach, had a little funeral, and gave Emilio a burial at sea. And right now I'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. But the point being, our child learned two very important lessons. One, about life and death. The other, somethings once you do, they 
can't be undone. I knew just how she felt (to B.B.) You loved Emilio, didn't you? 
B.B. Uh-huh. 
BILL Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I did to Mommy what you did to Emilio. 
B.B. You stomped on Mommy? 
BILL Worse. (making his finger a gun) I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot, like we were just doing. I shot her for real. 
B.B. Why? 
BILL I don't know. 
B.B. Did you want to see what would happen? 
BILL No, I   knew what   would happen to Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what would   happen to   me. 
B.B. What happened? 
BILL I was very sad. And that was when I learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone. 
B.B. What happened to Mommy? 
BILL Why don't you ask Mommy. 
B.B. Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt? 
BILL No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore. 
B.B. Did it make you sick? 
MOMMY It put me to sleep. That's why I haven't been with you B.B., I've been asleep. 
B.B. But you're awake now, right? 
MOMMY I'm wide awake, pretty girl. 
EXT. PORCH - DAWN 
Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and the sea. 
Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps across from him. 
Between them the dawn sky breaks. 
BILL Did she go to sleep easy? 
THE BRIDE It took her a little bit. She was excited. She's quite the little chatterbox. 
BILL Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. But if she likes you, you can't shut her up. She's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards. 
He holds up the bottle of vino. 
BILL Red wine? 
She shakes her blonde head, no. 
BILL C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya. 
She gives him a look. 
BILL (pointing towards the beach) We're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we? 
She shakes her blonde head, yes. 
BILL Well, I've already had    a glass. So unless you want to win    by an unfair advantage, you should    have a glass of wine. So we're both    on the same footing wine wise. 
She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red. 
BILL You know, there's an old man down here, his name is Esteban Viharo. He was a pimp. I knew him when I was a child. He was a friend of my mother's. I told him about you. When I showed him your picture he smiles and said; (imitating his accent) "Yesss, I see the attraction." He told me a story about taking me to the movies when I was five. It was a movie which had Lana Turner in it. And whenever she would appear on screen, he said I would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount. And he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes. 
THE BRIDE Who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father? 
BILL Well not you, that's for damn sure. 
She gives him another look. 
THE BRIDE Must we have to endure your little zingers? 
BILL No we mustn't. But if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, I will resist the temptation. 
THE BRIDE Baby, you don't have a future. 
Bill drinks some wine. 
BILL I sent you to L.A. and you never came back. I thought you'd been killed. Do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead? I mourned you. Then in the third month of my mourning, I track you down. I wasn't trying to track you down, I was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who I thought killed you. And when I find you, what to I find? Not only are you not dead, you're getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you're pregnant? How do you expect me to react? 
THE BRIDE Why do you think I hid? 
BILL Why did you leave in the first place? You have cold eyes towards me now. I understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time I saw them, or was that just my imagination? 
THE BRIDE No. 
The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts will be shown on the screen. 
To give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in Japanese; 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) You sent me to L.A. to kill that lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong. 
Bill interrupts her. 
BILL (ENGLISH) You are you talking in Japanese? 
The Bride explodes; 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) What the hell do you care what I talk in? Don't you know when to keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to tell you what you want to know, if you'll just shut up and listen and stop talking! Now may I continue? 
BILL You're right, I'm wrong, continue. 
THE BRIDE The morning I left, I threw up. I don't feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane, I threw up. When I got to my hotel, I threw up. So naturally I started thinking, maybe I might be pregnant. So I bought one of those home pregnancy kits. Went back to my room and took the test. The little strip said blue. I was going to have a baby. I tried to call you, but you weren't there, so I just thought I'd call back later. 
BILL But you never did. 
THE BRIDE - Would you shut up, I'm trying to tell you how I feel. 
BILL My apologies, please continue. 
THE BRIDE So I just figured I'd call you back later. I was just so happy, I put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. What I didn't know, was at some leg of my journey, I was spotted. With me in Los Angeles it didn't take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. So she sent an assassin of her own to 
kill me in my hotel room. As I was dancing in euphoria, the killer came down the hall. 
There's a knock on the hotel room door. 
The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole. 
PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers. 
The Bride says through the door; 
THE BRIDE Hello, can I help you? 
HOTEL WOMAN Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel. I have a welcome gift from the management. 
Seeing it through the peephole. 
THE BRIDE Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later? 
As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she bends down to pick it up... 
WHEN...

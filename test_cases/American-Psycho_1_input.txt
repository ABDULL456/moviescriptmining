BATEMAN No problem. (Buzzing Jean) 
JEAN (O.S.) Yes, Patrick? 
BATEMAN Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. 
KIMBALL What can you tell me about Paul Owen? 
BATEMAN Well... 
He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows them dry. 
KIMBALL How well did you know him? 
BATEMAN I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know. 
KIMBALL Yale thing? 
A pause. 
BATEMAN Yeah...Yale thing. 
KIMBALL What do you mean...Yale thing? 
A pause. 
BATEMAN Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing. 
A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner becomes deafening. 
KIMBALL So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen? 
BATEMAN He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. 
KIMBALL What kind of man was he? Besides... (He hesitates tries to smile) the information you've just given. 
BATEMAN I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. 
KIMBALL Do you feel that way? 
BATEMAN No. Not really. 
KIMBALL (As he writes without looking up) Where did Paul hang out? 
BATEMAN Hang...out? 
KIMBALL Yeah. You know...hang out. 
BATEMAN Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places. 
KIMBALL He had a yacht? 
BATEMAN No, he just hung out there. 
KIMBALL And where did he go to school? 
A slight pause. 
BATEMAN Don't you know this? 
KIMBALL I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help. 
KIMBALL I understand. 
He makes another note. 
KIMBALL Anything else you can tell me about Owen? 
BATEMAN We were both seven in 1969. 
KIMBALL (Smiles) So was I. 
BATEMAN Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? 
KIMBALL Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.

BERNIE I did this to myself. I planted the seed. When Angela took off with Mikey, I didn't... I never made an effort to get back in his life. I figured, the kid don't need a loser for a father. Now it's all come full circle. I give him the money, I open the door to all this... I musta had it coming. Payback. 
Natalie's hand lowers the needle onto the Sinatra record. 
"Nice 'n' Easy" starts up. 
She walks over to Bernie, takes the bottle away. Helps him to his feet. 
He gives himself over to her reassuring embrace. Natalie raises Bernie's face to her's. 
NATALIE Bernie, it's a big world out there. If you just took off -- if we took off. 
Bernie shakes his head. It's too late for that now. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT 
Natalie staring up at the ceiling, Bernie nuzzled against her. Her features appear softer than ever. Luminous in the moonlight. Realization moist in her eyes. 
NATALIE You awake, Bernie? 
He grunts something inaudible. 
NATALIE I -- think I love you. 
Bernie tenses up. Huh? 
NATALIE No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain of it. 
Bernie raises his head, not quite sure he heard her right. 
Natalie sits up, hugs her knees. Bernie finds himself staring at her back. 
NATALIE You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I never saw this coming. You shouldn't do that to a girl. 
Bernie reaches out, caresses her back. She emits a shiver... 
NATALIE There's still things you don't know... should know... I don't want to ruin it... 
Bernie pulls Natalie back toward him. 
BERNIE It won't make any difference, Natalie. Whatever you come clean about, I'm not gonna feel any different about you. I'd say the words, but with my luck... 
NATALIE Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten luck. That's overs. 
BERNIE (a beat) I love you, Natalie. 
Natalie smothers her lips against Bernie's. He enshrouds her in his arms. Fade out... 
INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Fade into SOFT FOCUS. Slowing taking form... A CAT'S FACE seen in extreme close-up. 
WIDER -- to reveal the cat resting on Bernie's chest. She MEOWS as he stirs awake. He's stunned to see her there. 
BERNIE Trixie? 
The cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty food bowl. Meows again. Bernie breaks into a wide smile. 
BERNIE Trix. You came back. 
Bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming in through the blinds. Huh? This is a first for him. He's never gotten direct sunlight in his room before. What's the deal? Did the world just turn on its axis?

FRY Oh, Christ.... 
They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an emergency light, climbing wall-rungs... 
INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the interior. Her face dies. 
ZEKE (V.O.) (shouting) Well? Is it just the pump? 
FRY Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink! 
INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY 
Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container has an access door. 
PARIS Mine here.... 
As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed. 
FRY S'matter? 
JOHNS Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep. 
Paris opens his container to reveal... 
INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY 
Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings. 
JOHNS King Tut's tomb.... 
PARIS Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare. 
They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151. 
FRY This is it? Booze? That's what you have to drink? 
PARIS (educating her) 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts." 
JOHNS (cracking a bottle) A toast to whatever he just said. 
PARIS I'll need a receipt for that. (to Fry) For all these. 
FRY Top of my list. 
She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with both envy and aversion. 
FRY I don't suppose.... 
IMAM One of the Christian habits we didn't adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait. 
JOHNS For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you? 
IMAM All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there. 
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it is... 
Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead, he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through. 
Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint. 
Free, he reaches for the cutting torch. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping. Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby. It's Riddick's mouth-bit. 
JOHNS Like we needed another way to die. 
INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY 
FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled back and dumped into... 
INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

FLAN Hello? PAUL returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted bowls. 
PAUL Seconds? THEY laugh and are served. 
OUISA Have you declared your major yet? 
PAUL You're like all parents. What's your major? 
FLAN Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles the students give courses. 
OUISA The Holocaust and Ethics? 
FLAN Krauts and Doubts. 
OUISA I think we're lucky having this dinner. Isn't this the finest time? A toast to you. 
GEOFFREY To Cats! 
FLAN Blunt question. What's he like? 
OUISA reaches for the bottle of wine. 
OUISA Let's not be star fuckers. 
FLAN I'm not a star fucker. 
PAUL My father, being an actor, has no real identity. You say to him, Pop, what's new? And he says, 'I got an interesting script today. I was asked to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell apart. My wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter. And I sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged. But I hold firm. In spite of prejudice because I want to get back to my wife. Out of this forest,back to the church... .' And my father is in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real event, this is some script that was sent to you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he has no memory--only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents. That's his past. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR Can it be? The CROWD listening to FLAN and OUISA is even larger. 
OUISA I just loved the kid so much. I wanted to reach out to him. 
FLAN And then we asked him what his thesis was on. 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S DINING ROOM 
GEOFFREY The one that was stolen. Please? 
PAUL Well... (HE takes a deep breath and leans back in 
HIS CHAIR) A substitute teacher out on Long Island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student. A few weeks later, the teacher returned to the classroom, shot the student unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor described the teacher as a nice boy. Always reading Catcher In the Rye. The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said he did it because he wanted to-`draw the attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and the reading of that book would be his defense. And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan and his press secretary said if you want my defense all you have to do is read catcher in the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again. 
FLAN I haven't read it in years. OUISA shushes FLAN. 
PAUL I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because I wanted to see what she had underlined and I read this book to find out why this touching, beautiful, sensitive story published in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of hate. I started reading. : It's exactly as I remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: "My brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute." Page three: "what a phony slob his father was." Page nine: "People never notice anything." Then on page twenty two my hair stood up. Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap. "A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of closed one eye like I was taking aim at it. This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people in this hat." 
PAUL (CONTINUES) Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than I ever dreamed of. Then on p. 89 "I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what scares me most is the other guy's face..." I finished the book. It's a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self involved. In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent. FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed. And what alarms me about that book--not the book so much as the aura about it--is this: the book is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't function. And at the end before he can run away and start a new life, it starts to rain and he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett be the great modern theme. The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For Godot--"Let's go." "Yes, let's go." Stage directions: They do not move. But the aura around this book of Salinger's-- which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times- --the death of the imagination. Because what else is paralysis? The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL. 
PAUL (CONTINUES) The imagination has been so debased that imagination--being imaginative-- rather than being the lynch pin of our existence now stands as a synonym for something outside ourselves like Science fiction or some new use for tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so 
IMAGINATIVE--- The imagination has moved out of the realm of being our link, our most personal link, with our inner lives and the world outside that world-- this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match up with what's out there? Why has imagination become a synonym for style? I believe that the imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world. I believe the imagination is another phrase for what is most uniquely Is. 
Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious. Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the faces we face are not the other guys' but our own faces. And it's the worst kind of yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself. To face ourselves. That's the hard thing. The imagination. That's God's gift to make the act of self- examination bearable. 
PAUSE. FLAN, GEOFFREY, OUISA are very moved. 
OUISA Well, indeed. 
FLAN I hope your muggers read every word. 
OUISA (chiding FLAN) 
DARLING 
GEOFFREY I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at the airport and read it. 
OUISA Cover to cover 
PAUL I'll test you. I should be going. PAUL starts to go. THEY follow. THE DINING ROOM opens into 
THE LIVING ROOM. 
FLAN Where will you stay? 
OUISA Not some flea bag. 
PAUL I get into the Sherry tomorrow morning. It's not so far off. I can walk around. I don't think they'll mug me twice in one evening. FLAN and OUISA take's PAUL's by the arm and leads him down the hall into 
THEIR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM. 
OUISA You'll stay here tonight.

VIDEO SARAH You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him... (she gestures are the attendant) everybody... you're all fucking dead! 
She is raving, half out of her chair.  The orderly moves to inject her with something. 
VIDEO SARAH You're the one living in a dream, Silberman, not me!  Because I know it happens.  It happens! 
31C     Silberman pauses the tape... freezing Sarah's contorted face. Real Sarah turns away from the screen, he expression stony. 
SARAH I was afraid... and confused.  I feel much better, now.  Clearer. 
Silberman gives a calculated paternal smile. 
SILBERMAN Yes.  Your attitude have been very positive lately. 
Sarah looks up at him.  Her voice is hopeful. 
SARAH It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to. 
SILBERMAN And what it that? 
As she answers, WE PULL BACK, revealing that we have been looking through a one-way mirror from an adjacent OBSERVATION ROOM.  In the shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the earlier rounds, and a couple of STAFF PSYCHOLOGISTS.  They smoke and make the occasional note. 
SARAH You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son. 
SILBERMAN I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist? 
CLOSE ON SARAH.  Her voice sounds hollow. 
SARAH They don't exist.  I see that now. 
Silberman leans back, studying her.  Toying with her. 
SILBERMAN But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press. 
SARAH If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory. 
SILBERMAN I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up? 
Sarah shakes her head no. 
CUT TO: 
32      EXT. CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS - DAY 
The corporate headquarters of a mega-electronic corporation.  As imposing cubist castle of black glass. 
33      INT. SECOND FLOOR/ELEVATORS 
The elevator doors slide open with a whisper and MILES DYSON strides out.  Black.  In his early thirties.  The star of the Special Projects Division.  He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.  Dyson walks down the corridor, swinging his arms... a man in a hurry.  A man with much to do. 
He reaches a solid security door and zips his ELECTRONIC KEY-CARD through the scanner.  The door unlocks with a clunk. The sign next to the door reads: SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. 
34      INT. SECURITY STATION 
He nods to the guards as he passes through the security checkpoint. They can see all activities on the floor on their bank of monitors. He unlocks another service door with his card and enters -- 
35      INT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (A.I.) LAB 
The lab is quite large, comprising banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly areas.  Extremely high tech. 
DYSON Greetings, troops. 
He is jokingly saluted by fellow members.  Not a lab coat in sight. This is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd.  All young and bright. They sit at their consoles drinking Coke and changing technology as we know it.  A young LAB ASSISTANT rushes over to Dyson.  Name tag says he's BRYANT. 
BRYANT Mr. Dyson?  The material teams wants to run another test on the uh... on it. 
DYSON Yup.  Come on.  I'll get it. 
Dyson produces an unusual-looking KEY from his pocket as they stride through the lab.  Bryant has to hustle to keep up. 
BRYANT Listen, Mr. Dyson, I know I haven't been here that long, but I was wondering if you could tell me... I mean, if you know... 
DYSON Know what? 
BRYANT Well... where it came from. 
DYSON I asked them that question once.  Know what they told me?  Don't ask.

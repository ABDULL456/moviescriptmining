{"train": "FADE IN: \nEXT. SPACE \nA small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction. Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it. \nPUSH DOWN TO: \nEXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE \nStrange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as Vesuvius erupted. \nANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING \nThe creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very different context, but for now, he is running from the ever- growing mist that threatens to engulf him. \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC \nAs Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him. \nARBLUS Transform and flee, Kranix! You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid. \nKRANIX Arblus!   No! \nANGLE ON KRANIX \nThe mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a small rocket ship and... \nTRACK WITH KRANIX AS... \nHe takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere, we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb with a gaping maw and a field of electricity. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct collision course with... \nMOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE \nThere are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish metal one. \nNARRATOR It is the year 2005. The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron. But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland. \nCLOSER ON GREEN MOON \nAt first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then, pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon camouflage \"netting\" and underneath it is a huge cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on Cybertron. \nANGLE ON IRONHIDE \nHe peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned on Cybertron. \nIRONHIDE Every time I look into this thing, my circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops? \nANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME \nHe stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion plans for Cybertron. \nOPTIMUS PRIME We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide. \nIRONHIDE Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth. I'll bring you back more cubes than you'll know what to do with. \nANGLE ON PRIME \nHe solemnly hands down an order \nPRIME Alright, ready the shuttle for launch. \nANGLE ON IRONHIDE \nHe raises a fist in a warwhoop! \nIRONHIDE YAHOO! (looking into monitor) Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps. \nA SMALL MOON \"MOUNTAIN\" \nIronhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility. \nOPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.) Jazz,    report security status. \nCOMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES \nJAZZ No sign of Decepticons in this sector, Prime. \nPRIME What about Moon Base 2? \nJAZZ Jazz to Moon Base 2. \nPAN UP   and through the sky to - \nANOTHER MOON This is the second moon. It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one. This is where Bumblebee and Spike are stationed. \nJAZZ (V.O.) Jazz to Moon Base 2. \nBRAWN is cut in half by Megatron's blast. \nON PROWL as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN. \nTHE INSECTICONS ...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for... ...an ARMY of other Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter, firing. \nIRONHIDE AND RATCHET \nWhile FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments. \nON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON \nAs they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons flood past them, taking positions and searching for other living Autobots. \nMEGATRON This was almost too easy, Starscream. \nSTARSCREAM Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat: the Autobots moon base. \nMEGATRON You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another one. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MEGATRON (CONT'D) But when we slip by their security systems in their own ship and destroy Autobot city, the Autobots will be vanquished forever! \nIRONHIDE Fat chance, Megatron! \nIronhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings him against the wall. \nMEGATRON Such heroic nonsense! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. EARTH - CLOSE SHOT- MINIATURE RADAR SCREEN \nA child's hands hold a scanner device which tracks a TRAVELING BLIP across a star map towards a pulsing dot which represents the Earth. \nDANIEL (V.O.) The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint zeta. \nON DANIEL Daniel, a classic twelve year old American boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned \"fishin' hole\" on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and shrubs, and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line floating lazily out on the water. \nDANIEL Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button, and watches, it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy hillside we change angle to feature... \nHOT ROD an \"adolescent\" Autobot. He is in robot mode, sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers, looking bored with it all. \nHOT ROD (CONT'D) Talk about dull......! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThen, he tosses the rod into the water. \nON DANIEL RIDING HIS HOVERBOARD UP THE HILL \nDANIEL (calling excitedly) Hurry or we'll miss it! \nHOT ROD lopes up hill after Daniel. \nHOT ROD (CONT'D) If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel, scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat. \nANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY \nFOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about. (DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts. Near all of these various things are energon compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up into neighboring hills for an overview of the - \nCIRCULAR LANDING AREA \nwhich resides within the \"bowl\" created by the City structure and natural surroundings. \nDANIEL Hey!   Let me out. \nHOT ROD Why settle for a peek when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDANIEL But we're not supposed to go beyond City limits! \nHOT ROD Chromo-Chicken! \nON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS \nKUP - a grizzled, \"old Soldier\" of an Autobot - is directing the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod barrels through a sign which reads: \"STOP -THIS AREA OFF LIMITS\", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind \nKUP disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the mountain. \nKUP (CONT'D) (to sound like swearing) Cam bustin', turbo revvin' young punk. \nCUT TO: \nMOUNTAIN ABOVE AUTOBOT CITY- LOOKOUT POINT \nHot Rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside and TRANSFORMS back to humanoid mode. Daniel rushes to a set of PUBLIC VIEWING BINOCULARS and peers into them. \nCONTINUED: \nON BLITZWING about to fire, when... \n...Kup's arm descends into SHOT, spinning Blitzwing's turret around. Blitzwing's blast, scorches... \nSHRAPNEL who is flying nearby. \nBLITZWING transforms to robot mode and turns as... Kup comes flying, feet first, into Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain ledge. \nFOLLOW Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just coming to a stop at the bottom with Daniel. \nHOT ROD Not bad for an old timer! \nKUP (gruffly) Old timer?! That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city. You know what we used to do with cocky, insubordinate upstarts? \nHOT ROD (interrupting) Save it. \nSTARSCREAM transforming into jet mode, fires on them with laser bursts which... \n... chew up the ground beside them. \nHOT ROD AND KUP \nwith Daniel race toward Autobot City, transforming into vehicle mode as shots gouge the terrain around them. \nCUT TO: \nPERCEPTOR IN MICROSCOPE MODE ON \"BATTLEMENT\" OF AUTOBOT CITY \nhe watches... \nPERCEPTOR'S POV - THE DECEPTICON ATTACK \nMegatron, Insecticons, Constructicons, and other Decepticon forces attack the city from the sky and ground. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERCEPTOR transforms to humanoid and runs toward...... ... Three new Autobots, ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod's age, SPRINGER, a very muscular and bantering \"Indiana Jones\" type Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and soldierly City Commander. \nPERCEPTOR Ultra Magnus.....a cursory evaluation of Decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficit! \nULTRA MAGNUS In other words, Perceptor... \nSPRINGER (translating) We're outnumbered! \nHe turns and FIRES from his hip. \nDIRGE IN JET MODE \nZooms in to strafe as... \nSPRINGER'S BLAST... \n...Explodes on his wing tip. \nSPRINGER, ULTRA MAGNUS AND OTHERS \nas Decepticon BOMBS AND LASER FIRE pour in on the City. \nULTRA MAGNUS Springer, Arcee, transform Autobot City! \nHIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN ON COURTYARD - TRACKING SPRINGER AND ARCEE \nSTARSCREAM (V.O.)

Just then, the floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping Starscream's foot. \nSTARSCREAM Agggggggh!     My foot! \nANGLE ON SPRINGER AND ARCEE \nas they make it through an archway which TRANSFORMS INTO A STEEL SHIELD as they run through \nON STARSCREAM - HIS FOOT STILL CAUGHT IN \"CLAM\" OF COURTYARD \nHe struggles to get free before he is crunched by the still transforming city. In the nick of time, he shoots a \"shoe horn\" like projection from his wrist and pulls his boot free, then... ...dodges away. ... The \"clam\" shape RETRACTS COMPLETELY and more armored shielding SLIDES INTO PLACE TO COVER where the Courtyard was. He winces in mid-air and flies away as the city continues to transform to a fortress below. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRANSFORMING CITY \nThe towers and buildings of the city, picot and retract.. ... withdrawing like periscopes, turning and vanishing into steel shield coverings. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMEGATRON Soundwave!

Megatron's making his big push and we can't even push... (struggling to turn Catapult around to re-aim it) ...back! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nArcee starts to push beside him. \nTHE HUGE CATAPULT \nmoves slowly as we CHANGE ANGLE and Kup, Hot Rod and Daniel ENTER SHOT. \nKUP Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at hand! (to Hot Rod) Together now! \nHot Rod joins the others in pushing the huge Catapult into firing position. \nDANIEL also leans against it, his small legs churning. \nTHE CATAPULT starts moving easily now. \nON ARCEE BESIDE HOT ROD \nPushing on the busted catapult. \nARCEE (pushing, manages to speak to Hot Rod. She likes him but doesn't want to go too far) I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city walls. \nMEGATRON Prime!? \nPRIME smashing through a wall of lesser Decepticons. \nPRIME One shall stand, one shall fall. \nCLOSE ON MEGATRON \nhis eyes blazing with hatred. \nMEGATRON Why throw away your life so recklessly? \nON OPTIMUS PRIME \nDirge takes a sneaky leap at him... Optimus stiffarms him with a shuddering clank... ...then turns him upside down with one hand and... ...drives him headfirst into the rocky ground, letting him crumple and fall. \nOPTIMUS PRIME That's a question you should ask yourself. \nMEGATRON hurls himself at Optimus Prime... .... both tumble into the walls of the City... ...denting the walls and causing the electronic panels inside to short circuit, surrounding them with a fiery nimbus of crackling electrical energy. \nUltra Magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying several Autobots. He and the others transform into robot mode and fire lasers at the Decepticons. \nINTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, DANIEL, ARCEE, BLASTER, PERCEPTOR, \nfighting their way to the battle of the titans. \nHOT ROD We've got to save Prime!

Optimus grabs Megatron's clawed hand in one of his hands, twists it in see-sawing test of strength which... Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron - - skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks until he crashes into the side of the city. \nANGLE ON HOT ROD \nHe dispatches a Decepticon and turns to Prime. \nHOT ROD That's showing him, Optimus! \nKUP knocks two Decepticons on their tails and turns. \nKUP Finish him off, Prime!   Do it now! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nON MEGATRON as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of him \nMEGATRON No more, Optimus Prime!    Grant me mercy, I beg of you! \nANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING OPTIMUS PRIME AND HOT ROD \nas Optimus Prime warily moves out to look down at the cowering Megatron, keeping him in his gun sights. \nOPTIMUS PRIME You who are without mercy now plead for it. I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Megatron! \nON HOT ROD \nas he sees Megatron go for the gun and leaps out to grapple with him \nPRIME Out of the way, Hot Rod. \nMEGATRON AND HOT ROD \nas Hot Rod grabs for the Blaster - - Megatron quickly gets Hot Rod in a headlock and using Hot Rod as a shield, gets the gun and... \nBLASTS PRIME IN THE WOUND HE'D MADE WITH HIS LASER DAGGER \nas he steps forward unwillingly, mixed grief and surprise on his face \nMAGNUS Prime, I'm just a soldier.

Continue the struggle... (sags, gasps, hanging on) Transfer the Matrix of Leadership. \nTIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME \nA distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then, pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light, reaches in, and lifts out -- \nTHE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX, \n-- and holds it for a moment in his hand. \nANGLE ON ALL \nThe bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest, closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and extremely powerful glow from his eyes. \nON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR \nThey are all full of great sorrow. \nON PRIME - HE DIES \nAll of his lights go out, including his eyes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nUNICRON \nRotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with electricity.

DURING UNICRON'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW \nLONG SHOT OF UNICRON \nas Galvatron and his newly created force FLY UP AND AWAY with great speed. \nGALVATRON I will rip open Autobot after Autobot until it is yours, Unicron. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES - STARSCREAM \nThis is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne room. It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old leaders, and a raised area where Starscream stands. \nSTARSCREAM AND OTHERS \nThe Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held high, but ready for action should anybody question Starscream's rule. In front of him stands Astrotrain holding a huge Metallic CROWN over his head. \nOTHER DECEPTICONS in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure. \nSTARSCREAM (preening) Get on with the ceremony!

By the time the ship lands, it is nearly indistinguishable from the junk. \nINT. THE SHUTTLE \nEveryone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr, Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway, Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body sticking through the hull \nSPRINGER (pulling himself free of hull wall) Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise... Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders \nDANIEL Wow! That was better'n the Roller Coaster at Future World! \nPERCEPTOR (working scanner, computer device, thoughtfully) The composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous articulations. \nULTRA MAGNUS (baffled) How's that? \nSPRINGER (opening hull door with a RIPPING OF METAL) He says the planet's made of junk. \nSPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR \nas they look out on landscape of \"living\" junk \nSPRINGER Yep, this dump is a dump...... \nULTRA MAGNUS as he straps on TOOL BELT \nULTRA MAGNUS We might be able to salvage this thing.

Ultra Magnus is dead. \nUNICRON Then where is the matrix? \nGALVATRON Destroyed, with him. \nUNICRON The matrix can not be destroyed. (pause) And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him.

Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them, while... \nSwoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops them on other Sharkticons. \nTHE SHARKTICONS suddenly back off and begin transforming (bowing) to the dinobots. \nANGLE ON ALL \nKup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon parts. \nHOT ROD I never thought I'd be so happy to see those big bozos. \nANGLE ON GRIMLOCK \nHe turns to Hot Rod. \nGRIMLOCK Me Grimlock no bozo.

Then, they charge the Quintessons. \nTHE CHASE The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them. \nKUP I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly. \nON HOT ROD \nHOT ROD But what about our problems.    We need a ship. \nWHEELIE WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip. \nANGLE ON HOT ROD \nHe turns to the little, feral, robot. \nHOT ROD Who are you. \nSLAG AND WHEELIE \nThe dinobot lifts up Wheelie. \nSLAG Him Wheelie, him friend. \nHOT ROD HOT ROD He'll be mine too, if he can find a Quintesson ship. \nANGLE ON WHEELIE \nHe points into the distance... \nWHAT WE SEE \nis the strangest looking corkscrew ship   we've every seen sticking out of the ground. \nHOT ROD That's a ship? \nEXT.

That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver.

Hot Rod, somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came. \nThey hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six show up looking for cubes. \nHOT ROD This is getting expensive. \nKUP Don't worry, they'll reciprocate.

As Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh, dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays, underscoring the brutal evil they face, \nKUP (V.O.) Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on Golgonath Seven.... \nHOT ROD Every place reminds you of some place else..... \nKUP (V.O.) Experience, lad.

Who's Unicron? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKRANIX A planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path. \nKUP So that's the monster's name. \nHOT ROD I wonder if there's any connection between it and Galvatron. \nSuddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in... \nQUINTESSON GUARD (V.O.)

UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo grabs them in his mouth and runs. 
ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement. Anya turns to them. 
ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him with great vindication. 
BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks him with her head accidently. 
THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together, with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither of them even try to readjust. 
END MONTAGE 
STILL IN THE SCENE 
Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he knows he interrupted something) as he leads her away from Dmitri. 
VLADIMIR You are a natural! I don't know how you ever learned to dance that well! That must have been some high class orphanage ... 
EXT. SEA - NIGHT 
As a storm begins to whip up, the wind starts to howl and the waves become more violent. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see Rasputin's face. 
INT. CABIN - NIGHT 
The storm is pitching the boat wildly. Vladimir is sleeping, snoring loudly. Meetoo, sound asleep, is sliding from side of the cabin to the other. Anya is looking out the small port hole at the violent sea when Dmitri, carrying his back pack, sits on the bed next to her. 
DMITRI I wanted to show you something. 
Dmitri takes out the music box and hands it to Anya. She is immediately taken by it, something about it ... 
ANYA It's so beautiful ... and sad. 
DMITRI Sad? 
ANYA Lost. it feels lost. This was hers? 
DMITRI Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you? 
ANYA I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home. 
DMITRI Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost. 
ANYA I'm sorry. 
DMITRI (false bravado) Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry! 
Dmitri goes back over to his bed. Anya sees through him and knows how much it all did matter to him.

NICOLETTE Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. 
EDDIE Yeah, yeah.  Good thing. 
NICOLETTE Okay. 
EDDIE See you later.  Good luck. 
NICOLETTE Thank you. 
EDDIE Don't be late. 
She walks out. 
INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY 
Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire station is empty. 
JORDY The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. 
DAPHNE So...the station is empty? 
JORDY Yeah.  This way. 
He gestures toward the stairs. 
INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes never leaving Jordy's. 
JORDY You considered becoming a prostitute? 
DAPHNE Yes, I considered it. 
JORDY Did you ever turn tricks before? 
DAPHNE No. 
JORDY What about back home? 
DAPHNE No. 
Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close. 
DAPHNE (CONT'D) I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's. 
JORDY So you were never a prostitute? 
DAPHNE What are you asking me? 
JORDY I'm just trying to find out who you are. 
She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's hinting. 
DAPHNE Can you let me go? 
She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning and backs up slightly. 
JORDY Showers are this way. 
Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even closer. 
DAPHNE You could shower with me. 
Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks away.  Gestures towards the showers. Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are lined with shower stalls. 
JORDY I'll uh, I'll get you a towel. 
He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the street. 
JORDY 
gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he notices the window.  It's open. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Shit! 
He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns - looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over - quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Are you alright?

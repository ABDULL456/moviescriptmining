JOHN He made me! Go! Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters away. Ah, a game! He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver Marley back into Jenny. Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Uh-oh. 
77 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - MORNING 
John grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop. He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into the lawn. Nothing. 
JENNY (O.S.) Dr. Jay's sending over a laxative. 
JOHN Yay. 
78 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - DAY 
John hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops. 
JOHN Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes. 
(A SIGH) You know, years ago, when I pictured my life, somehow standing in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my bride's swallowed and recycled ass- kissing gift just didn't spring to mind. 
(SUDDENLY EXCITED) Aha! Jackpot! 
79 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Carefully, Jenny lifts the shiny necklace out of a glass filled with bleach. 
JENNY I think it's shinier than before. Amazing. 
JOHN Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only threw up eight times. 
JENNY My hero. 
80 INT. OB/GYN OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY 
The NURSE arranges the gown on Jenny. 
NURSE How's that crazy dog of yours? (smiles at John) I'm a big fan. 
JOHN Thank you. 
NURSE The heartbeat'll be very fast, like a little train. That's normal. 
Shooting Draft  56. 
MARLEY & ME 
80 CONTINUED: 
JOHN Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not that I care. He can be any sex he wants. Male, female, we don't care. Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our druthers, but whatever... 
NURSE Shhhhh... hang on... She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up to a speaker. Nothing. 
NURSE (CONT'D) Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending on how the baby is lying.- You're ten weeks, right? 
JENNY Next Monday, yes. 
NURSE Might be a little early for that. Let's go right to the sonogram. Did you bring your blank tape? 
JOHN (waving it, smiling) Ready to roll. 
NURSE Let's get a good picture first. It'll be on the monitor there. The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen. 
NURSE (CONT'D) 
(NEUTRAL) Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll be just a minute... She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand. We wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then... smiles down at DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse, Jenny. 
DR. SHERMAN Hi, guys. Let's have a look at your baby, shall we? 
(MORE) 
Shooting Draft  57. 
MARLEY & HE 
80 CONTINUED: (2) 
DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D) (he takes the instrument) All right, there we go. Good. Now, look over there. Much better resolution, right? Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen. They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr. Sherman expands and expands. But it's empty. Jenny tries to smile. 
JENNY Is there anything in there? 
DR. SHERMAN Not what you'd expect to see at ten weeks. 
JENNY Not quite ten weeks. Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly: 
DR. SHERMAN Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no heartbeat. John and Jenny are still, silent.

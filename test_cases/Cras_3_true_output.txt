He, in turn, has trouble taking his eyes off her facial scars, which she now makes no attempt to hide. 
She pulls a cigarette packet from the pocket of her raincoat. She searches the instrument panel for the lighter, her right hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird. 
Having found the lighter, her strong hands tear away the cellophane from the cigarette pack. 
HELEN Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me. 
JAMES (suddenly very agitated) Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it. 
HELEN It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic. 
JAMES Are we imagining it? 
Helen waves her cigarette in a gesture that takes in the whole interior of the car. 
HELEN You've bought yourself exactly the same car again. It's the same shape and colour. 
EXT. FIRST CRASH SITE -- DAY 
They are now passing the spot where their crash took place. Intimidated by the aggressive traffic around him, James allows the front wheel of the car to strike the curb of the central reservation, throwing a tornado of dust and cigarette packs on to the windshield. 
INT. JAMES'S CAR -- DAY 
The car swerves from the fast lane and veers toward an airline coach coming out of the exit ramp. Helen quickly shifts to the left of her seat and, pressing her shoulder against James's, closes her hand over James's hand on the wheel. 
With Helen's help, James just manages to pull the car behind the coach. 
They watch the cars swerving past on both sides of them, horns sounding. 
HELEN Turn up here into the car-park. It won't be busy this time of day. 
INT. AIRPORT CAR-PARK -- DAY 
The car winds its way slowly up the rampways leading to higher and higher parking levels. James finds the rhythm soothing and begins to calm down.

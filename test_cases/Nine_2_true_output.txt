EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Saraghina drops to the ground and playfully writhes in the sand. The boys are transfixed. 
She gets up and heads towards the water.   The boys follow, running. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines. They begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds into a wild and raucous tarantella. 
We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and the memory of the boys romping on the beach with Saraghina, across the sand and through the water. 
SARAGHINA                       WHORES BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER,      BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER, PICK THE FLOWER NOW BEFORE    BEFORE IT'S PAST. THE CHANCE IS PAST. p. 46

The number ends. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Two PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks flapping. 
The boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the priests. They catch him and carry him away from the beach. 
INT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY 
Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE. 
The priests drag Young Guido through the school's chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate altar, into the Principal's office. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY 
Guido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she appears the way he remembers her). 
MAMMA I am ashamed of you, Guido. 
YOUNG GUIDO But Mamma, what did I do. 
PRINCIPAL Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins, now and forever. 
The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries out as they punish him... 
INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY 
...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe... Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately wanting to leave after the sex. p. 47

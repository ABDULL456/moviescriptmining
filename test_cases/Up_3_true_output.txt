She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand- drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top. 
YOUNG ELLIE (reading caption) "Paradise Falls, a land lost in time." I ripped this right out of a library book. 
Carl GASPS in horror. 
YOUNG ELLIE I'm gonna move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls. Who knows what lives up there? And once I get there... 
She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank. 
YOUNG ELLIE Well, I'm saving these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have. Only... I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls. Ellie closes the book, disappointed. 
Carl has a thought.    He looks at his toy dirigible. 
YOUNG ELLIE That's it! You can take us there in a blimp! Swear you'll take us. Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross your heart. 
Carl does. 
YOUNG ELLIE Good. You promised. No backing out. 
Carl shakes his head "no." 
YOUNG ELLIE Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye. 
Ellie hops up and jumps out the window. 
YOUNG ELLIE "Adventure is out there!!" 
She pops back in. 
YOUNG ELLIE You know, you don't talk very much. I like you. 
Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.   He rests his head on his balloon. 
YOUNG CARL Wow. 
The balloon pops. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss. 
Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.     A gun shot is fired in the air. 
Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely. 
EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 
Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.   It's the same house where they met as kids. 
EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers. 
INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room. 
EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX. Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint handprint on the mailbox! Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint as well. They smile. 
EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING from her childhood Adventure Book. 
EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY 
They run up a hillside together. 
They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the clouds. He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle. 
Carl closes his eyes and smiles.   He's lucky to be with her.

Go to bed now, baby. .. \nMOLLY (V.O.) \nGRAHAM I love you... \nWIDE SHOT: GRAHAM \nslowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on the bed. All over the room are clothes out of drawers and closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half- packed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE DR. CHILTON - DAY \nDR. CHILTON Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr. Graham. Or should I call you Dr. Graham? \nGRAHAM (O.S.) I'm not a doctor. (beat) I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible. TWO SHOT Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted. \nDR. CHILTON Dr. Lecter will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside. \nGRAHAM I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. \nDR. CHILTON As long as it's on soft paper. You may(Pause) find this curious. \nHe pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the spiky lines. \nDR. CHILTON Here Lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram. Complained of chest pains. Pulse seventy-two. Here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. Here he's subdued by the attendant and Lecter's shoulder is dislocated. Do you notice the strange thing? (pause) His pulse never got over eighty- five. Even when he tore into her face. \nDr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a. response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is a blank. \nDR. CHILTON The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him? \nGRAHAM No. \nDR. CHILTON When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him? \nDR. CHILTON \nlooks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility. Right now he's seeing some more. \nGRAHAM (stands) I want to see Lecktor now. \nDR. CHILTON Uh... sure... \nINT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY \nWe hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters. An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now: \nGRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL \nA 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not stirred. Then: \nLECKTOR That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. \nGRAHAM I keep getting it for Christmas. \nCLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD \nturns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain. Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham is the patient. LECKTOR Did you get my card? \nGRAHAM I got it. Thank you. \nGRAHAM' S struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his emotional reactions. \nLECKTOR And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement. \nGRAHAM Stuart is fine. \nLECKTOR Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will? \nGRAHAM No. \nLECKTOR Of course, you don't. (pause) I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. \nGRAHAM Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. \nLECKTOR And? \nGRAHAM Very interesting, even to a layman. \nLecktor rolls around and examines the term \"layman\" in his head. Then: \nLECKTOR A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it' \nGRAHAM You've read the transcript. It's all there. \nLECKTOR No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will? \n", "test1_true": "LECKTOR (smiles) It doesn't matter to me, Will. \nGRAHAM I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. \nLECKTOR Yes, I thought so. \nGRAHAM It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. \nLECKTOR Yes . \nGRAHAM You read about it, I'm sure. \nLECKTOR In the papers. I don't rear out the articles. (laughs) I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you? \nGRAHAM I thought you would have some ideas. \nLECKTOR Why should I tell you? \nGRAHAM There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...? \nLECKTOR Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. (laugh;) He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. (beat) Never mind, it's boring. \nGRAHAM You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. \nLECKTOR Pray tell. \nGRAHAM I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. \nLECKTOR Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me. \nGRAHAM No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are. \nLECKTOR Then how did you catch me, Will? \nGRAHAM You had disadvantages. \nLECKTOR What disadvantage?. \nGRAHAM You're insane. \nLECKTOR You're very tan, Will. \nGraham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to Lecktor. \nLECKTOR Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it? \nAnother silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then relaxes: \nLECKTOR Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. \nGRAHAM I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... \nLECKTOR (interrupts) Do you have the file with you \nGRAHAM Yes. \nLECKTOR Pictures? \nGRAHAM Yes. \nLECKTOR let me have them,, and I might consider it. \nGRAHAM No. \nLECKTOR Do you dream much, Will? \nGRAHAM Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. \nLECKTOR You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. \nGraham gets up and starts to walk away. \nLECKTOR let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think. \nGraham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant. Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray. Lecktor pulls it through. \nGRAHAM sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees: \nGRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP DR. LECKTOR \nToothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour- nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with- no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light. Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the mind of Graham. It is interrupted when: \nLECKTOR (O.S.) There is a very shy boy, Will. \nGRAHAM \nsnaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor. \nLECKTOR What were the yards like? \nGRAHAM Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why? \nLECKTOR Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing. \n", "test1_id": 1281, "test2_input": "GRAHAM That's interesting. \nLECKTOR It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. \nGRAHAM Yes. I'd considered it. \nLECKTOR You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you? \nGRAHAM I want your opinion. \nLECKTOR I don't have one right now. \nGRAHAM When you do have one I'd like to hear it. \nLECKTOR May I keep the file? \nGRAHAM I haven't decided yet. \nLECKTOR I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number? \nThreat. \nGRAHAM No. \nLECKTOR Do you know how you caught me, Will? \nGRAHAM Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. \nGraham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked. Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to get unlocked faster! \nLECKTOR Do you know how you caught me? \nThe door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears is : \nLECKTOR (O.S.) The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself. \nThe DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHESAPEAKE: STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE, CORRIDOR - GRAHAM - DAY \nwalks down the corridor. He's very stiff. He's walking towards the outside door. The door is a rectangle of white light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly polished institution's floor. Graham walks for the light. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - ENTRANCE - DAY \nThe DOOR SLAMS open and Graham comes out into daylight and air. The air is tactile to him. He can almost feel the motes of dust and light that swim freely. He breathes. \nGRAHAM'S POV: GRASS \nis dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral breakup. As it returns to a normal green... \nTIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM \nbreathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building: \"CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.\" He leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image is flattened in a LONG LENS.

The fam- ily quadrant slows to normal. We TIGHTEN in on it. We will come to know these people as the SHERMANS. An 11-year-old boy, a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade sign says:   \"THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL.\" Mrs. Sherman has brown hair.  She wears a bikini.   She has a nice body. She's sensuous and tan in her thirties.  She dives into the pool. The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs. Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair. \nA couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis- tening. Her teeth are white. She smiles at the camera. Whoever controls the console puts Mrs. Sherman in reverse. It runs forward again. Mrs. Sherman's glistening body coming our of the water... \nREAR SHOT: CONSOLE AND A MAN \nBeyond is the screen. The man at the console is FRANCIS DOLLARHYDE. He has a weightlifter's body. We don't see his face. Black goggles with red lenses are on the console. He puts them on and watches Mrs. Sherman... \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEGATIVE PROCESSING ROOM - DOOR - DAY \nIt slams open.

His eyes are white violet. He turns the page. \nNATIONAL TATTLER'S OLD PICTURE OF GRAHAEI \nIt's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor. It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals. The caption reads: \"Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover- ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecktor.\" \nEXTREMELY CLOSE: SECOND IMAGE OF WILL GRAHAM in newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi- tal. The half-tone dots comorising the image are visible. Dollarhyde's massive finger slides across the image, brush- ing it sensitively.

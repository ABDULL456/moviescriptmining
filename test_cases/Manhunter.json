MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY \nThe highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington. His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio- let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from a glass of iced tea. Then: \nCRAWFORD I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... \nGRAHAM I don't want to talk about it anywhere. (beat) If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. \nCRAWFORD How much do you know? \nGRAHAM What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' (beat) Confessions? \nCRAWFORD Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. (beat) None of them knew that; \nGRAHAM What else did you keep out of the papers? \nCRAWFORD Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. \nGRAHAM Somebody hurt him? \nCRAWFORD Typed him from semen. He's a secretor. \nCrawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham. \nGraham flips his cigarette into the surf. CRAWFORD Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call? \nGRAHAM No. \nCRAWFORD Why not? \nGRAHAM The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... \nCRAWFORD And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors. \nGRAHAM You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. \nCRAWFORD Last two like this we had, you caught. \nGRAHAM That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. \nCRAWFORD That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think. \nGRAHAM I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. (beat) I came down here to get away from all that. \nCRAWFORD You look all right now. \nGRAHAM I am all right. \nCrawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this. \nCRAWFORD If you can't look anymore, I understand... \nGRAHAM As long as they're dead... \nCRAWFORD These are all dead, Will. \nPICTURES \nIf we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling. \nCLOSE: GRAHAM \nlooks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he puts them down and looks along the beach. \nGRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN \nKEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand. MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen around her ankles. Her body language openly states hostility. It's towards Crawford. \nGRAHAM (O.S.) Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. \nCRAWFORD (O.S.) I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect \nMolly starts walking forward. On it... CUT TO: INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN - MOLLY + GRAHAM - NIGHT are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes. \nMOLLY He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here. \nGRAHAM What did he want? \nMOLLY He asked how you are. \nGRAHAM And you said? \nMOLLY I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone. \nwalk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going. A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly. Graham's feet pass our of frame... \nINT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR \nis empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash- light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing. \nINT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch. \nBLOOD \nscreams at us from the walls. \nCLOSE: GRAHAM doesn't visibly react. \nWIDER - GRAHAM moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports. \nOVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM \nstanding alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic. Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference. \nGRAHAM intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. (beat) The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room. (beat) Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... (beat) in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot... (MORE) \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds? \nCUT TO: \nZNT. LEEDS BATHROOM - MEDICINE CABINET - NIGHT \nis dark. We see nothing. Light comes on. Graham enters. He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees... \nZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE \nstill hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom. He doesn't let it unnerve him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT \nThe window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant... More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image. He takes out his tape recorder again. \nGRAHAM There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog? \nHOLD ON Graham. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ATLANTA HYATT HOUSE, ELEVATOR - WIDE - NIGHT \nGraham riding up with two half-drunk CONVENTIONEERS with big \"Hi\" badges. One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby below. \nA good-looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them. Graham is leaning against the glass. \nCONVENTIONEER #1 ...like to rip me off a piece of that! \nCONVENTIONEER #2 Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds. \nThe other cracks up. \nGRAHAM \nsnaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2. \nCONVENTIONEER #2 \nsips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles: \nCONVENTIONEER #1 What the fuck are you lookin' at? \nGraham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens. Conventioneer #1 drags Conventioneer #2. \nCONVENTIONEER #l (being pulled out of elevator) What are you, a faggot? \nBoth Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall. Conventioneer #1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist Graham looks away. \nCUT TO: \nZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT \nWe are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All are mouthing silently: \"Happy Birthday to you, happy birth- day to you...\" Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera a large yellow envelope that says: \"Follow the ribbon.\" A big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope. \nThe camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise. \nGRAHAM \nhas hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs. Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat- tress. \nGRAHAM (into the tape recorder) When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else? (beat) Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead? \nGraham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks up the phone and dials. He waits. Then: \nGRAHAM (into phone) Molly? \nMOLLY (V.O.) (asleep) Huh? (beat) Will? Is that you? \nGRAHAM It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. (beat) I love you... \nDr. Princi joins them. \nSPRINGFIELD (to Graham) The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. (beat) He killed nine people, didn't he? \nGRAHAM Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. \nSPRINGFIELD What happened to them? \nGRAHAM One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. \nSPRINGFIELD What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter? \nGRAHAM Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. \nSPRINGFIELD What would you call him? \nGraham doesn't answer. \nSPRINGFIELD To yourself... \nGRAHAM I call him a monster. \nSPRINGFIELD I understand he cut you pretty good... \nGRAHAM (cold right turn> What about the dog? \nSPRINGFIELD It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl. \nGRAHAM Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? \nSPRINGFIELD No. \nGRAHAM Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? \nCRAWFORD (alert) A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it. \nGRAHAM Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. \nCrawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield answers. SPRINGFIELD Yeah? (waits) Lemme put you on the speaker phone. \nJIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Who am I talking to? \nCRAWIIORD Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here. \nJIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) I got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm. \nSpringfield reacts. \nJIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound. \nCRAWFORD Can you make an identification off it? \nJIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Don't know. The palm came off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon. Hangs up. \nSPRINGFIELD thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very changed. \nGRAHAM \nsenses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank. He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY \ncoming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield, the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No- body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them. \nLOUNDS Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... ! \nCLOSE: GRAHAM \nwalking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel trap. He's repressing something powerful. \nLOUNDS (running on, behind them) When did they call you in, Will? What have you got? \nGraham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now. \nCRAWFORD Lounds, give it a rest... \nLOUNDS Come on, Graham?! Talk to me! \nGraham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham: \nLOUNDS How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them? \nRight now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to turn him around. \nGRAHAM \nGrabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from Lounds. \nGRAHAM (very low) Keep the fuck away from me! \nCrawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go. \nWIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY \nGRAHAM Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all I care... (beat) Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... \nMolly interrupts: \nMOLLY (V.O.) Will, I don't know why I'm talking about this stuff... (beat) I called to tell you: I love you and I miss you. And you are doing the right thing. It's costing you, too. And I know that. And I'm here. I'LL be here whenever you come home. Or I'LL meet you anywhere.  Anytime. That's what I called to say... \nGraham holds the phone close to him. As if it were a part of Molly herself. \nGRAHAM Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. .. \nMOLLY (V.O.) \nGRAHAM I love you... \nWIDE SHOT: GRAHAM \nslowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on the bed. All over the room are clothes out of drawers and closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half- packed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE DR. CHILTON - DAY \nDR. CHILTON Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr. Graham. Or should I call you Dr. Graham? \nGRAHAM (O.S.) I'm not a doctor. (beat) I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible. TWO SHOT Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted. \nDR. CHILTON Dr. Lecter will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside. \nGRAHAM I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. \nDR. CHILTON As long as it's on soft paper. You may(Pause) find this curious. \nHe pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the spiky lines. \nDR. CHILTON Here Lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram. Complained of chest pains. Pulse seventy-two. Here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. Here he's subdued by the attendant and Lecter's shoulder is dislocated. Do you notice the strange thing? (pause) His pulse never got over eighty- five. Even when he tore into her face. \nDr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a. response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is a blank. \nDR. CHILTON The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him? \nGRAHAM No. \nDR. CHILTON When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him? \nDR. CHILTON \nlooks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility. Right now he's seeing some more. \nGRAHAM (stands) I want to see Lecktor now. \nDR. CHILTON Uh... sure... \nINT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY \nWe hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters. An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now: \nGRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL \nA 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not stirred. Then: \nLECKTOR That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. \nGRAHAM I keep getting it for Christmas. \nCLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD \nturns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain. Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham is the patient. LECKTOR Did you get my card? \nGRAHAM I got it. Thank you. \nGRAHAM' S struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his emotional reactions. \nLECKTOR And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement. \nGRAHAM Stuart is fine. \nLECKTOR Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will? \nGRAHAM No. \nLECKTOR Of course, you don't. (pause) I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. \nGRAHAM Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. \nLECKTOR And? \nGRAHAM Very interesting, even to a layman. \nLecktor rolls around and examines the term \"layman\" in his head. Then: \nLECKTOR A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it' \nGRAHAM You've read the transcript. It's all there. \nLECKTOR No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will? \nGRAHAM That's interesting. \nLECKTOR It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. \nGRAHAM Yes. I'd considered it. \nLECKTOR You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you? \nGRAHAM I want your opinion. \nLECKTOR I don't have one right now. \nGRAHAM When you do have one I'd like to hear it. \nLECKTOR May I keep the file? \nGRAHAM I haven't decided yet. \nLECKTOR I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number? \nThreat. \nGRAHAM No. \nLECKTOR Do you know how you caught me, Will? \nGRAHAM Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. \nGraham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked. Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to get unlocked faster! \nLECKTOR Do you know how you caught me? \nThe door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears is : \nLECKTOR (O.S.) The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself. \nThe DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHESAPEAKE: STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE, CORRIDOR - GRAHAM - DAY \nwalks down the corridor. He's very stiff. He's walking towards the outside door. The door is a rectangle of white light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly polished institution's floor. Graham walks for the light. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - ENTRANCE - DAY \nThe DOOR SLAMS open and Graham comes out into daylight and air. The air is tactile to him. He can almost feel the motes of dust and light that swim freely. He breathes. \nGRAHAM'S POV: GRASS \nis dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral breakup. As it returns to a normal green... \nTIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM \nbreathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building: \"CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.\" He leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image is flattened in a LONG LENS. We hear a CLICK. It FOCUSES and DE-FOCUSES. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CXR - FREDDIE LOUNDS - DAY \nis photographing Graham with a Nikon and a 500mm Questar reflector. Be puts the camera to his eye again and hits the button. The MOTOR DRIVE knocks off three shots. \nCUT TO: \nINT. G:,TEWAY LABS - SCREEN DIVIDED INTO FOUR QUADRANTS - DAV \nThe quadrants display 4 home movies at six times normal speed: an old couple, 2 men, a baby and a family. The fam- ily quadrant slows to normal. We TIGHTEN in on it. We will come to know these people as the SHERMANS. An 11-year-old boy, a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade sign says:   \"THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL.\" Mrs. Sherman has brown hair.  She wears a bikini.   She has a nice body. She's sensuous and tan in her thirties.  She dives into the pool. The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs. Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair. \nA couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis- tening. Her teeth are white. She smiles at the camera. Whoever controls the console puts Mrs. Sherman in reverse. It runs forward again. Mrs. Sherman's glistening body coming our of the water... \nREAR SHOT: CONSOLE AND A MAN \nBeyond is the screen. The man at the console is FRANCIS DOLLARHYDE. He has a weightlifter's body. We don't see his face. Black goggles with red lenses are on the console. He puts them on and watches Mrs. Sherman... \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEGATIVE PROCESSING ROOM - DOOR - DAY \nIt slams open. Dollarhyde enters and walks through the dim green light past the developers in his black goggles with red lenses. Thousands of feet of negative move through the tank on rollers. Dollarhyde walks past the baths. We TRACK WITH him to the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIGHT TRAP-DOOR - DAY slams open. Dollarhyde enters. As he reaches the next door... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRYER ROOM - DOLLARHYDE - DAY \nenters and we TRACK WITH him past film snaking across pul- leys and rollers through the drying cabinets. As Dollarhyde passes the dryers... \nINT. CAFETERIA - DOLLARHYDE - DAY \nin the brilliant aluminum and peach cafeteria gets coffee. A newspaper's under his arm. As he waits to pay, EILEEN approaches. She, too, wears goggles, but on a lanyard around her neck. She's petite, fragile. Dollarhyde towers over her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. L1011, COACH SECTION - CRAHAM - DAY \nSqueezed into a narrow seat. He sits on the aisle. Next to him is a seven-year-old girl, at the window her mother. He opens and reads a Telex in yellow envelope: \"BIRMINGHAM P.D. FOUND JACOBI CAT DEAD IN BACK YARD. KIDS MUST HAVE BURIED IT. HE KILLS THE PETS. REGARDS, CRAWFORD.\" \nSTEWARDESS Clears the trays. \nGRAHAM \ncontorts his body to pull his briefcase from under the seat in front. He extracts the Leeds and Jacobi files. From each he takes a snapshot of a happy family picture and paperclips them to the front of the files. He stands them on the dinner tray and stares at them. \nGRAHAM'S POV: HAPPY FAMILY PORTRAITS \nSLOWLY ZOOM IN TO the Jacobi family. As we get CLOSER and CLOSER TO Mrs. Jacobi in a bikini, her face abstracts into pointillist dots of color... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MARATHON BOATYARD - DIESEL ENGINE - DAY moves down to us... \nMOLLY \napproaches in SLOW MOTION raising a bag of shrimp and a six- pack of Dos Equis. \nINT. UNFINISHED HULL - GRAHAM \nguiding the engine down, wears faded violet shorts and no shirt. We see a huge circular scar ending in a hook on his abdomen as the engine lands... \nGRAHAM (reverb, distant) Block her off, Mitch... \nGraham waves to Molly... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nGRAHAM \nOn the dock. The hot sun turns the water a brilliant aqua and silver. Graham's tan body in the violet shorts on the silver wood... Molly reaches in the bag for another shrimp. Graham looks at her... \nMOLLY SMILES \nas she rips the head off the shrimp. The warm mouth, Her shiny teeth look like a Pepsodent commercial. \nHEAD COMING OFF SHRIMP \nViscera trail. As the shrimp is ripped apart we see: \nGRAHAM'S EYES In horror. And O.S., we hear SCREAMING coming from a differ- ent place as we... CUT TO: \nINT. L1011 - GRAHAM - DAY \nsnaps awake. The child next to Graham is screaming. People stare. The mother is shouting at him. Graham is confused, stunned... He doesn't know what's wrong. He looks around... The Stewardess is handling things on his tray in front of him. \nTRAY \nThe file has spilled open. Crime photos of the Leeds and Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost separated head of Mr. Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and in his lap... \nGRAHAM \nmumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos. The mother wants her seat changed. \nGraham is excruciatingly embarrassed, clumsily shoving them back into their files... CUT TO: \nINT. JACOBI HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - WIDE ON DOOR - DAY \nWe MOVE INTO the knob... it starts to turn. Slowly. Sud- denly: door SLAMS open revealing real estate agent GEEHAN and Graham, \nGEEHAN It was last Thursday. This couple from Duluth. I had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages -- I mean, that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place. I'm figuring: Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you gonna unload this turkey. (beat) Then the squad car rolls up. They ask a coupla questions. The good officers give them the whole fuckin' guided tour. Who was laying where. Where all the blood sprayed... terrific! (beat) Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here. \nGRAHAM Have any single men asked to look at it? \nGEEHAN Haven't asked me. (beat) Took four coats of interior latex, five in places. (pause) You can drop that key in the mailbox. You don't have to come back by, do you? \nGRAHAM Uh-uh. \nGeehan leaves. The door closes with a SLAM. \nWIDE - GRAHAM \nIn the empty white living room. Graham walks OUT OF FRAME. Bare floors and dead air. His footsteps echo in the empty house. CUT TO: \nEXT. JACOBI HOUSE - WIDE - DAY An image from Bill Owens' \"Suburbia.\" A family house. No different than any other family house around. But it is somehow sinister in its vacancy. It ought to be littered with bicycles and wagons: the signs and symbols of suburban normalcy. TRACK LEFT to reveal the back of Graham staring at the house from across the street. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEXT DOOR HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY \nIn a different position staring at the rear of the house from a neighbor's bushes. We don't know why Graham is staring at the Jacobi house from different vantage points. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIDEROAD - GRAHAM'S POV: 3/4 VIEW OF JACOBI HOUSE DAY \nGraham looking at the house from the third vantage point. \nJACOBI BACKYARD \nDr. Chilton reacts. \nDR. CHILTON (fast) Do you have it? \nGUARD Yeah. It's right here. \nGuard pulls three sheers of toiler paper with writing on them out of his pocket. We HOLD ON it. \nDR. CHILTON \nis already dialling a number. \nDR. CHILTON Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you? \nGUARD No. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT Sarah answers the phone. \nSARAH Special Agent Crawford's office. \nIn the b.g. all hell is breaking loose. Crawford and Graham are both hollering into the phone at Freddie Lounds. \nSARAH Speak up, please. I can hardly hear you! \nDR. CBILTON (V.O.) (shouting) I said I need to speak to Special Agent Crawford or Mr. Graham. Right away! \nSARAH (holding one ear closed) I'm sorry. Special Agent Crawford and Graham are tied up tight now. Can I get them to call you back? \nDR. CHILTON (V.O.) (going nuts) This is Dr. Chilton. At the Chesapeake Hospital. Will you please call them this is very, very urgent!! \n(beat) I'll hold on. \nSarah puts Chilton on \"Hold.\" TRACK her INTO the room. She starts to say something. Crawford holds up a hand... \nCRAWFORD (hollering) How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop? (beat) Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds! \nGRAHAM (seeing Sarah) What is it? \nSARAH It's a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says it's urgent. \nGraham punches the phone and takes the call. Crawford's yelling at Lounds. \nGRARAM It's Will Graham... \nDR. CHILTON (V.O.) Well, it's about goddamn time! I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... \nGRAHAM Where did you get it?! \nGraham waves Crawford to the other phone. \nDR. CHILTON (V.O.) From Hannibal Lecktor's cell. It was hidden in a book. \nCRAWFORD (to Lounds) Run along to the police station, Freddie. We'll talk to you when we get around to it... \nCrawford punches into Dr. Chilton's call. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHESAPEAKE HOSPITAL - DR. CHIITON - NIGHT \nGRAHAM (V.O.) Can you read it to me? \nDR. CHILTON It's written on toilet tissue. (reads ) 'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming. (reads ) 'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming. Just as the source of light is burning. (beat) Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched our, then it says... (reads) 'I have a complete collection of your press notices. f think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The \"Tooth Fairy.\" What could be more inappropriate. Investigator Graham interests me. Very purposeful locking. I hope we can correspond. (beat) There's another piece missing here. I'LL read the bottom part. (reads ) 'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet. Signed: Avid Fan. (to Graham) It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom. \nCRAWFORD \npunches the other line. \nCBAWFORD Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. (punches into Dr. Chilton's line) Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up. \nGRAHAM After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. (beat) Where's Lector now? \nDR. CHILTON (V.O.) In a holding cell. \nGRAHAM How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? \nDR. CHILTON (V.O.) Three, four hours. \nCRAWFORD Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something, \nDR. CHILTDN (V.O.) Yes. We can manage all that. \nCRAWFORD (hits another line) Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI BUILDING, HAIR AND FIBER SECTION - BEVERLY KATZ - NIGHT \nis bent over a microscope. She's under it. Behind her a male assistant brushes a child's bib overalls with a metal spatula. He is collecting whatever debris comes off the clothing onto a white paper sheet. BEVERLY KATZ lifts something with tweezers. She leans away from the micro- scope . \nBEVERLY KATZ One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty- second of an inch. A couple of blue grains. I'll work it up. What else have you got? \nGRAHAM Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man. \nBOWMAN When do they go to press? \nGRAHAM In thirty-five minutes. \nBOWMAN Christ! \nCRAWFORD After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message. Here's what he'll find, Bill. \nBILL (reads ) 'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central. Left luggage 72683. \nCRAWFORD It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout. He shows: we take him. (beat) Anything from Chicago? \nSARAH Not yet. \nCRAWFORD Let's get to the physical. \nPRICE There was no print. I'm here for kicks . \nBEVERLY KATZ One whisker. Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So does color. The color's different than the Tooth Fairy's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian's end. \nBRIAN ZELLAR The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine. Must be from the cleaning man. There are several particles of dried blood. Not enough to type. \nGRAHAM Bowman? \nBOWMAN It's Snow White toilet paper. National distribution. \nBowman sets up his photographs on an easel. \nBOWMAN (beat) If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy... (beat) He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. We can make out: 'six-six-six'. (beat) I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it. \nCRAWFORD Issue the toilet paper tear as a... \nThe phone RINGS. Graham punches the speaker. \nCHESTER (V.O.) This is Chester here. Who am I talking to? \nGRAHAM Will Graham, Jack Crawford... \nCHESTER (V.O.) We got an ad order in tonight's \"Tattler\" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now. \nGRAHAM Read it. \nCHESTER (V.O.) (reads) 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.' \nGRAHAM That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... \nCHESTER (V.O.) 'You're very beautiful. \nCBAWFORD Christ... \nCHESTER (V.O.) 'I offer one hundred prayers for your safety. Find help in john 6:22, 8:16 9:1;Luke l:7, 3:1; Galatians 6:11. 15:2; Acts 3:3; Revelations 18:i; Jonah 6:8...

They're on if now... \nEverybody exhibits disciplined surface calm. The tension is screaming underneath. \nBOWMAN \nfuriously looking through pages of the Bible, suddenly stops. \nBOWMAN (to Graham) No. (beat) The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code. (beat) And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him. \nCRAWFORD Book code? \nBOWMAN 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book? \nCBAWFORD Not the Bible? \nBOWMAN No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible. \nGRAHAM Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. \nBOWMAN Right . (beat) What about sweating Lecktor? \nGRAHAM They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. (beat) He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. \nBOWMAN it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell. \nGRAHAM He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... \nCRAWFORD Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place... \nBOWMAN Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... \nCRAWFORD Where? \nBOWMAN Library of Congress. \nBowman's our the door. \nGRAHAM Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. \nHe catches Molly's eye: \nMOLLY'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW \nA silhouette shape moves past the window. The angle of the streetlight plays its shadow on the wall against Molly. \nFRONTAL CLOSEUP: MOLLY \nfrozen. She hears the outer screen door being opened... \nBEHIND MOLLY & OVER HER SHOULDER TO KITCHEN DOOR \nThe shape is at the door. Molly takes a couple of steps, and can't go any further. \nMOLLY \nbreathless, opens the door.

GRAHAM HOUSE - TROOPER + MOLLY - NIGHT \nAs Molly comes out of the house, we PULL BACK and CRANE UP INTO a very HIGH ANGLE WIDE SHOT revealing: Four state trooper cars parked on Graham's property. On the road are two roadblocks 100 yards apart on either side of Graham's house. All their flashers are going. Molly looks around in confusion. We see her turn to the sea, a coast guard launch pulls to 100 yards off the beach. Its searchlight plays on the water's edge then across the property. Molly look; at all the policemen... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AIRPORT - GULF STREAM JET - DAY \nadvances on us, its engine screaming. Its front wheel brakes to a stop right before CAMERA. \nDOOR \nopens. Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with collapsible stock. His eyes scan the perimeter. \nFBI MEN \nmoving fast, follow Graham. Their eyes sweep the terminal area. One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns. \nA CORDON OF FLORIDA STATE TROOPERS \nhussle Molly and Kevin between them from their cars towards Graham. Two carry suitcases. \nGRAHAM + MOLLY + KEVIN \ninside the protective barrier of men. \nHIGH ANGLE: THE AIRPORT \nGraham moves Molly and Kevin up into the Gulf Stream. FBI men follow.

It pauses a moment, then blasts down the runway and up into the morning sun. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, FOYER - DOOR - DAY \nHOLD. Then it opens. Molly and Kevin, followed by Graham. Unmarked FBI cars are parked on the front lawn. Molly enters the foyer, looks around and stops. \nHOUSE INTERIOR Holiday Inn decor. \nMOLLY Who decorated this place, Richard Nixon? \nMolly takes a deep breath. Then lets it out. She's tired. Graham takes her hand. \nGRAHAM ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. \nMOLLY You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. (touches his face) And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... (Graham has to smile) He's after you now, isn't he? \nShe didn't check to see that Kevin is our of earshot. Graham does. \nGRAHAM It's a precaution... (to Kevin) Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float. \nKEVIN I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom... \nGRAHAM (to Molly) What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' (beat) He read the Tattler piece, didn't he? \nMOLLY He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face . \nGRAHAM Good for him. (beat) Thanks a lot, Freddie! (to Kevin) Kevin. We're going grocery shopping . \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUPERMARKET - GRAHAM + KEVIN - DAY \npush a basket collecting stuff from the shelves. Other families are shopping The place is medium-crowded. Mind- dulling MUZAK comes from the ceiling. \nKEVIN Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? \nGRAHAM No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are. \nMOLLY You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong? \nGRAHAM I remember. \nMOLLY Do you remember what you said? \nGRAHAM Yes. I said this is too good to live... \nMolly stares into his eyes. \nMOLLY Time is luck, Will. (heat ) I know the value of our days... \nThey stare into each other. There's a pause. They rise. She puts her arm around Graham's waist. They start towards the house. \nMOLLY Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI CAFETERIA - CRAWFORD + BLOOM - DAY \nCRAWFORD I need to talk to you about Will Graham. \nBLOOM What about him? \nCRAWFORD I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. \nBLOOM Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now. \nCRAWFORD That was Peterson upstairs. \nBLOOM It was you who did the asking. \nCRAWFORD He doesn't think you run mind games on him. \nBLOOM I wouldn't presume to try. \nCRAWFORD You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic? \nBLOOM He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.   But I don't think he's psychic.   What he has it empathy and projection  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him. \nCRAWFORD Why aren't you ever alone with him? \nBLOOM Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked. (beat) So do I. (beat) What do you want? \nCRAWFORD His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate? \nBLOOM I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in... \nCRAWFORD That's when it happened? \nBLOOM No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy? ' (beat) That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown. \nCRAWFORD What's the bottom line? \nBLOOM If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself. (beat) What are you planning, Jack? \nCRAWFORD Could he handle a direct contact? \nBLOOM I don't recommend it. \nGRAHAM (O.S.) You don't recommend what, Sidney? \nCrawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't. \nBLOOM Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea. \nGRAHAM If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. (MORE) \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) That's what you were thinking, isn't it? \nCrawford's embarrassed. Bloom said Graham was fast. \nGXAHAM I'll use Lounds. \nNow Bloom's surprised... \nGRAHAM Sidney, he doesn't read the \"Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the \"Tattler.\" (beat) And I want this over with... Fast. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT - GRAHAM + LOUNDS - DAY Graham leans against a table, his back to a window. GRAHAM I believe he's socially maladjusted. Laughed at by his contemporaries... \nLOUNDS How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal Lecktor? \nGRAHAM He's not as intelligent. \nPULL BACK to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and assistant. Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his tape recorder. \nGRAHAM (to Bloom) What have we missed? \nBLOOM He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds. \nGraham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again. \nGRAHAM The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex. (beat) Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . (added afterthought) And probably had sexual relations with his mother... \nHe starts coming back. He rakes off his silver sunglasses revealing the white violet eyes. \nDOLLARHYDE You told me what?! \nCLOSE: NEWSSTAND OPERATOR \nNEWSSTAND OPERATOR You got a quarter comin' back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT, PARKING LOT - GRAHAM'S CAR - NIGHT \npulls into the prescribed space. It's raining. He kills the engine and gets out. \nHIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM \nexiting the car. The image is in GREEN AND BLACK. We are: \nEXT.

Reveal we are: \nEXT. SECOND ROOFTOP - SWAT #2 \nwith the same rifle sweeping the parking lot. He reacts to something to his left. \nGRAHAM \n... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the apartment building.., hears something through the delicate patter of the rain. \nGRAHAM'S POV: CORNER OF BUILDING \nA distant \"plop-plop-plop\" of running feet... \nGRAHAM'S eyes tighten. \nCORNER OF BUILDING \nHOLD. Then entering around the corner is a running MAN. He's 6'2\". He's heavy and wears a running suit with the hood up. His face is lost in its shadow. \nRUNNER'S RIGHT HAND \nis gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket, grasping something... \nRUNNER'S FEET ACROSS WET BLACK TARMAC splash through shallow puddles. \nGRAHAM'S FACE \nin anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER... \nGBAHAM'S EYES \nlike taut wire about to snap. \nWIDE PROFILE:  GRAHAM on the left.   The Runner enters on the right. In SLOW MOTION as they cross, Graham slams him sideways... \nRUNNER \nis knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to fight ... \n.44 BULLDOG \ncomes up.., pressure on the trigger. \nRUNNER'S HEAD \nturns INTO CAMERA. He is a black man with a moustache and scared eyes staring into the .44. His hands shoot into the air: \nRUNNER (MAN) Yo, boss. Plastic and cash in the right pocket...! \nGRAHAM (re the mistake) God-dammit!!! \nWalking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest. Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive. The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two D.C. cops are running in. \nRUNNER Arrest dat sucker...! \nCrawford catches up to Graham: \nCRAWFORD You okay? \nGraham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile, Spurgen is with the Runner. \nSPURGEN It was a mistake . Sorry we... \nRUNNER 'Sorry' yo' mama!! \nRunner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops him. \nSPURGEN Hold on! We thought you were someone we're trying to catch... \nRUNNER (backs up) Hold onto this!! (grabs his groin) I get dat cannon stuck up mah face?! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins?! \n'Catch somebody?!' You couldn't catch yo' ass with yo' right hand! You lucky you muther-fuckers catch a cold! Who the hell goin' pay my cleanin' bill? Huh? \nturns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head. The kimono is on again. \nPAST LOUNDS' HEAD: SCREEN \nA slide appears. It is Blake's painting. \nDOLLARHYDE Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun. Do you see? \nLOUNDS Yes ... \nNext picture: Mrs. Jacobi, eyes wide. \nDOLLARHME Do you see? \nLOUNDS Yes . \nCLICK. Next slide. Mrs. Leeds alive, locked into a silent scream in her bedroom. \nDOLLARHYDE Do you see? \nLOUNDS Yes. \nCLICK. \nLOUNDS \nstaring in horror. We will not see the rest of the slider. \nDOLLARHYDE Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see? \nLOUNDS Yes . \nDOLLARHYDE Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. (as Lounds nods) The Dragon rampant. Do you see? \nLOUNDS Yes . \nDOLLARHYDE Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. \nDo you see? \nLOUNDS Oh, God. \nDOLLARHYDE Do you see? \nLOUNDS Please, no. \nDOLLARHYDE 'No' what? \nLOUNDS Not me. \nDOLLARHYDE Are you a man? \nLOUNDS Yes. \nDOLLARHYDE Do you imply that I'm a queer? \nLOUNDS God, no. \nDOLLARHYI)E Are you queer, Mr. Lounds? \nLOUNDS No. \nREAR OF DOLLARHYDE'S HEAD \nBeyond him is the screen and the image of Freddie Lounds with Graham's arm over his shoulder. \nDOLLARHYDE Before me you are a slug in the sun. You are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. You are an ant in the afterbirth. (beat) It is your nature to do only one thing correctly: tremble. Bur fear is not what you owe me. Lounds: you and the others, YOU OWE ME AWE! (long pause) We have one more piece of work to do. \nDollarhyde leaves. Lounds closes his eyes. \nLOUNDS (to himself) Didn't take off the mask. Please, God, let him not take off the mask. If he comes back with it off, I'm dead... \nDOLLARHME'S HAND \ncarries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds' face . DOLLARHYDE (O.S.) Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. \nLounds obeys. \nCLOSE: DOLLARHYDE \nThe stocking mask and teeth -- stained and jagged -- are in place. \nDOLLARHYDE Now you will read this into the tape recorder. \nON LOUNDS \nLOUNDS 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand. (beat) 'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you. (beat) 'I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About his becoming.' \nDOLLARHYDE'S HAND turns off the tape recorder. \nDOLLARHYDE You did very well.   I apologize for the crude images.    Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights . \nLOUNDS You'll let me go now? \nDOLLARHYDE You will tell the truth? \nsits among piles of Leeds family possessions. He opens a child's toy. It's large, pink plastic and heart-shaped. It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them, \nREARSHOT: GRAHAM \nhalf and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates motes of dust in the air. Graham merely sits and stares into all of the debris of this dead family. PULL BACK to see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a life by two adults and three children. Everything from washing machines to tricycles to sleds. They litter the vast floor space. While we WIDEN, we hear: \nVOICE :1(O.S.) What's he doin'? Been in there all day . \nVOICE :2 (O.S.) Just sits and stares at the stuff... \nThe CAMERA now includes two UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS at the door. They watch Graham, As we WIDEN and PULL BACK they fall into REAR SHOT. HOLD. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE CORRIDOR - REBA ON DOLLARHYDE'S ARM - NIGHT \nHer cane taps the white tile floor. It's antiseptic and sinister. We worry about where he's taking her. \nREBA Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is? \nDOLLARHYDE It's a surprise. \nHer head arcs back as she senses: \nREBA Francis? We're at the zoo...! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ZOO EXAMINATIONTION ROOM - DR. WARFIELD - NIGHT \nDR. WARFIELD In two days we're going to cap his tooth. Can you smell him? \nREBA (aglow) Yes! \nDR. WARFIELD Are you apprehensive? Your protective and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat. \nREBA No, no! I want to. \nDollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment. \nDR. WARFIELD All right, put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right. I'll be right here beside you. \nWe see Reba start to reach out. Then we see what she is about to touch. \nTEN-FOOT LONG BENGAL TIGER \nReba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm. \nREBA'S HAND \nThe fur springs between her fingers. \nTIGER'S GREAT PAW Reba's hand enters down its foreleg. Warfield -- with two hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. Reba's hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple muscles of his shoulder. \nTIGER'S HEAD \nReba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head. \nTIGER'S MOUTH \nThe hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms. \nTIGER'S CHEST \nReba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills us and Reba with its bright thunder. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE - THE GREAT RED DRAGON ARD THE WOMAN CLOTHED WITH THE SUN - NIGHT \nBlake's painting. It's a large reproduction. It's a pre- psychological evocation of violent sexual impulses. It has come right after the image of Reba and the tiger. O.S. we hear WATER RUNNING... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - FAUCET + HANDS \nHands are Reba's. We FOLLOW them up to the wall as they search for and find a towel. O.S. we hear the hum of a film PROJECTOR starring. We see the sightless Reba reflected in the mirror. Feeling her way, she starts out... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING BOOM - PAN \nIt's dark brown with wing-armed 50's-futuristic furniture. A Sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room. A full-sized mural from JPL of the Mars surface is on one wall. \nWe MOVE-PAST objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors, a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow arms, a Magnavox console TV set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and Reba on it. They're watching a movie. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSER: DOLLARHYDE AND REBA \nThe film projector hums. We don't see what movie Dollarhyde is watching. \nREBA \n(beat) That was nice of you to think of that. \nREBA My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too? \nDOLLARHYDE I have work to do at the plant. \nREBA I'll get my purse. \nDOLLARHYDE I'll get it. (leaving) Stay right here. You lock very good in the sun... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SERVICE STATION - ATTENDANT - DAY \nHe's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls in. \nDOLLARHYDE Do you want a Coke or something, Reba? \nREBA I'm fine, Francis. \nDollarhyde gets out. \nDOLLARHYDE Fill it up and check the oil, please. \nDollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood, draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He wipes and wipes the same spot. \nREBA'S \ndress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat. Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats. From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better... \nMEN'S ROOM DOOR \nNothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the backside of the van. \nDRIVER'S WINDOW \nDollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing... \nATTENDANT \nunaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of Reba. \nDOLLARHYDE \nis coming around the van. Fast. \nDOLLARHYDE You sonofabitch... \nATTENDANT (cocky) You don't like it? You know what you can do about it... \nAttendant starts away.

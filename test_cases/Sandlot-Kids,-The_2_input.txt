and shove the pipe under the green fiberglass. HORRIBLE SOUNDS ERUPT from the Badlands. Dust mushrooms over the fence. The pipe draws under in FEROCIOUS JERKS. Gone. Moments. The pole sails back over the fence - bounces on the asphalt with ANGRY CLANGS. 'Tis pretzel'd. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
Bertram arrives. Hands "it" over. How embarrassing: 
BERTRAM It ain't mine. I told you, it's my little sister's! 
A Cootie Toy. They 
ASSEMBLE THE INSECT 
putting a hunk of chewed 'zooka on each Cootie foot. Attach it to a plastic parachute - ah-ha! Genius. An airborne assault!

INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - THE BADLANDS - DAY 
THE GANG 
DRIFTS THE 
COOTIE N' CHUTE 
out the tree house window. It floats silently toward the baseball. The Cootie lands right on the Babe Ruth. The gum sticks. 
THE GANG 
hauls it in. 
THE BALL 
slowly rises. Suddenly 
THE BEAST'S JAWS 
erupt from 'neath the lean-to and CHOMP the Cootie whole. The string snaps. 
THE GANG 
pulls up the frayed end. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Now a War Room. Map of the Badlands: crazed trajectories, distances to The Beast, etc. Coffee can PBX system. Cardboard periscope. X's on a calendar counting down "Bill's Return." The new retreival system: 
THREE EUREKA CANISTER VACS 
all connected. Ham's catcher's mask bolted to the end pipe for ball securing. 
EXT. TREE HOUSE - OVER THE BADLANDS - NIGHT 
Toy flashlights and BSOA lanterns hang from the structure, semi-illuminating the Badlands. 
OUT THE WINDOW 
goes the vacuumtraption, 30 feet of wobbly pipe. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - NIGHT 
Squints directs the operation, looking 
THROUGH THE CARDBOARD PERISCOPE 
WE SEE the vacupipe-mask... 12 inches from the baseball. 
SQUINTS (O.S.) (coffee can muffled) A-okay. Roger, affirmative. Initiate retreival suction.

They throw eureka switch one. WEOHH!

THE BASEBALL moves a lot! 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
They throw eureka switch three! RRRWWEEEOOOHHH! 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - NIGHT 
The baseball leaps from the ground - sticks in the catcher's mask collection basket. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - NIGHT 
SQUINTS (O.S.) We have suction! Pull it up! PULL IT UP!

James gets up and starts running-- lumbers, really, in the suit -- as fast as he can towards a retreating Sanborn. 
Sanborn hears James' boots thumping towards him and cranes his neck to see 
--James running, arms akimbo 
--The Black Suit man stands up 
BOOM!! 
-- He explodes and the blast spits out fire and dust. 
--James is nailed with shrapnel and debris, knocked over. 
--Sanborn is blown to the ground. 
JAMES POV 
--through the helmet a hailstorm of particulate matter flying at 22,000 feet per second straight at us -- 
--chunks of molten metal hitting his stomach, stopped by the SUIT 
--bits of shrapnel and body parts thump into him 
--dust and blood splatters the outside of his helmet 
JAMES 
--CU his face: White. No movement. Total silence. 
--blood seeps from his nose 
--then, as if overcoming great resistance, his heart turns over -- Daaaa--duuuunk 
--sharp, loud inhale of breath. Like birth. The heart kicks in again. Da-dunk. Da-dunk. 
James struggles to stand. 
He looks uprange. 
Sanborn is staggering towards the soldiers. 
CUT TO: 
EXT   HUMVEE   DUSK 
The Humvee snakes along the desert floor. 
Traffic thickening. 
Shadows against a dimming sky. 
INT   HUMVEE 
Sanborn is in the passenger seat, shivering, and covered in grime and dust. James, in the driver's seat. 
James looks over at Sanborn. 
JAMES You alright? 
SANBORN No.   I hate this place 
Sanborn stares out the window at the unforgiving landscape. 
James passes Sanborn some Gatorade. 
JAMES Have a hit. 
Sanborn drinks, grateful, and puts the Gatorade down. Then he looks at James. 
SANBORN I'm not ready to die, man. 
JAMES Bro, you're not going to die out here. 
Sanborn shakes his head. Unconsciously, his fingers touch his neck, finding the exposed area above the collar of his body armor. 
SANBORN Another inch or two difference. Shrapnel goes zing (still touching his neck). Severs my throat. I bleed out in the sand. (BEAT) Fuck. If I die now, nobody will even really care. My folks, sure. But that don't count. Who else? (BEAT) I don't even have a son. 
JAMES You got time. 
SANBORN No... I'm done. I want a son, Will. I want a son. 
They drive on in silence. Then Sanborn looks at James, as if seeing him for the first time. 
SANBORN Why do you do it? Take the risks? 
JAMES Hell, I don't know. 
SANBORN But you know what I'm talking about, right? Every time we go out, you throw the dice. Live or die, you just throw `em down. You recognize that, right? 
Beat. 
JAMES Yeah. (softly) I do. But I don't know why. Do you know why I am the way I am? 
SANBORN No, Will, I don't. 
Silence. Then after a while:

WOMAN. I don't want to survive! I'd take him with me if it weren't for you. You know I would. Why can't you face it? 
MAN. Will you listen? You're talking 
CRAZY - 
WOMAN. It's not crazy and you know it. It's the right thing to do. They glance at the BOY. 
WOMAN. (CONT'D) Other families do it. She goes to the BOY, strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a reassuring display of being motherly. 
WOMAN. (CONT'D) Time for bed, there's a good boy. She picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed. 
END OF FLASHBACK. 
EXT. RAVINE/WATERFALL - DAY 
The THUNDER of a waterfall, the river disappears into space - the BOY and the MAN stand staring up at the waterfall, 80 feet above, shrouded in gray mist. A color spectrum is visible rising from the waterfall, like a rainbow - the boy is transfixed, clutching the MAN's arm for safety. 
BOY. What is it? The MAN looks at the BOY, surprised he's talking again. 
MAN. It's a waterfall. 
BOY. Look. Colors. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. There used to be color everywhere. You don't remember. It was before you were born. There used to be so many thnings... The BOY approaches the water's edge, shallow and clear with gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom. He scoops up some water, surprised that it seems clean. 
BOY. Look. It's clear. 
MAN. Do you want to go in? 
BOY. I don't know. 
MAN. Sure you do. 
BOY. Is it okay? 
MAN. Just don't swallow any. The MAN unzips his parka and slips it to the ground. The BOY eyes the MAN, surprised - then does the same. 
EXT. RIVER/WATERFALL - DAY 
Naked, pale, filthy dirty and shivering with cold, the BOY frolics in the spray of the waterfall. The MAN watches him enjoying himself by the waterfall, clutching his shoulders, hopping up and down, he joins him. 
EXT. RAVINE/ROCKFACE - (CAMP 6) - EVENING 
The MAN has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a shelter. He meticulously filters water through a rag into a pan. In the background, the waterfall can be heard RUMBLING. The BOY has painted his face with CRAYONS, drawing a bizarre set of FANGS and dripping blood around his mouth. The MAN studies the BOY's painted face a moment. 
MAN. Listen. That man back there... there's not many good guys left, that's all. We have to watch out for the bad guys. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. (CONT'D) And we have to talk. Always. We have to just... you know... keep carrying the fire... 
BOY. What fire? 
MAN. The fire inside you. The BOY is thoughtful a minute, and then: 
BOY. Are we still the good guys? 
MAN. Yes. We're still the good guys. 
BOY. And we always will be no matter what happens? He eyes the BOY uncertainly, unsure if he can promise this. 
MAN. Always will be. Yeah. The MAN goes back to tying the tarp. 
EXT. THE RIVER/VALLEY - MORNING

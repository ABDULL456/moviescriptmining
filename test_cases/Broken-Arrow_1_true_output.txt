INT./EXT. SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER/DESERT 
The helicopter glides over wind-whipped sand, searchlights on. Rhodes sits with MCKELLAR, the pilot. Lieutenants KELLY, REED and THOMAS are in the back. 
IN THE SAND Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on. 
RHODES Hold it. Come back. The lights sweep back, find... 
THE TIP OF BLACK WING Sticking out of the sand. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PENTAGON - NIGHT 
Establishing shot. 
INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM 
AKA "The War Room." Phones, faxes, computers, TV monitors, backlit maps and coffee. Present are GENERALS (including Air Force General CREELEY), the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF (CHAIRMAN) and ASSISTANTS, all in uniform. They turn as... 
BAIRD Enters. Baird, 60s, is the White House Chief of Staff. His assistant stays in the b.g. as Baird walks in. 
BAIRD So, do I wake the President? 
CHAIRMAN Where is he -- Las Vegas? 
BAIRD 
(NODS) Computer convention. Some information superhighway crap. 
CHAIRMAN Let him sleep for now. (hands Baird a piece of paper) We're going out with this. Rick's team prepared it. The chairman nods toward RICK. Baird reads, mumbling. 
BAIRD "United States Air Force ... regrets to announce ... C-130 heavy-lift cargo plane ... down over the Utah desert ... status of crew not determined at this time ... yadda yadda ... Nice bullshit, Rick. Baird hands it to Rick, who starts for the door. 
GILES (O.S.) That's a mistake. The room quiets. All eyes on... 
GILES Baird's intensely competent assistant. 
BAIRD Giles ...? 
GILES Aviation Week has been following this plane's development for years. They have stringers who spend their vacations sitting in lawnchairs all night long by the Whiteman perimeter fence just in case one of these things takes off. The boys in those lawnchairs know one took off tonight. They're going to know when it doesn't come back. 
(MORE) 
GILES (cont'd) And when we put out a press release saying a C-130 went down in Utah, they're going to put two and two together. Aviation week will run a story, everyone'll know what really happened and we're going to look real stupid. 
(BEAT) We might as well tell the truth. 
BAIRD (mock shock) The truth? How the hell did you get this job? A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman -- well? The Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to Rick. 
BAIRD Rewrite it. What Giles just said. Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles. 
BAIRD I want you in Utah. Now. Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm. 
BAIRD You scare me sometimes. 
GILES Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare myself. And out Giles goes. 
EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE 
Rhodes and his men are on the ground. Wind is whipping the sand. Rhodes is walking under part of the wing that is exposed. He's yelling into a headset microphone. 
RHODES (into mike) Cockpit's empty! We're checking the payload!

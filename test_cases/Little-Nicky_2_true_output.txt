NICKY I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't live here! 
PETER Dude, it's us.  Let us in. 
Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in. 
JOHN There's like a total mob scene coming this way. 
We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside. 
NICKY I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip. 
Todd i s looking out the window. 
TODD Looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit. 
PETER What'll we do now, Beefy? 
BEEFY I don't know, this is a little out of my league. 
VOICES GROW LOUDER. 
VOICES (O.S.) Come on.  Let's get 'em. 
JOHN What would your dad do, Nicky? 
NICKY Good idea...kill me. 
PETER Dude.  Seriously? 
NICKY Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you. 
JOHN AND PETER (psyched) Alright! 
John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen counter.  Nicky is dazed. 
NICKY That just hurt a lot. 
TODD I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can I do it? 
JOHN Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John and Peter watch happily. 
TODD Die, Grandma, die! 
Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand drops back in.  He's dead. 
INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER 
Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking at his hand. 
LUCIFER Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the bra. 
The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we see his breasts flop out. 
LUCIFER (CONT'D) Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big, two hillbillies were blowing on them. 
The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one ear). 
NICKY Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am I gonna do? 
DAD What are you gonna do?  Look at me, Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear... 
Dad's remaining ear falls out. 
DAD (CONT'D) I got no ears!  I can't hear! 
JIMMY THE DEMON Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears! 
NICKY Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have any advice at all for me? 
DAD I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear anything!

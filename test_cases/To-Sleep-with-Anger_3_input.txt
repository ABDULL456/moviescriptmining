INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Suzie is sitting in a chair; her head is bent forward. Gideon is TALKING in his sleep. She awakes and nods off again. Harry sticks his head in. 
HARRY How is he doing? 
SUZIE As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest. 
HARRY I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway. 
Harry helps Suzie to her feet. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Okra is painfully standing on his bad feet. He is in his security-guard uniform, holding a bouquet of greens. As Suzie comes in, Okra tries to stand upright at attention. 
OKRA I brought you these greens and some salt meat. 
SUZIE That is very thoughtful of you. I haven't had time to tend to my garden like I should. 
Suzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter. She squeezes Okra's hand as a thank you. She pours him a cup of coffee. Okra eases down into the chair. He crosses his legs and starts massaging his feet. 
Suzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him. She stretches and tries to hold back a yawn. Okra looks at her in a slightly desirous way. 
OKRA You know Gideon and I are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother. 
SUZIE You are very sweet, but Gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him. He has a policy. 
OKRA If you become a widow, you will need someone around to fix the whatnots. We like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge. I know Gideon ain't gone yet, but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line. I just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal, to be first in line so to speak. 
Suzie keeps herself under control; she tries to find words to say. She stands up. 
SUZIE Excuse me. I have to go feed my dog. 
She turns the fire out from under the coffee pot and exits the back door. 
Okra unties his shoes and begins to massage his feet. 
INT. BEDROOM / EXT. YARD - NIGHT 
Harry is sitting by the bed, just visible through the window. He seems restless. 
EXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY 
There is only one hen left in the coop. The garden is full of weeds. The sunflowers are bent by the force of the wind. A bag is thrown over the fence. 
The shadows of pigeons flying overhead race along the ground. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Two shadows on the wall are facing each other. The shadows are the heads of two women, Suzie and Hattie. 
HATTIE You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog. 
SUZIE I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house. 
HATTIE Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children. 
INT. HARRY'S ROOM - DAY 
Harry has a plate of food in his hand. He stands facing himself in the mirror, staring at himself while he eats. He opens the door to leave but Sunny is in the hallway with his back turned sweeping. Harry stares at him and decides to go back in his room.

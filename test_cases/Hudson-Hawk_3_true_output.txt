THE LONG HALLWAY 
Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats. 
HAWK Why does this have to be so hard... 
KAPLAN Tell me about it... 
Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the darkness. 
Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY- FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun. 
Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into Kaplan's hands. 
HAWK Take this to Hell with you... 
Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp. 
Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture to the charging limousine. 
KAPLAN My pension..... 
The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield. 
Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash into the windshield. 
Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp. 
Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun. 
Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin, locking his legs around his neck and crushing him down into.... 
THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE 
Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's gun goes off.. 
right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing down on the accelerator. 
THE LIMOUSINE 
blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and bashing off paintings and mirrors. 
THE BACKSEAT 
Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side of Hawk's hand into its teeth. 
OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE 
A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes a weird bloody line across the wall. 
INT. BACKSEAT 
Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg- lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream. Darwin's entire body bucks wildly. 
Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun. Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls, and pushes him upward through the sunroof. 
DARWIN God-damnit, I only wanted to destroy the world in my own image. I'm a regular Joe... 
Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting in the wind. 
The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin. 
Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it.... 
DARWIN Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God, let's talk abut this. 
The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's body connects with the mural. 
INSIDE THE LIMO 
Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs. 
HAWK Wow, this is really gonna hurt the resale value...

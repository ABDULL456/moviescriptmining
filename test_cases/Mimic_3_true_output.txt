Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An arrow below it points east. 
ERNEST Graffiti artist, uh? (To Homeless People) Look guys, just get off my beat, you hear?  Get moving. 
Ernest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him, pick up their things and head into the gloom. 
Ernest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti painting of The Stickman. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER 
Ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in weakly from grates above. 
He stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER. 
A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal... 
A FIGURE crouched over something. 
We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds. 
CU ERNEST 
Squinting to see over his flashlight beam. 
ERNEST Hey, buddy! 
No answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and ingested.  Ernest is revolted. 
ERNEST Get off my track... 
The crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN. 
Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff of hot wind that signals an approaching train. 
Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance. 
The Overcoat Man stands up. 
Ernest stops in his tracks. 
For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood. 
A dead dog. 
The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his chest... 
...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING FROM HIS TORSO. 
ERNEST Sweet Jesus... 
The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He begins walking toward Ernest. 
Ernest backs away. 
The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS PAST! 
CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful arms. 
Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the dark figure, then raised above, taken away. 
TRACK 
The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS. 
The track is empty again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER 
We PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'. 
INT. EXHIBITION FLOOR 
EXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc. 
An opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the displays; most just camp out at the buffet table. 
Peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her. 
PETER Heya. (Kisses her on the cheek.) Where's the boss? 
Siri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit. 
SIRI Ant mound. 
Peter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one of her eyes. 
PETER You okay? 
SIRI It's just a headache.  We were sandblasting Trump Tower here since four this morning. 
PETER Maybe you should sit... 
SIRI I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could use a good word right now. 
She nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves. 
Siri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the insect bite on her hand. 
PETER

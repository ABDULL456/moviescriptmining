VANESSA I can't feel anything. 
Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby. 
VANESSA It's not moving for me. 
She says this as though it's an admission of failure. 
JUNO Oh, you should try talking to it. They can apparently hear speech in there, even though it sounds all ten thousands leagues under the sea. 
Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly. 
VANESSA Hi. Hi, baby. It's me. My name is Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you. 
Leah gives a look to Juno as if she's about to barf. 
VANESSA Can you hear me sweet angel? 
Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Then suddenly, 
VANESSA Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it! 
JUNO (nods) Elbow. 
VANESSA Wow! It's magical. 
Juno smiles at Vanessa in awe of her genuine affection. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING 
The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run. 
INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - BREN'S DESK - DAY 
Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno's jeans. Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic waistband. 
INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
We're behind that same WAISTBAND, as Juno walks through the students. Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL ROOM" - DAY 
Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards of an awful commercial. 
CU - THE SCRIPT (storyboards). A kitchen scene with a kid eating a new breakfast product called -- BRUNCH BOWLZ. 
Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song... 
MARK IF YOU'RE TIRED OF BREAKFAST BUT NOT HUNGRY FOR LUNCH, MICROWAVE YOURSELF A HEALTHY BOWL OF BRUNCH! 
Mark drops his head, dejected. Then, the phone rings. 
MARK (picks up) Hello? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
JUNO So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me. 
Mark instantly smiles. 
MARK Oh really? What's the verdict? 
JUNO I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute. 
MARK Cute?

They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of them are too drunk to be scared. 
JACK Where is your captain? Ou est votre capitaine? 
One man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and Spanish. 
298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON 
It's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down their colours. 
A cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured flag. 
A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre. BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow. 
299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON 
A doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody apron, red-eyed from fatigue. 
JACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair and blood-stained cutlass. 
JACK Le Capitaine? Where is he? 
The doctor points at a body on the operating table. 
JACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ] somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black coat draped over his body. DOCTOR Il m√°vait prie de vous donner ceci. 
Passing JACK the captain's sword. 
300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON 
JACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY. 
CALAMY He's dead, sir. 
Gently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms. 
Friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses the gangway to... 
301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE 
...then with CALAMY following, he goes below. 
302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY 
JACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix of grief and depression, the old question, "Was it worth the price?". 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE UP ON - 
303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN 
The two ships anchored close together on the ocean. 
304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN 
As eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen crewman. 
DAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks, BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach - 
CALAMY I'll do it. JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him alone. 
As CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard distinctly from below. 
HOLLAR (O.S.) Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble up! Tumble up! 
In close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY 
HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D) Sleepers awake! 
...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed. 
305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN 
The small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck. JACK's voice drifting across the water. 
JACK John Henry ALLEN... Joseph NAGEL... William Horner... Stephen Winston Boyle... and Lieutenant William Blakeney 
We therefore commit their bodies to the deep, looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead... Amen. 
ALL Amen. 
The bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea. 
306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY 
Wide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend.

Pete and Sheila are naked in the front seat.  Sheila clings to Pete as they make love.  She's hopelessly in love with him. 
FADE OUT: FADE IN: 
INT. ARNIE'S GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Pete and the other MECHANICS are working in the garage.  The clock on the wall reads: 4:45 p.m. 
Some of the guys are cleaning up - washing their hands - putting tools away. 
Pete is ragging off some grease from his hands when he notices a CAB pull up to the front of the garage.  The beautiful blonde steps out of the cab and comes up to him. 
Pete's heart races - she smiles at him. 
BEAUTIFUL BLONDE (ALICE) Hi. I'm Alice Wyatt. 
PETE Pete Dayton. 
ALICE I was here yesterday. 
PETE Yeah, I remember. 
ALICE How would you like to take me to dinner? 
PETE (laughs uncomfortably) I don't know. 
ALICE Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner. 
Pete hesitates - thinks. 
PETE Look, I don't think it's a good idea. 
Alice looks hard at him, then smiles. 
ALICE Where's your phone?  I have to call another taxi. 
PETE (pointing) Over there. 
Alice walks to the office inside the garage - picks up the phone and dials information. 
ALICE (into phone) Can you give me the number for United Cab? 
She turns and looks at Pete while she's speaking, then listening. 
ALICE (CON'T) (into phone) Thanks. 
Alice dials the number. 
ALICE (CON'T) (into phone) Yes, I need a taxi at Arnie's Auto Repair, the corner of Fifth and... 
Pete has walked over.  He takes the telephone out of her hand. 
PETE (into phone) We won't be needing a cab, thanks anyway. 
He hangs up the phone. 
ALICE Why don't we just skip dinner7 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ARTHUR'S HIDEAWAY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Pete and Alice pull up to the cheap motel in Pete's Camaro. Pete gets out and leaves Alice in the car. 
She waits and watches him go into the office. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ARTHUR'S HIDEAWAY MOTEL - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT 
Ed and Al are watching Pete and Alice.  They watch Pete come out of the office and take Alice into one of the motel rooms. 
ED 'Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat. 
Al shakes his head with anger mixed with a lot of envy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARTHUR'S HIDEAWAY MOTEL - A ROOM - NIGHT 
Pete and Alice enter the room. There is a double bed, a little desk, two bedside tables with lamps, a floor lamp, and a bathroom.  They don't notice any of this. 
Just inside the room Alice takes Pete's hand and they turn to each other.  Alice puts Pete's hand between her legs.  She moves up close to him and closes her eyes. 
They kiss tenderly at first - then hotter. 
ALICE (whispers) Take off my clothes.

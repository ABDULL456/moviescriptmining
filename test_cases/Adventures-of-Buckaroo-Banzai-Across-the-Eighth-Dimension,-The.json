The invisible body? \nPERFECT TOMMY Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey... \nRENO ...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo? \nPERFECT TOMMY Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid Overthruster. \nRAWHIDE Faulty design.  It sucked. \nRENO ...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else? \nPERFECT TOMMY It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho. \nBUCKAROO BANZAI It?  Who does? \nINT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT\t261 \nProfessor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at... \n...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES... \n...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror. \nINT.

JOHNSON Oh, wow... \nReno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the corner of Buckaroo's desk... \nJOHN EMDALL After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed \"Lord\" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed too good for their ilk. \nRENO Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her? \nMRS. JOHNSON She's not in her room...I looked. \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing? \nJOHN EMDALL Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of existence. \nRawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere in the room... \nPINKY CARRUTHERS \"John Parker\" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil.

For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. \nPERFECT TOMMY An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American first strike! \nPENNY PRIDDY How did she die?  I wanna know. \nBUCKAROO BANZAI You don't wanna know. \nPENNY PRIDDY Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think. \nBUCKAROO BANZAI She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. \nPENNY PRIDDY Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character. \nBUCKAROO BANZAI I wish he was.  He's real enough. \nPenny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed photograph of Peggy... \nPENNY PRIDDY God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget her though. \nOne look at Buckaroo says it all... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Never. \nPENNY PRIDDY I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time. \nPENNY PRIDDY Go where?  Where're you going? \nBUCKAROO BANZAI (squatting close to her) Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right. \nPENNY PRIDDY What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai? \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself. \nPENNY PRIDDY Believe in Penny Priddy? \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Absolutely. \nPenny looks into his eyes... \nPENNY PRIDDY You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI It's too dangerous. \nPENNY PRIDDY That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming... \nStarry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK... \n...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in... \nPERFECT TOMMY (breathless) Buckaroo--! Sorry-- \nBUCKAROO BANZAI What is it, Tommy? \nPERFECT TOMMY Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab... \nBuckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny: \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Stay here, I'll be back. \nPENNY PRIDDY Sure.

Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor... \nRAWHIDE Apache? \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Arachtoid. \nRAWHIDE So I was right.  That's nice to know... \nAcross the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker... \nPINKY CARRUTHERS We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to... \nPinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition. \nBuckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing there... \nRawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to \"John Parker\"... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Any antidote for these things? \nJohn Parker holding the stinger in his palm... \nJOHN PARKER No, none. \n...as it suddenly comes alive!  He drops it to the floor, stomps it to death... \nPERFECT TOMMY That mean you're on our side? \nRAWHIDE (sinking) We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo. \nBuckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI We will, old fried, we will. \nRAWHIDE Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go... \nBUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness mixed with anger... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI There's another one we owe 'em. \n...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP... \nCASPER LINDLEY They're stealing my chopper! \nThe Cavaliers racing for the window... \nRENO And they got Penny!

Now, do you think they're gonna listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do you think they will? \nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (being handed a dispatch) Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.

So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains. \nPROF.

Where's Penny? \nPERFECT TOMMY New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion. \nPerfect Tommy and Reno pacing Buckaroo... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Got a casualty list? \nRENO Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out... \nPerfect Tommy whistling... \nPERFECT TOMMY Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in! \nScooter's eyes lighting up as he runs over... \nSCOOTER LINDLEY Is this what you're looking for, Buckaroo? \nThe Oscillation Overthruster, safe and sound.  Buckaroo amazed, receiving the precious object, giving Scooter a Blue Shield salute...the Secretary of Defense watching jealously from a short distance, his clothing disheveled... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Looks like one Junior Shield is in line for a ride in The Jet Car. \nSCOOTER LINDLEY Wow, you know it! (suddenly crestfallen) I'll have to ask my dad. \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Well, go ahead, what're you waiting for? \nScooter running off. \nA dour-faced, shaken New Jersey appears in the doorway of the big bus, Buckaroo's smile immediately vanishing... \nNEW JERSEY I did all I could.  I did my best... \nBuckaroo racing past new Jersey and into the bus... \nINT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUT - DAWN\t435 \nBuckaroo hurrying through the front section. \nINT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAWN\t436 \nBuckaroo hurrying through the COMMUNICATIONS NERVE CENTER... \nRADAR SHIELD ONE Buckaroo, Reno said check with you - something about \"pirates\"?  He mean the baseball team? \nNo response. \nRADAR SHIELD TWO Buckaroo, the President's on line on.  Calling about is everything okay with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead and destroy Russia...? \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Tell him yes on \"1\" and no on \"2\". \nBuckaroo going into his PRIVATE REAR SECTION of the bus... \nRADAR SHIELD TWO Which was \"yes\"? Destroy Russia? Or \"2\"...? \nINT. BEDROOM/BUS - DAWN\t437 \nBuckaroo reaching his private quarters, finding Penny on his cot, a sheet pulled over her face...ethereal morning light caressing her still body... \n...Buckaroo distraught, pulling the sheet back to reveal Penny in final repose, speckled with dead ants, honey and powdery white insecticide... Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish. \nHis lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S! \nAnd she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both hands...SPARKS... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Penny! \n...shaking her, exhorting her... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI Open your eyes!  Look at me!  Penny! \n...but nothing, no more signs of life... \n...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT! \n", "test3_id": 962}

His hair was orange... \nBUCKAROO BANZAI And his soul black as the Ace of Spades. \nRAWHIDE He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.

So what's he up to? \nBUCKAROO BANZAI I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. \nBuckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his pocket. \nRAWHIDE And another thing.

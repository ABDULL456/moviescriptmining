WADE Heck, you don't know!  You're just whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this!  I'm sayin' call a professional! 
JERRY No!  No cops!  That's final!  This is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is my wife here! 
STAN I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here. 
WADE Well - 
STAN We gotta protect Jean.  These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em.  So they call the shots. 
JERRY You're darned tootin'! 
WADE Ah, dammit! 
STAN I'm tellin' ya. 
WADE Well...  Why don't we... 
He saws a finger under his nose. 
WADE ...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million. 
JERRY Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way! 
STAN We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing. 
JERRY Yah! 
STAN What's the next step here, Jerry? 
JERRY They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop.  I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow. 
WADE Dammit! 
THE CASHIER 
She rings up two dollars forty. 
CASHIER How was everything today? 
JERRY Yah, real good now. 
PARKING LOT 
Snow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles. Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for Stan. 
STAN Okay.  We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call? 
JERRY No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear. 
STAN Yah. 
Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold. 
JERRY Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots. 
STAN Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna be all right? 
JERRY Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk to him. 
There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the Lincoln. 
STAN We'll call. 
The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and fishtails out onto the boulevard. 
SCOTTY'S BEDROOM 
Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches uncomfortably on the edge of his bed. 
JERRY ...  How ya doin' there, Scotty? 
SCOTT Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom? 
JERRY It's okay, Scotty.  They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see. 
SCOTT What if - what if sumpn goes wrong? 
JERRY No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE/EXAM ROOM - DAY 
Curtis sits, fully clothed, on the edge of a paper covered bench in the exam room. DOCTOR SHANNAN, an older man with a smoker's voice, enters smiling and gives a firm handshake. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN Curtis, how you doin' bud? 
CURTIS Hey Doc. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN How's my girl? 
The Doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer. 
CURTIS She's good. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN That's good to hear. Tilt your head back for me. The Doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils. 
CURTIS I don't have a cold. The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN Oh. Did she get that down wrong? 
CURTIS No, I just told her that. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN Oh. So what's the problem? 
CURTIS I've been havin'...I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN How long's this been goin' on? 
CURTIS `Bout four nights now. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN You're not sleepin' at all? 
CURTIS Well some, but real restless. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN Well, I think four nights is a little too soon to tell. My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine...get some daily exercise. 
CURTIS Well, I think... Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) I think I may need to try some medication. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN Why do you say that? 
CURTIS 
(STILL RELUCTANT) The reason I've been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams I've been havin'. I didn't think it was anything at first, but then the other day I woke up and the bed was wet. 
DOCTOR SHANNAN You urinated in your bed? 
CURTIS Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this.

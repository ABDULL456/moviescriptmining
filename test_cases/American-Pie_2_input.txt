JIM (interrupting) What was your name again? 
MICHELLE Michelle. 
JIM Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom? 
MICHELLE Really?  You seriously want to go with me? 
JIM (so forced) Yes.  Seriously. 
MICHELLE Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool. 
JIM Whatever you want. 
MICHELLE Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp... 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER 
Heather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the door she sees Oz.  She stops. 
Oz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated -- 
OZ Dammit! 
He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils, still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again. Heather is impressed. 
INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Vicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on, rubbing her shoulders. 
KEVIN You're not doing the extra credit problems. 
VICKY No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April. 
KEVIN That's my trick! 
VICKY It's everyone's trick, Kevin. (she turns to him) But I did pick it up from you. 
She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious. 
KEVIN We've come a long way since Homecoming. 
VICKY (playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five. 
KEVIN Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways. 
Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk, facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic. 
VICKY Like how? 
KEVIN Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them. 
VICKY I think you're so right, Kevin. 
KEVIN (pause) You want to do it? 
VICKY Yes -- 
She takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares. 
VICKY (CONT'D) I love you. 
Kevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response. 
VICKY (CONT'D) Kevin?  Do you not love me? 
KEVIN No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us.  Something good. Something special. 
VICKY But you don't love me. 
KEVIN I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong." 
A beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from. 
VICKY Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents. 
KEVIN I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay? 
VICKY Okay. 
INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 
Oz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised, embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them. 
HEATHER Hi... 
OZ How did you know I was here?

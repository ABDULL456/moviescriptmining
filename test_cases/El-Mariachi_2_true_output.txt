VIEJO CLERK Callate, hombre!!! 
SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE (?) 
Mariachi looks up at the Clerk, then stands. 
The Mean Dude turns around and looks and looks at the Clerk. Clerk turns to look at Mean Dude, who is walking back to the counter. 
Mariachi picks his guitar from the ground. He is in full view, but no one is looking at him. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Viejo, if you see anyone new in town, carrying a guitar case, dressed in black... you can call this number, OK? 
Mean Dude writes down a phone number and the description of Azul on a little card. 
VIEJO CLERK (nodding sarcastically) And if I don't call, you'll kill me... 
MEAN DUDE (handing him the card) No. I won't kill you... he will... 
The sarcastic smile fades from the old man. Mean Dude walks away. The old man reads the card, then glances out the window. Mariachi is gone.

MEAN DUDE #5 That's him... 
The Mean Dudes start walking towards Azul as the camera tracks back with them. Azul slams the case shut, wondering what the hell is going on. He looks up and notices the Mean Dudes walking towards him. He stands up and slowly walks in the other direction. 
EXT. A BLOCK AWAY - DAY 
Mariachi is running through the streets and onto the sidewalk. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
The bad guys are pulling out their weapons. 
Mariachi bolts around the corner. Now everyone is on the same sidewalk. Mariachi and Azul are on each end of the street with the Mean Dudes in between them. 
Azul turns and sees Mariachi with his guitar case. Mean Dude #5 turns and sees Mariachi, too. 
MEAN DUDE #5 That's him... 
The two other Mean Dudes exchange glances. Mean Dude #5 stalks after Mariachi, so the other two follow. Mariachi looks to Azul for help. Azul tips the imaginary hat to Mariachi and walks away. 
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY 
Mariachi runs through the street almost getting hit. Bullets are flying as the Mean Dudes are firing at him as they run. 
EXT. DEAD END - DAY 
Mariachi leaps up over a few cars and ends up in a dead end. He turns around, drops the case on the ground and opens it. A million weapons seem to stare back at him when he opens it. He is frantic. He grabs a small gun, shakes it in his hand, doesn't like the feel. He tosses it back in. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
The Mean Dudes are barreling down the street. One turns towards the dead end. 
EXT. DEAD END - DAY 
Mariachi pulls out the MAC-10 and blasts the first Mean Dude he sees. He grabs the case and runs out into the street, jumping onto a truck and blasting the other Mean Dude from up there. He sees Mean Dude #5 run away. 
Mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in slow motion. Peolple are staring at him as if he was Azul the killer. Mariachi walks straight to the bar. A BOY is bouncing a ball on one of the sidewalks. 
INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY 
The camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a Rat sitting in a chair, drinking a beer. The other Rat is pacing back and forth in front of the sitting Rat. Azul enters the room. Throwing his guitar case onto the pool table as a grand entrance gesture. The sitting Rat stands beside the pacing Rat. 
RAT #1 I'm sorry we left...

OSCAR Naw. We gonna keep it low key. Probably just catch the fireworks, and then roll around after that.

OSCAR I'm sure they will. I'm not gonna be drinking. 
Wanda looks at Oscar, not buying it. Oscar laughs. 
WANDA Why don't you catch BART out there? That way you can drink and hang out, and not have to worry about anything. 
OSCAR Yeah we might catch BART. 
WANDA No traffic either. You know its gonna be crazy. Going and coming back. 
OSCAR Yeah, we might have to do it. 
WANDA Promise me, if you and your friends go, you'll catch the train. (beat) I'm serious. 
OSCAR Okay, I promise. 
WANDA Aight. Don't make me follow you guys to make sure... you remember Prom. 
Oscar laughs at this so hard he has to sit the bowl. He pulls out his phone and starts to text. 
TO CATO: Let's catch BART out there. Tell everybody to meet at South Hayward Station. 
He presses send. He picks the dish back up, and dries it. His phone buzzes. He look at it. 
FROM CATO: Aight bet. We'll see you there in minute. Pink (6/25/2012)                                          58.

Oscar, Sophina, and Tatiana say their good-byes to Grandma Bonnie, and Uncle Daryl and Uncle Ceephus. 
Oscar walks up to Wanda. 
OSCAR Alright we out, Birthday Girl. Love you. 
WANDA Love you too, son. And Happy New Year. 
Oscar gives her a big hug and kiss, then turns and leads his family out of the door. Wanda watches them, and shuts the door behind him. 
41     INT. SOPHINA'S CAR- LATER                                    41 
Oscar drives through Hayward in silence, turning his wheels. Tatiana watches out of the backseat passenger window with a solemn expression. 
She looks up at a bright flash of light in the sky. We see outside her window, a group of YOUNG TEENAGERS stand on a street corner and shoot off a Roman Candle.

Oscar and Sophina sit in the front seat of the car. They both look tired. They look back at Tatiana who continues to lookout of the window. 
OSCAR (whispering) You don't want to just call it a night? 
Sophina thinks about this. Shakes her head. 
SOPHINA (whispering as well) I want to go to the city... It's been a minute since we been out together too.

They both get out of the car. Oscar grabs Tatiana and walks up to the house. He rings the doorbell.

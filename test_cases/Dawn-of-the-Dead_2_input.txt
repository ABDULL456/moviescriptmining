703	Several creatures now wander through the Department Store, having entered from the second storey gate. They move through aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking it human, throws the dummy aside roughly. 
704	The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone. Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running his hand along the edge. 
Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one at a time and runs onto the balcony. 
705	Bikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone. 
706	The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above. He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late. 
707	The big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies. 
708	Below, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to peel out of the mall entrance one at a time. 
709	Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies. 
710	The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures. 
711	The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out. 
712	Peter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid, he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels off with his scope. 
713	He shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out. 
714	Regrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight. 
715	One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance. He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors. 
716	Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine. 
717	The bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement, stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him. 
718	The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade away. 
719	The puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing. 
720	In the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely. They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously, the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area. 
721	Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork. Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button. 
Steve:	PETER! 
Peter:	WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? 
Steve:	IN THE ELEVATOR! 
Peter:	LISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN. 
Peter starts to crawl through the ducts. 
722	Steve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall. 
723	Suddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently. 
724	In the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor. 
725	In the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and close repeatedly against the creatures which block it. 
A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice... 
726	Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently. He is angry and confused. 
727	Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors finally close. 
728	Outside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors. 
729	Inside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in his hand. He finds it hard to breathe. 
730	Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran looks down. 
Fran:	NO.....NO! 
She runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as she is about to charge out into the hall. 
Peter:	I HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE... 
731	The mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn. 
732	Zombies move through the building freely, walking the halls, lumbering through the stores. 
733	Several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors. As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes contact with the elevator call button. 
The doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now. His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now.

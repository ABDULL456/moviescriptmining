FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
BRONX APARTMENT HOUSE, STAIRWAY. NIGHT 
Mrs. Pilletti, in her hat and coat and carrying a purse, is making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing. She pauses to catch her breath on the landing. Then she moves down the hallway to... 
ENTRANCE TO APARTMENT 4-B. 
Mrs. Pilletti rings the bell. The SOUND can be heard as she waits. The door is opened by Virginia. 
VIRGINIA Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in. 
Mrs. Pilletti enters the apartment. 
APARTMENT. 
Virginia closes the door after Mrs. Pilletti enters, and they stand in a small narrow hallway, brightly lit. At the far end to the right is the living room in the background. 
MRS. PILLETTI (in a low voice as she pulls off her coat) Is Catherine here? 
Virginia helps her with her coat. 
VIRGINIA (nods, keeping her voice low) We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you? 
MRS. PILLETTI I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling. 
Thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an anxious smile on his face. 
THOMAS Hello, Aunt Theresa. 
MRS. PILLETTI Hello, Thomas. 
THOMAS I just this minute got the baby to sleep. 
He comes down to Mrs. Pilletti and Virginia, lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. 
THOMAS Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see... 
MRS. PILLETTI Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing. 
A shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered conference in the hallway. 
CATHERINE'S VOICE (off-screen) Who's there?! Who's there?! 
Mrs. Pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room, followed by Virginia and Thomas. 
MRS. PILLETTI (calling back) It's me, Catherine! How you feel? 
CATHERINE comes in at the end of the foyer. She is a gaunt woman with a face carved out of granite. She is tough, embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work ingrained into her features.

He hangs up, drives a little longer...letting what Casey said sink in. Then... 
BILLY 
(TO HIMSELF) Shhhit. 
...he turns on the radio. 
ANNOUNCER V/O Tim Hudson is carving through this Royals line-up and at the end of three, it's the A's 11 and Kansas City nothing. 
BILLY 
(QUIETLY) Oh God. 
(BEAT) Ohhhh God. 
BILLY sees the sign for the next exit coming up. He makes a decision and quickly crosses to the right, just making the exit. 
CUT TO: 
A141 OMITTED A141 
141 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - LATER - DAY 141 
BILLY is striding through an underground corridor which is echoing with the cheers of 55,000 fans. 
142 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD LEVEL - DAY 142 
BILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there. 
BILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the 3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching. Billy looks around. He sees the scoreboard, a FAN with a big funky cowboy hat, the charged-up crowd in the stands, it's like the Coliseum at Rome. 
A143 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY - TOP OF THE 4TH A143 
IBANEZ of the Royals singles to center field. 
RANDA of the Royals singles to left field. But the Oakland fans are still jubilant and do the wave. 
Then a big error from Tejada puts runners on 1st, 2nd and 3rd (MAYNE, Ibanez and Randa). 
A143A EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - MAGIC HOUR - TOP OF 4TH A143A 
As if we've entered the Twilight Zone, it becomes twilight and LIGHTS GO ON. 
DEE BROWN of the Royals singles to right, bringing Ibanez and Randa home, and Mayne to 3rd. 
Ibanez and Randa high-five each other at the plate, passing Billy as they head to their dugout. Okay, the Royals are on the board now: 11-2, but just barely. Until- 
A143B EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 4TH A143B 
PEREZ of the Royals singles to center field, bringing Mayne home. Then TUCKER of the Royals doubles to left field. Justice makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and suddenly the Royals have 5. Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd, Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with Peterson and Hudson. 
And finally Billy, who WALKS OUT. 
B143 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 5TH B143 
MIKE SWEENEY of the Royals singles to left-center field -- Neither Justice or Long get it, it lands between them. And they have WORDS. 
Randa makes a sloppy single to left field... this one goes between Justice and Tejada. 
C143 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - BOTTOM OF THE 5TH C143 
MONTAGE of A's at bat: Hernandez grounds out, DURHAM strikes out, Mabry grounds out... A stunned A'S FAN stands up with his arms out in a "WTF??" gesture. While the A's are still up, this is excruciating for the fans. 
143 OMITTED 143 
144 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 144 
ANNOUNCER V/O Kansas City's scored five and Oakland's lead is down to six as Art Howe comes out to the mound to pull Tim Hudson. 
Art Howe comes out of the dugout, gives the signal for "underhander," takes the ball from Hudson. 
ANNOUNCER V/O He'll go with the submariner, Chad Bradford. 
We see SHOTS OF FANS in the sold-out stadium experiencing the height of tension and excitement in sports. 
Chad Bradford comes off the bullpen mound to relieve Hudson, and begins counting his steps - 
CHAD One, two, three, four - 
145 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 145 
Chad arriving at the mound taking the game ball from Art, who we see is genuinely supportive and encouraging to Chad. 
146 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 146 
Chad finishing his warm-up pitches. 
CHAD I know what it is to be in need and to have plenty. I am content. I can do all things through Christ who gives me 
STRENGTH-- 
147 INT. ART'S OFFICE - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 7TH 147 
BILLY is just as tense as the fans. 
BILLY (to himself but to 
CHAD) Okay Chad, let's see it. 
148 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 8TH 148 
CHAD walks Mayne. An angry fan throws toilet paper onto center field, the one thing Long manages to pick up. The crowd grows anxious. CHAD's submariner pitch to the next batter, DEE BROWN, walks him. BROWN trots down to first and there are now two runners on. Some FANS have to cover their eyes. There's a pitcher conference. 
Art Howe simmers in frustration. He signals Rincon to warm up. The fans aren't happy either. 
ORDAZ of the Royals grounds to Tejada, who throws home for the force, and misses. Now it's 11-6! 
Howe pulls Bradford. Rincon throws a controversial strike out. The Royals batter, TUCKER, protests, and fans go crazy BOOING. 
Brown scores, 11-7 now, Royals chipping away that lead, 
AND -- 
Howe pulls Rincon. Tam comes in to relieve him. Sweeney's up. In rapid succession, we seem him battle off TEN PITCHES of Tam. He's got two strikes on him, more toilet paper flies on the field, Bowie comes in to warm up which Tam sees, then - 
SWEENEY HITS A THREE-RUN HOMER TO MAKE IT 11-10! This is excruciating. 
149 OMITTED 149 
150 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT - TOP OF THE 9TH 150 
BOWIE is already gone. KOCH is on the mound. There's a Royal, PELLOW, on 2nd. According to the scoreboard, it's 2 outs, 2 strikes. If Koch throws a strike, the game is over. The fans are fucking feverish. ALICEA of the Royals singles to left and Pellow scores. The game is now TIED. 
In their dugout, Royals GLOAT. 
He's ended the inning, but in the A's dugout, Koch slams the wall.

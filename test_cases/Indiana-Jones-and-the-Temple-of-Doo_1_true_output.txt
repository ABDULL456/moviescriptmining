WILLIE (confidently) Five minutes, Dr. Jones...

Indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room:  wall paint- ings show palace scenes and landscapes; life-size figures dance and there are full-scale portraits or Rajput princes and prancing horses.  But Indy's more concerned with lust than with art. 
INDIANA (muttering) ...want me to be her palace slave! 
He picks up his whip and smiles, considering using it on her. Then he just grubles and tosses the bullwhip onto the couch.

Lying in bed in a seductive pose, Willie waits for Indy to show up and she starts to look worried.  She grabs a clock and shakes it to see if it's working.  She taps her fingers irritably won- dering in her charm has failed... 
71.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          71. 
We see another clock ticking.  Looking annoyed, Indy tosses a boot at it and the clock falls on its face, setting of the alarm. 
On the chaise lounge in front of Indy's bed, Short Round moves groggily and sees Indy turning off the alarm. 
SHORT ROUND (half asleep) Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things... 
INDIANA Okay, Shorty ... see you in the morning...I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie. 
Indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal instincts.  He buttons his shirt, puts his boots back on and grabs his leather jacket. 
As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized paintings of armed gaurds standing in silent vigil.  Suddenly we see something frightening behind him:  one of the wall paintings sees to come to life! 
A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly around Indiana's neck! 
The huge assassin stands behind Indy, twisting the cord even tighter around his neck.  As Indy attempts to break free he sees the assassin's face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow light glowing in the killer's eyes. 
72.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           72. 
Willie's finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg petu- lantly. 
WILLIE He's not coming...I can't be- lieve it... 
She walks across the room and opens the door.  She looks out the empty hall -- and her resolve starts to weaken -- 
WILLIE (Cont'd) Well... (bracing herself) No!  I'm not going over there... 
She comes back into her room and kicks the door closed. 
WILLIE (Cont'd) Sleep tight, Dr. Jones! (suddenly melancholy) I could've been your greatest ad- venture... 
73.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          73. 
Indy shoves the assassin backwards, ramming the big man into the wall.  The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on the chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all! 
Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees  - his eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at the ends of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's fists. 
Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's head with a skull-crushing clang! 
The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him into a somersault and sening him flying over his back.  The ass- assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise.  Short Round still doesn't wake up. 
Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath. He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife flies through the air and slams into the wall. 
Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass- assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and wraps around the killer's neck. 
The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer gasping for air now as his face turns red. 
Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in- stant to grin victoriously -- 
Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass- in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel-- 
And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor. The assassin screams as he is hanged!  His legs twitch in his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up. 
Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the couch and draws a small dagger -- 
SHORT ROUND Don't worry, Indy!  Where are they?! 
Short Round spins a 360 , then looks up and does a double-take seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the ceiling fan. Indy takes Short Rund by the shoulders and turns him away from the grisly sight. 
INDIANA It's okay, it's over -- go turn off the fan. 
Short goes over and turns off the fan -- the assassin's body drops and Indy recoils his whip.  Suddenly they hear a hideous scream -- Willie!

In a tight close-up:  Willie screams again.  She's lying in bed looking down at something -- 
Moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous-looking insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops breather.  Immo- bilized by fear, Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck. 
Across the suite, the doors burst open and Indiana rushes in. Shorty is behind him, carrying Indy's whip.  Indiana leaps on a stools and slides up to the bed to save WIllie -- 
Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to have some fun. 
INDIANA This a cheap trick to get me over here? 
Willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision -- 
WILLIE No -- don't you see -- crawling --

MRS. STEPHENS We both have the key of the door... Mine needs oiling - and yours needs exercise... Off you go. 
HELEN Thank you. 
She kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass. 
HELEN remember that you lost the toss. 
She walks to the door. 
MRS. STEPHENS Helen... 
HELEN Yes, darling? 
MRS. STEPHENS If you're back in five minutes... I won't even finish this. 
HELEN Done! 
She hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass. CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble. 
MARK'S DARK-ROOM 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark- room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack. 
He puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock. 
CLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking. 
A knock is heard off. 
Mark looks up. 
MARK Who is it? 
HELEN (O.S.) Helen... 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.  Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the Key of the Door'.  He looks down at the clock. 
MARK (calling) Come in, Helen! 
INT. PASSAGE - EVENING 
Helen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark call out from the inner room: 
MARK (O.S.) Would you... please... wait in there?... Developing. 
Helen goes in, closing the door behind her. 
INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING 
Helen enters. She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark- room. 
HELEN Mother heard you come in - so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed ... 
No reply from the inner room. 
HELEN Are you sure this is conven... 
MARK (O.S.) Won't be long! 
Helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round the room. 
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair. 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it, curiously, fingering the stops. 
MARK (O.S.) Hallo. 
Helen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of the dark-room. 
HELEN Hallo, Mark... 
He walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring at the recorder in her hand. 
HELEN I hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder? 
MARK Yes. 
Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf. 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. 
HELEN I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to... 
Her voice trails away. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package. 
MARK Happy birthday. 
HELEN Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really. 
MARK It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please. 
HELEN (gently) Thank you... 
She takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender brooch 
HELEN It's beautiful... 
MARK I like the design... More milk? 
HELEN More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this... I'm going to put it on now. 
He watches her hold it against her dress. 
HELEN There?... Or there?... 
MARK The first place... 
HELEN I think so too!... 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen pinning it on. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark touching his lapel. 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch. 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking clock in the dark-room. 
Helen looks up, and sees him. 
HELEN I am keeping you. 
MARK No... I promise. 
HELEN Mark, I'm here for some advice. 
MARK From me?  Please...

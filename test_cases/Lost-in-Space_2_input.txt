JOHN 
After it. Move. 
(to the Robot) 
Bring Smith. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR 
Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor. 
THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery. 
Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside. 
INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB 
A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don. 
WEST 
This explains where all the plants came from. 
JUDY 
Growth like this would take decades. 
The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw. 
SMITH 
Unhand me, you mechanical moron. 
Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head. 
WEST 
Don't move. 
SMITH 
I am sick of your terrorism. If you are going to kill me, be done with it. Otherwise I will insist you treat me with the respect and- 
WEST 
(like steel) 
I said don't move. 
Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he pulls from its hiding place a small creature. 
About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Will is watching through the Robot's eyes. 
WILL 
Neat. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN 
West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more friendly blue. Judy approaches. 
JUDY 
Well, who do we have here? 
As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like, trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast. 
WEST 
Easy there, little buddy. No one's going to hurt you. 
SMITH 
How do you know it won't hurt us? 
Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds. 
JUDY 
Looks like you've made a friend. You have a good bedside manner, Major. 
WEST 
I'm going to let that one go. 
SMITH 
How charming. Doctor Dolittle of outer space. 
JUDY 
Where do you think it came from? 
JOHN 
It's possible this is one of the creatures represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It must have been their ship attached to the other docking ring. 
The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there, burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH. 
WEST 
It looks like a child. 
SMITH 
If so, my dear Major, what do you suppose happened to its parents? 
JOHN 
Let's get back to the bridge. 
As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the background. Ominous. Unseen. 
CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders! 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Penny is still hanging overhead. 
PENNY 
I think I've got it. 
The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor. 
MAUREEN 
That's strange. 
SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with ambient heat. Penny lands beside her. 
PENNY 
Those scales are giving off heat. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE 
John is at the Com. 
JOHN 
I've tapped into the internal sensor array. Besides us, this ship is totally deserted. 
SMITH

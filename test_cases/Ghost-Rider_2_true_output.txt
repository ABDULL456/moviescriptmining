Arlo enters, accompanied by the Pulsifer Brothers. Carrigan and Landsdale are waiting to meet them. 
ARLO So you need some contract work? 
CARRIGAN An escort. We're making a delivery first thing tomorrow morning. 
ARLO And will there be mayhem involved? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIGAN Yeah, I'd say a certain amount of hijinx are likely to ensue. 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT 
Blaze moves around the back of the compound. Up ahead, TWO GARGOYLES are lingering by a side entrance. 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT 
Arlo takes out a nail clipper, starts trimming his fingernails. 
ARLO Well, I'll tell you, I got nineteen brothers out there willing to go the distance and enough firepower to give a small Balkan nation a fucking titty- twister. But we don't come cheap. So how many men we going up against? 
CARRIGAN One. 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
WHACK! Blaze elbows Gargoyle #2 in the face. As the biker drops, we SEE that Blaze has already disabled Gargoyle #1. Blaze quietly slips in through the door. 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Nomi has worked her way through a half-dozen bikes now and a fair amount of gasoline has pooled on the ground around her. 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT 
Arlo looks at Carrigan, incredulous. 
ARLO One man? 
CARRIGAN One man. 
ARLO You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister? 
CARRIGAN Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things -- 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Blaze sidles down the hallway, moving as quietly as he can. We can HEAR the men talking in the office just next door. 
CARRIGAN (O.S.) See, this guy's not really a "guy". He's more like a demon or something. 
ARLO (0. S.) A demon? 
CARRIGAN (O.S.) That's right. 
ARLO (O.S.) What, exactly, do you mean by demon? Blaze winces, lifting a hand before his face -- BLUE FLAMES dance over his fingertips. He leans against the wall for support. When he removes his hand, he leaves a singed palm- print on the drywall. 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT 
Arlo puts the clipper away, starts arranging the fingernails on the desk before him into a neat little pile. 
CARRIGAN Like his head's on fire and shit. Arlo LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to Landsdale, icy now. 
ARLO Brotherman, what in fuck's name is this smooth faggot talking about? 
INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Blaze exhales a wisp of BLUE FLAME, totally enveloped in a bubble of heat. More than anything, he wants to step inside, fully aflame. But he forces himself to simply take a peek -- 
BLAZE'S POV; The room, the men -- but no Rain.

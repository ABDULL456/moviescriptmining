{"train": "BLADE : TRINITY \nOver darkness a WOMAN'S VOICE speaks to us. \nABIGAIL (V.0.) Italo Calvino once said that myth is the hidden part of every story, the buried part, the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to enable us to get there. (beat) But I was there for the end.  I took part in it.  And I think my words can help shed light on what happened.  My name is Abigail.  This is our story. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN \nHarsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of rocky desert.  Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur. \nSUPER TITLE:\tSOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE \nSIX MONTHS AGO \nAN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER \nkneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.  He is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO. \nPresently, we hear HELICOPTERS.  The sheepherder looks up -- \nTWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS \napproach from the East.  They touch down near the base of the ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust. \nFOUR FIGURES \ndisembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.  They wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the teeth.  To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens. \nOne of the figures turns to the East.  We can see the rising sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He raises a gloved hand, gives the \"finger\" to the new day. \nAnother figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward. They mount the central steps of the ziggurat. \nINT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY \nThe shrine is empty.  The woman activates a wearable computing device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat. \nShe kneels, studying the floor.  In the corner of the room she identifies a particular brick and presses it.  We hear hidden COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up -- \n-- revealing a stone stairway leading down. \nINT. ZIGGURAT - STAIRWAY - DAY \nDark.  Sepulchral.  Spooky.  The figures descend into -- \nINT. ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY \n-- an empty room with an earthen floor.  The sunlight from above barely penetrates down here.  One of the figures takes out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating -- \n-- walls covered with CUNEIFORM WRITING.  The male figure who flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset. \nMALE FIGURE That's great. We've got dick. (turning to the others) Is there any reason we had to embark on this cluster-fuck during the day? \nThe woman removes her helmet.  This is DANICA TALOS.  A vampire.  Intense, appearing to be in her 30s.  Possessing a regal air.  She wears a silver crucifix around her neck. \nDANICA Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You know that. \nOne by one, the others remove their helmets.  All vampires: \nGRIMWOOD (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs. \nASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma. \nWOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative.  Right now he's readying a portable ground-penetrating radar unit. \nGrimwood studies the writing on the walls. \nGRIMWOOD What is this chicken-scratch? \nDANICA Cuneiform. Dates back about four thousand years. \nGRIMWOOD So why here? \nDANICA Because this was the cradle of civilization.  He would've been comfortable here. \nASHER I don't know, Dan.  Seems like another dead-end. \nWOLFE I'm not so sure -- \nWolfe looks at his unit, excited.  The others gather round. \nVOICE (0.S.) (mocking) \"My people\".  You think I'm your messiah? Your Savior? \nWe hear MOVEMENT.  A pair of RED EYES pierce the gloom -- and God help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this guy has to be the scariest mother-fucker we've ever seen. \nVOICE What makes you think I wanted to be brought back? \nA hand emerges from the darkness, armored.  Danica wants to bolt.  Instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a taloned finger brushes her throat. \nDANICA Times have changed.  Science has made great strides.  Your blood, the sacrament you provide -- it can set us free now. \nVOICE I see.  And the one I killed earlier?  He was vampire? (off her nod) You must forgive me.  It had been centuries since I last fed. \nDANICA I understand. \nVOICE Then offer yourself to me, child -- (lifting her chin) -- and let me quench my thirst again. \nINT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWHOOSH!  The vault doors open and Danica stumbles out, all but falling into Asher's arms.  She's bone-white and there are fresh BITE MARKS on her throat, BLOOD staining her shirt. \nASKER Danica!  Are you alright --?! \nShe nods, shaking, struggling to recompose herself. \nDANICA Let him out -- he wants to see what's become of his world. \nCUT TO: \nA VIDEO MONITOR \nLARRY KING launching into the intro of his show. \nLARRY Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance, forensic psychiatrist and author of the New York Times best seller \"Human Health: The Whole Being Breakthrough\".  Also with us is Martin Vreede, Chief of Police.  They're here for an hour and they'll take your calls.  Next on Larry King Live. \nINT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT \nTaping is underway.  Larry King sits at his desk opposite EDGAR VANCE (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic demeanor and movie star good looks.  CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE (50s, square-jawed), joins via remote feed. \nLARRY Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a biochemist, isn't that right? \nVANCE Yes.  I've long believed that in order to achieve true health, we have to reconcile the body and the mind.  Of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions, which is what my work is all about. \nLARRY Let's talk about that.  How do you account for the fascination with things that go bump in the night?  Movies, books, videogames -- seems like we can't get enough of our boogeymen? \nVance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras. \nVANCE Monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external.  In the case of vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism. These are scary subjects for people to own up to. \nLARRY So we pass the buck to someone else? \nVANCE Exactly.  Historically, people suffering from medical conditions have always been our psychological scapegoats.  In the Middle Ages schizophrenia was often attributed to demonic possession. \nLARRY And vampires? \nVANCE Well, there's a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits.  People suffering from this disease are anemic, they become sensitive to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic -- \nLARRY Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me that's good for the heart. (turning to Chief Vreede) Chief Vreede?  What's your take on all the recent rumors we've been hearing about vampires? \nVREEDE The only vampires I'm worried about are the ones passing the bar exam. (laughing) Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you think we'd be on to them by now?  The truth is, our streets have never been safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent crime is down across the board.  If people want to be concerned, they should focus on criminals like Blade. \nLARRY Now who's this?  Tell me about him. \nVREEDE He's a sociopath we've been pursuing. \nVANCE Blade is a very disturbed individual. Even the name he's chosen for himself is troubling.  According to witnesses, he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. You have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here.  What does a person like Blade really want? Odds are, he's really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's slaying monsters, but he's really trying to murder aspects of himself. \nThe sound of GUNFIRE pre-laps over from the next scene as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP/PARKING LOT - NIGHT \n-- a MASSIVE EXPLOSION ripping through an industrial building. Banks of windows BLOW OUTWARDS, FIRE ROlLS, brick walls CRUMBLE, raining debris everywhere. \nA SCREAMING, BURNING MAN \ngoes tumbling into the night air.  Buoyed by the explosion, his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet. \nMORE MEN (VAMPIRES) race out, some of them on fire. \nCLOSER \n--\tBlade reaches between the seats, ACTIVATING the newly installed nitrous oxide fuel-injection system. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \nHyper-speed.  The Charger jets forward as the NOS nitrous system boosts the car's speed by another 300 HP, leaving any and everything in its dust.  In seconds, it has caught up to -- \nSTONE AND CAMPBELL \nThey draw TEC-9s, FIRING back at Blade.  The bullet-proof windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the engine -- but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork. \nINT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \nBlade gives his car another jolt of nitrous.  The Charger SURGES FORWARD as Stone and Campbell fall back, veering to either side.  Now Blade is ahead of them.  He checks their position in his rear-view mirror, then stands on the brakes -- \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \nThe Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat, causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade. \nThe vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like crash-test dummies.  Stone SMASHES through Blade's back windshield, continuing into the front seat-- \n-- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield wipers at the last minute. \nINT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \nBlade clutches the wheel.  He's got a HOWLING vampire in the front seat, upside down, covered in windshield fragments and another perched on his hood, obscuring his vision. \nStone tries to right himself, clawing at Blade.  Blade struggles, keeping one hand on the wheel while he -- \n--\treaches for a shotgun secured between the seats.  He FIRES.  As the vampire ASHES, Blade hits a button on the dash. The passenger door opens, spills Stone onto the road -- \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \n-- right into the path of an oncoming bus!  WHAM!  Stone is ground to paste and -- \nINT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT \nTOURISTS, mostly elderly.  The passengers are jolted in their seats as the wheels of the bus KA-THUMP over Stone's remains -- \nOLD WOMAN I hope that wasn't a dog. \nINT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \n-- and we're back in Blade's Charger as Campbell continues to HAMMER away at the windshield.  The windshield spiderwebs. Campbell manages to get a clawed hand through -- \nBlade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in Campbell's snarling mouth.  He pulls the trigger -- \nBOOM!  Campbell's CINDER-REMAINS blow over the cracked windshield.  Blade hits the wipers, spritzes window cleaner - but the mess turns to ashen sludge.  making the view worse! \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \nThe Talor is up ahead, weaving in and out of traffic. Fighting to see, Blade accelerates, gaining ground -- \nThe VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out of his own wihdow, looking back at Blade, FIRING an AUTOMATIC PISTOL -- \nINT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \nBlade's windshield, already weakened by Campbell, SHATTERS, blowing glass fragments all over him.  Undaunted, Blade calmly reaches for his dash, hitting a button labeled \"UV\". \nEXT. BUSY STREET/BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \nRoof-mounted UV DAYLIGHTS come on, bathing the car ahead and \n(more importantly) the vampire driver with UV LIGHT! \nThe vampire at the wheel SHRIEKS, ASHES, leaving the car \ndriverless.  Gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel -- \nINT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \nBURNING REMAINS blow back at us.  Then the view clears and -- \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \n--\tBlade SLAMS his charger into the Talon.  The cars briefly lock, grinding SPARKS.  Then they disengage.  Blade jerks his steering wheel, gives the Talon ANOTHER SLAM. \nThe Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk, PLOWING DOWN newspaper vending machines and table-top displays piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart. PEDESTRIANS duck for cover and -- \n-- the Talon gets some serious air, ROLLING onto its side as it comes back to earth. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nCUMBERLAND Book us a flight, Hale.  Time to take these cowboys down. \nCUT TO: \nWHISTLER (0.S.) Pack of Reds and some matches. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY \nWhistler is buying a pack of cigarettes when he notices\t-- \nA BLACK AND WHITE TABLOID \non display nearby.  The cover story features a BLURRY PHOTO of Blade's recent melee with the vampires. \nWhistler picks up the tabloid, studying it.  Next to the photo is an ARTIST'S SKETCH OF BLADE.  The headline reads: \"GUN TOTING PSYCHOPATH CAPTURED ON FILM!\" \nWhistler nods to the CASHIER, hands over some more cash. \nWHISTLER I'll take this too. \nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY \nWhistler exits the store, perusing the tabloid as he walks. We hear the WHIR of a camera's HIGH-SPEED MOTOR DRIVE and -- \nA SERIES OF DIGITAL SHOTS \ncapture Whistler as he moves down the sidewalk. \nANGLE ON AN FBI AGENT \nperched on a nearby roof, taking surveillance photos. \nFBI AGENT Subject is heading West. \nWHIP-PAN to a parked CAR, Cumberland and Hale seated within. \nCUMBERLAND Got him. \nCumberland starts the car, starts following Whistler. \nWHISTLER (0.S.) Congratulations.  You're famous.  Just what we needed. \nINT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE ON the tabloid as Whistler slaps it down on a workbench. WIDEN to include Whistler and Blade. \nWHISTLER Somebody screwed us.  Your face is all over the papers, the television.  Media's eating it up. \nBLADE Like I care? \nWHISTLER You should.  Something like this -- (gesturing to the tabloid) -- taking out a human, even one working for the vampires -- far as the rest of the world's concerned, you're public enemy number one. \nBLADE Didn't realize this was a popularity contest. \nWhistler shakes his head, frustrated. \nWHISTLER Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's happening?!  The fuckers are finally getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires we have to worry about, we're gonna have to take on the rest of the world too. (beat, adamant) They've got us on the run.  These last few months we've barely been staying ahead of the curve. \nBLADE You worry too much, old man. \nWHISTLER I've been doing this since before you were born, Blade.  The moment you stop worrying, you're dead. \nThen Whistler's face softens for a moment. \nWHISTLER Since the day I found you, you've been like a son to me.  I taught you everything I know. (beat) But I'm tired.  You understand? \nEXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT \nIt's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic. PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk. \nWe move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER. \nVOICE (O.S) How about that one? \nSECOND VOICE (O.S.) No fatties.  They taste like Cheetos. \nTHIRD VOICE (O.S.) What about that shrunken apple-head beeyatch-a-saurus over there? \nVOICE (O.S.) Fucking blow me, man! \nCRASH!  The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.  The roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING -- \nCUMBERLAND Take him down! \nAn FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking aim.  BA-BANG!  Four projectiles expand out from the barrel, carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them. \nThe netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his movements.  Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission -- \nINT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT \nOn the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself against a piece of machinery.  He's bleeding, been shot to hell.  One of his hands is closed, clutching something. \nAgents warily close in around him, guns raised. \nAGENT Move a finger and you're dead. \nWHISTLER (flipping them off) How 'bout this one? \nWhistler lets his other hand uncurl. He's got a REMOTE in his palm, with a tiny digital timer counting-down. \nAGENT #2 He's got something in his-- \n00:03.  00:02.  00:01.  The timer reaches zero. \nA SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS \nrock the workshop, knocking the agents back. \nEXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane force.  In the midst of the conflagration -- \n-- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors -- \nBLADE WHISTLER!!! \n-- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping up everything in its path, turning the world to white. \nINT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nFADE IN.  We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face. His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness. \nCUMBERLAND (O.S.) Rise and shine, sleepyhead. \nPULL BACK.  We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window. Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining down on him.  He looks disoriented, battered.  Very weak. \nCumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade. \nBLADE Who --? \nCUMBERLAND Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a long time. \nBLADE Whistler -- \nHALE Dead.  Just like all of your victims. \nBlade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away. \nCUMBERLAND How many people have you killed?  Thirty? Forty?  A hundred? \nBLADE Those were familiars -- people who worked for them -- \nCUMBERLAND And by \"them\" you mean vampires, right? I suppose next you'll be telling us that Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? Maybe you can give us some pointers. (counting on his ringers) You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? Do those still work? \nHALE I don't know, Ray.  What if a vampire's Jewish? \nCUMBERLAND That's a good point.  And does garlic work on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need saffron or something? \nHale laughs.  Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading. \nCUMBERLAND You can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want, Blade, but it's not going to play.  You're a stone-cold killer.  And you're sick as fuck. \nVANCE (O.S.) Let's leave the diagnosis to the professionals. \nANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE, \nstanding in the doorway.  He's the man we saw on Larry King. He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table. \nVANCE Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance. I'm with the Department of Mental Health. I've been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you. (to Cumberland and Hale) Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few moments alone? \nCumberland nods.  They rise, exiting the room.  Vance smiles, trying to project a sympathetic air. \nBlade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS. \nBLADE He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working for them! \nVance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to say -- \"The man's deranged.  What can I do?\" \nINT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nOn the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging lunatic.  Vance enters.  He extends his hand to Vreede. \nThey shake.  As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the inside of Vreede's wrist as well.  Another familiar. \nINT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nBlade stares at his own reflection in the mirror.  He blinks, trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in. \nINT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAn elevator door opens.  Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit, followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney.  As they move down the corridor, they pass -- \n-- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede. \nCUMBERLAND Just hold it right there -- \nDanica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him. \nCumberland looks to Hale.  Something isn't right about this. \nINT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nBlade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now. \nBLADE'S POV \nHis vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving trails as he shifts his head from side to side and -- \nASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD \nenter, followed by two of the orderlies.  Despite his incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise.  Danica plants her heel in his chest, shoving him back down. \nDANICA Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere. \nShe draws closer, enjoying herself. \nDANICA We moved the humans around like, pawns, Blade.  Used them to flush you out. \nBlade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK! Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw.  A brutal blow. \nGRIMWOOD Don't worry, Captain Sunshine.  Soon as we get you out of here, you'll get a chance to play. \nDanica motions to the two vampire orderlies.  They step forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade. Blade THRASHES madly.  Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this. \nDANICA Don't make this any harder than it has to be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can help you now. \nBA-BOOM!  The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it -- \n-- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies -- \nASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room!  Seconds later -- \nA MAN \nVAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing two high-tech electronic pistols. Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an irrepressible grin.  Slapped to his chest is a \"Hello, my name is\" sticker with the words \"FUCK YOU\" written where the name should be. \nKING Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death? \nDanica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly -- \nKING He kept biting his own lip. \nDANICA King! \nThe lights go out.  Immediately, backup lights come on, followed by FIRE ALARMS.  In the ensuing confusion ~ both pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire orderlies behind him to take the hit. \nTHE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES \nBut unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside out.  (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS, explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.) \nKing whips around, FIRING at -- \n-- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table.  She quickly upends it, using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King. \nA tiny \"egg-timer\" dial on the arrowhead spins.  It CLICKS in place, a RED LED comes on, and -- \n--\tthe arrowhead EXPLODES, catching all three vampires with the full force of a UV BLAST.  Grimwood ducks away from the blast as the other two vampires ASH -- \nBLADE, KING, AND ABIGAIL \ncome racing out of the alcove.  They reach a stairwell.  Blade RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging up the stairs.  The cops go down like ten-pins. \nBlade and company have an opening.  But as they charge downward -- \nBLADE (as King and Abigail freeze) My sword.  They still have it. \nKING (apoplectic) Are you insane?!  We're practically home free!  We can't go hunting for your fucking butter-knife now! \nBut Blade is already heading back the way they came and -- \nKING Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is supposed to be a rescue! \n-- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs. \nABIGAIL Forget it, King.  Let's move. \nPOLICE STATION - NIGHT \nKing and Abigail rush outside.  The station is gated. FLASHING POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate. They're trapped.  Then -- \nCRASH! \nA window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD. Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in a cat-like crouch.  With his sword in his hand.  He looks at King, grins, flips him off. \nBLADE Now we can go. \nKING (nudging Abigail) Is he epic or what? \nThe police close in around them, pinning the trio down with FIREPOWER.  Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because -- \nHEADLIGHTS \nare washing over them.  A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is SCREAMING up the street.  The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk, SMASHES right through the gated wall.  SCREECHES to a stop between our trio and the police cars. \nA DRIVER (DEX) \nleans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors pop open.  Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter. \nDEX My name is Dex.  And I'll be saving your ass this evening. \nBlade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land Cruiser.  Dex reverses, backing out the way he came. \nThe police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off. \nINT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT \nIn the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield -- \nABIGAIL'S POV \nGrimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land Cruiser.  Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah. \nEXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT \nAbigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in her bow.  She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly -- \nSHUNKT!  The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye.  He goes down, his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background as the Land Cruiser speeds away. \nINT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT \nSafe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a battle well fought.  Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone. \nDEX We have him.  We'll be there soon. \nKING (to Blade) So my entrance back there -- what do you think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money? \nKing unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs. \nBLADE Who are you people? \nKING My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter, like you. (re: Abigail) And this little hellion is Abigail Whistler. \nAbigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him. \nKING That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part of Whistler's \"contingency plan\". \nON DRAKE, \nviewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire, striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk. \nSlower.  A HEARTBEAT.  The pulse of the people.  And over this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are -- \nOUTSIDE A GOTH STORE \nDrake studies a window display.  Halloween merchandise. Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES.  We see vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key chains.  Even Dracula bobbleheads. \nDrake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature on display before him. \nINT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT \nDrake enters. The store is crowded with low-end junky goods that might appeal to tourists visiting Hollywood Boulevard. \nA pallid, Goth-guy CASHIER sits behind a counter, eating from a takeout container.  He's wafer thin, with a detached attitude.  A snot.  Further back is a sultry GOTH VIXEN. \nBehind them, on a TV, a cartoon is playing. An animated vampire cavorts -- \"LITTLE BIT\" (like the Hot Stuff devil from Ritchie Rich comicbooks) \nDRAKE In the window -- you sell vampire merchandise? \nGoth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin.  Doesn't want to engage with Drake at all. \nGOTH GUY Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a few things. \nHe and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense.  Then she tries to be a little more helpful. \nGOTH VIXEN We've got Dracula lunchboxes.  Did you see those?  And there're bobbleheads, Pez dispensers.  We've got just about anything -- (selecting a vampire- shaped vibrator, playful) -- even vampire vibrators. \nAs Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending rage.  Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments. Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire. \nGOTH VIXEN Here, check this out -- \nShe reaches into a case, pulling out a soft-drink.  The label reads: \"DRA-COLA\" and has a stylized vampire on it. \nGOTH VIXEN \"Dracola\".  Makes you want to cry, doesn't it? \nDrake just stares at the can.  His mind seems to have retreated elsewhere.  Back through the ages. \nGOTH VIXEN Was there something special you needed? \nDrake doesn't respond.  A kind of melancholy has settled over him.  He's an outsider now.  The world has moved on. \nGOTH-GUY Hey, guy, she's talking to you. \nDrake looks up as Goth Guy pours a bowl of Count Chocula. \nEXT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT \nCRASH!  Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into the display window of the store opposite us. \nINT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT \nGoth Vixen SCREAMS.  Drake LASHES out.  hauling her over the counter.  He sinks his teeth into her throat, drinking her blood with wild abandon.  He consumes it so quickly that his skin flushes BRIGHT RED. \nThen Drake tears his head away, lifting his face upward as he flings the girl aside, unleashing an ear-splitting ROAR.  And for a brief moment, the bones of his face seem to shift, once again hinting at another shape Drake might take. \nEXT. THE CITY - VARIOUS \nDRAKE's ROAR echoes through the canyons of downtown. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT/DAY \nTime-lapse.  The sun rises over the decrepit amusement park. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAWN Sunlight slices down through skylights, bathing Blade, King, Abigail, and Sommerfield in its warmth.  Zoe has joined them. She's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious. \nBLADE Why wake up Drake now? \nABIGAIL That's what we've been trying to figure out. \nKING When I was under the fang there used to be talk about some kind of vampire 'Final Solution'.  But I could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source.  I mean, seems stupid, right? They've always had plans for the human race.  Seems likely that whatever they're cooking up, Drake's return is a part of it. \nBlade nods, pensive. \nKING (CONT'D) Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a losing battle. So we kill a few hundred of them a year. Big deal.  There are thousands of them out there.  Maybe tens of th'usands.  We need a new tactic. \nBLADE Like what? \nHedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms.  On the stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette. \nKING This little mamacita -- a modified version of the Army's Objective Individual Combat Weapon.  Pick your poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking mini-rockets.  Whatever gets you hard, this puppy will pump out. (gesturing to Blade's sword, sarcastic) Of course it doesn't have the range of a sword but -- \nNext, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that Abigail used.  He gives the device a twist and -- \nHEDGES We call this the UV arc -- \nCHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping outward.  Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER. \nHEDGES You hold the arc in the center, curved away from you.  Connecting the tips is a powerful UV laser beam.  Because of its high focus, the laser cuts through vampire flesh like a knife through butter. \nKING We're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general shape-shifting?  Maybe. \nHEDGES (off Blade's look) Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that.  But another human, someone with the same approximate body mass -- given enough practice it might be possible. \nBLADE How? \nHEDGES He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure.  Probably something more like a snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array.  Commensurate with this would be an exquisite control of electrical potential across his tissues, resulting in an ability to effectively change shape at will -- \nKING (raising his hand) Question.  Have you ever been laid, Hedges? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - DAY \nBlade, King, and Abigail, newly suited up for war, moving towards the Land Cruiser. \nBLADE Time to apply some pressure.  The weak link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars.  Vampires can't go out in the day, so they get humans to do their dirty work for them Blood-running, safe house maintenance, whatever -- (climbing in the Cruiser) We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll lead us to the real thing. \nBlade starts the ENGINE. \nINT. LAND CRUISER - DAY \nBlade looks to Abigail, who sits in the back.  She has a laptop on her knees and is assembling an MP3 playlist. \nKING She's making playlists.  Likes to listen to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip hop, whatever kids these days are listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G fan. \nFinished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on her portable MP3 player.  MUSIC CUE.  The smoking bassline of Jurassic 5's 'A Day At The Races' kicks in as -- \nEXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY \n-- Blade, King, and Abigail cruise the streets in a jagged fast-forward montage. \nEXT. SEEDY BAR - DAY \nThe Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front of a scuzzy bar.  Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and flyers we see a vampire glyph. \nINT. SEEDY BAR - DAY \nBANG!  Blade KICKS open the door.  A couple of LOW-LIFES take notice.  Blade moves around the bar, opening a refrigerator - we see packs of REFRIGERATED BLOOD inside. \nOne of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear -- \nEXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY \n--\tSTUMBLING right into Abigail's arms.  She trips him up, swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him.  She pulls the back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH -- \nWe can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing, raising his hands in a \"please don't hit me anymore\" manner. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY \nThe Land Cruiser rockets down the streets. \nEXT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSES - VARIOUS - DAY \nIn quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives -- \n-- a pool hall -- \n-- an internet cafe -- \n-- an electronics repair shop -- \nAll are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested. \nIn each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to oldfashioned strong-arm tactics: \n-- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar. \n-- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw. \nPast the RECEPTION DESK are the elevators with more monitors showing the video greeting.  As Blade, King, and Abigail approach, TWO SECURITY GUARDS move to intercept them. \nSECURITY GUARD Excuse me, can I help y-- \nCRACK!  Blade effortlessly tosses the guards aside, sending them CRASHING into the nearest monitors. \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe trio continue.  A DOCTOR steps out of a doorway.  King PUNCHES him in the face.  We see another video monitor. \nVANCE What does it mean to be human?  Since the dawn of creation our ancestors have asked ourselves that question. \nThey round the corner -- \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - SECOND HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \n-- nearly colliding with TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS.  Blade takes them both out.  There's another video monitor. \nVANCE The modern world today is filled with countless challenges.  In every direction we look, toxic stressors are impacting upon our happiness.  We think we're healthy, but the truth is, our immune systems are engaged in a life or death struggle to maintain our well being. \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nBlade, King, and Abigail storm in.  An EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT is moving to stop them. \nEXECUTIVE ASSISTANT I'm sorry but you can't -- \nAbigail KICKS out the man's knee, then slices her hand into his windpipe, silencing him. \nVANCE Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain how a series of remarkable new breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the quality of your life \nBlade aims his shotgun at the door leading to Vance's office. He FIRES at the keycard lock, KICKS down the door -- \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY \n--\tstartling Dr. Vance himself, who is rising up from behind his desk.  Vance is wiping his mouth, not dressed like a doctor would normally be.  But we hardly notice this as -- \nVANCE What --? \nBLADE Payback, Vance. \n--\tBlade aims his shotgun at Vance's head.  Vance just smiles, seemingly unconcerned as -- \n--\tAbigail circles around the other side, getting a view behind Vance's desk where -- \nVANCE'S BODY \nlies on the floor.  His throat has been ripped out.  And this body is dressed like a doctor. \nKing puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath the Vance double's flesh -- \nKING Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake! \nThe Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS a glass window.  Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING him clear across the office as -- \n--\tKing advances.  The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones in his head shifting around.  He reaches for King, SLAMS him onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top. \nThen the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape. \nDRAKE \nBACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow. \nShe spins, falling -- \n-- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast. \nBLADE \ngives chase.  He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on the ground, some three stories below. \nEXT. VANCE INSTITUTE - REAR ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY \nDrake runs with inhuman speed.  He effortlessly scales a chain link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade, sailing over a trash dumpster.  Seconds later, Blade follows, catching sight of Drake rushing out into -- \nEXT. STREET MARKET - VARIOUS - DAY \n-- a crowded urban market.  What unfolds is a foot-chase at super-human velocity.  Vampire and hunter are moving at least twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians, SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - DAY \nDrake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST. \nDRAKE Yes.  My children seek to isolate the properties in my blood that make me immune to sunlight.  Through me, they believe they can all become Daywalkers. \nDrake glances down at the street people.  Throngs of PEOPLE are massing there, pointing up at him. \nDRAKE The world's changed much since I went to sleep.  How crowded it's become.  Look at them down there.  Lives brief as fireflies.  Do you think they can ever grasp what it means to be immortal like us? \nBLADE You're not immortal.  I must've heard a hundred of you people make the same claim. And every one of them's seen the end of my sword. \nDrake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent. \nDRAKE Perhaps I will as well, then.  But I think it's more likely that you will fall before mine. (beat) Catch. \nDrake tosses the infant at Blade.  Blade twists around to catch it, scooping it safely up.  But when he looks back -- \n-- Drake is gone. \nKING (O.S.) Shit! \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON King being propped up against the wall by Abigail. Blade has joined them.  King is in terrible pain. \nKING Jesus, it hurts.  I wanna be a vampire again -- fuck!  Did you see that guy?! We're gonna lose, man.  We're gonna fucking lose. \nAbigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt.  She removes a small aerosol cannister from her belt. \nBLADE What's that? \nABIGAIL Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic protein.  Help me spread the wound open. The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in his body cavity from within -- \nTogether they spread the wound apart.  King is really hurting, breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain. \nKING Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian vampire say to the other? \nABIGAIL Shut up, King. \nKING -- see you in twenty-eight days -- \nKing's voice trails off as he passes out.  Abigail triggers the dispenser, spraying a jet of compressed foam into it.  The foam condenses, sealing the wound up. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nBlade and Abigail enter the HQ, hauling King between them. Dex and Hedges rush to meet them, relieving them of King. \nExhausted and covered in blood, Abigail retires to her quarters, stripping off her clothes. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOWERS - DAY \nAbigail stands beneath (he showerhead, turning her face up into the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from her body. \nCLOSE ON the drain by her feet, BLOOD swirling down it. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY - DAY \nKing drowses on a cot.  His shirt is off and his chest has been bandaged.  He opens his eyes, SEES Blade above him. \nKING Hey, Blade -- say we're successful.  Say we wipe the vampires out.  What happens then?  You ever ask yourself that? (weakly) Somehow I don't picture you parked on a porch with a jigsaw puzzle. \nKing drifts back into unconsciousness again, leaving Blade left to ponder his words. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - DAY \nLater, Sommerfield and Hedges consult with Blade and Abigail. \nHEDGES So basically we're in an arms race. They're using Drake's DNA to build themselves a better vampire -- \nBLADE (noddin) -- and we need his blood to kill them. (to Sommerfield) How's this weapon of yours coming along? \nSODDERFIELD We're almost there -- \nShe gestures to a series of ampule-like prototypes.  (We'll see the completed version of this device later on.) \nSOMMERFIELD The virus is harmless to humans.  So we decided to go after the vampires' food source.  The one thing we know for sure about vampires is that they have to drink blood. If we manage to pull this off, we'll be able to contaminate every blood source on the planet.  They won't have anyone left to feed on. \nABIGAIL Doesn't do us any good if we don't have time to finish it.  We can't just sit here.  We need to take the battle to them. \nSommerfield lowers her head, thinking. \nSOMMERFIELD If the vampires are trying to isolate the hereditary factor in Drake that makes him immune to sunlight, they'll require certain kinds of laboratory equipment and provisions.  For instance, there's an enzyme called Taq Polymerase.  And there are only a limited number of suppliers. (beat) Give me a few hours.  I'll see if I can't hunt us up some leads. \nCUT TO: \nHendrix moves to the door, checking a surveillance monitor. He can't see anyone outside.  He shrugs, turns to leave and -- \nCRUNCH!  The door is SMASHED inward, taking much of the door frame with it, flattening Hendrix. \nBlade and Abigail step inside.  As Blade hauls Hendrix up from the ground, Abigail points her already drawn gun at -- \nCHIEF VREEDE \nHe was reaching into his jacket for his own piece, now thinks better of it. \nBLADE Doing a little moonlighting, Chief? \nBlade nods to Abigail.  She reaches onto Vreede's jacket to disarm him.  Blade grips Hendrix by the shirt collar. \nBLADE C'mere.  We need to talk. \nBlade PUNCHES Hendrix in the face.  Hendrix sags for a moment, stunned. \nBLADE Now spill it, bite-boy. \nHENDRIX (wiping a bloody nose) You know what we're doing.  Drake has come back to us.  Soon we'll all be Daywalkers. And when that day comes, the world will truly be ours. \nBlade nods towards the back of the lab where another door -- a very secure one -- is located. \nBLADE What's back there? \nHendrix shoots a quick look to Vreede.  Then he turns on Blade, all fangs and claws, trying to tear Blade's eyes out -- \nAbigail FIRES her UV gun with blinding speed and -- \n-- Hendrix is dead before he knows it.  ASHING all over Blade. \nBlade brushes Hendrix' s remains from coat collar, shoots Abigail a look:  \"Did you really have to do that?\" \nBLADE (dryly) Thanks. \nAbigail cringes.  Mea culpa. \nBlade looks to the floor.  Aside from some cinders, all that remains of Hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard. Blade picks up the keycard, looks to Vreede. \nBLADE What's behind Door Number One? \nVREEDE They'll kill me -- \nBLADE (an evil grin) So will I.  But I'll enjoy it more. \nVreede nods.  They move towards the door.  Blade slides the security card.  An inset light changes from RED to GREEN. Vreede punches in a numeric code.  The doors slide open -- \nINT. BLOOD FARMING FACILITY - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT \nBlade, Abigail, and Vreede emerge into a cavernous room. \nABIGAIL God in Heaven -- \nHUNDREDS OF HUMAN CADAVERS \nhang from gantries, preserved in fluid-filled pods, suspended by wires like nightmarish marionettes.  The bodies are hooked up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and IVs which are designed to replenish vital nutrients. \nBLADE What was this place? \nVreede pauses before answering, looking uncomfortable. \nVREEDE It's a blood farming facility. (elaborating) They decided that hunting humans on a piece-meal basis was too inefficient. Why kill your prey when you can keep them alive?  Productive.  Under optimal conditions a donor can generate anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a year. \nABIGAIL (sickened) But where did you get all these people? \nVREEDE The streets.  In any given year you've got two to three million homeless people wandering around America -- (shrugging) No one cares about them.  We're doing the country a service, really. \nBlade shakes his head, admiring the horrible efficiency. \nBLADE The vampire Final Solution. \nAbigail moves towards one of the pods, touching her hand to the glass, studyihg the comatose person within. \nABIGAIL Are they aware?  Do they feel anything? \nVREEDE (shaking his head) They're in a chemical-induced coma. They're brain-dead, vegetables. \nBlade angrily SLAMS Vreede's face against one of the pods. \nBLADE Look at this!  Is this the future you want?  You think there's a place for you in their world? \nThe girl scurries away.  Sommerfield TAP-TAPS with her cane, moving towards the storage area.  She finds a gun cabinet, feels around with her hands, locates an electronic pistol. \nINT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT \nSommerfield enters.  Dex and Hedges are sprawled on the floor before her, having been slaughtered.  Blood is everywnere. She doesn't see them, of course.  But we do. \nTHE CAMERA SHIFTS AROUND, \nrevealing Whistler crouched right behind her! \nShe's unaware of his presence.  And as we watch, his facial features shift.  We hear the sickening sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING and we realize that it's Drake, not Whistler. \nWith mounting dread, Sommerfield turns towards the sound.  And then Drake is upon her, rushing forward with a GROWL. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nAs Sommerfield's AGONIZED SCREAMS echo through the warehouse, Zoe rushes into the bathroom, looking for a place to hide. She considers the lockers, discounts them.  Then settles on -- \nA HEATING GRATE \nnear the floor.  It's about fourteen inches wide -- just barely big enough for her to squeeze into. \nZoe kneels, prying the grate off.  Inside, a heating duct extends four feet before making a ninety-degree turn upward. Zoe climbs into the duct feet first, scooting her body backwards.  Then she reaches for the grate, securing it back on, sealing herself inside. \nINT. HEATING DUCT - NIGHT \nZoe waits.  It's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct. She's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position. \nZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) \nMostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway leading to the hallway outside. \nShe listens, trying to hear past the sound of her own \nBREATHING which has been magnified because of the ducting. \nThe screams from the outer rooms have stopped.  Then -- \nZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) \nA pair of boots appear in the doorway -- Drake. \nZoe holds her breath.  We HEAR Drake searching the bathroom, opening the lockers and bathroom stalls. \nZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) Drake's boot-clad feet pass by the grate again, closer, tn~s time. They pause for an interminable moment -- \nZoe shuts her eyes.  She can't stand it.  Finally, we hear Drake's FOOTSTEPS receding away.  Relieved, Zoe takes in a breath and opens her eyes -- \nZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) \nDrake's face is right there.  pressed up against the other side of the grate, staring at her! \nZoe SCREAMS.  With a ROAR, Drake rips the grate off.  He tries to climb inside, but the width of the duct is too narrow to accommodate the size of his upper body. \nInstead, he reaches his right arm in, extending his clawed hand as far as he possibly can.  Zoe WHIMPERS, trying to compress her mass into an even tighter ball -- \nON DRAKE'S HAND, \nhaving reached the limits of its extension -- his fingertips \nonly a few scant inches from Zoe's face. \nZoe's been allowed a moment's reprieve.  He can't reach her! \nBut then we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE.  Of TINY BONES shifting beneath Drake's flesh.  Drake's fingers are elongating, snake-like Reaching for Zoe's face, rapidly closing the space whici1 separates them -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LUNA PARK/GARAGE - NIGHT \nThe real Blade and Abigail are returning.  The sliding garage door opens and the Land Cruiser glides inside. \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nBlade and Abigail enter.  The place is dark.  They know instinctively that somethong is wrong. \nBlade tries a nearby light.  The power is out.  They both draw their weapons.  Blade turns on a FLASHLIGHT.  They move onto the darkness -- \nSHADOWS loom everywhere.  It's like a tornado touched down inside.  Equipment lies smashed, tables and chairs have been overturned.  Sommerfield's lab area has been destroyed. \nABIGAIL King -- \nDANICA Poor little King.  You look so distraught. \nDanica wipes a little blood from the corner of King's mouth. She touches her fingertips to her tongue, tasting his blood. \nDANICA You're tasting a little bland, lover.  Not getting enough fatty acids in your diet? Have you tried mackerel?  Lake trout? \nKING How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck off the end of my dick? \nDANICA Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later, believe me.  But for now, we need to have a little talk. (beat) Tell us about this bio-weapon you've been building. \nKING I can tell you two things.  Diddly.  And shit.  And diddly just left the building. \nGrimwood steps forward, throttling King for a moment. \nGRINWOOD Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake! \nKING Okay, here's the deal with the weapon - (coughing) It's a new flavor crystal formula.  Twice the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories. Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay -- \nGrimwood moves in to choke him again, but Danica intervenes. \nDANICA You're brave, King, I'll give you that. But underneath all your swagger -- \nShe leans closer, caressing his face. \nDANICA -- I know what you really fear.   What would hurt you more than anything else. \nKing's smile falters for a moment.  Maybe she does know.  She rubs her cheek against his. \nDANICA You don't want to go back to being one of us -- (her lips grazing his) -- do you? \nKing tries to turn his head away, but Danica grips his chin, turning his head back.  He's sweating now.  Worried. \nDANICA I'm going to bite you again, King.  And then I'm going to leave you here while you turn.  I'm going to watch you, day after day, while the Thirst keeps building and building.  And then, when you can't stand it anymore -- \nShe nods.  Drake appears, holding Zoe.  She's alive. Terrified.  Held firm in Drake's arms. \nDANICA -- I'm going to bring the little girl for you to feed on.  Would you like that, King?  Would you enjoy taking her life? \nKing shuts his eyes, sickened at the thought.  Danica smiles. \nDANICA Now we're getting somewhere, my pet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOOTING RANGE - NIGHT \nAbigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her bows.  Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets. \nAcross the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer to measure arrow speed. \nCLOSE ON Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion, re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the center-shot position and wheel timing, etc. \nBLADE \nappears in the doorway, watching her. \nBLADE You alright? \nABIGAIL (brusque) I'll be fine. \nBlade nods.  He's going to leave her alone -- but then he hesitates, wrestling to say something. \nBLADE Don't let it turn inward. \nAbigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work. \nABIGAIL It already has.  Since I can remember I've had this knife of sadness in my heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment I pull it out -- (turning back to him) -- I'll die. \nBlade nods.  He understands all too well.  He leaves. \nON ABIGAIL \nShe stands, moving to the shooting range.  She straps on a quiver, takes aim at \nA 3-D HUMAN-SHAPED TARGET \nabout a hundred feet away.  Just in front of the target is the chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts. \nWHOOSH!  Abigail FIRES an arrow.  It flies through the arms of the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest.  On the screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked at 240 feet per second.  We move CLOSER to her now as-- \nWHOOSH!  Abicail FIRES again. The speed is 242 fps. CLOSER -- \nAbigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials. \nBlade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers. \nAbigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to one of her arrowheads. \nBlade polishes his sword.  Finished, he sights down the length of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back scabbard with a flourish. \nEXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT \nWe hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles.  Blade emerges from the alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket.  Abigail appears a moment later on her own customized bike. \nBlade revs his engine.  Then the two bikes take off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nDrake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his \nright arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his burial armor.  The rest of the armor has been propped up on a stand nearby. \nDRAKE Do you know who I am? \nZOE You're the Nome King. \nDrake smiles at this. \nDRAKE The Nome King.  I like that. (leaning closer) Tell me, child.  Do you want to die? \nZoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant. \nZOE I'm not afraid -- I'll go to Heaven. \nDRAKE There is no Heaven.  No God.  No angels. No happy ending for good little girls. The only thing you have to look forward to is nothingness. \nAs Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness nearly occludes the whites of his eyes.  Zoe stares at him. Can't tear her gaze away.  His eyes are hypnotic. \nDRAKE But what if you could change that?  What if you could remain a child forever? \nHe reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek. \nDRAKE What if you could keep this little doll- like face of yours until the sun itself cooled to a cold, hard rock? (beat) Wouldn't you like that?  Wouldn't you accept that gift? \nZoe reaches out, calmly touches Drake's cheek. \nZOE My friends are coming to kill you. \nINT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nWHACK!  Grimwood PUNCHES King, whose body sags, weakened from the beatings he has undergone.  Asher and Danica look on. \nKING -- gonna be sorry you did that -- \nASHER Nobody's coming for you, King. \nKING Sure they are.  Left a trail of digital bread crumbs -- \nDANICA Excuse me? \nKING One thing you need to know about us Nightstalkers.  When you join our club, you get this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body -- \nGRIMWOOD Bullshit. \nKING Scout's honor.  One of us gets lost, the others just dial up the satellite and presto, instant cavalry. \nGrimwood looks to Asher and Danica, unsure. \nAS HER He's bluffing. \nDANICA (smiling, playing along) Okay, King, where did they put this tracking node of yours? \nHe motions for her to draw closer, whispering. \nKING It's in my left ass-cheek -- \nWHACK!  Danica slaps King's face, making him see stars. \nKING Alright.  alright, it's in my right ass- cheek -- \nWHACK!  Danica slaps King again, this time knocking his head the other way.  He spits out blood -- \nA SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES \nspan the length of the atrium ceiling. \nAbigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space -- \n-- catching hold of one of the crosspieces.  Like an acrobat, she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry.  If she loses her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet. \nBA-BANG!  A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering her with SPARKS.  MORE BULLETS follow. \nANGLE ON PAIR OF VAMPIRES \nFIRING from below, trying to pick her off.  Suddenly, UV BULLETS strike each of the vampires.  As they ASH we -- \nWHIP-PAN BACK TO KING, \nhaving dragged his battered body out onto the upper gallery. He's playing guardian angel to Abigail, laying down cover fire so she can continue.  But then -- \nDANICA KING!!! \nDANICA \nappears behind King.  She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the floor, pummeling his face with her fist. \nKing tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched. He swings his electronic pistol up -- \nDanica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the stock.  King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again -- \nINT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT \nBack to Abigail.  She's breathing heavily, trying to call up new reserves of strength.  She glances down -- \nBig mistake. \nShe forces herself to look back up.  She swings herself pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece.  A SHOT RINGS OUT -- \nANGLE ON ASHER, \ndown below, armed with a rifle.  He FIRES again -- \n-- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet.  Abigail CRIES OUT, nearly losing her grip. \nINT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT \nKing rolls on his side, spits out a bloody tooth. \nKING No offense, Danica -- (gasping in pain) -- but I've wanted to kill you since the moment we slept together. \nDANICA I was that bad, huh? \nKing reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points it vaguely in Danica's direction.  She LAUGHS. \nDANICA No bullets in your gun, King. \nKING Yeah, but here's the beauty -- (wiping his bloody mouth) -- these babies can be triggered remotely. \nKing pulls the trigger.  The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT with UV LIGHT.  Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already burning face from the glare.  She runs, horribly wounded. \nINT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT \nDrake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty feet -- \nSMASH!  Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging glass chandelier/lighting fixture. \nBlade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. Drake pounces on him.  Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows anymore.  In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's eyes. \nDrake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an entire section of the limestone flooring. \nA SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air, knocking Blade off his feet. \nINT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT \nKing loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the railing, and FIRES at Asher -- \nTHE SUN DOG \nscreams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's open mouth.  The bullet EXPLODES.  UV LIGHT causes Asher's skull to burn up from the inside out.  His headless corpse falls forward over the gallery railing.  Then it too carbonizes and BURNS UP. \nRelieved, King sinks to his knees. \nBEHIND KING, \nas the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon.  We SEE the virus flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as his circulatory system carries it throughout his body. \nON DRAKE'S FACE, \nletting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood mist.  His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into his more familiar face.  At the same time we -- \nGO MACR0 ONCE MORE \nShrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake expelled.  We continue shrinking until we are moving with the individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by -- \nDANICA, \nhaving retreated from her defeat by King.  She clutches her throat.  We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny BLACK THREADS expand across her face.  She sways, falling onto the floor.  She reaches a beseeching hand towards King -- \n-- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips. \nMORE VAMPIRES \nare feeling the effects now too.  One by one they drop, choking, going into convulsions.  As they writhe on the floor, we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies. \nBACK TO BLADE AND DRAKE \nDrake slumps against the wall.  Hero and villain are now separated by only a few feet.  Both at death's door. \nDRAKE Well done, hunter.  Well done. \nBlade stares back.  At this point, he's just trying to remain conscious.  He's lost a ton of blood. \nDRAKE You fought with honor -- \nDrake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow. \nDRAKE -- as I knew you would.  The humans are coming for you, you know.  In their eyes, you and I are the same. Allow me one last indulgence, then -- (gasping) -- a parting gift -- \nDrake grows still, his eyes locked on Blade's. \nABIGAIL AND KING \nrush to Blade's side.  Zoe joins them.  Blade is dying, fading fast.  Abigail shakes Blade -- \nABIGAIL \nBlade! \nHer voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by Blade's own HEARTBEAT which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack. \nABIGAIL BLADE!!! \nBlade's eyes can't focus anymore.  They're clouding over. \nBLADE'S POV We drop away from Abigail and King -- like we're falling down \na dark tunnel.\t Then the world FADES TO WHITE. \nEXT. CITYSCAPE\t- DAWN \nFADE IN FROM WHITE.

When they got there, all of Drake's people were dead. \nBy the time Cumberland and his men have entered, fanning out through the atrium, all they find are a series of corpse shaped piles of ash and singe marks. \nABIGAIL (V.0.)

Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as -- \n-- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING -- \nAbigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat -- \n-- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES -- \nFOLLOWING ABIGAIL \nas she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE secured to her back.  She holds the crescent in the center, the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and -- \nCHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping outward into a three-foot long metal arc.  Connecting the two ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER. \nAbigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm.  His arm falls, ASHING.  Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter -- \nFlick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling away to reveal Abigail in the background -- \nDingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life. \nAbigail gives her UV arc a twist.  It retracts.  She secures it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking \"bloop\" GUN with a large barrel.  She FIRES -- \nA rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up -- \nDingo goes down again.  He panics, trying to scrape the gunk off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap. \nAbigail calmly approaches.  She stands over Dingo, staring down at him with a look of cruel indifference.  She holsters her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE -- \nABIGAIL Scream if this hurts, chica. \n-- and SLAMS the stake into his chest. \nWIDEN OUT \nAbigail turns, surveying her work.  The ashen remains of the vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers.  In thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all. \nA train approaches, pulls into the station.  PASSENGERS disembark, flood the platform.  They tramp all over the ashes of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter. \nAbigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away. \nINT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWhistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding ring on his hand.

Near silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside. \nCLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE \nWe hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS. These are Blade's thoughts.

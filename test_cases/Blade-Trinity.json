A pair of RED EYES pierce the gloom -- and God help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this guy has to be the scariest mother-fucker we've ever seen. \nVOICE What makes you think I wanted to be brought back? \nA hand emerges from the darkness, armored.  Danica wants to bolt.  Instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a taloned finger brushes her throat. \nDANICA Times have changed.  Science has made great strides.  Your blood, the sacrament you provide -- it can set us free now. \nVOICE I see.  And the one I killed earlier?  He was vampire? (off her nod) You must forgive me.  It had been centuries since I last fed. \nDANICA I understand. \nVOICE Then offer yourself to me, child -- (lifting her chin) -- and let me quench my thirst again. \nINT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWHOOSH!  The vault doors open and Danica stumbles out, all but falling into Asher's arms.

Are you alright --?! \nShe nods, shaking, struggling to recompose herself. \nDANICA Let him out -- he wants to see what's become of his world. \nCUT TO: \nA VIDEO MONITOR \nLARRY KING launching into the intro of his show. \nLARRY Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance, forensic psychiatrist and author of the New York Times best seller \"Human Health: The Whole Being Breakthrough\".  Also with us is Martin Vreede, Chief of Police.  They're here for an hour and they'll take your calls.  Next on Larry King Live. \nINT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT \nTaping is underway.  Larry King sits at his desk opposite EDGAR VANCE (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic demeanor and movie star good looks.  CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE (50s, square-jawed), joins via remote feed. \nLARRY Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a biochemist, isn't that right? \nVANCE Yes.  I've long believed that in order to achieve true health, we have to reconcile the body and the mind.  Of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions, which is what my work is all about. \nLARRY Let's talk about that.  How do you account for the fascination with things that go bump in the night?  Movies, books, videogames -- seems like we can't get enough of our boogeymen? \nVance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras. \nVANCE Monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external.  In the case of vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism. These are scary subjects for people to own up to. \nLARRY So we pass the buck to someone else? \nVANCE Exactly.  Historically, people suffering from medical conditions have always been our psychological scapegoats.  In the Middle Ages schizophrenia was often attributed to demonic possession. \nLARRY And vampires? \nVANCE Well, there's a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits.  People suffering from this disease are anemic, they become sensitive to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic -- \nLARRY Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me that's good for the heart. (turning to Chief Vreede) Chief Vreede?  What's your take on all the recent rumors we've been hearing about vampires? \nVREEDE The only vampires I'm worried about are the ones passing the bar exam. (laughing) Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you think we'd be on to them by now?  The truth is, our streets have never been safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent crime is down across the board.  If people want to be concerned, they should focus on criminals like Blade. \nLARRY Now who's this?  Tell me about him. \nVREEDE He's a sociopath we've been pursuing. \nVANCE Blade is a very disturbed individual. Even the name he's chosen for himself is troubling.  According to witnesses, he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. You have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here.  What does a person like Blade really want? Odds are, he's really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's slaying monsters, but he's really trying to murder aspects of himself. \nThe sound of GUNFIRE pre-laps over from the next scene as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MACHINE SHOP/PARKING LOT - NIGHT \n-- a MASSIVE EXPLOSION ripping through an industrial building. Banks of windows BLOW OUTWARDS, FIRE ROlLS, brick walls CRUMBLE, raining debris everywhere. \nA SCREAMING, BURNING MAN \ngoes tumbling into the night air.  Buoyed by the explosion, his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet. \nMORE MEN (VAMPIRES) race out, some of them on fire. \nCLOSER \n", "test1_true": "He looks like the God of War.  WHOOSH!  We ramp back up to real-time.  Then faster as -- \n-- a TRIO OF VAMPIRE LOW-LIFES (STONE, GEDGE, and CAMPBELL) run for their lives towards their vehicles.  TWO MODIFIED STREET RACING CARS are pulling out; a Mustang and an Eagle Talon.  Gedge is climbing into the Talon even as it starts to move, pulling the door shut.  At the same time -- \n-- Stone and Campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered hardtail chopper cycles.  Blade starts forward, drawing two of his custom MACH pistols, but -- \n--\tthe Mustang comes SCREAMING IN REVERSE TOWARDS him! \nBlade makes a SUPER-HUMAN LEAP over the speeding car. Momentarily upside down, he FIRES through the windshield and engine block as he flips.  Within the car, the vampires ASH.

Then -- \nELLINGSON (O.S.) No more bullets, Blade?  Guess it's time for you to fall down and go boom. \nFOUR STRANDED VAMPIRES, \nfrom the conflagration, their clothes still smoking, surround Blade.  Call them EMOND, DOH, DENLINGER, and ELLINGSON. \nBlade holsters his MACH pistols.  Then reaches for a wicked looking CHAIN-KNIFE strapped to his thigh.  The knife has a button on either side of the hilt.  As Ellingson RUSHES him -- \n-- Blade triggers the first button.  ZZZING!  The knife-blade ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored chain.  The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest.  He GASPS as he starts to ASH.  But before his disintegration is complete -- \n-- Blade hits the second button.  The knife-blade retracts, the razored chain WHIRRING back into the knife-hilt.  Blade SPINS, triggers the first button again -- \nThe knife-blade FLIES OUT, the razored chain whipping around Denlinger's throat.  Blade tugs.  The razor chain cuts through Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. As he ASHES -- \n-- Blade triggers the knife again.  As it ejects, he whirls it over his head, making a sound like a BULL-ROARER. \nBlade drops low, swinging the razored chain.  The chain slices through Emond's legs.  Emond's amputated legs ASH, the rest of him tumbling onto the asphalt.  He SCREAMS. \nBlade retracts the knife-blade, whirls, THRUSTS it through Doh's abdomen. who was coming up from behind.  As Doh ASHES, Blade returns to Emond, finishing him off -- \n-- and Blade is on the move again, RUSHING after the vampires who escaped. \nEXT. STREET - OVERPASS - NIGHT \nThe bike-riding vamps cut across traffic, then SCREAM down an on-ramp to a busy street below. \nBACK TO BLADE, \nsprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk.  He touches a hand to his ear.  We SEE a tiny receiver tucked within. \nBLADE Whistler!  I'm on the Stonebridge overpass at Clemons -- \nWHISTLER'S VOICE Got it!  Heading eastbound, I'm just beneath you -- \nBlade dodges past a HONKING car, stepping onto and over the trunk, then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as -- \nA BIG-RIG CAB \nhauling a semi-trailer THUNDERS beneath the overpass, sounding its AIR HORN.  It has safety cables running along the perimeter of the trailer roof, like an aircraft carrier. \nWHISTLER'S VOICE -- GO!!! \nEXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT \nBlade LAUNCHES HIMSELF into the air.  He lands atop the semi, then tumbles, nearly slipping off the edge as he -- \n-- snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer!  He dangles above the asphalt then SWINGS himself into the open back of the trailer.  We HOLD for a beat, then hear the THUNDERCLAP of a high-performance ENGINE turning over as -- \nBLADE'S MATTE-BLACK DODGE CHARGER \nROCKETS out of the back of the trailer, sailing right over a car that was tail-gating the semi, heading into three lanes of on-coming traffic at fifty miles an hour! \nBlade hits the brakes, sending the battle-scarred muscle car into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process. \nINT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT \nAs cars continue to brake and COLLIDE around him, Blade puts the pedal to the metal once again.  The Charger accelerates, tachometer red-lining as Blade pulls alongside the cab of the big-rig, catching a glimpse of -- \nWHISTLER BEHIND THE WHEEL \nWhistler grins, gives Blade a little salute and -- \n", "test1_id": 2037, "test2_input": "Past the RECEPTION DESK are the elevators with more monitors showing the video greeting.

Since the dawn of creation our ancestors have asked ourselves that question. \nThey round the corner -- \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - SECOND HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \n-- nearly colliding with TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS.  Blade takes them both out.  There's another video monitor. \nVANCE The modern world today is filled with countless challenges.  In every direction we look, toxic stressors are impacting upon our happiness.  We think we're healthy, but the truth is, our immune systems are engaged in a life or death struggle to maintain our well being. \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nBlade, King, and Abigail storm in.  An EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT is moving to stop them. \nEXECUTIVE ASSISTANT I'm sorry but you can't -- \nAbigail KICKS out the man's knee, then slices her hand into his windpipe, silencing him. \nVANCE Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain how a series of remarkable new breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the quality of your life \nBlade aims his shotgun at the door leading to Vance's office. He FIRES at the keycard lock, KICKS down the door -- \nINT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY \n--\tstartling Dr. Vance himself, who is rising up from behind his desk.  Vance is wiping his mouth, not dressed like a doctor would normally be.  But we hardly notice this as -- \nVANCE What --? \nBLADE Payback, Vance. \n--\tBlade aims his shotgun at Vance's head.  Vance just smiles, seemingly unconcerned as -- \n--\tAbigail circles around the other side, getting a view behind Vance's desk where -- \nVANCE'S BODY \nlies on the floor.  His throat has been ripped out.  And this body is dressed like a doctor. \nKing puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath the Vance double's flesh -- \nKING Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake! \nThe Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS a glass window.  Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING him clear across the office as -- \n--\tKing advances.  The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones in his head shifting around.  He reaches for King, SLAMS him onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top. \nThen the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape. \nDRAKE \nBACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow. \nShe spins, falling -- \n-- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast. \nBLADE \ngives chase.  He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on the ground, some three stories below. \nEXT. VANCE INSTITUTE - REAR ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY \nDrake runs with inhuman speed.  He effortlessly scales a chain link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade, sailing over a trash dumpster.  Seconds later, Blade follows, catching sight of Drake rushing out into -- \nEXT. STREET MARKET - VARIOUS - DAY \n-- a crowded urban market.  What unfolds is a foot-chase at super-human velocity.  Vampire and hunter are moving at least twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians, SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - DAY \nDrake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST. \n", "test2_true": "BLADE FOLLOWS, jumping onto the hood of another car. More HORNS sound. \nIn this manner. Drake and Blade race across the flowing traffic itself. using the hoods and roofs of the cars like moving stepping stones. \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET \nDrake mounts the steps of an older apartment building, THUNDERS his way through the main entrance -- \nINT. OLDER BUILDING - STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - DAY \nBlade is on Drake like a shadow.  We're internal now, the sound of Blade's LABORED BREATH moving to the foreground of the soundscape. \nChaos.  A BARKING DOG darting from a doorway.  Up ahead, an OLD MAN has been knocked over.  An insane dash up two flights of stairs, then down a corridor, passing MORE TENANTS. Somewhere, a WOMAN SCREAMS.  We hear GLASS BREAKING and -- \nWOMAN My baby \n-- there's another open door -- \nINT. OLDER BUILDING - APARTMENT - DAY \n-- Blade tears into an apartment, passing a HYSTERICAL WOMAN, an upended crib.  He SEES a broken window by a fire escape -- \nEXT. OLDER BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - DAY \nCut onto the fire escape.  A glimpse of Drake overhead. \nBlade clambers up the fire escape, moving in a near-blur.  One story of steps up the rickety metal ladder -- \nSMASH!  A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking Blade.  He lets go with one hand, swings outward -- \n-- then he's climbing again.  A CLOUD OF PIGEONS take wing, flapping frenetically about him, momentarily blinding him. \nAnother story, a third, a fourth.  As he reaches the top, Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him -- \nEXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY \n-- FLIPPING himself over and onto the roof.  He lands in a cat stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area. \nDRAKE (O.S.) So you're the hunter they all fear. \nBlade spins -- \nDRAKE \nstands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his arms.  In the full glare of the afternoon sun. \nDRAKE (re: infant) Just so we understand each other, Daywalker. \nWith his free hand, he massages his jaw.  We hear a few more Pieces of POPPING CARTKAGE as the very last of Drake's cermanent features seem to settee into clace. \nBLADE Why did you kill Vance? \nDRAKE He'd outlived his purpose.  He'd become a liabi1ity. \nDrake nods at Blade's sword -- \nDRAKE Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before. Eight or nine centuries ago.  The hunter who carried it was an accomplished fighter. \nEXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY (THE PAST) \nDrake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century VAMPIRE HUNTER.  The hunter has BLADE'S SWORD.  Drake tears the sword from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back through the man's chest.  And as the man GASPS we are -- \nEXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY (THE PRESENT) \n-- back to here and now. \nDRAKE He was honorable, in his own way.  He died a good death. \nBLADE I wouldn't know about that. \nDRAKE You lie.  You're part of a grand tradition, Blade.  You hunters have plagued my people since the day we first walked the earth.  And I have vanquished them.  One by one. \nBlade pauses, looking for some kind of opening. \nBLADE How can you exist in the daylight? \nDRAKE I've always been able to.  Haven't you read Mr. Stoker's fable?  I was the first of the vampires.  I am unique. \nBLADE (realizing) That's why they brought you back. \n", "test2_id": 2038, "test3_input": "Hendrix moves to the door, checking a surveillance monitor. He can't see anyone outside.  He shrugs, turns to leave and -- \nCRUNCH!  The door is SMASHED inward, taking much of the door frame with it, flattening Hendrix. \nBlade and Abigail step inside.  As Blade hauls Hendrix up from the ground, Abigail points her already drawn gun at -- \nCHIEF VREEDE \nHe was reaching into his jacket for his own piece, now thinks better of it. \nBLADE Doing a little moonlighting, Chief? \nBlade nods to Abigail.  She reaches onto Vreede's jacket to disarm him.  Blade grips Hendrix by the shirt collar. \nBLADE C'mere.  We need to talk. \nBlade PUNCHES Hendrix in the face.  Hendrix sags for a moment, stunned. \nBLADE Now spill it, bite-boy. \nHENDRIX (wiping a bloody nose) You know what we're doing.  Drake has come back to us.  Soon we'll all be Daywalkers. And when that day comes, the world will truly be ours. \nBlade nods towards the back of the lab where another door -- a very secure one -- is located. \nBLADE What's back there? \nHendrix shoots a quick look to Vreede.  Then he turns on Blade, all fangs and claws, trying to tear Blade's eyes out -- \nAbigail FIRES her UV gun with blinding speed and -- \n-- Hendrix is dead before he knows it.  ASHING all over Blade. \nBlade brushes Hendrix' s remains from coat collar, shoots Abigail a look:  \"Did you really have to do that?\" \nBLADE (dryly) Thanks. \nAbigail cringes.  Mea culpa. \nBlade looks to the floor.  Aside from some cinders, all that remains of Hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard. Blade picks up the keycard, looks to Vreede. \nBLADE What's behind Door Number One? \nVREEDE They'll kill me -- \nBLADE (an evil grin) So will I.  But I'll enjoy it more. \nVreede nods.  They move towards the door.  Blade slides the security card.  An inset light changes from RED to GREEN. Vreede punches in a numeric code.  The doors slide open -- \nINT. BLOOD FARMING FACILITY - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT \nBlade, Abigail, and Vreede emerge into a cavernous room. \nABIGAIL God in Heaven -- \nHUNDREDS OF HUMAN CADAVERS \nhang from gantries, preserved in fluid-filled pods, suspended by wires like nightmarish marionettes.  The bodies are hooked up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and IVs which are designed to replenish vital nutrients. \nBLADE What was this place? \nVreede pauses before answering, looking uncomfortable. \nVREEDE It's a blood farming facility. (elaborating) They decided that hunting humans on a piece-meal basis was too inefficient. Why kill your prey when you can keep them alive?  Productive.  Under optimal conditions a donor can generate anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a year. \nABIGAIL (sickened) But where did you get all these people? \nVREEDE The streets.  In any given year you've got two to three million homeless people wandering around America -- (shrugging) No one cares about them.  We're doing the country a service, really. \nBlade shakes his head, admiring the horrible efficiency. \nBLADE The vampire Final Solution. \nAbigail moves towards one of the pods, touching her hand to the glass, studyihg the comatose person within. \nABIGAIL Are they aware?  Do they feel anything? \nVREEDE (shaking his head) They're in a chemical-induced coma. They're brain-dead, vegetables. \nBlade angrily SLAMS Vreede's face against one of the pods. \nBLADE Look at this!  Is this the future you want?  You think there's a place for you in their world? \n", "test3_true": "VREEDE We don't have a choice!  They're going to win, don't you see that?!  He's come back!

You've got thirty seconds. \nVreede turns and runs, stumbling towards the door.  Despite his promise, Blade lifts his MACH.  Without even looking in Vreede's direction, Blade FIRES.  We hear Vreede drop. \nBlade turns to Abigail.  She can hardly contain herself. Nearby is a control console.  Blade UNLOADS his MACH pistol into it, damaging the interlinked life support systems. \nOne by one, the vital signs and EKGs on the pods flat-line, their warning tones rising into a collective, PIERCING WAIL. \nBLADE (CONT'D) (feeling a heavy weight) Let's go. \nBlade and Abigail leave, turning the lights out as they go. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

enters. Stands at the dresser. Only his suitcase is there. She left her chartreuse blouse. He takes it and smells the scent of her cologne. He is torn with grief at the loss of her, curling into a ball on the bed, alone in the room. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - ALI - DAY 
getting made up by a good-looking ASIAN COSMETOLOGIST. An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR lounges against the wall with headset, reading the newspaper... 
COSMETOLOGIST You got the prettiest eyes... 
ALI Yeah? 
BUNDINI He so pretty, when you look up "pretty" in the dictionary, he too pretty to be there. 
She laughs and whispers something in Ali's ear, holding his hand where the others can't see it and slips her phone number to him. Meanwhile...a phone rings. Bundini answers while... 
A.D. (re: newspaper, to Ali) ...you gonna try for Germany? 
ALI Huh? 
A.D. You gonna try to get stationed in Germany? 
ALI What you talking about? 
BUNDINI Champ.   It's Eskridge... 
A.D. (Ali didn't know) They changed your classification. (turns page) It's in the paper...You're 1-A. You're gonna get drafted into the Army... 
ALI (takes phone) You know about this? 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (V.O.) Yes. But I think the government's looking to negotiate a deal... 
A.D. (hears on headset) Here we go...! 
INT. A NEW YORK TELEVISION STUDIO, ABC - COSELL - DAY 
"Wide World of Sports" is ON THE AIR.   We've entered mid- broadcast. 
ALI ...I flunk their draft board test. Now, without testing if I am "wiser" or "worser," they decide I can go into the Army. 
HOWARD COSELL Cassius, it is my opinion you... 
ALI (cuts in) And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a slave name. I'm a free man. I'm Muhammad Ali. 
HOWARD COSELL (stops, realizing) You know, I apologize to you. On the air. Your name is Muhammad Ali. You have the right to be called whatever you want. 
ALI (stays angry) You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school? 
HOWARD COSELL Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you. 
ALI I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth. 
HOWARD COSELL (fast) And without me...you'd be a mouth. 
Ali lifts Howard's toupee. HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D) (into camera) We'll be right back. 
Laughter. 
INT. ABC TELEVISION STUDIO, BACKSTAGE - ALI + COSELL - LATER 
Ali pours three spoons of sugar in his coffee. 
HOWARD COSELL (sarcastic) Have a little coffee with your sugar...? 
ALI Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart... 
HOWARD COSELL They want to make an example out of you. 
ALI Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown... 
HOWARD COSELL All they are is political. They tell people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're important. And they don't like your militancy, your politics. So, they'll make an example out of you. 
ALI ...of a good "Ne-gro," who do what he told? 
HOWARD COSELL Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is what happens to your ass if you don't... 
He's screwed either way. 
EXT./INT. THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES STATION, HOUSTON - LOBBY - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY 
waits at the curb as Ali and Herbert pull up and get out of a car...move through the crowd...reporters shouting questions at him we don't hear, go up the steps, into the lobby, joining other recruits and M.P.'s. 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (quietly) You do six weeks basic...you go into the Reserves...you don't go to Vietnam...you get to box...you even get to keep the money... 
He gives Ali a piece of paper signed by the Justice Department, confirming the deal... 
HERBERT (lets him know) The Messenger would not object if you joined under these terms. 
ALI I stay out of jail and I get to fight. HERBERT (nods) All you have to do is accept the induction. And life goes on. 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE They call your name. You say yes. 
We're not sure what Ali will do.

JOE I look forward to that. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK. DAY. 
Baseball diamond. Joe pitching underhand to "Queen E." He's using plastic balls the size of soccer balls, so it's easy for her to hit every one. "Erin" is running, retrieving the hits. FREEZE FRAME as she's caught in a photograph. The image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of frozen frames, photographs of her, some wide, some tight. 
REVERSE IMAGE. The park. Mostly empty. No one taking their picture. A stand of green bushes. HOLD on the bushes for a moment - 
EXT. PARK. AN HOUR LATER. 
"Queen E." is curled on a blanket taking a nap as "Erin" and Joe finish the picnic. 
JOE You seem like you're doing great. 
"ERIN" Yeah. 
JOE How long can you stand it? (off her look) I mean: not to talk to your friends or family or have anything to do with your real life? 
"ERIN" (quiet, strong) Gracie is safe. 
JOE Yeah, but what, now Mitch started some kind of custody battle?, what 
DOES - 
ROBBIE Are you Denise? SHOCK. There he is, standing right over them, in bad clothes and a baseball cap, dark glasses. Completely unrecognizable. 
"ERIN" Pardon me? 
ROBBIE You're Denise, right? Used to work at the Pack 'N' Ship? 
"ERIN" I'm not Denise. 
ROBBIE Oh. Sorry, I... You look-but you're right, your voice... (isn't) You're not from New Zealand, are you? 
"ERIN" Never been there. 
ROBBIE Boy. Sorry to bother you folks. He backs away, embarrassed. Joe stares after him warily... 
JOE What now? We call Pack 'N' Ship, see if Denise ever - (worked there) 
"ERIN" Because of some homeless guy? Joe: it could be the Pack'N'Ship in Trenton, New Jersey. (over his protest) One thing I learned: I can't jump every time someone says boo. I can't do that to her. 
Joe looks at "Queen E." and nods. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. NIGHT. 
Looks peaceful. But why do we need this establishing shot? Its very existence in the narrative is menacing. 
INT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. NIGHT. 
Joe gets up from "Queen E. 's" bed and goes into the kitchen. Gets some juice from the fridge, drinks it. Looks into "Erin's" bedroom. "Erin" is awake, "Queen E." asleep at her side. Half -whisper: 
JOE Gracie was right. (off her look) 'Bout the dreams in there. 
"ERIN" Yeah, mine too. 
(BEAT) Cuddle? 
INT. "ERIN'S" BEDROOM. NIGHT.

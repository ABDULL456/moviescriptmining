I'll give you -- \nSuddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light, being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic - with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure blurs and becomes indistinct.

We are rushing at it, circling it, diving closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures, angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern.

Crom marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other. When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear. We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers.

The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads straight for Flynn. \nFlynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches himself in time to keep from falling over the edge. \n190  FLYNN'S POV - DOWN                                           190 \ndown, down between the rings into an infinite pit. \n191  BACK TO FLYNN                                                191 \nstaring down.

They look at each other. \nRAM (into mike) What do you think? \nTRON (into mike) Do it! \n248  LONG SHOT                                                    248 \nWe see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up: \nVOICE (through loudspeaker) WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID. REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING. \nWe continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies out altogether. \n249  SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS                                      249 \nmoving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it. \n250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250 \n", "test3_true": "251  SARK                                                         251 \nHe is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out of his way. \nSARK Get them. Send out every Game Tank in the Grid! Get them! \n252  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        252 \nas he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about to come down for the kill. \nFLYNN (into mike) Watch it! \nRAM (into mike) Recognizers! \n252A SHOT OF RAM                                                  252 \nheading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled \"Game Storage.\" \n253  SHOT FROM BEHIND                                             253 \nas the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked, way too big to fit through the opening. \n254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254 \nFROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes, and follow. \n255  EXT. MAZE                                                    255 \nOutside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the face of the cliff. They stop for a moment. \n255A ANGLE ON FLYNN                                               255A \n256  CLOSE UP - TRON'S FACE                                       256 \nlistening. \nTRON (into mike) Game Tanks! Come on \n257  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              257 \nas the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing from view. \n258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258 \nWe see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax. \nFLYNN Oh man...when you're on the other side of the screen...it all looks so easy... \nRam and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and grinning, until all three are LAUGHING. \n259  DESERT LABYRINTH                                             259 \nas the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft carrier hovering overhead. \n260  BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                               260 \nSark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape. \nSARK (to one of the bridge personnel) Get the pursuit force back into 404A. There's no place else they could be... \nSark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark, where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible, moving through it. He turns to Sark. \nLIEUTENANT (confidently) We'll have them in no time, sir. Long before the interrupt interface. \nSARK (whirls on him) We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone. I want those programs! \n261  INT. CAVE                                                    261 \nRam, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible. \nFLYNN (looking out) It's all circuits... (points at tower) Must be an input/output component... \nRAM The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from? \nFLYNN (sitting down against a rock) Well...my home \"sector\" was called Paramus ... \nRAM (sits also) PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ... (starts counting them off on his fingers) ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place. \nFLYNN (shrugs) It grows on you. \nHe notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is gazing upwards. \nTRON (murmuring) I can feel it ... \nFlynn and Ram turn. \nFLYNN Feel what? You okay? \nRAM Alan-One... \nTRON Yes... he's got something to tell me... \nRam and Tron look out at the distant tall tower. \n", "test3_id": 1580}

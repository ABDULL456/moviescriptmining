{"train": "T R O N \nDigitized by Guy G. Gordon Special thanks to Bryan Duarte for the physical copy of the script \nT R O N \nBased on the screenplay by \nSteven Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird \nProd. 0222 \nFourth Draft Screenplay by Charlie Haas April 6, 1981 BLACKNESS \n1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1 \nOn one side of the screen, computer programming language is being printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice speaking. \nVOICE As astonishing advances in computer science are made, artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life... \nWe see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular, wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate. \nVOICE (CONT.) In a world-wide network of electronics, they travel through miles of circuitry at the speed of light. We created them to calculate and research, to help us design and heal and think. With all that they can do, are they only electrical impulses... or are they a new form of life? \nThe figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it. As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light, a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of the screen in huge letters. \nT R O N ! ! \nThe MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as if it had an inner core of electricity. \nThe following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD. \nThe Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the electronic information in our computers, television sets and telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs, data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through the window of television screens. \nCUT TO: \n2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2 \nTWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely encasing them. \nCUT TO: \n3    LONG SHOT                                                    3 \nas the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the other. \nCUT TO: \n4    REAL WORLD                                                   4 \nScreen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles, as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear. \n5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5 \nWe see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light, their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR electronic beeping and popping. \n6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6 \nFuturistic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound like a crack of lightning. \n7    REAL WORLD                                                   7 \nA video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D maze. \n8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9 \n10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10 \nTwo other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines. \n11   REAL WORLD                                                   11 \nA video game called \"BERSERK,\" in which a human character' throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring down, LAUGHING. \n12   OMITTED                                                      12 \n13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13 \nAnother game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy at each other. \n14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14 \nHe is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing yellow. \n15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15 \nfearful, nervous, poised on one ring. \n16   SARK                                                         16 \nsneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet back with violent force. \n16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A \nCROM Sure, if I don't have a User, then who wrote me? \nRAM That's what you're doing here. Master Control Program's been snapping up all us programs who believe...if he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger... an' if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the Game Grid to get the bits blasted outta you. What's your name? \nCROM Crom. \nRAM \nI'm Ram. They'll train you for the games, but ... well, I hope you make it okay. Hey, what's going on in the other sectors? I've been stuck in this Grid for 200 microcycles. \nHe points to several hash marks on his cell wall. \nCROM It's murder out there. You can't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that Master Control creep. Hauling me down here to play games...who does he calculate he is? \n(holds his head in his hands) If only Tron was still around... \nHe looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange, still expression on his face. \nCROM You ever see that guy in action? Hundred-percent independent. MCP couldn't tell him what to -- \nHe stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder. \nCROM (continuing) What's wrong? What did I say? \nThere's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's. \nCUT TO: \n24   THE FIGURE AT THE WINDOW                                     24 \nIt turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor. \n25   CLOSE UP - CROM                                              25 \nreacting.  He GASPS and stares. \nCROM Oh my User...Tron--they've got you in here? \n26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26 \nwith Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring. \nTRON Not for long, friend. \nCUT TO: \n27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27 OFF IN THE SYSTEM \nHere in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along one of the paths. \n28   INT. TANK                                                    28 \nA lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck driver on an all-night run. \nCLU Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay, good buddy? \nA spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as it speaks. \nBIT (eagerly) \nAs soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light. \nCLU Now, ol' Flynn said to look over in here ... \n28A  EXT. TANK                                                    28A \nThe tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded corners -- a computer memory microcircuit. \n28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B \nCLU ...but I don't see what he's looking for. I'd better get over to that input/output tower and let him know. \n28C  ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER                                      28C \nat the instrument panel. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n29   REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT                    29 \nA shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of large video parlor game consoles. \nFLYNN Come on, you scuzzy little data, be in there... \n30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30 \nHe's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive, charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye. \nFLYNN I've got such nice blue paper to print you out on, if you'll just sit still... \nWE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of the CRT screen reflected there. \nCUT TO: \nof two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white- suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry- picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look at them. \nWe see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman, with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their bristling white eyebrows. \nIn contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist. Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks at the moment. \nAs the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor: \nLORA (sighs) Well, here goes nothing ... \nGIBBS Hah. Interesting, interesting. You hear what you said? \"Here goes nothing.\" \nLORA Well, I meant - \nGIBBS Whereas actually, what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again. So you might just as well have said, \"Here goes something and here comes nothing.\" Hah? \nThey step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The \"firing\" end of the giant laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical plat-form -- empty. \nLORA Let me make sure we're running \nShe crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables. \nPulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but close enough to watch. \n74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74 \nShe types a series of commands on the computer keyboard. \nLORA Looks good... \nGIBBS (O.S.) \nLet 'er rip... \n75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75 \nThe laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly, the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed, five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic. \nGIBBS (quietly) Perfect. \nAt the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper shoe-covers, walking toward them. \nALAN Beautiful! \nGIBBS Hello, Alan. \nALAN Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun. \nHe gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss. \nGIBBS Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and... (indicates ball) voila. \n75   CONTINUED                                                    75 \nALAN Great. Can it send me to Hawaii? \nGIBBS Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah! \nThe three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with their arms around each other's shoulders. \nLORA How's it going upstairs? \nALAN Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system. \nGibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything. \nALAN (continuing) Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store. \nGIBBS Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think... \nALAN They'll start to soon enough. \nGIBBS (wryly) Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow. \nAD LIB goodnights. \n78   INT. CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT                                   78 \noutside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes. \nLORA Did you say Group 7 access? \nALAN Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set \nLORA Did he say why? \nALAN (shrugs) Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested? \nLORA Flynn had Group 7 access. \nALAN Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him. \nLORA Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it. \nHe grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora approaching him, with Alan in tow. \nFLYNN (continuinq) Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple. \nLORA We have to talk. \nFLYNN Good luck. You can't even think in here. \nHe leads them toward the back of the arcade. \nFLYNN (CONT.) Come on. \n93-96 OMIT                                                         93-96 \n97   INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT                                       97 \nA dark, panelled room, with a few comfortable chairs, a business desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans against a game, nervous; Lora paces. \nFLYNN (stretching his arms, relaxing) So...how's the world of serious science? \nLORA Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system? \nFLYNN Whew. You never were much for small talk. (to Alan) She still leave her clothes all over the floor? \nAlan looks profoundly uncomfortable. \nLORA Flynn! \nALAN Uh, no ... I mean, not that often - \nFlynn laughs. \nLORA (to Alan, indicating arcade) You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old. \nFLYNN Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know... \nALAN You did break in. \nFLYNN Tried to. (nods toward terminal) Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ... \nALAN Are you embezzling? \nFLYNN (Sydney Greenstreet) \"Embezzling\" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... (normal voice) No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together. \nALAN I don't get it. \nFLYNN (to Lora) You haven't told him? \nShe shakes her head. \nFLYNN (CONT.) (sighs) Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn (points to himself) is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... (waves at one of the games in the room) ...Space Paranoids. \nALAN You invented Space Paranoids? \nFLYNN Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close (gestures) to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has \"invented\" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.? \nALAN Senior exec. \nFLYNN Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime. \nALAN I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system. \nFLYNN Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it. \nFLYNN (CONT.) My password ... Dillinger's instruction to divert the data ... \nLORA I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to. \nFLYNN Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight. \nALAN Dillinger? \nFLYNN Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high.. \nLORA Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does.. \nFLYNN Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it... \nALAN Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there... \nFLYNN Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access... \nThey all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys to her van aloft. \nLORA Shall we dance? \nCUT TO: \n98-100 OMIT                                                         98-100 \n101  DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   101 \nDillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing, faces him. \n112  INT. HALLWAY AT ELEVATOR - POV OF MCP                        112 \nfrom the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera. His head pulls back in. \n113  SHOT OF HALLWAY                                              113 \nAs the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching. \n114  INT. DOORWAY TO LASER LAB - POV OF MCP                       114 \nfrom the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK, \n115  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   115 \nAlan comes into his office and sits at his terminal. \n116-118 OMIT                                                         116-118 \n119  INT. LASER LAB - NIGHT                                       119 \nLora watches as Flynn sits down at her terminal. \nLORA This laser's my life's work. Don't spill anything. \nFlynn LAUGHS as Lora goes out. \n120  CLOSE SHOT OF FLYNN                                          120 \nsettling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a safecracker. He types in a code number, presses the \"enter\" key. \n121  VIEW OF THE CEILING                                          121 \nWe see a camera emerging from a sliding panel. \n122  POV OF MCP                                                   122 \nfrom this camera. We watch as Flynn starts typing. \nSCREEN Access code 6. Password Series PS 17. Reindeer, Flotilla -- \n123  FLYNN'S CRT SCREEN                                           123 \nIt clears abruptly, and the following appears as we hear the VOICE of the MCP. \nMCP You shouldn't have come back, Flynn. \nFLYNN Hey hey, it's that big Master Control Program everybody's talking about... You don't look a thing like your pictures... Tell me, have you really been thinking about world domination like they say? (types.) CODE SERIES LSU-123 ... activate. CODE SERIES ESS-999 ... activate. CODE SERIES HHH-888 ... activate. \nMCP That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn. I'm afraid you... \nThe voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal. \nMCP (continuing; slightly shaken) Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this. \n124  SHOT OF LASER EQUIPMENT                                      124 \nactivating, lighting up. \n125  SHOT OF FLYNN AT-TERMINAL                                    125 \nWe see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice. \nWe can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it is this section that is being activated. \nCUT TO: \n126  FLYNN typing.                                                126 \nCUT TO: \n127  SCREEN                                                       127 \nSCREEN MCP: Terminate control mode.

C'mon, big boy, let's see what... \nMCP You're entering a big error, Flynn... I'm going to have to put you on the Game Grid. \nFLYNN Games, huh? I'll give you -- \nSuddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light, being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic - with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and \nDISSOLVE TO: \n129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129 we saw at the opening of the film'. \nThe pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo, covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures, angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with an internal energy. \nThe same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence. Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands. \n138  HIS POV                                                      138 \nFlynn's hands are glowing, electrified. \n139  CLOSE SHOT                                                   139 \nof his face. His head comes up and we see an expression of terrible understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening of the neighboring cell. \n140  INT.

What's his User s'posed to do -- ? \nRAM (sighs) The Users...you really think they're still there? \nTRON They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me. \n141  FLYNN'S CELL                                                 141 \nHe can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back, so he goes to the window and tries to reach through. \nFLYNN Hey! Who are you guys? What's the story around here? \nBut as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells, it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock. \n142  RAM                                                          142 \nturning towards Flynn as he hears this noise. \nRAM You want to watch those force fields... \nHe goes to the window opening. \nRAM (CONT.) You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that. \nFLYNN Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I? \nRAM You're a...\"guest\" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games. \nFLYNN (relieved) Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody. \nRam gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything, there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell opens. \n143  THE CORRIDOR                                                 143 \nwe see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the opposite direction. \nCUT TO: \n144  TRAINING ARENA                                               144 \nA large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of them. Flynn is in the front of the line. \nHEAD GUARD Look operative, you guys. Command Program Sark will explain the training procedures. \nSark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is amplified over the grid. \nSARK (reciting a routine statement) Greetings.

The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of the next ring to keep from falling. \n200-201 OMIT                                                         200-201 \n202  FLYNN                                                        202 \nHe is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring. \n203  SARK                                                         203 \nHis face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry \n204  FLYNN                                                        204 \nHe puts down his cesta.

Each of the men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back into shape and race up the ramp, and on out. \n263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265 \n266  EXT.

They turn another corner and come to the edge of a gaping ravine. \nSeveral hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom. \nTRON'S VOICE The bridge! Come on! \nThe tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons, lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank turning the corner. \nCUT TO: \n269  POV OF TANK GUNSIGHT                                         269 \nas the turret swings around and focuses on the bridge. \n270  SHOT OF THE BRIDGE                                           270 \nTron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears, and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around. \nHe looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble. \nThe tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again, speeds off down the ramp, and is gone. \nCUT TO: 271-272 OMIT                                                         271-272 \n273  FLYNN AND RAM                                                273 \nRam is badly injured, unconscious.

But wait a micro... \nShe lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around; the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops. \n315  HIS POV                                                      315 \nWith her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand. \nYORI Come here. \n316  TRON                                                         316 \nHis face tells the story.

All the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and are enveloped in the cloud of stars... \nSLOW, SLOW DISSOLVE TO: \n318  EXT.

We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated. There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing his balance. \n435  YORI                                                         435 \nsmiling. \nYORI We're off! \n436  EXT.

In front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and the Solar Sailer -- racing away. \nMCP I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays \"Happy Birthday\" to its User once a year. \nSARK Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us -- \nMCP Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation. \nSARK We'll get them, sir...

Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam rises out of the center of this cylinder. \n550  EXT.

While this is our impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering: \nDILLINGER (O.S.) Hello? A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.) Mr. Dillinger? DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.) Yes. A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.) Hello, please hold a moment for the Master Control Program \nAs we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and a passenger. \n47   EXT.

DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58 \nA huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see printed out on the screen: \nREQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger. Password: MASTER. \nThe computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as that of the \"bad cop\" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient. \nMCP Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early. \nDillinger settles into a chair. \nDILLINGER No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs) What's up? \nMCP It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again. \nDILLINGER Flynn? \nMCP Yes.  It felt like Flynn. \nDILLINGER He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it? \nMCP I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile... \nDILLINGER Meanwhile, he might find it. \nMCP I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time. \nDILLINGER I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file.

I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me. \nDILLINGER oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you? \nALAN Yeah...? \nDILLINGER We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering. \nALAN I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that. \nDILLINGER No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on? \nALAN It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it. \nDILLINGER Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program? \nALAN No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well. \nDILLINGER Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope. \nALAN Ok \nAlan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves: \nDILLINGER (trouble) Oh boy. \nThe Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and through the speakers. \nMCP Ed, I am so very disappointed in you. \nDILLINGER I'm sorry - \nMCP (sharply) I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated? \nDILLINGER (nods) It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much... \nMCP And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week... \nDILLINGER The Pentagon? \nMCP It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans. \nDILLINGER Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you. \nMCP I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then. \nDILLINGER What do you want with the Pentagon? \nMCP The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human. \nDILLINGER If you think - \nMCP You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you? \nDILLINGER You wouldn't dare. \nMCP So do as I tell you.

SIMULATION HANGER COMPLEX                               303 \nThis is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces. We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along. Tron looks farther down the corridor. \nCUT TO: \n304  HIS POV                                                      304 \nWe see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards Tron. \nCUT TO: \n305  TRON                                                         305 \nas he moves back against the wall, into a niche. \nAs the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him. The line of workers mechanically files on past. \nWe watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly, half-heartedly. \nTRON I'm not gonna hurt you. \nShe stops struggling. \nTRON (CONT.) I'm going to let you go now... don't scream, or I'll be very sorry. \nHis hands loosen, and he releases her. \nCUT TO: \n306  SHOT FROM IN FRONT                                           306 \nWe see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face, still beautiful in its pallor. \nTRON Put your hand behind your back. \nSlowly she obeys. \n307  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              307 \nA slow smile appears on his face. \n308  SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                            308 \nHe extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's. \nGIRL TRON!! \nShe throws her arms around him. \nTRON (smiling, hugging her tightly) Yori... hey... \nYORI Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you... \nShe-looks around nervously. \nYORI (pulling him by his hand) This way. Come on. \nThey walk quickly toward a flight of stairs. \nCUT TO: \n309  THE STREETS                                                  309 \nTron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings, and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they hear snatches of conversation. \nPROGRAM ...artillery for Video Game Sector... \nPROGRAM 2 ...all mathematical functions transferred to... \nYORI I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time... \nTRON That's all going to change, Yori... \nYORI How? \nTRON Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to \nSuddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air. \nCUT TO: \n310  EXT.

She turns to Flynn, goes up to him. \nYORI Flynn... you can't... I \nFLYNN (lays finger on her lips) Shhhhh. \nHe takes her in his arms. \nFLYNN (CONT.) (whispering) I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if... just once... \nHis head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow, change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed. \n614  CLOSE UP - THEIR FACES                                       614 \nFinally Flynn pulls away from her.

We see Yori shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out. \n616  HER POV                                                      616 \nFlynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion directly into the center of MCP itself. \n617  INT. MCP                                                     617 \nSark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but his voice is that of the MCP. \nSARK/MCP End of line, program... \nWe can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle. Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once, and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy cones. And connects. \n618  SHOT OF THE APEX                                             618 \nA brilliant explosion of lights bursts out. \n619  SHOT OF SARK                                                 619 \nDead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely. \n620  SHOT OF THE MCP                                              620 \nWe see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of the MCP glows brighter and brighter. \n621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621 \non the bridge of the carrier looking down at this. \n622  HER POV                                                      622 \nA fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the camera. \n623  YORI                                                         623 \nshielding her face from the power of the blast. \n624  LONG SHOT                                                    624 \nThe nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates, leaving the sky full of sparkling stars. \n625  YORI                                                         625 \nstill shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains regaining their life. \n", "test3_true": "one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows brightly, increasing. \n627  LONG SHOT                                                    627 \nThe carrier starts to descend. \nCUT TO: \n628  EXT.

But she reaches up and presses her lips to his in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back. \nTRON (laughing) Nice... \nYORI It's something Users do. \nTRON Where's Flynn? \nHe looks up at the bridge. \nYORI He's gone. He went into the beam. He saved you. He saved all of us. \nTron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up. \nDUMONT He really was a User... \nBIT (quietly, sadly) Yes... \n631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631 \nof the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632 \nand returning to the real world. \n633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633 \nCLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism. \nWIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized. \nSlowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact -- back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world. \nHe studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent flesh and blood. \nHe looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with weak sunlight coming in. \nAnd, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is coughing out a long document on wide blue paper. \nFlynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his face. \nThe printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant, tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it. \nCUT TO: \n634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634 \nBleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout. \nFLYNN Hey -- you guys \nBefore he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve. \nALAN Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running. \nFLYNN I know, I met him. \nAlan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself. \nFLYNN (CONT.) I mean, I saw it read-up - hey, look at this. \nHe shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of reading it to figure out its significance. \nALAN Your old files -- ? \nFLYNN And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on. \nALAN Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods... \nFlynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him. \nFLYNN You're telling me... \n", "test3_id": 1580}

Later. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake. 
HANNA You never tell me what you've been studying. 
MICHAEL Studying? 
HANNA At school. Do you learn languages? 
MICHAEL Yes. 
HANNA What languages? 
MICHAEL Latin. 
HANNA Say something in Latin. 
MICHAEL Oh... 
MICHAEL thinks a moment. 
MICHAEL Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur dexteris aptantur enses conditi? 
MICHAEL smiles slightly. 
MICHAEL It's Horace. 
HANNA It's wonderful. 
MICHAEL Do you want some Greek? 
MICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light. 
MICHAEL Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon oi da naon phais epi gan malainan emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto tis eratai. 
HANNA It's beautiful. 
MICHAEL How can you tell? How do you know when you've no idea what it means? 
HANNA looks at him a moment. 
HANNA What about in German? 
MICHAEL In German? 
HANNA Do you have anything? 
MICHAEL Well, I'm writing an essay. It's about a play. By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps you've heard of him? 
HANNA makes no reaction. 
MICHAEL The play's called Emilia Galotti. 
HANNA Have you got it? 
MICHAEL reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book. 
MICHAEL Here. You can read it. 
HANNA I'd rather listen to you.

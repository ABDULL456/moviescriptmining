LLOYD Winners control their own destiny, Har. 
Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one to him. 
HARRY You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. (beat) The alarm alone cost me two hundred. 
LLOYD Big deal. That car's an old bomb anyway. 
HARRY What are you talking about? It's only six years old. 
LLOYD That's forty-two in dog years. 
They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry notices the briefcase. 
HARRY What's with the briefcase? 
LLOYD It's a love memento. 
HARRY Huh? 
LLOYD The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of story. 
HARRY What's in it? 
LLOYD DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property? 
HARRY Why not? 
LLOYD (beat) It's locked. 
They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK. The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to the 
PEEPHOLE. 
HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental are standing at the door. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) (WHISPERING to Harry) Friend or foe? 
HARRY (WHISPERING) We don't have any friends. 
Harry is still squinting out the peephole. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Can't recognize them. Could be student loan thugs again, or the IRS, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on. 
LLOYD Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline. 
HARRY Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing plaid. 
LLOYD (cringing) That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment. 
Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the window and down the fire escape. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON 
The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out. Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE 
HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY. 
INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON 
STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs. 
GRABNER Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that neither I nor the unemployment epartment of the state of Rhose Island can do anything for you. (beat) You've run out of chances. You're unemployable. Remember last year? Middle of winter I busted my butt to 
GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE- 
fifty an hour, and you went and blew it! 
LLOYD Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months. 
HARRY Yeah, and that was because of a blizzard 
GRABNER (exploding) YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS! 
Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted. 
HARRY Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline? 
Grabner jumps up. 
GRABNER OUT!!!!!

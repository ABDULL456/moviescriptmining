{"train": "THE BIG BLUE \nTHE BIG BLUE \nby \nLuc Besson \nBob Garland \nMarylin Golden \n\"God is at the bottom of the sea and I dive to find him.\" \nEnzo Maiorca \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET \nCREDIT SEQUENCE: \nThe image is in black and white. \nThe sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea. \nA little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe -- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility. \nIn one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and sweater. \nThe only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit -- obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as he leaps again... and pulls them up... \nThe little boy is JACQUES MAYOL. \nEnd credits. \nEXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET \nJACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove. \nHe spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives. \nHe surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and swims away from shore. \nIN OPEN SEA \nThe boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if we've never seen this before. \nHis gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water. 40 feet deep.  And intensely blue. \nSuddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the blue. \nUNDERWATER \nJACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head. \nThe boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel delicately -- and slithers back into his hole. \nGravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag. \nEXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK \nJACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost dry now. \nTwo boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch up with him and gesture toward the port. \nTHE BOYS Jacques!  Come quick! \nEXT.  PIER - DUSK \nThe little boys tug JACQUES to the end of the pier and point to something in the water. \nBOYS Look!  Right there!  It's shining! \nJACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water. \nJACQUES (squinting) A coin. \nFIRST BOY I found it. \nSECOND BOY Liar! \nCamera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading supplies into a small boat.  He stops to watch the children's negotiations.  Little JACQUES is putting his flippers on. \nJACQUES Ok.  I'll get it, but no fighting, all right? \nThe two boys nod as they point to the coin. \nJACQUES We'll split it. \nFIRST BOY You can't split a coin.  That's stupid. \nPRIEST Jacques... Come, look. \nJACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater. \nPRIEST Is it a coin shining down there? \nJACQUES (overjoyed) It is.  It's a coin!  I'll get it for you, Father! \nPRIEST It'll be for the poor. \nJACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask.  He swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it to the surface. \nHe breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there. \nJACQUES Padre? \nHe looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- \"Boy on a Dolphin\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \nON JACQUES - UNDERWATER \nHe's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel. He senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It seems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that JACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface... \nON JACQUES - IN BED \nHe bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream. \nINT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK \nA BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows and throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours in.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house, and runs his hand through his hair. \nFATHER (with a smile) ... Come on, time to get up, Jacques! \nJACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He gives the pile a kick. \nFATHER (screaming at the top of his lungs) Louis, wake up! \nHe uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS, who is having a very hard time, waking up. \nEXT.  HOUSE - DAY \nJACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear under his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth. \nHe catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on a path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down abruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue. \nEXT.  SEA - DAY \nTheir boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES off the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim the waves of its wake. \nEXT.  BOAT - DAY \nOn board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump. JACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's suit. \nAt the foot of an old monastery another boat passes. The Priest is in it. \nJACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES takes the gold coin out of his pocket. \nThe pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin back in his pocket. \nEXT.  BOAT - DAY \nLOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock, the kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns around to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him. ENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing session. \nFATHER Jacques, come help me. \nJACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He seems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He has a weird feeling. \nJACQUES You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa. \nUNCLE LOUIS Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques. \nHis father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck. \nFATHER (winks at him) Don't worry.  When I'm tired down there, the mermaids help me out. \nFather and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts the helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump. \nThe heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of sight. \nJACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions to maintain the flow of air. \nUNCLE LOUIS (to Jacques) Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid? \nJACQUES No. \nThey keep on pumping for a while, then... \nUNCLE LOUIS I've seen them. \nUNCLE LOUIS goes on.  JACQUES doesn't budge. \nENZO (calmly undressing, expressionless) How did it happen? \nSUPERVISOR (upset) The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help? \nENZO How many are, down there? \nENZO goes back to the car. \nSUPERVISOR Just one... We're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly... You've got to get him out fast. \nENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site. \nENZO (a beat) Ten thousand. \nSUPERVISOR Lira? \nENZO Dollars. \nSUPERVISOR You're going to hold me up at a time like this? \nROBERTO You do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world? \nSUPERVISOR Yes, but ten thousand dollars... \nENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack. He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the American, straight in the eyes. \nENZO Okay.  You tell me.  How much would you say the man's life is worth? \nExtremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer. \nENZO In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction. \nSUPERVISOR (baffled) What does that mean? \nROBERTO That you should get your checkbook. Damn quick. \nEXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO \nHe's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below. \nENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow. He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense. \nBehind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. \nENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay. \nUNDERWATER - WRECK \nENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris. \nHe pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were changing a tire, begins to pump the handle... \nSlowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris rises off the diver's leg. \nEXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY \nEveryone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully. The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder. \nROBERTO Since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check? \nUNDERWATER - WRECK \nENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso. Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls him free. \nThe diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as possible toward the surface. \nEXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY \nThe diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits, breathless. \nROBERTO (to the Supervisor) Sign here. \nSuddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the back. \nENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO. Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car. \nROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO bends down into the car and opens the roof. \nSUPERVISOR (through the open roof smiling) Thanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that too... You extortionist bastard! \nThe car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police (carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site. \nINSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY \nENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy. \nENZO Dollars, Roberto!  We took him for ten thousand dollars! \nROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea. \nEXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY \nFRANK A drink to warm up? \nJOHANA Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible. \nFRANK (pulling out a flask) Tea... or whiskey? \nJOHANA ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles? \nFRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup. \nFRANK ... right. (calling out) Dr. Lawrence?  The insurance man... uh... The insurance person is here! \nLAWRENCE It's about time! \nFRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.  She warms her hands on the cup.  She asks blankly. \nJOHANA Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing? \nFRANK Who? \nJOHANA The guy in the Halloween suit! \nLAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room. \nHe walks straight over to the bay window. \nLAWRENCE Did you have a nice trip?  We were getting restless, it's been three weeks since the accident. \nJOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at something in the distance. \nEXT.  DOCK - ON JACQUES \nAt the end of the dock, JACQUES who is sitting on the edge of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of gloves on.  He then grabs the handles of a strange machine which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely elsewhere. \nBACK IN LAB \nJOHANA watches JACQUES.  She just can't believe her eyes. LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with different switches. \nLAWRENCE (to Johana) You should get things moving, you know.  We're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments...! Frank, check the program! \nJOHANA is finally able to speak. \nJOHANA Who... Who is that? \nLAWRENCE Mayol... Jacques Mayol. \nJOHANA That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake? \nLAWRENCE turns one last knob. \nLAWRENCE ... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment. \nJOHANA I'll have to talk to the driver. \nLAWRENCE In the spring when he melts! \nJOHANA walks closer to the window.  She isn't hearing a thing he's saying. \nJACQUES is putting on his flippers. \nJOHANA can't believe it. \nJACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice.  He is holding onto the machine in the water.  He is waving a mask. \nJOHANA (dumbfounded) You really send him under the ice? He isn't a slave or a convict or anything? \nLAWRENCE My dear, science is a cruel mistress. \nJOHANA But... how is he going to breathe? \nLAWRENCE He isn't going to breathe. \nJACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight yanks him straight down into the water.  LAWRENCE sets his stop watch off and flips a few switches. \nJOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about it. \nLAWRENCE Listen... \nHe raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through a small speaker. \nLAWRENCE That's his heartbeat. (excited) Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible. \nLAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to JOHANA. \nJOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't figure it out. \nUNDERWATER - JACQUES \nJACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles. He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is hinged open.  He closes it around himself.  His heart is still slowing down.  He pushes a button on the machine, and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him. \nBACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN \nJACQUES You think I'd forget you? \nHe laughs.  The driver, who seems to be quite familiar with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda machine.  Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the scene, very intrigued. \nJACQUES has not noticed him. \nHe starts unwrapping the first package. \nJACQUES For Bathsheba. \nHe produces a little ceramic Llama. \nON BATHSHEBA \nlooking at the llama, bewildered.  As bewildered as a dolphin can be.  JACQUES turns the llama upside down.  It moos:  HIAK, HIAK... \nJACQUES It's a Llama.  You understand?  From Peru.  It's fighting. \nBATHSHEBA shakes her head.  JACQUES throws the llama into the water.  He unwraps the second package.  A pair of Peruvian gloves and hat.  Wide eyed, the driver sits in the stands to watch the show. \nJACQUES That's for you, Darjeeling.  We wouldn't want you to catch cold! \nHe throws them to DARJEELING who catches them. \nJACQUES And now... (singing out) \"Ta, da...\" For you Tina. \nHe pulls out a thermos. \nJACQUES Something you've never seen either. \nHe opens the thermos. \nJACQUES Snow! \nHe sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head.  She tries to taste it. \nJACQUES (smiling like a child) A new experience, Tina. (nostalgic) I missed you little rascals.  Did you get my post card? \nThe three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge splash which soaks JACQUES.  He takes his shirt off. \nJACQUES (pretending to be serious) Oh?  Is that what you want? Alright, but five minutes, no more. I have a taxi waiting. \nHe takes off his pants.  The taxi driver gets up, as if to keep him from going in.  JACQUES dives into the pool. \nUNDERWATER - ON JACQUES \nHe swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of the dolphin's snout. \nThe dolphin pulls JACQUES around and around the basin while JACQUES pets his chest and belly.  We have never seen JACQUES so relaxed and happy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  MANHATTAN - DAWN \nOverview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning.  JOHANA depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow cab.  She watches the muddy brown water flow under the Brooklyn Bridge. \nThe driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars around him. \nEXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY \nA suitcase in each hand, JOHANA gets out of the cab and walks up the stairs of her apartment. \nINT.  HALLWAY - DAY \nJOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.  Catches her breath and gets out her keys.  She tries one in the top lock.  It doesn't work.  She tries harder.  There's a woman's voice yelling angrily from inside the apartment. \nSALLY (O.S.) I changed the lock you son of a bitch! \nJOHANA ... Sally? \nThe door opens. \nSALLY You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled. \nJOHANA Again? \nSALLY They got the new T.V. \nJOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment. \nSALLY ... And the new stereo. \nJOHANA I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time? \nSALLY Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay? \nJOHANA You called the police? \nSALLY They're going to send detectives. When they get around to it. \nJOHANA (shrugging) So what, all they ever want is your phone number anyway. \nENZO Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me. \nJACQUES (shaking his head) I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him? \nENZO No.  All you need is to want to be the best. \nJACQUES (smiles) You're the best, Enzo! \nENZO (with a tense grin on his face) That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  \"D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete.\" So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. (he pushes the airplane ticket to Jacques) ... I'll see you there... \nEXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - NEW YORK - DAY \nINT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - JOHANA \nShe is seated across the desk from him.  He's reading through her report.  Behind him, outside the large plate glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold suspended far above the city.  They eat lunch. \nJOHANA'S eyes wander (bored) around the office as DUFFY reads.  He looks up. \nDUFFY (indicating report) This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. (he glances at the window) Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street. \nJOHANA (absently) What kind? \nDUFFY Johana, am I boring you? \nJOHANA Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say? \nDUFFY I said that the file is incomplete. See if you can get through to this Lawrence character and have him send the Peruvian registration for his missing truck... and don't let him tell you it was in the glove compartment. \nJOHANA Right Chief! \nShe starts out of the office. \nDUFFY (to her back) Did the driver really freeze? \nJOHANA Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring. \nDUFFY My God!  I'm glad I didn't go. \nJOHANA (under her breath, leaving) ... So am I. \nINT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY \nDoctor LAWRENCE covers one ear with his hand as he yells into the phone. \nLAWRENCE (screaming) ... I said, all the truck papers are in the glove compartment! \nINT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN \nJOHANA sits at her desk, she too is yelling into the telephone.  Her colleague looks over at her and smiles. \nJOHANA (with a sigh) Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay? \nINT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY \nLAWRENCE Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that? \nJOHANA (V.O.) You've made me a happy insurance person. \nLAWRENCE Then, goodbye. \nHe is just about to hang up. \nINT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN \nJOHANA jumps up. \nJOHANA Wait!  Professor...? \nLAWRENCE (V.O.) ... Yes? \nJOHANA starts snooping around the papers on her desk, embarrassed by the presence of her colleague. \nJOHANA (as softly as possible) You don't know how I could reach that diver of yours... Mayol... We need some additional information... I mean, we have a few questions to ask him. \nINT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY \nLAWRENCE The last thing I heard, he was off to Taormina for the world diving championships.  That's Taormina, in Sicily! \nINT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY \nJOHANA dashes in without knocking. \nJOHANA Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily! \nDUFFY (alarmed) What d'you mean? \nJOHANA (improvising) The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra! Coppola!  De Niro...!  I knew it!  I knew we shouldn't have written that policy!! \nDUFFY (pale) What's happened?? \nJOHANA The documents are forged. \nENZO (sincerely) I'm glad you're here. \nEXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - DAY \nThey're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea. They've just arrived and all around them people are lunching away furiously. \nENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table. He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man. \nENZO (to waiter) \"Spaghetti del mare\" (to Jacques) It's delicious here.  It's the one thing they really know how to make. \nWAITER Del mare for two? \nJACQUES (nodding quickly) Yes, sure, for two. \nENZO And a bottle of \"Frascatti\".  Two bottles! \nWAITER Si Signore, grazie mille. \nThe waiter hurries away.  ENZO watches his departure, then thoughtfully. \nENZO He moves just like a woman. (then, as if he were speaking to Jacques) It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh?  To breathe in one, swim in the other... \nJACQUES nods without really knowing. \nENZO (suddenly louder) Anyway!  Nothing beats a sexy broad! Huh, Jacques! \nENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under the table. \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - LATER \nTheir lunch is on the table, half eaten. \nENZO ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right? \nJACQUES (quickly) Yes, of course.  Lots of questions. \nJACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the subject is closed.  They eat silently for a moment.  ENZO watches him.  Then: \nENZO Well, what are they? \nJACQUES (giving up) I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions. \nENZO bursts out laughing. \nENZO Well, then.  I'll do the asking for you.  \"Tell me dear Enzo, how did you become World Champion?\"  Oh, that's a long story. (his voice changes) Well, after you left Amorgos, I went back to Italy and joined the Navy. So you now have in front of you -- Captain Molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 years... \nJACQUES That's good. \nENZO How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well? \nJACQUES It's okay. \nENZO ... You married? \nJACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage. \nJACQUES No. \nENZO Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls. \nJACQUES smiles. \nENZO So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh? \nJACQUES (bluffing) Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men! \nENZO (slapping the table top) Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish. \nJACQUES (concerned) People say that? \nENZO (sorry he went too far) Forget it.  I was joking. \nEXT.  ENTRANCE TO TERRACE - ON JOHANA \nJOHANA comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the terrace.  She looks over the crowd, trying to find someone. \nJACQUES is sitting with his back to her.  She finally spots him and walks over to the table. \nENZO Eh!  La Madonna!  This one is for me.  I'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight. \nJACQUES turns around and recognizes her.  JOHANA smiles and walks up to the table.  ENZO takes his watch off and puts it on the table. \nENZO (quickly) I tell you she's mine! \nJOHANA (to Jacques) Hello! \nENZO (surprised) You know each other? \nJOHANA Yes. \nDead silence. \nENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him. Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead. \nJOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full one. \nJOHANA (to waiter) Thank you. \nAnd begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her. \nMAMMA MOLINARI Americana? \nJOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak. \nMAMMA MOLINARI (impressed, to Johana) Benvenuto! \nMAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face. \nEXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT \nThey emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a small rooming house. \nJACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry hanging on the other side of the street. \nJOHANA Thanks for helping with the bag. (she looks up at the pension with little enthusiasm) It looks great! \nJACQUES I thought it was a nice place. (suddenly doubting) Isn't it? \nJOHANA I'm being a pain in the ass. (looking at him) It's beautiful here. \nThey look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just stands there, a suitcase in each hand. \nJOHANA breaks the silence. \nJOHANA You're going to be very busy these days aren't you? \nJACQUES I don't know... why? \nJOHANA Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you. (feeling she has gone too far) But you are going to be very busy. You must have tons of things to prepare, interviews... And a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right? \nJACQUES (shakes his head negatively) Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think? \nJOHANA (with a faint smile) I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best? \nJACQUES Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous? \nHe looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She smiles at him, lovingly. \nJOHANA (laughing) You can put down the suitcases, you know. \nHe lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the street. \nENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window. \nENZO C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion. \nJACQUES I'm a little tired, I don't know if... \nENZO Get in the car! \nINT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT \nThey're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the mirror. \nENZO Roberto!  The bow-tie! \nROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around JACQUES' collar. \nENZO (taking a few steps back) Very good. \nJACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes. \nROBERTO What about the shoes? \nENZO Very chic. (hesitates) Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you? \nJACQUES No. \nENZO Then, it's very chic.  Avanti! \nEXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT \nA big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel. The official divers and technicians are all gathered in front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with photographers. \nROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet table. \nJACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a whiskey bottle on the table beside him. \nJOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks. \nJOHANA I thought you'd be at the dinner. \nJACQUES nods. \nENZO Why? \nJACQUES ... For the mermaids. \nENZO smiles, moved. \nENZO My father used to see them everywhere too... but the only one he ever caught was my mother... Actually she caught him. \nA beat. \nJACQUES Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions. \nENZO Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women. \nJACQUES Why?  Are they what's most important? \nENZO No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know? \nJACQUES ... Everything. \nENZO Everything about what? \nJACQUES (thinking) Well... about everything. \nENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again. \nTIME DISSOLVE TO LATER: \nJACQUES AND ENZO \nThere are now several empty champagne bottles around. They are both quite drunk.  ENZO is philosophizing. JOHANA is looking for them. \nENZO ... So, between Mamma, Roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long.  Except with Angelica. She just cries.  And then finally, we all end up kissing.  Can you explain that to me? \nJACQUES can't answer. \nENZO Because that's what love is all about.  It's a pain in the ass but keeps us together. (then, in a half dreaming, half desperate tone) A large and beautiful family! \nJOHANA walks over to them. \nJACQUES (suddenly) Enzo... We must quit the competition. \nENZO hits a wrong note on the piano. \nENZO (worried) Why? \nJACQUES If we don't... I'm going to beat you. \nJOHANA stands next to JACQUES. \nENZO (with a nervous laugh) Huh?  Well listen to him! (to Johana) Do you hear that? \nJOHANA No. \nENZO He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  \"I'm going to beat you\". \nJOHANA (with a smile) ... That's what he's here for, isn't he? \nENZO Listen to her!  \"That's what he's here for\"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you? \nJACQUES Two years younger than you. \nENZO As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs.  I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick. \nJACQUES The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it! \nENZO Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath? \nENZO is getting really angry.  The drinks have a lot to do with it. \nJACQUES (impatiently) I don't know.  Longer than you. \nENZO pulls open his collar and rises. \nENZO We'll see. \nEXT.  HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nJACQUES and ENZO dive into the pool in their Tuxedos. Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to help them stay at the bottom. \nENZO takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to JACQUES.  Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other pocket and opens it.  The cork floats out of the bottle. \nAbove on the surface of the pool there's a splash.  JOHANA finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them. Her dress is soaked by now. \nENZO pours champagne.  Courteous and grave, they clink glasses and begin to drink.  They have already been underwater longer than a minute.  They can't really drink out of the glasses and ENZO offers JACQUES the bottle. JACQUES studies the label like a connoisseur.  He drinks, passes the bottle back to ENZO. \nINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nParamedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at full speed.  ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.  Both men keep throwing up water. \nENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder. \nENZO Brave. \nEXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM \nIt's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee Boat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim ladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins. He flip-flops to the end of the platform. \nROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible. Only two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly over his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an astonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster. ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving apparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp of air. \nROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO down, he quickly disappears into the dark water... \nBLACK AND WHITE \nBut this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin. \nJACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating vertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES isn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the dolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY \nHe sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He looks around the room, trying to get his bearings. \nJOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger. She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep. \nJACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA sleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder. She wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on the floor.  It's one of his. \nJOHANA You scared me! \nJACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles. \nJOHANA Just checking up on your family. (then embarrassed) I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well... \nJACQUES I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you. \nJOHANA (getting up) I'd better get back now. \nJACQUES You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me? \nShe sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask. \nJACQUES (self conscious) ... No? \nJOHANA No?  Huh? (she says \"No\" as if she had asked the question) Yes, of course!! \nEXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY \nJACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is wearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite pleased with her new attire. \nJACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and head toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly kids. \nThe dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the pool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool and getting absolutely no reaction. \nJACQUES What's the matter? \nTRAINER I don't understand.  We've tried for two days.  They won't eat.  They won't perform.  It's since we got the new one. \nCLOSE ON DOLPHIN \nsurfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool, looks to JACQUES and SPEAKS. \nJACQUES Is she the new one? \nSurprised, the trainer nods. \nJOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She doesn't understand. \nJOHANA How can you tell it's a female? \nJACQUES ... The way she moves. \nThree other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is patting. \nJACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like the animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the pool. \nUNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL \nJACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull him along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool, and pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins circle above. \nEXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY \nJACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the air behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is so excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls into the pool. \nAfter a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps JOHANA out. \nTRAINER Did you ever think of trying the public pool? \nJOHANA He's a dolphin specialist. \nTRAINER In that case what's wrong with the new one?  Is she sick or not. \nJACQUES (taking his time to answer) Not the way you mean. \nNOVELLI (smiling) Yes... It's magic. \nINT.  BOAT - DAY - LATER \nOn the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him are drowned out. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY \nJACQUES sits in the diver's slot.  Opens his eyes slowly and looks around.  He puts his flippers on, an assistant stands at his side. \nHIS POV \nThe figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are GARBLED and incomprehensible.  Moving almost in slow motion he raises three fingers. \nTECHNICIAN Tre minuti! \nBACK TO SCENE \nTen other divers have waited for this signal to dive. They disappear one by one into the blue. \nJACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade... \nAlready euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems to empty himself out. \nTECHNICIAN Due minuti! \nJACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems to be operating in a different time zone... He seems unable to take his eyes off the water. \nEXT.  END OF DIVING PLATFORM - DAY \nTECHNICIAN Uno minuto! \nJACQUES puts his nose clip on.  He puts his hand on the gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears. \nUNDERWATER \nThe gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down. \nAbove him, the boat disappears from sight. \nHe moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him. \nBelow, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night. JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down. \nThe medics are waiting for him there.  They take his pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them... \nJACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this time into pitch black. \nBelow him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle of the gesture. \nThe dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES does not respond. \nThe diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay. Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon. \nThe dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him up. \nAt the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the surface. \nJACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's getting warm now... He closes his eyes. \nPasses the medical control without stopping... without even seeing it like someone asleep. \nHe's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air. JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter. \nThe silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet to go. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY \nIn slow motion JACQUES' hand holding the plaque breaks out of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous movement, his shoulders and head. \nHe gasps for air. \nA trickle of blood comes from his nose. \nFlashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer. \nEXT.  OPEN SEA - A DOLPHIN \nThe dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the air, in perfect harmony with JACQUES' triumph. \nEXT.  DOLPHINARIUM \nThe dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the exact same moment. \nThe trainer doesn't understand what's going on. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY \nJACQUES falls back into the water.  Two divers run over and pull him up onto the dock. \nJACQUES seems completely dazed, almost in a trance.  He slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder. It is the scream of his body in need of the surface, reality and the feel of the land. \nLATER \nJACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.  They are both asleep. Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his recurrent dream. \nHe's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.  She sleeps peacefully like a baby.  Quietly, gently, he eases out of bed and walks to the open window. \nHe stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.  Then in the distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the water, once, twice, a third time. \nJACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down next to JOHANA.  She is still sound asleep. \nEXT.  HOTEL - PIER - NIGHT \nJACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits.  He puts on his flippers.  The dolphin is still jumping in and out of the water.  JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims over to her. \nINT.  JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep. \nJACQUES' absence wakes her. \nJOHANA Jacques? \nShe gets up and walks over to the balcony.  She doesn't see anything. \nEXT.  PIER - NIGHT \nJOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of clothes JACQUES has left behind.  She looks around but still can't see anything.  She decides to sit next to the pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea. \nEXT.  PIER - DAWN \nThe sky has just begun to light up again.  JOHANA is still sitting next to the pile of clothes. \nShe is wearing JACQUES' sweater.  She looks sad, yet serene.  The look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation and who has made up her mind. \nTired, JACQUES swims back to the pier.  It looks as if he has come out of nowhere. \nHe is exhausted.  He takes off his flippers and gets up onto the pier in front of JOHANA.  He looks at her, a little surprised to find her there. \nJACQUES (warm) What are you doing here? \nShe answers in a far away voice, with the same serene sadness. \nJOHANA I'm going to leave, Jacques. \nDripping with water, he sits down next to her.  His face is drawn from fatigue.  She continues. \nJOHANA I'm going back home. \nJACQUES Why? \nJOHANA Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea. \nJACQUES I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about. \nJOHANA Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me. \nJACQUES But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right... \nShe looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child. \nJOHANA I've got to get back to the hotel... and get my suitcase packed. \nINT.  TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY \nThe train station faces the sea.  JACQUES and JOHANA are standing on the platform, amid others.  In the distance we hear the rumble and whistle of a train. \nJOHANA gets on the train.  The station master blows his whistle. \nJACQUES Will... will we see each other again? \nJOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears. \nJOHANA Take good care of yourself, Jacques. \nThe train starts pulling out of the station. \nJACQUES Where can I call you?  Johana, tell me where can I call you? \nJOHANA doesn't answer.  JACQUES stands helplessly in the station, his eyes filled with tears. \nINT.  ENZO'S ROOM - DAY \nENZO opens the door of his suite.  His hair is messed up, he's got \"sheet prints\" on his face and is wearing the top of a diving suit. \nJACQUES Can I come in? \nENZO No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep. \nENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed. He's lying on his stomach.  JACQUES walks in and lets himself drop in a chair. \nENZO Wake me up at 11:00. \nThe SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder. \nTECHNICIAN They're at 450 feet. \nINT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY \nENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through the porthole. \nENZO ... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her.  Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything! \nJACQUES I don't want to erase anything. \nENZO You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable? \nJACQUES (after thinking about it) ... Yes. \nENZO (smiles) I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn. \nJACQUES (taking it as a compliment) Thank you. \nINT.  CAPSULE - DAY \nThe technician fiddles with a few knobs. \nTECHNICIAN Minus 800 feet.  End of descent. \nINT.  DIVING CAPSULE \nThe diving capsule ends its descent.  The COMMANDER turns to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole. \nNOIREUTER (with a Mickey Mouse voice) You have enough air for 15 minutes. \nENZO bursts out laughing. \nENZO (with Donald Ducks voice) What's with the voice? \nNOIREUTER It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure. \nENZO (worried) And... does the voice come back? \nNOIREUTER For others, yes... For you, who knows? \nENZO (still a little worried, to Jacques) Try speaking to me? \nJACQUES (with Daffy Ducks voice) I don't find this funny.  We were having a serious conversation. \nENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.  They keep these same voice till the end of the scene. \nENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket. \nENZO (to Jacques) Here, give me your finger. \nENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own. Then NOIREUTER blows up. \nNOIREUTER (in a panic) Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden. \nENZO (loosing his temper) Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay? \nENZO pours a second drop on his own finger. \nENZO Go on, suck your finger. \nJACQUES hesitates.  ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks his own finger.  NOIREUTER is petrified. \nNOIREUTER Are you crazy?  At this pressure? \nJACQUES It's very deep down here. \nENZO Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere! \nJACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.  ENZO smiles. The alcohol has an immediate effect on them. \nENZO (to Jacques) A thousand commanders and we get a Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous. \nUNDERWATER \nENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first. He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables. \nJACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in them.  They are both hilariously drunk. \nINT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM \nThe SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control room speakers.  He flips a communication switch. \nSUPERINTENDENT Can you hear me?  What's going on? (to the technician) Are you sure you're on the right channel? \nThe technician nods back to him. \nUNDERWATER \nThe two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed to be working on.  They have their arms around each other and are dancing. \nJOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nJOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay window.  Day is dawning. \nJOHANA (looking out at the skyline) It's getting light out. \nJACQUES (V.O.) Here, it's getting dark. \nJOHANA smiles.  She stretches, lies down on the carpeted floor.  JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of conversation. \nJACQUES I've been thinking about you a lot, you know... \nJOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor. \nJOHANA So have I. (a beat) ... Hello? \nJACQUES I'm still here. \nJOHANA Well, then, talk to me some more. \nJACQUES ... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say. \nJOHANA Then, tell me a story. \nJACQUES Uh... Ah!  A story? \nHe turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet dangling in mid air. \nHe looks at the sea, seeking inspiration. \nJACQUES Do you know how it is? (starting again) Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid? \nJOHANA (with a smile) No... tell me. \nJACQUES You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever. \nJOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to sleep. \nINT.  JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES \nThe sun hits the roof tops.  The sea is sparkling. The phone rings on the window sill.  JACQUES answers. \nJACQUES Hello? \nJOHANA (V.O.) It's me again. \nJACQUES smiles. \nJOHANA (after a silence) I'm being a pain, huh? \nJACQUES ... Not at all. \nJOHANA (V.O.) You sure? \nJACQUES (smiling) Absolutely positive. \nJOHANA (V.O.) Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice. \nJACQUES doesn't know what to say.  He looks around him, can't figure out what to do. \nJACQUES (lost) Okay... huh, I'll be right over. \nINT.  AIRPORT - DAY \nJOHANA is standing in front of the airport. \nJACQUES sees her.  They smile shyly at each other. \nEXT.  STREET - NICE - OPPOSITE THE NEGRESCO HOTEL \nJACQUES and JOHANA are sitting in the back of a taxi.  The driver stops in front of the hotel. \nDRIVER (loud) The Carlton!  Enjoy your siesta. \nJACQUES and JOHANA look at each other. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY \nThe room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight coming through cracks in the shutters.  JACQUES and JOHANA are making love.  JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements of their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUNDS are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are underwater... \nALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act like people who have never felt anything like this before. A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits. \nJACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of someone melting, the screen is now totally blue. \nA thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. \nFrom the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the CAMERA... \nJACQUES (with a sigh) It's my apartment. \nUNCLE LOUIS (jumping up) Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast. \nJACQUES Uncle Louis, we have a guest! \nUNCLE LOUIS I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. (them calming down, to Johana) Did you bring the cassettes? \nINT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA \nJACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze. \nJACQUES (solicitously) You think it'll be all right? You'll be comfortable here? \nJOHANA (catching her breath) It's going to be... interesting. \nEXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY \nJACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port. \nROBERTO (glancing at his watch) ... It's not like him to be late. Of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all.  Once in Capri, he... \nJOHANA (interrupting) We get the picture, Roberto. (looks over her shoulder) Jacques, I think Louis needs help. \nJACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger. \nUNCLE LOUIS (yelling) Two dollars for this!  This fish wasn't caught.  It died of cancer! \nJACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering. \nROBERTO (pointing) Here he comes! \nA speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port. Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO. \nNext to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long. If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA MARIPOSA. \nENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines. \nENZO Jacques!  Johana! \nJOHANA Enzo! \nJACQUES Enzo! \nDuring all of this, everyone's attention is actually on BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all awestruck except for ROBERTO. \nROBERTO (meaning the speed boat) Where did you get that? \nENZO (meaning Bonita) \"That\"!  This is not a \"that\"... This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress. (whispering to Bonita) ... Who is going to be careful with the varnish... (back to Roberto) And who has come to spend a few days with us. (and very quickly) Where's Mamma? \nROBERTO (checking watch) You have eight hours before she gets here. \nENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY \nLoud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs. \nUNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody. \nENZO He's really going totally deaf! \nUNCLE LOUIS I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy!  You take care of your eyes, I'll take care of my ears! \nENZO (laughing) I'm sorry Uncle Louis. \nUNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey. \nUNCLE LOUIS Come on, drink up, my boy!  It might just save us from your bullshit. \nThe bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen. JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door: it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a bottle. \nJACQUES I'm glad you could come.  I want you to meet Enzo. \nENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands. \nLAWRENCE (with a smile) So you're the famous Enzo Molinari? \nENZO (with an even bigger smile) In the flesh.  I have that honor! \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nJOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the ceiling. \nBONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make- up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror. \nBONITA You're going to live here permanently? \nJOHANA ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little. \nJOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on her make-up like a professional. \nThe diver realizes and starts after him.  He grabs JACQUES by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform.  JACQUES lets go of the balloon. \nThe diver panics.  JACQUES slowly motions that everything is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface. \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY \nThe boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then 5:00, then 5:10.  JACQUES has been down there for over 5 minutes. \nJOHANA is worried sick.  ENZO doesn't know what to make of it and LAWRENCE feels completely helpless.  The stopwatch indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and JACQUES, half unconscious, brakes through the surface of the water. \nJOHANA screams and cries with joy when she sees him.  The crowd applauds.  ENZO is somber. \nNOVELLI takes the plaque from JACQUES' hands and turns to the crowd. \nNOVELLI (stunned) 360 feet!  He dove 360 feet!!! \nThe crowd cheers in excitement. \nENZO is sullen.  LAWRENCE is very worried. \nEXT.  ON PORT - END OF THE DAY \nThere's a pile of gear on the dock. \nENZO is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a time, JACQUES comes up to the boat.  Parked in the background, we see a taxi waiting with JOHANA sitting in the back seat.  ENZO pretends not to notice JACQUES' arrival. \nJACQUES watches him for a moment then finally dares to speak. \nJACQUES (pointing at taxi) ... There's a party at the hotel tonight. \nENZO keeps loading up the boat. \nENZO (busy) That's good. \nJACQUES (after a beat) Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all. \nENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit. \nENZO (serious) I'll see you in Amorgos. \nENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat. \nJACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab.  JOHANA opens the door to let him in, but he keeps walking. \nJOHANA Jacques...? \nJACQUES You go back, I'll walk. \nHe walks off. \nEXT.  MARINELAND - DOLPHIN POOL - ANTIBES - NIGHT \nThe park is empty as JACQUES approaches the pool. \nTINA the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet JACQUES.  JACQUES pats her and kneels to talk to TINA NINA. \nJACQUES (sadly) I won today.  I dove very deep, Tina. \nThe dolphin giggles. \nJACQUES What's so funny?  Can you dive deeper? \nThe dolphin nods \"yes\". \nJACQUES smiles. \nJACQUES (smiling) So you understand everything? \nThe dolphin nods. \nJACQUES That's good... So tell me why they're all angry at me?  Why is Enzo angry?  I never wanted to compete with him.  I never wanted to be champion of anything... All I want is to escape from them all... For just a few minutes, no people... No noise... Nothing but the sea. \nThe dolphin nods and giggles. \nJACQUES Do you really understand me?  Huh? Are we actually having a conversation here? \nAgain the dolphin nods \"yes\". \nJACQUES All right then, tell me:  can I ever dive as deep as you?  Stay under as long...? \nA beat.  Then the dolphin nods \"yes\". \nJACQUES Are you sure? \nThe two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water. They all nod together. \nJACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time. \nEXT.  AMORGOS - DAY \nThe little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous. It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white villas clinging to hillsides.  There is a small port.  (we saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast, we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by all sorts of activity. \nAs JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the dock, in his arms.  JACQUES is unconscious. \nENZO is furious.  The fear of loosing his friend has absolutely enraged him.  He starts pacing up and down the dock. \nJOHANA Is he alright?  What happened? \nENZO (furious) The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!!  Is that who you want to live with? Well, good luck!  You better learn to look after him because I won't always be here to do it! \nOnce again he marches off, then comes back. \nJACQUES (mumbling) ... How long was I asleep? \nENZO (to Jacques) Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay? \nA few steps away, then coming back. \nENZO (to Jacques) I'll never let you take away my title.  D'you hear me?  Never! \nENZO stalks off defiantly. \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - ANCHORED OFF THE COAST \nThere's activity.  The competition has begun. \nMUSIC \nA SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at various points in their dives. \nThe Tahitian comes up unconscious. The German comes up unconscious. So does the diver from the Philippines. \nNOVELLI doesn't know what to think. \nEXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET \nJACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals. JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea. \nBelow them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time. \nJOHANA Do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be? \nA beat. \nJACQUES ... Sure. \nJOHANA wants to say something. \nJOHANA ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like? \nJACQUES (after thinking about it) ... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom. \nJOHANA Why? \nJACQUES Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one. \nJOHANA has never looked so sad and lost. \nJACQUES doesn't notice. \nENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea. \nJACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him. \nENZO (smiling) ... You should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. Very good the piano!  Tomorrow is going to be a big day! \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT UNDERWAY - ON JACQUES \nHe's alone in the bow.  The others are clustered in the saloon, cockpit in the stern.  The boat is moving close to the cliffs.  The monastery looms above them. \nCLOSE ON JACQUES \nHe's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching for signs of life. \nA red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee Boat.  In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY \nENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is serious, concentrating hard. \nLAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and the DOCTOR climbs onto it. \nINT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS \nLAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph paper on a cabin table. \nLAWRENCE ... When I analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became apparent... (taps the graph paper) ... At the depths these men are diving, it is a physiological impossibility that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it back to the surface.  It's a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom, orient themselves and to return... To attempt to break Mayol's record is simple suicide. (to Novelli) For the last time.  I'm telling you cancel the competition. \nNOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform where ENZO is concentrating. \nMEDIC Molinari's a seventeen time world champion.  Do you want to tell him he can't dive. \nLAWRENCE doesn't answer.  NOVELLI is thinking. \n", "test1_input": "INT.  HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJACQUES Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal? \nENZO Because pasta should be eaten \"Al Dente\".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit. \nENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung out to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the middle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color... noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet. \nJOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner of the room.  JACQUES walks over and sits down at her side. \nENZO (to Mamma) Mamma!  La pasta?! \nMAMMA MOLINARI Arrivo!  Arrivo! \nShe points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the cheese.  ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's hands and starts playing. \nENZO ... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up. (to Johana) ... Right, Johana? \nJOHANA (smiling) Congratulations, Enzo. \nENZO Don't you agree, Jacques? \nJACQUES ... You always were the best. \nENZO laughs then sees his mother. \nENZO Ah!  La pasta! \nENZO starts singing in Italian.  MAMMA MOLINARI serves the pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese on the plates.  She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta, enough for three giants. \nMAMMA MOLINARI (with a smile) Buon appetito, Signorina! \nJOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.  JACQUES has walked up to ENZO.  He doesn't dare ask his question. \nENZO (smiling) What's the matter?  You still have a bunch of things to ask me?  You want to know the price of tea in China of how we landed on the moon?  Is that it? \nENZO laughs.  JACQUES is serious. \nJACQUES No, I have to ask you a favor... (a beat) You're the only one who'll understand. \nENZO (seriously) ... I'm listening. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nMAMMA MOLINARI Tutto va bene? \nThe three officials are eating pasta, plates on their knees.  Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod enthusiastically. \nNOVELLI (mouth full) Gracie mille, chignora. \nMAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door. \nINT.  FIAT - NIGHT \nJACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.  ENZO crammed in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a stretcher which takes up all the space. \nThey are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party. \nENZO (leaning forward) Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive? \nJACQUES Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road. \nJACQUES runs a red light. \nENZO And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail. \nJOHANA Enzo, stop bitching, will you? \nEXT.  MARINELAND PARKING LOT - FIAT - NIGHT \nThey get out of the car.  JACQUES starts to change into his swimming trunks.  ENZO shakes his head, can't believe he's really come along.  He laughs and starts undressing. \nINT./ EXT.  FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT \nIt's a very narrow street.  The car moves down it quickly. JACQUES drives.  The back seat is now occupied by the dolphin.  Its nose and tail protruding through the windows. \nJOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the dolphin with a watering can. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nThey have driven to the public beach.  They slowly lower the stretcher into the water.  The dolphin, leaving the stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away. \nHe won't leave JACQUES. \nJACQUES (moved) You can't stay here!  Come on!  Go away! \nJACQUES swims off with her for a while. \nENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher. \nJOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the dolphin who are swimming off together. \n", "test1_true": "ENZO You can stop that now, she has all the water she needs. \nJACQUES cannot get rid of the dolphin. \nENZO All right, we did it.  Let's go back to the party. \nJACQUES and the dolphin can't seem to part. \nJACQUES Just one minute. \nJOHANA is worried, she walks up to ENZO who goes back into the water and takes JACQUES by the arm. \nENZO Jacques, the dolphin is home now. And that's where we're going.  Come on!  Hurry up now.  Our girlfriend is freezing over there. \nThe dolphin starts swimming off.  JACQUES follows ENZO half-heartedly. \nEXT.  JOHANA'S PENSION - NIGHT \nENZO stops the FIAT in front of the pension.  The three of them get out.  ENZO hasn't bothered to dress. \nJOHANA heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of leaving JACQUES. \nJOHANA Well, good night, then... \nENZO You going to sleep here, all by yourself? \nJOHANA Yes... \nShe looks over at the pension, having a hard time concealing her lack of enthusiasm. \nJOHANA ... It's a comfortable place. \nENZO Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite. \nJOHANA (smiles) The Mamma's there too. \nENZO (face clouds up) Yes, the Mamma is is there. \nJOHANA Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques. \nJACQUES Good night. \nENZO (to Jacques) You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you? \nJACQUES What? \nENZO The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes. \nJOHANA Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay. \nShe rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at JACQUES. \nJOHANA Can I come watch you dive tomorrow? \nJACQUES (lost) Uh... Yes, of course! \nThe concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her. JOHANA disappears into the parc.  ENZO turns to JACQUES. \nENZO You really do have a few things to learn about women! \nEXT.  SEA - DAY \nThe sun is rising on a rough sea.  The Committee Boat is anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed. \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - BAY OF TAORMINA - DAY \nJACQUES who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just laid a towel down before him.  He's suited up, sitting in the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self- hypnotized. \nJOHANA, NOVELLI, and other officials are in the stern of the boat watching last minute preparations. \nThe scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into the water, disappear. \nJOHANA What are they for? \nNOVELLI They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet. \nJOHANA (just checking) If there was a problem, they could do something right? \nNOVELLI Of course, that's what they're for. \nJOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks. \nJOHANA (pointing) ... And those? \nNOVELLI Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide. \nJOHANA What's that little air bottle on the machine? \nNOVELLI That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed. \nJOHANA (shocked) But doesn't Jacques dive without anything? \n", "test2_input": "EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO \nSurfacing.  Assistants help him onto the platform. ROBERTO pulls off his fins.  ENZO rips off his mask.  He looks furious.  He tosses the depth plaque (which proves he is qualified) back into the water. \nENZO A shit dive. \nHe looks around angrily for an official.  Sees NOVELLI. \nENZO Those goddamned frogmen doctors waiting around at 200 feet they just kill your concentration. \nNOVELLI They're required by law. \nENZO (climbing off platform) There's no law down there!  The only law is what your lungs can take. (to the next diver) ... Have fun!  They waiting for you down there, to take the temperature of your ass. \nHe keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES, who's just about to begin his yoga preparation. \nJACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned. \nENZO (defensively) Anybody can have a bad day! \nJACQUES I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you. \nENZO (disgusted) It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know? Go do your Hindu exercises and don't break my balls! \nENZO stamps into one of the cabins. \nINT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.  She throws it away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES approaching.  JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.  He seems bitter. \nJOHANA Well, how was it? \nIn an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the catalog. \nJACQUES (sadly) Enzo had a bad day. \nJOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of the baby magazine. \nJOHANA (tense) And you? \nJACQUES I didn't dive. \nJOHANA (she takes the magazine) You'll try again tomorrow? \nJACQUES I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired. \nHe goes away. \nJOHANA You forgot your magazine! \nHe hasn't heard. \nJACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the bed. \nJOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two together. \nJACQUES What? \nJOHANA ... Nothing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY \nENZO bursts out of the water.  He rips off his face mask, throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure. He tosses the depth plague to ROBERTO. \nENZO Let them try. \nINT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY \nJOHANA opens the apartment door.  BONITA is standing there, a suitcase in one hand. \nBONITA I wanted to say goodbye, Johana. \nThey kiss each other goodbye. \nJOHANA is very uncomfortable. \nJOHANA You're leaving? \nBONITA Yes... (she hands her a note) Could you please give this to Enzo. \nJOHANA Of course. \nBONITA grabs the note back and tears it up. \nBONITA It's no use... Just tell him I said goodbye... And give him a kiss for me, Okay? \nThe two women hug again. \nJOHANA (sorry) Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily. \n", "test2_true": "BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach. \nBONITA Did you tell him? \nJOHANA Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment. \nBONITA ... You take care of yourself, Johana. \nBONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs. \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DOCKING - DAY \nOfficials, NOVELLI, LAWRENCE, ROBERTO and of course ENZO disembark.  There is a lot of excitement on the dock. Everyone has already heard the news. People swarm around ENZO. \nLAWRENCE spots JACQUES in the crowd, and goes to him. \nJACQUES (smiling) Good huh? \nLAWRENCE He really was unbelievable, 328 feet, deeper than the world record... (then eagerly) ... And, Jacques!  He held his breath for four minutes and fifty seconds! \nJACQUES (smiles too) Good... I guess I have tomorrow's work cut out for me as Enzo would say... \nLAWRENCE (seriously) You must be very careful, Jacques. At these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is... You'd really be pushing it.  I think it's very, very dangerous. \nJACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd.  He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO. \nJACQUES (yelling) Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations! \nEXT.  AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT \nENZO (in answer to the crowd's applause) Thank you, thank you very much! \nENZO and NOVELLI stand on a little stage facing the crowd. ENZO is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the audience. \nNOVELLI ... Now I'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue. Dangerous, because we don't know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet. \nWhile the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI, ENZO is gesturing to ROBERTO, explaining what appetizers he wants from the cocktail trays. \nThe crowd laughs. \nNOVELLI But, we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition continue! \nThere's wild applause.  ENZO lifts the trophy over his head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone. \nENZO (yelling) Good luck to you all! \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY \nENZO and ROBERTO are on the front deck watching the divers. \nA German diver comes up to the surface, empty handed. ENZO smiles. \nThe Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma.  The doctors carry him away.  Once he's sure that the diver is out of danger, ENZO smiles again. \nA whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform. The team consists of one diver and six assistants, three of them playing music to help the diver concentrate.  The diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his forehead.  He is concentrating very hard, so much that ENZO walks over to him to make sure he's okay.  The Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he faints. \nENZO (smiling to his brother) Fabulous, what a dive, huh? \nROBERTO smiles. \nThe diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the diving platform.  He concentrates for a moment then gives up and walks away. \nENZO He's right.  What's the point of knocking yourself out? \nINT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT \nThey're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep. The only light in the room comes from the open windows. He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her adoringly.  He slips off the chain with the gold coin. Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it rest there.  She opens her eyes and looks at him, wondering if he senses something. \nJOHANA (softly) What are you doing? \nJACQUES I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive. \nShe smiles, closes her eyes.  He swings the coin over her face gently, some kind of private ceremony.  She looks just a little intimidated. \nThe coin is now dangling in front of her mouth.  She hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin slide into it. \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY \nJACQUES walks up to the diving platform. \nLAWRENCE has fixed scientific equipment on his chest. JACQUES wets and slowly puts them on. \nENZO watches from the deck, his expression has changed. \nJOHANA, on the deck also, opposite ENZO, watches a little worried.  JACQUES concentrates then releases the gueuse and lets himself disappear under the water. \nUNDERWATER \nJACQUES dives down very fast.  The control takes place at 200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go.  He continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker around him. \nThe gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform, just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he is alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before swimming off, downwards! \n", "test3_input": "Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly come back. \nJACQUES falls unconscious. \nA DOCTOR The heart started again!  It's all right! \nNOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved. \nINT.  JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT \nJACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever. \nJOHANA sits at his feet. \nLAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill from a bottle and gives it to him. \nLAWRENCE Take this.  Have a good sleep. \nJACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the balcony. \nLAWRENCE Sweet dreams. \nLAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep. He goes out of the room. \nJACQUES (tenderly to Johana, who had started to leave the room) Kiss me. \nJOHANA bends over and kisses him. \nJACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave. \nJOHANA Sleep now.  We'll talk later. \nJOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room. \nEXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA \nThey're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really drinking either, just toying with their glasses. \nROBERTO passes, stops. \nROBERTO I've packed all of... Enzo's clothes. (a beat) I'm going to the radio telephone... (swallowing) ... to call Mamma. \nThey watch sadly as he leaves. \nINT.  JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT \nJACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the sheets.  He turns off the light by the bed. \nINT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA \nThey've moved from the bar to the table.  There is uneaten food in front of them.  A third place is set. \nJOHANA looks at the wall clock. \nJOHANA I'll go see how he's doing. \nLAWRENCE Let him sleep. \nINT.  JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES \nJACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable. The ceiling turns into water. \nJACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he is swallowed by it. \nAs he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue. \nThe dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They all break through the surface to gulp air regularly. \nSuddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket, gulps air and goes back down. \nThe sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin, locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two, then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim. \nHe breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a panic. \nThe exhausted fish is swallowed. \nThe dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright. \nHe screams inhumanly. \nImage is white, black, silence. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES \nJOHANA opens the shutters. \nThe room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and glasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out. \nJACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood coming from his nose and ears. \nJOHANA (in a panic) Jacques... Are you alright? \n", "test3_true": "JACQUES jumps into ENZO'S boat. \nJOHANA (still worried) Jacques?  Are you alright?  Answer me!  Are you alright? \nShe jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine. The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over the sound of the engine. \nJOHANA You've got to tell me what happened? \nJACQUES I saw how it has to be. \nJACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S DIVING PLATFORM.  He turns on the platform lights:  above and underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90, 120 feet... \nJACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating... \nJOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing. \nAs the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself. \nJOHANA Jacques, you know I love you. \nJACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his gueuse. \nJACQUES (after a silence) Don't be sad... It's not because of you, it's me.  It's all going on inside me! (a beat) I've gotta go and see. \nJOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform. \nJOHANA See what?  There is nothing to see! It's pitch black down there!  It's cold.  You'll be all alone!  Look at me, Jacques!  I am here!  I exist! Look!!! (she starts waving her arms) I'm real!  I am not a dream! Jacques will you look at me? (she breaks down) Please! \nJACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing his gueuse. \nJOHANA doesn't know what to do or say.  She is totally drained. \nJOHANA Jacques?  I'm pregnant. \nJACQUES That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you. \nJOHANA You are the father. \nSilence.  JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction.  He doesn't understand.  She realizes it's hopeless and stares at the sea. \nJOHANA (after a while) I lied... to keep you here. \nShe kisses him. \nJOHANA Promise me one thing. \nJACQUES Anything. \nJOHANA Promise you won't forget me. \nShe pulls the line releasing the gueuse. \nJACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by the ocean. \nUNDERWATER \nJACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light around him. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT \nJOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform.  She is holding the cable, to \"hear\" JACQUES' descent. \nThe counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300 feet mark. \nUNDERWATER \nJACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever.  He has gained a lot of speed. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT \nJOHANA holds her face in her hands.  The counter indicates that JACQUES is going very fast. \nUNDERWATER \nThe gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable.  JACQUES turns his body right side up. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT \nThe counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet. \nJOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable.  She cries her tears and looks down at the water. \nUNDERWATER \nThe headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and around his cable... as if he were waiting for something. \nA long form circles the border between the darkness and the light. \nJACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the night.  JACQUES watches in amazement. \nA dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead him off.  JACQUES hesitates. \n"}

{"test1_input": "PRIEST Jacques... Come, look. \nJACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater. \nPRIEST Is it a coin shining down there? \nJACQUES (overjoyed) It is.  It's a coin!  I'll get it for you, Father! \nPRIEST It'll be for the poor. \nJACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask.  He swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it to the surface. \nHe breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there. \nJACQUES Padre? \nHe looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- \"Boy on a Dolphin\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \nON JACQUES - UNDERWATER \nHe's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel. He senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It seems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that JACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface... \nON JACQUES - IN BED \nHe bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream. \nINT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK \nA BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows and throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours in.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house, and runs his hand through his hair. \nFATHER (with a smile) ... Come on, time to get up, Jacques! \nJACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He gives the pile a kick. \nFATHER (screaming at the top of his lungs) Louis, wake up! \nHe uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS, who is having a very hard time, waking up. \nEXT.  HOUSE - DAY \nJACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear under his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth. \nHe catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on a path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down abruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue. \nEXT.  SEA - DAY \nTheir boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES off the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim the waves of its wake. \nEXT.  BOAT - DAY \nOn board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump. JACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's suit. \nAt the foot of an old monastery another boat passes. The Priest is in it. \nJACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES takes the gold coin out of his pocket. \nThe pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin back in his pocket. \nEXT.  BOAT - DAY \nLOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock, the kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns around to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him. ENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing session. \nFATHER Jacques, come help me. \nJACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He seems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He has a weird feeling. \nJACQUES You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa. \nUNCLE LOUIS Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques. \nHis father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck. \nFATHER (winks at him) Don't worry.  When I'm tired down there, the mermaids help me out. \nFather and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts the helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump. \nThe heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of sight. \nJACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions to maintain the flow of air. \nUNCLE LOUIS (to Jacques) Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid? \nJACQUES No. \nThey keep on pumping for a while, then... \nUNCLE LOUIS I've seen them. \nUNCLE LOUIS goes on.  JACQUES doesn't budge. \n", "test1_true": "JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father. He doesn't answer. \nUNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER \nHe moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit.  He is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor.  He sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist.  He moves on. \nINT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING \nThey keep up the rhythm.  Sitting on a rock at a distance, ENZO watches them.  UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff. \nUNCLE LOUIS Why don't you ask me? \nJACQUES What? \nUNCLE LOUIS Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit! \nJACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him: \nJACQUES (in a completely flat tone) Why did my mother leave? \nUNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.  A beat. \nUNCLE LOUIS (ill at ease) Come on now, pump! \nUNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER \nHe is walking with difficulty at the bottom.  His bag is full of sponges.  He seems to be having trouble breathing. \nEXT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS \nJACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently.  UNCLE LOUIS feels obliged to answer JACQUES' question. \nUNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains: \nUNCLE LOUIS Your mother didn't leave.  She went back to America, that's all.  It's her home.  She's allergic to this Island.  She likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor... so one day she left.  Woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea. \nThey haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface.  The air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way. \nJACQUES (with a slight grin) So where did you see mermaids? \nUNCLE LOUIS smiles. \nUNCLE LOUIS In the bars in Athens! \nVery pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing. JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders.  The air hose is suddenly yanked down.  JACQUES immediately sees all the bubbles.  He is white as a sheet. \nJACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries to jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot at the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let him.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified. \nThe sea now looks as if it were boiling. \nUNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his arms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying desperately. \nENZO (screaming) Jacques!  Jacques! \nThe last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it looks as if they will never stop. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET - DAY \nThe image is now in color. \nA rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which fills the screen. \nSUPERIMPOSED:  1987 SICILY \nALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he can go, surprisingly fast. \nHe runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he enters.  We have time to read the sign carrying the restaurant's name:  \"LA MAMMA\". \nINT.  RESTAURANT - DAY \nALFREDO skips in.  He is panting, covered in sweat.  His panic is palpable.  The whole room watches him approach a long table where a large family is having a birthday party for a very old lady. \nHe has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can get the words out.  Then leans over and whispers in the ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull, wearing little round glasses. \nThe man listens, then stiffens. \nEXT.  HARBOR - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY \nA beat-up FIAT, towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops. \nENZO unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown emerging from a toy car. \nThe construction SUPERVISOR, an American, wearing a three piece suit, hurries over to him. \nENZO has already started undressing.  ROBERTO unloads the diving gear from the trailer. \nSUPERVISOR (exhausted) Signore Molinari? \nROBERTO (shaking his hand) Yes. \n", "test1_id": 1521, "test2_input": "As JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the dock, in his arms.  JACQUES is unconscious. \nENZO is furious.  The fear of loosing his friend has absolutely enraged him.  He starts pacing up and down the dock. \nJOHANA Is he alright?  What happened? \nENZO (furious) The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!!  Is that who you want to live with? Well, good luck!  You better learn to look after him because I won't always be here to do it! \nOnce again he marches off, then comes back. \nJACQUES (mumbling) ... How long was I asleep? \nENZO (to Jacques) Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay? \nA few steps away, then coming back. \nENZO (to Jacques) I'll never let you take away my title.  D'you hear me?  Never! \nENZO stalks off defiantly. \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - ANCHORED OFF THE COAST \nThere's activity.  The competition has begun. \nMUSIC \nA SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at various points in their dives. \nThe Tahitian comes up unconscious. The German comes up unconscious. So does the diver from the Philippines. \nNOVELLI doesn't know what to think. \nEXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET \nJACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals. JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea. \nBelow them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time. \nJOHANA Do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be? \nA beat. \nJACQUES ... Sure. \nJOHANA wants to say something. \nJOHANA ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like? \nJACQUES (after thinking about it) ... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom. \nJOHANA Why? \nJACQUES Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one. \nJOHANA has never looked so sad and lost. \nJACQUES doesn't notice. \nENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea. \nJACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him. \nENZO (smiling) ... You should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. Very good the piano!  Tomorrow is going to be a big day! \nEXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT UNDERWAY - ON JACQUES \nHe's alone in the bow.  The others are clustered in the saloon, cockpit in the stern.  The boat is moving close to the cliffs.  The monastery looms above them. \nCLOSE ON JACQUES \nHe's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching for signs of life. \nA red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee Boat.  In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY \nENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is serious, concentrating hard. \nLAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and the DOCTOR climbs onto it. \nINT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS \nLAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph paper on a cabin table. \nLAWRENCE ... When I analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became apparent... (taps the graph paper) ... At the depths these men are diving, it is a physiological impossibility that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it back to the surface.  It's a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom, orient themselves and to return... To attempt to break Mayol's record is simple suicide. (to Novelli) For the last time.  I'm telling you cancel the competition. \nNOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform where ENZO is concentrating. \nMEDIC Molinari's a seventeen time world champion.  Do you want to tell him he can't dive. \nLAWRENCE doesn't answer.  NOVELLI is thinking. \n", "test2_true": "EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO \nENZO is preparing.  He sits at the edge of the platform hyperventilating, almost in a trance. \nWe see JACQUES in the background, talking to NOVELLI, he then walks over to ENZO and climbs down next to him. \nJACQUES Enzo? (no response) Enzo... I know you're angry at me. (no response) Enzo, it's important. \nENZO opens one eye. \nENZO I'm concentrating. \nJACQUES (quickly) We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while. \nENZO looks at him coldly.  Takes another deep breath. \nJACQUES (rushing on) It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport. \nENZO You say that because you have the title! \nJACQUES No!  I would never cheat you. \nENZO Well that's very nice of you. \nHe takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the gueuse, disappears into the water. \nLAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing. LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving.  NOVELLI is balling out his assistants. \nJACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they were a gaggle of geese.  He listens to the sound of the gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the stopwatches.  He knows something is wrong. \nHe walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen bottle which is there for security.  He takes a few breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down after ENZO. \nUNDERWATER - JACQUES \nJACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand. 80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward him carrying ENZO'S unconscious body. \nJACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic, screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion, the memory of death. \nENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push both divers toward the surface. \nAs if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to wake him up.  He then slaps his face but ENZO remains unconscious. \nThey finally break the surface in each others arms. \nEXT.  ON DIVING PLATFORM \nThey pull ENZO out of the water.  The doctors open his jacket.  ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close.  He still has that long smile. \nENZO (faintly) You were right. \nJACQUES (moved) ... I was right about what? \nENZO (after a long silence) ... It is much better down there. It's a better place. \nHe tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting. JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears. \nENZO ... Push me back in the water... \nJACQUES (crying) I can't. \nENZO Jacques, take me back down... Please. \nHis smile freezes, he stops breathing.  His eyes close. \nJACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs. The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES resists. \nLAWRENCE Just give him five minutes!  What does it matter now, anyway... Come on, just leave him alone! \nLAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform. \nJACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his belt.  Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S body back into the water and dives after it. \nUNDERWATER - JACQUES \nHe holds ENZO in his arms.  Lets the dead weight of the body pull him down, deeper and deeper.  The rope around JACQUES' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt jerk.  When he feels it, JACQUES lets go... watches as ENZO'S body continues to drift by itself into the bottomless blue... \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM \nThe doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that JACQUES is attached to.  He is unconscious when they pull him up.  They hold him up by his feet.  JACQUES throws up gallons of water.  They put an oxygen mask on his face. \nA DOCTOR (listening to his heartbeat) The heart is going to stop!  The stimulator, quickly. \nSuddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds disappear.  The image slows down, the light fades. \nJACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down. \nHis heart stops. \nAmong the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle, smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart starts again slowly. \nThe image goes back to normal. \n", "test2_id": 1522, "test3_input": "Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly come back. \nJACQUES falls unconscious. \nA DOCTOR The heart started again!  It's all right! \nNOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved. \nINT.  JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT \nJACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever. \nJOHANA sits at his feet. \nLAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill from a bottle and gives it to him. \nLAWRENCE Take this.  Have a good sleep. \nJACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the balcony. \nLAWRENCE Sweet dreams. \nLAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep. He goes out of the room. \nJACQUES (tenderly to Johana, who had started to leave the room) Kiss me. \nJOHANA bends over and kisses him. \nJACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave. \nJOHANA Sleep now.  We'll talk later. \nJOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room. \nEXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA \nThey're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really drinking either, just toying with their glasses. \nROBERTO passes, stops. \nROBERTO I've packed all of... Enzo's clothes. (a beat) I'm going to the radio telephone... (swallowing) ... to call Mamma. \nThey watch sadly as he leaves. \nINT.  JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT \nJACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the sheets.  He turns off the light by the bed. \nINT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA \nThey've moved from the bar to the table.  There is uneaten food in front of them.  A third place is set. \nJOHANA looks at the wall clock. \nJOHANA I'll go see how he's doing. \nLAWRENCE Let him sleep. \nINT.  JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES \nJACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable. The ceiling turns into water. \nJACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he is swallowed by it. \nAs he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue. \nThe dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They all break through the surface to gulp air regularly. \nSuddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket, gulps air and goes back down. \nThe sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin, locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two, then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim. \nHe breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a panic. \nThe exhausted fish is swallowed. \nThe dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright. \nHe screams inhumanly. \nImage is white, black, silence. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES \nJOHANA opens the shutters. \nThe room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and glasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out. \nJACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood coming from his nose and ears. \nJOHANA (in a panic) Jacques... Are you alright? \n", "test3_true": "JACQUES jumps into ENZO'S boat. \nJOHANA (still worried) Jacques?  Are you alright?  Answer me!  Are you alright? \nShe jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine. The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over the sound of the engine. \nJOHANA You've got to tell me what happened? \nJACQUES I saw how it has to be. \nJACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S DIVING PLATFORM.  He turns on the platform lights:  above and underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90, 120 feet... \nJACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating... \nJOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing. \nAs the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself. \nJOHANA Jacques, you know I love you. \nJACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his gueuse. \nJACQUES (after a silence) Don't be sad... It's not because of you, it's me.  It's all going on inside me! (a beat) I've gotta go and see. \nJOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform. \nJOHANA See what?  There is nothing to see! It's pitch black down there!  It's cold.  You'll be all alone!  Look at me, Jacques!  I am here!  I exist! Look!!! (she starts waving her arms) I'm real!  I am not a dream! Jacques will you look at me? (she breaks down) Please! \nJACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing his gueuse. \nJOHANA doesn't know what to do or say.  She is totally drained. \nJOHANA Jacques?  I'm pregnant. \nJACQUES That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you. \nJOHANA You are the father. \nSilence.  JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction.  He doesn't understand.  She realizes it's hopeless and stares at the sea. \nJOHANA (after a while) I lied... to keep you here. \nShe kisses him. \nJOHANA Promise me one thing. \nJACQUES Anything. \nJOHANA Promise you won't forget me. \nShe pulls the line releasing the gueuse. \nJACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by the ocean. \nUNDERWATER \nJACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light around him. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT \nJOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform.  She is holding the cable, to \"hear\" JACQUES' descent. \nThe counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300 feet mark. \nUNDERWATER \nJACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever.  He has gained a lot of speed. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT \nJOHANA holds her face in her hands.  The counter indicates that JACQUES is going very fast. \nUNDERWATER \nThe gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable.  JACQUES turns his body right side up. \nEXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT \nThe counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet. \nJOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable.  She cries her tears and looks down at the water. \nUNDERWATER \nThe headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and around his cable... as if he were waiting for something. \nA long form circles the border between the darkness and the light. \nJACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the night.  JACQUES watches in amazement. \nA dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead him off.  JACQUES hesitates. \n", "test3_id": 1523}

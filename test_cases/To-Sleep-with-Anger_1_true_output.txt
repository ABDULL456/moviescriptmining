GIDEON You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story. 
HARRY You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son. 
GIDEON My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him. 
HARRY 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead. 
Off-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN. 
INT. BABE BROTHER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Babe Brother is sitting with Sunny by the screen door blowing giant bubbles. The bubbles drift past Linda, who is sitting at the table with real estate papers all over the table. She is talking on the phone with a client and signals them to stop disturbing her. 
Babe Brother sends more bubbles floating by, causing her to shake the water off her papers while she talks to a first time buyer. 
LINDA It has three bedrooms, one and a half baths. Well, yes, that means two toilets and one bath. Well... Yes, by appointment... Call me back if you decide. 
She hangs up the phone. 
LINDA You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean. 
BABE BROTHER Will you still get the money from your father? 
LINDA I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property. 
BABE BROTHER Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it. 
LINDA We could borrow on that land and put the money to work. 
BABE BROTHER I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way... 
Babe Brother is lost in his thoughts. He stares down at his hands resting on his knees. He picks up the telephone. 
INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY 
Junior is on the phone with Babe Brother. Pat crosses in front of the camera shaking her head in a negative manner. Babe Brother's voice is just audible. 
JUNIOR You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street. 
BABE BROTHER (O.S.) Why are you always afraid to get somewhere? 
JUNIOR This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal. 
BABE BROTHER (O.S.) This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street. 
JUNIOR Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him? 
BABE BROTHER (O.S.) Maybe I can get down there next week. 
Junior turns to his wife, who is off-camera. 
JUNIOR Babe Brother always acts like a gambler who is in the biggest game of his life and don't know about playing cards. 
EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON 
Harry and Gideon are walking along a railroad track. The sun is blinding. The heat makes the asphalt Appear to turn into a lake off in the distance. Gideon appears exhausted; beads of sweat continually form on his forehead. He fans himself with his hat. Harry is unaffected by the hot temperature. 
HARRY I can sit here and look at train tracks all day. We laid enough of them, didn't we? So many memories are stretched along tracks like these. 
Gideon looks down the tracks. A bowl of dust stirs off in the distance. The hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid. 
EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON (EFFECT) 
The tracks begin to twist and bend. Off in the distance, faint images of men laying track to a song.

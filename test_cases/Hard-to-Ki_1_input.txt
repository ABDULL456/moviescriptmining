INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BEDR00M    DAY 
Storm blinks his eyes   -- groggy, disoriented. He is in bed, just waking up.    Outside his window: this postcard- perfect ranch scene.    Has he died and gone to heaven? He can barely absorb it:   nature, sunshine, life. 
Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable. He remembers: the nurse ... Andy. 
A TV is on at the foot of the bed.     Storm squints at the digital clock beside him: 4:17 PM.     Storm closes his eyes.

STORM Seven years. 
He struggles to sit. It takes all his strength simply to get half-propped on pillows. Something jabs him. It's a TV remote, on the sheet beside him. Storm picks it up. 
After a beat, he manages to focus on the TV -- 
TV SCREEN - "GERALDO SHOW" (FILE TAPE) 
Heated argument in progress. Suddenly Roy Innis leaps from his chair, starts strangling a white supremacist across from him. Melee. The stage flooded with shooting, fist-fighting men. Geraldo's nose is broken! 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (from TV) -- Stay tuned for more of: Best of Geraldo! 
BACK TO STORM 
Dumbstruck. 
STORM Geraldo? 
Outside the HORSE WHINNIES loudly and rears up on its hind legs. Storm turns toward the horse -- 
When Storm is turned away from the TV, a 10-second ad comes on. Senator Trent waving and smiling to a crowd. 
AD (V.O.) (from TV) Senator Vernon Trent promises:   No new taxes! 
TRENT (V.O.) (from TV) And you can take that to the bank! 
Storm misses this.     He turns back to: 
TV SCREEN 
An attractive female spokesperson speaks directly and sincerely into camera. 
FEMALE SPOKESPERSON (V.O.) (from TV) -- If you want to sleep with me ... you better wear a Pharoah.

A "product shot" of condom packages appears. 
MALE ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (from TV) Pharoah condoms. The only safer sex is no sex at all! 
STORM 
Certain the world has gone insane. 
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Andy at the wall phone. 
ANDY (into phone) can't come in to work, are you crazy?! I can't even go to my apartment! People are dead, Martha ... no, I can't tell you where I am ... you're better off not knowing -- 
Mini-TV on countertop.    On TV:   a photo of Storm.   Jack Esposito reporting -- 
ANDY (into phone) I am freaking A.W.O.L. I mean, what am I gonna do with this guy -- (pacing, anxious) I want to help him... my God, he needs it ... but it's all over the T.V., he's some kind of crooked cop with drugs and murder and -- 
CLICK. Andy turns to see Storm standing there, glowering       -- his hand on the PHONE hang-up bar. 
For half a beat, Andy is frightened: unsure what this man will do. Then Storm starts to collapse. 
Andy rushes to him, supports him. 
ANDY It's okay -- I'm here, I'm with you. 
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Storm on the couch, phone in hand -- Andy across from him. The day's newspapers before them... TV ON in b.g.

STORM (into phone) Yeah,   that Esposito. The ignorant fuck   who's broadcasting the news right   now. (listens) Tell   him it's Storm. Mason Storm. 
Storm cups the receiver -- steaming -- waiting to be put through. His eyes flash to the room, the house...

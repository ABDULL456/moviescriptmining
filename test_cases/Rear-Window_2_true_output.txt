INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff and Stella turn for a quick glimpse of the song-writer's apartment. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
A quick flash of the song-writer's apartment, and his musical group gathered around the piano. 
STELLA Maybe that music will delay her taking the pills. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff and Stella look back to Thorwald's apartment. Jeff has the receiver to his ear, and the buzzer can be heard on filter. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
At the bottom of the picture, Miss Lonely Hearts is still listening to the music, while in the apartment above Lisa appears into the living room from behind the doorway that leads to the bedroom. She looks across to the source of the music. She is as arrested by the melody as Miss Lonely Hearts. Then looking across to Jeff, she holds up her hands triumphantly to show him the jewelry she has discovered. At this point, Thorwald appears coming along the corridor of his apartment house! Lisa is completely unaware of his approach.

Stella is so shocked, she can only gasp for breath. 
Jeff, in near panic, shouts in anguish! 
JEFF Lisa! Lisa! 
At this moment, the phone is picked up on filter, and a voice speaks: 
POLICE Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood. 
Jeff opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out, as his attention is focused on: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Thorwald at the door, unlocking it with his key. We see that Lisa has heard the sound, and looks toward the door, all but frozen with alarm. The Policeman on the phone repeats with studied irritation: 
POLICE Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood. 
Lisa dashes back into the bedroom just in time to avoid being seen by Thorwald as he opens the door and enters the apartment.

Jeff, urgently into phone, with a serious and rapid voice:

POLICE Your name? 
JEFF L. B. Jefferies. 
POLICE Phone number? 
JEFF (Impatiently) Chelsea 2-5598. 
POLICE Two minutes. 
Phone is down on filter, and Jeff replaces his receiver.

Thorwald crosses the living room, and goes into the bedroom. Suddenly he looks onto the bed. He picks up the open alligator handbag. He turns, facing the window, looking down at the bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment. 
He comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in. 
He points to the window. She makes one more step toward the door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands something from Lisa. 
Slowly her right hand comes up and opens. 
He takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out faintly: "Jeff! Jeff!" 
Thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but not clearly. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
An angry Jeff is staring, and trying to penetrate the semi- darkness of Thorwald's room. Then he bends his head forward in despair, and after a brief moment speaks: 
JEFF (With deep sincerity) Stella -- what can we do?

Stella staring out, tense, frightened. Then her expression changes sharply as she looks slightly to the left. 
STELLA There they are. 
Jeff looks up quickly. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Two policemen move quickly and professionally up the corridor toward Thorwald's apartment. They stop at the door, listen a moment, and then push the buzzer insistently. Inside the apartment, lights go on, and Thorwald is in the center of the room looking toward the door. Lisa staggers away from him, trying to rearrange her clothes and her hair. She is as surprised at the interruption as Thorwald. He listens, looks back questioningly toward Lisa, then goes to the door. He passes into the kitchen.

Jeff and Stella visibly relax. Jeff doesn't say anything, but a gesture of rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand gives an indication of how deep his tension was. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
After a moment's hesitation, Thorwald goes to the door and opens it.

Jeff quickly puts a hand out and takes up his long-focus lens. He looks through the finder. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT 
Thorwald's head and shoulders fill the screen. For a moment Thorwald is genuinely frightened by the sight of the police. We see him listening to the policeman out of the picture. Thorwald turns slowly and we see him lose much of his fright and regain some control of his face. He completes his turn and is looking at the girl a little puzzled. He then swings back toward the police.

A quick flash of Jeff and Stella looking. Jeff still has the long-focus lens to his eye.

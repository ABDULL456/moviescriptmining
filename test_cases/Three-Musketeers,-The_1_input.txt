MILADY Good. Then we will sit by the fire, and eat and drink, and you may impress, perhaps even move me, with the story of how you came to lie unconscious, in the middle of the night, on the road to Calais. (soft seductively) I love a good adventure. D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her. CUT TO: 
108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108 A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters its box. The little door on the other side opens. A hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels the message on its leg. CUT TO: 
109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109 A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary opponent. Richelieu enters with the message. 
RICHELIEU (dry; re: Rochefort's fencing) The wonderful thing about an imaginary opponent is that he is always greatly skilled, and always easily defeated. The pride of victory, without the risk of loss. If only life were like that. 
Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He looks up, pleased. 
(CONTINUED) 
109   CONTINUED:                                                       109 RICHELIEU Milady has reached Calais. 
ROCHEFORT I told you not to worry about the Musketeers. They are dead by now. 
RICHELIEU Buckingham's signature will be on the treaty by morning. 
ROCHEFORT The King's birthday celebration...? RICHELIEU Will proceed as planned. Thanks to the kind intercession of Queen Anne. Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly. ROCHEFORT And our plans...? 
RICHELIEU (knowingly) Will proceed as well. Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the King's portrait. And drink. CUT TO: 
110   INT. MILADY'S CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT                      110 
D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady speaks quietly, with seeming compassion: MILADY You are sad. 
D'ARTAGNAN I was thinking about my friends. Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks quietly, from the heart: 
(CONTINUED) 
110   CONTINUED:                                                     110 D'ARTAGNAN The three best friends a man could have. We were separated on our way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll never see them again. 
MILADY What brings you here? D'ARTAGNAN I'd like to tell you. But I can't. 
MILADY 'Important business.' 
D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it. She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose. MILADY I understand. Men make bold plans in secret. And women wait... to mourn, or to celebrate the outcome. I know from experience, it's a lonely vigil. D'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) All I can tell you is... I'm on a mission for the King. MILADY (looks up; laughs lightly) I've heard that one before. D'ARTAGNAN I'm serious. MILADY You are a young man. And young men are given to exaggeration. However, if you would like to entertain me with a story, I'm eager to hear it. And please, make it very brave, filled with handsome knights and beautiful ladies. I know, a dragon -- There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts accordingly, and reveals: (CONTINUED) 
110   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             110 D'ARTAGNAN I came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England. MILADY (alert; though d'Artagnan doesn't see it) A spy...? D'ARTAGNAN Yes. MILADY I believe you... (beat) Aren't you afraid? D'ARTAGNAN Musketeers are not afraid of anything. MILADY I knew it. I knew you were a Musketeer the moment I saw you. D'ARTAGNAN You did? 
MILADY Of course. (with sudden concern) But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was to find out you are here, your life could be in grave danger. D'ARTAGNAN A Musketeer is not afriad of danger. MILADY I'm dangerous. You're not afraid of me? Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him. But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider. And midnight as it approaches. D'ARTAGNAN You're not dangerous. 
MILADY Then what am I? 
(CONTINUED) 
110   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              110 D'ARTAGNAN You're... beautiful. 
Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

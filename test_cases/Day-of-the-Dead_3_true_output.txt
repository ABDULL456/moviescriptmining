SARAH moves to retreat but CHICO lifts his rifle and FIRES wildly into the clearing. 
CHICO NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! 
57	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT, but not in the head. Their brains keep functioning and they march on. RHODES SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE! 
Whatever else he is, RHODES seems fearless. He stands in the open as his human soldiers fan out. He notices that the RED COATS are out of ammunition. He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS SOUND. THE RED COATS stop in their tracks. They dump the SPENT SHELLS from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts. Their fingers are stiff. Three bullets fall to the ground for every one that finds its way into a gun chamber. 
The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW. They are closing in on the thicket. 
58	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest. SARAH FIRES A QUICK BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into the jungle. 
Suddenly, from right behind SARAH's back, comes A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM. A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all. 
MIGUEL BURN THE CHURCH! KILL THE PRIEST! 
It's MIGUEL, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. He is charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one good hand. He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down. 
59	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
MIGUEL breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the SOLDIERS. RHODES sees the one-armed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly. He draws his own PISTOL, an enormous Magnum, an elephant stopper. 
SOLDIERS, taken by surprise, scatter, TOBY AND TRICKS among them. MIGUEL'S BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIER'S CHEST. He dies instantly. 
MIGUEL KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! 
NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING. 
ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION. 
THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE. 
MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST. He falls to his knees. His RIFLE FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun knocks him back on his ass. He sits there bewildered for a moment, then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES. 
RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE. In the next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captain's stomach. RHODES' smile disappears, re-placed by a sudden flush of fear. He freezes. 
MIGUEL Kill the priest. 
MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's empty. 
The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the "Attack" button on his belt unit. 
THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him. Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what they are...walking dead. 
THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream. 
THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH. ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD. He tries to stand up but he's too weak. A BULLET IN THE NECK stops his screaming. Then HE'S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead. 
THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again. RHODES calmly pushes the "Reload" signal and the creatures obey. 
MIGUEL'S CORPSE twitches for a short time, then goes rigid. 
60	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
SARAH sinks against a cypress when she sees MIGUEL die.

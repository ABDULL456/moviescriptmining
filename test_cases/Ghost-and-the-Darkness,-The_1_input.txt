THE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE. 
STILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to sing. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. Lovely. 
CUT TO 
MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe- 
-or rather they should be. 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as the others start to scream- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening. 
CUT TO 
A CATTLE PEN. THE CATTLE ARE NERVOUS- 
-one of them kicks wildly at the wind. 
They should be nervous- 
-The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on it, brings it to earth as the dust rises. 
CUT TO 
ANOTHER FLARE IN THE NIGHT. 
CUT TO 
THE HOSPITAL. DAY. PACKED. 
HAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed. 
CUT TO 
SOMETHING. 
And for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire. 
HOLD ON THE WIRE. 
And now a paw walks across it- 
-and the instant that happens- 
CUT TO 
THE THREE COOLIES, the brothers, in the contraption, two of them asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad car and 
CUT TO 
THE DOOR OF THE RAILROAD CAR slamming loudly down and 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
THE DARKNESS, standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked and 
KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL 
The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough coolies. 
For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too startled and surprised to do anything but stare- 
-and then all hell just explodes as we 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more terrifying and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and 
CUT TO 
THE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and 
CUT TO 
THE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of the car. 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again and 
CUT TO 
THE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do anything but stare and 
CUT TO 
THE CLAWS, ripping at the air and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and 
CUT TO 
THE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and 
CUT TO 
THE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and 
CUT TO

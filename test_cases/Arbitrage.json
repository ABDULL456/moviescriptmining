{"train": "ROBERT (hugging her, happy) No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here? \nAnother SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING. \nALL HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY! \nRobert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a toast. \nROBERT Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! \nEveryone laughs a little. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6. \nROBERT (CONT'D) What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. (MORE LAUGHTER) I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for, (KISSES ELLEN) so, thank you... \nPETER (CALLING OUT) ...and to have sold the company to Standard this morning! \nThey all LAUGH. \nROBERT (SMILES) That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business! \nELLEN Oh, here we go! \nMore group LAUGHTER. \nROBERT Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too! \nMore LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter across the room. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much. \nALL (as they applaud) Hear, hear! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 7. \nINT. STUDY - MOMENTS LATER \nA warm, clubby room, kept traditional. Robert pours out two SCOTCHES. \nROBERT Kids are wild. \nBROOKE (LAUGHING) I don't know about me as a mom. \nROBERT No, no no, you should have-- I want more \"you's\" around. \nRobert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers. \nBROOKE (LAUGHS) It's all about you, isn't it. (POINTS) Four... and nineteen. \nROBERT Yeah, yeah yeah... \nBrooke nods, tries to smile. \nBROOKE So what was that all about? \nROBERT What? \nBROOKE The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid. \nROBERT (LAUGHS) Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight. \nShe nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE. \nBROOKE You see this? \nHe looks closely at it. A \"Forbes\" cover story: \n\"Robert Miller, the Oracle of Gracie Square: Investor profits in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis.\" Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8. \nROBERT (shakes his head) Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can. \nBROOKE Peter's got a copy pinned up in the conference room. \nROBERT (sits back, takes a drink) Well, you gonna keep skirting around it? \nBrooke leans back and stares at him. \nROBERT I don't wanna be in the cemetery! \nELLEN Oh, by the way, Mary called from St. Victor's Hospital, again, she said they still haven't gotten the check yet... \nROBERT I'm taking care of it. \nELLEN The gala is Friday. Should I be selling my ring? What's going on? \nROBERT I've had to move some things around for the merger. \nELLEN It's only two million. \nROBERT (walks up to her, laughs) Only two million? \nELLEN (SMILES) Yeah! \nROBERT You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks... \nELLEN I do remember. But I do not remember you being so sentimental unless you were trying to change the subject. \nA KNOCK at the door. \nROBERT (as he heads out, smiling) I don't know what you're talking about... \nEllen slaps his behind. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17. \nINT. MAYBACH - NIGHT \nRobert and Gavin ride, both shuffling papers. \nINT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS \nRobert trails Gavin up the stairs as he types out a TEXT MESSAGE to Julie: \"Wrapping up mtg- be there soon.\" \nThe MAITRE'D spots Robert and greets him as he approaches. \nMAITRE'D Mr. Miller, good to see you, sir. Your party has already arrived. \nHe leads Robert and Gavin into the \nINT. POOL ROOM \nWhere we see Brooke and Peter seated with a group of EXECUTIVES including AIMES (45), and BARNES (43). \nDispleasure immediately registers on Robert's face. \nROBERT (sotto, to Gavin) Where the hell is Mayfield? \nGavin shakes his head. They approach the table. \nBARNES (as they sit) Mr. Miller, thank you for coming. We were just getting acquainted with Brooke and Peter here. \nROBERT (SMILING) I hope they didn't beat you up too much. \nAIMES They've been terrific. \nPETER Dad, we've been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back-office. \nRobert phone VIBRATES. It's \"Julie\" calling. He silences it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 18. \nROBERT I'd love to hear about that, but... (A BEAT) I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight. \nAIMES (NODS) Jim should be here in twenty minutes; he suggested we get right into details. \nBARNES I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that... \nRobert drifts as the suits prattle on. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. POOL ROOM - LATER \nThe execs are still chattering. Robert is sweating. Julie calls again. Robert silences it again. Then he gets a text: \"9:40pm - FUCK YOU.\" \nHe scans the party further. No Julie. \nROBERT Where's Julie? \nASSISTANT She's in the back. \nINT. GALLERY - OFFICE IN BACK - CONTINUOUS \nWe pick up on Julie bumping two rails of COCAINE. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 21. \nShe's dressed in a burnt red, form-fitting Lanvin dress, hair coiffed, perfectly made-up-- if we didn't suspect anything, we'd think she was the precise image of New York art-world success. \nJulie pulls her hair back and straightens, enters the main gallery... \nINT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS \nWhere she quickly sees Robert searching for her through the crowd. She stops dead, considers going back into the office... \nBut she stands firm. Robert finds her eyes. He stares at her. \nShe stares back, with a simple look that says, plainly: \"Go away.\" \nShe turns and heads off to talk to a group of PATRONS, including the painter VICTOR. One of the group is a DASHING YOUNG MAN- is he flirting with her? \nRobert approaches, staring at the young man, then at Julie. She's all smiles, but she doesn't immediately introduce him. He stands there, until-- \nROBERT Hey, Julie. \nJULIE Oh... (to the group) This is Robert Miller, one of our collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava, who is a talented young artist. \nRobert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries, especially kind to young AVA (15). \nROBERT Oh, really? Painter? \nAVA Drawings. \nJulie begins to walk off, disappearing into the crowd. \nROBERT (LOOKING AROUND) Yeah, that's great. (as he notices Julie leave, to the group) (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22. ROBERT (CONT'D) I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second. \nRobert trails Julie, moving up to her quickly. He reaches out to touch her and she spins towards him violent, definitive. \nROBERT (CONT'D) What? Why are you doing this? \nJULIE Go -- away. \nJulie heads back to the buyers. \nDismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out towards the entry desk. \nHe approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces. \nROBERT I will take (POINTING) those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall. \nASSISTANT (pointing to list) Right there, number seven. \nROBERT Don't tell her it was me. (off her nod) I mean it. \nASSISTANT You got it. \nRobert walks out and hails his driver. \nINT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER \nOff Robert, in bed with Ellen who is asleep. He gets up and stumbles to the bathroom, puts on a robe. \nINT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR \nHe approaches the basement level carrying a folder of papers... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 23. \nINT. SERVICE KITCHEN \nAnd sits at the counter, staring at a REPORT of some kind. He refills a glass of SCOTCH, downs it. \nROBERT Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? \nHe crosses towards her. \nROBERT (CONT'D) You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image. \nJULIE What image? \nROBERT Success. \nHe sits down next to her. \nROBERT (CONT'D) The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say \"Whoah, how'd she do that?\" -- and that's what they remember. Always. \nShe stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26. \nJULIE (QUIETLY) You're never gonna leave her. \nHold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently. \nCUT TO: \nBEDROOM \nJulie is on the bed, holding herself, crying. \nRobert comes up next to her, hugs her. \nROBERT Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go... \nJULIE ...Where?... \nROBERT There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that. \nShe's keeps crying, but... \nJULIE Me, too. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT \nA MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 \"Just One More Chance.\" We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie rests her head on Robert's shoulder. \nAnd the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off into a trance of desperately needed sleep until... \nA SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nReality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT, flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 27. \nINT. CAR \nRobert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement returns... \nHe looks over at Julie. \nIt is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck. \nShock, followed quickly by panic. \nWe hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak... \nRobert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at the phone just before pressing \"Send\"... and hangs up. \nHe tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens. \nEXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nHe drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces. \nHe takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to touch her, then stops. \nHold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in his bloody hands. He SCREAMS. \nROBERT It's better you don't ask. \nJIMMY So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30. \nROBERT That's correct. \nJIMMY Because I want to be very clear about this: you called me to give you a ride. I'm giving you a ride. \nROBERT No, you're not. We're not here. \nJIMMY Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we? \nROBERT We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right? \nJIMMY Right. \nROBERT Because if anyone checks... \nJIMMY Why is anyone gonna check? \nROBERT They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here? \nJIMMY No. \nROBERT Somebody knows you're here? \nJIMMY No! \nROBERT But somebody knows-- you're not there. \nJIMMY Well, my girl... \nROBERT Oh, Jesus, Jimmy... \nJIMMY Man, you call up two am, what the fuck you want? She asked me where I was going. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 31. \nROBERT What'd you say? \nJIMMY I told her I had to run out a minute. \nA beat. \nROBERT Do you trust her? \nJIMMY Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad? \nROBERT Do you trust her? \nJIMMY Yes, I fucking trust her! \nROBERT Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours. \nJimmy exhales a long sigh. \nJIMMY This is some pretty fucked up shit. \nROBERT Jimmy... \nJIMMY No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me... \nROBERT ...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'... \nJimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 32. \nJIMMY You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?! \nROBERT (after a beat) Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help. \nJimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road. \nRobert winces in pain. \nJIMMY You alright? \nELLEN Of course I do... \nShe rolls over. Hold on Robert's face. \nEXT. PARK BENCH - DAY \nSYD FELDER (64) sits next to Robert. \nSYD Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter. \nROBERT And such a person... \nSYD ...would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction. (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 35. SYD (CONT'D) But that's only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime. \nROBERT Fingerprints, DNA? \nSYD Very hard to collect after an explosion. The real world's different from television. \nROBERT What about cell phone records? \nSYD Did this person make any calls from the area? \nROBERT Not from a cell phone, no. \nSYD Then they won't be able to place him there. \nROBERT What would you advise such a person to do? \nSYD To confess immediately. \nROBERT Failing which? \nSYD To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. But let me tell you something, and I'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him. \nRobert stands. \nSYD (CONT'D) (FRENCH ACCENT) Robert... \nROBERT Yeah. \nSYD They're going to come to you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36. \nROBERT I know. \nSYD An accident's not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now we can probably work it out. \nROBERT You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses? \nSYD Nothing good. \nROBERT And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years? \nSYD I did. \nROBERT (laughs in pain) What choice do I really have? \nEXT. FREMAUT ACCOUNTING HEADQUARTERS - LATER \nWe follow CHRIS VOGLER (52) through the busy lobby out to the street. He crosses Park Avenue and gets into Robert's limo. \nINT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nRobert opens the Percocet bottle, downs four PILLS. \nChris enters and sits. Robert mimes a question. \nCHRIS You're aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds. \nROBERT Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. (ZEROING IN) You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37. \nCHRIS Well, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets. \nROBERT No. Absolutely not. That's impossible. \nBROOKE The \"Old Hill\" Fund. Dad, are you listening to me? \nROBERT Of course I'm listening. (SITS FORWARD) Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet. \nBROOKE Yeah, but look at the sheet! It can't be right. There's a four hundred million dollar hole here. I mean that can't be right. \nINT. ROBERT'S OFFICE RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS \nDet. Bryer enters the glass doors and badges the RECEPTIONIST. \nRECEPTIONIST May I help you? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 40. \nBRYER Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller. \nCINDY Is he expecting you? \nBRYER Possibly. \nINT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nBROOKE ...the way that this sheet reads, half of the fund's assets are missing. \nROBERT (LAUGHS) That's ridiculous. That can't be right. \nBROOKE I know, it's ridiculous, and yet... \nROBERT Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it. \nThe Intercom handset RINGS. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) Yeah. \nCINDY (O.S.) There's a detective Bryer here to see you? \nROBERT (stiffens, then into phone) Give me two minutes, then send him in... \nBROOKE Everything alright? \nROBERT Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later. \nBROOKE Okay. And Mom wants to know about the hospital check? \nROBERT Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41. \nBROOKE Okay. \nBrooke exits. Robert steels himself. \nCINDY (O.S.) Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr. Miller's personal assistant, right this way. \nINT. ROBERT'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nAs Brooke exits, she and Bryer cross paths. She eyes him... He doesn't look familiar. Off Brooke, curious. \nINT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nRobert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite each other. \nROBERT Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible. \nBRYER Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery? \nROBERT Correct. \nBRYER How'd you meet her? \nROBERT Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation. \nBRYER Uh-huh. When'd you last see her? \nROBERT Last night, at the gallery. \nBRYER Did you stay till the doors closed? \nROBERT Alright. \nBRYER Now, I don't mean to be indelicate... \nROBERT But you're going to be indelicate... \nBRYER Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but... \nROBERT Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place? \nBRYER Something like that, yeah. \nROBERT It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 45. \nBRYER (nods, stands as Robert STANDS) Well that seems to make sense. (BEAT) So we're all good with the apartment, then? \nROBERT Sure. \nBRYER Thanks. \nRobert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back. \nBRYER (CONT'D) What happened to your head? \nROBERT What? \nBRYER That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you? \nROBERT (touching the cut) Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet. \nBRYER Last night? \nROBERT This morning. \nBRYER Hate when that happens. \nROBERT Yeah. Me, too. \nBRYER Well, thanks for the chat. \nROBERT No problem. \nBryer heads out. \nWe hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 46. \nINT. ELLEN'S OFFICE - OUTER SUITE - DAY \nA serene khaki suite with high-post windows and white upholstered furniture. On the walls are gala posters from various charity events. \nMAE (30s) sits at a reception desk typing. The phone RINGS. \nMAE (INTO PHONE) Ellen Miller's office... \nINT. ELLEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nEllen's standing, cradling the phone and packing her handbag. Across her desk, SUSAN (30s) reviews the guest list for the hospital event. \nELLEN (INTO PHONE) And it, it transformed them, seriously. \nMAE (SOFTLY) There's a Detective Bryer in the lobby. \nEllen holds up her hand, buying a moment. \nELLEN (INTO PHONE) And thanks again for your generosity. Alright, we'll see you then. Thank you, bye. (hanging up, to Mae) I'm sorry, what? \nMAE Detective Bryer. \nELLEN What does he want? \nMAE I don't know. \nEllen smooths her suit and puts her bag over her shoulder. \nJIMMY Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd, what happens now? \nSYD We meet with Earl and we go from there. I understand that right now they don't have enough to charge you with anything. \nROBERT Your under suspicion. \nJIMMY Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black! \nROBERT I am aware of that. \nJIMMY And what exactly would you like me to do about it? \nSYD (BUZZING the driver) Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you wanna go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation, so this is where I get out... \nEXT. STREET \nSyd steps out of the limo and watches as it rolls away up Tenth Avenue. \nINT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nJIMMY Why couldn't you have just stayed? \nROBERT I couldn't. \nJIMMY Why not? \nROBERT Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt. \nJIMMY Somebody was hurt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55. \nROBERT Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me. \nJimmy chews on this, dissatisfied. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something. \nJimmy slides over to sit next to Robert. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you. \nJIMMY Yeah. \nROBERT Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. (handing Jimmy the folder) So I've been able to set up a situation for you. \nJIMMY What's that? \nROBERT It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that. \nJIMMY (ASTOUNDED) Are you serious? You think money's gonna fix this? \nROBERT What else is there? \nJimmy laughs, then rises and knocks on the limo's partition. \nJIMMY (to the driver) Yo, yo man, pull over. \nROBERT (stares at him) What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56. \nJIMMY I look like a fucking snitch to you? \nROBERT I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you? \nJimmy laughs in disgust, begins to open the door. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you. \nJimmy grabs the document and gets out. Robert stares ahead into space. His CELLPHONE RINGS. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (AGITATED) What? \nCINDY (O.S.) I've got Chris Vogler from Fremaut accounting, you asked me to interrupt you. \nROBERT Yeah, put him through... (he hears Chris come on) Chris... \nBRYER Nah, they're all dead. \nFLORES (READING) So he's a good student, magnet school, whatever. (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 59. FLORES (CONT'D) Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession. Even so, how come he got probation? \nBRYER Well, he had an excellent lawyer. \nFLORES (READING CLOSER) How the fuck does this kid afford Felder and Chausse...? \nMills drops another FOLDER on the table. \nBRYER We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years? \nFLORES (READING) Miller Capital? (READING) He was the fucking driver?! (LAUGHS) Wow, this guy's good... \nHe puts down the sheet and leans back. \nFLORES (CONT'D) Where are you at with the kid? \nMILLS So far he won't budge. \nFLORES Well he's a convicted felon. Go get a warrant, put him in front of a grand jury. Let's see how long he holds out when he realizes he's looking at ten years off the prior. \nINT. FREMAUT - VOGLER'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER \nRobert storms the hallway, passing a waiting SECRETARY. \nSECRETARY I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs, he's on a call right now, and he said... \nHe brushes past her. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 60. \nSECRETARY (CONT'D) Mr. Miller! \nINT. VOGLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nRobert enters, locking the door behind him. Chris bolts up. \nCHRIS What the fuck...? \nROBERT Tell me what is going on. \nRobert comes closer. Chris is freaking out. \nCHRIS I can't. \nROBERT Tell me what's going on! \nCHRIS I can't! \nRobert GRABS Chris by the collar. \nROBERT Why not?! \nCHRIS It's not me! \nROBERT What do you mean it's not...? \nCHRIS THE AUDIT PASSED! \nROBERT (slackening his grip) The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed? \nCHRIS It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done. \nROBERT (BEYOND CONFUSED) Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61. \nCHRIS Because they asked me to hold it. \nROBERT They? Who's they? (thrashes him again) Who is they?! \nCHRIS Mayfield. \nROBERT (TO HIMSELF) Mayfield? \nRobert thinks... and starts LAUGHING. Chris looks at him strangely as he walks out. \nBROOKE Then why didn't you tell me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 64. \nROBERT Because I hoped you wouldn't. \nBROOKE Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now -- or I am done. \nROBERT I made a bad bet. \nBROOKE No, you committed fraud. \nROBERT That's a dangerous word, Brooke. \nBROOKE What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trusted you? That you lied? That you lied right to my face? Why? \nROBERT Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing. \nBROOKE How. How does that happen? \nROBERT You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said \"Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months.\" So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune. (beat, then real fast) (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65. ROBERT (CONT'D) But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY! FOREVER! IT IS GOD!... \nBROOKE Until... \nROBERT Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will. (BEAT) It's like a plane crash. It just happens. \nBROOKE Well it does not just happen. \nROBERT Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you... \nBROOKE Thanks to you, we may all be arrested. \nROBERT Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66. \nBROOKE Everybody wins? \nROBERT Yes. \nBROOKE If the company sells. If I lie for you. \nROBERT You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it. \nBROOKE (INCREDULOUS) I'm the Chief Investment Officer of this company. What do you think they'll say at the depositions? \"She didn't know?\" They'll take away my brokerage license- failure to supervise you -- my name in every paper and blog while I visit your ass in jail! \nROBERT What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt? \nBROOKE What... gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions? \nROBERT (STANDS) Because it's my job! \nBROOKE No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And I am your partner. \nROBERT You are not my partner! You work for me! (off her bewildered stare) That's right. You work for me! (SITS) Everybody works for me! \nThey pass a moment in silence. He looks at her destroyed expression. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down. \nShe sits. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (DEEP SIGH) There's something I wanna tell you. And whatever you decide I won't blame you... (she turns to look at him) I'm on my own path. It's up to you to move with it or against it. But I'm the patriarch; that's my role. And I have to play it. \nBROOKE (stares a while, then) For a moment I thought you were gonna say you were sorry. \nShe walks off. \nHold on Robert alone in the park. \nROBERT (SOTTO) I'm sorry. \nEXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nJimmy approaches the building. Bryer exits his sedan and walks over to him. \nJIMMY (SEEING BRYER) Oh, man, what? \nINT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nIt's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room. \nSYD He's gonna walk. \nROBERT You're certain? \nSYD Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be? A phone call doesn't make him a liar. (off Robert's nod) But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 71. \nROBERT (BEAT) He's not like us. \nSYD Is that a good thing? \nROBERT (laughs, plays with his SCOTCH GLASS) I don't know. \nRobert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE. \nSYD How's Ellen? \nROBERT She's good. Fine. (stops packing, looks up) Why? \nSYD I heard something... \nROBERT Yes...? \nSYD She met with Gil Deuchman. \nROBERT The estate lawyer? \nSYD Yeah. Has she mentioned anything? \nROBERT Not to me. \nThey sit in silence. \nINT. CRIMINAL COURT - FELONY INDICTMENTS - THE NEXT DAY \nWe see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next to Jimmy. \nDEFERLITO That was the early morning of April 11th. \nJIMMY Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72. \nDEFERLITO You received a phone call? \nJIMMY Yes. \nDEFERLITO Who called you? \nJimmy stares at DeFerlito. \nJIMMY It was a wrong number. \nDEFERLITO That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant? \nJIMMY No. \nDEFERLITO You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this court? \nJIMMY I'm not lying. \nDeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK. \nDEFERLITO I'm going to introduce into evidence People's A. This is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the photograph, would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner? \nJimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief. \nJIMMY This is crazy. \nEARL (whispers in Jimmy's ear) You're gonna have to answer that. \nDEFERLITO Mr. Grant, please answer the question. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 73. \nJIMMY That picture was some bullshit... \nEARL ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's going on? \nBRYER Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one. \nEarl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS. \nBRYER (CONT'D) Last chance. \nJimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off. \nEARL (rising, to Jimmy) Wait here. \nBryer and Earl enter the courtroom. \nCLOSE ON: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 76. \nJimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building. \nINT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY \nAbout thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET. \nRobert enters and spots some of the people from the art opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at him quietly, then quickly looks away. \nThere is no organized service; people are just walking up to the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and holds a moment at the casket. \nThe gallery assistant comes up behind him. \nASSISTANT Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine. \nA beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert approaches as she stands. \nROBERT I am so, so sorry. \nSANDRINE (nods, then) I just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter. \nROBERT (shaking his head softly) No... \nSANDRINE You believed in her, and you gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy. \nROBERT It's just... (EMOTIONAL) not fair, is it? \nSandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) This shouldn't have happened. \nHold on Sandrine's face, in pain. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 77. \nINT. ROBERT'S MANSION - GYM - MORNING \nClose on Brooke's legs, running on a treadmill. Ellen exercises on a STAIRMASTER next to her. We hear the sound of Ellen's small talk begin to fade in. \nELLEN ...she's rail thin. She's a blond. I would not have known who she was if she hadn't come up and introduced herself to me. She looked totally different... and... (notices Brooke increasing the machine's resistance) You're going straight to level six don't you think you better pace yourself a little bit? \nBROOKE (fakes a smile) I'm good. I wanna run. \nELLEN Everything okay with you and Tom? \nBROOKE We're fine. \nELLEN Are you worried about the deal closing? \nBROOKE (STRIDES FASTER) No. \nELLEN You want me to guess? (NO RESPONSE) Brookie, come on, don't be silly, tell me what's... \nBrooke stabs \"Stop\" on the machine, quickly cooling down. \nBROOKE (heading to pick up her BELONGINGS) You know, I can't stay for breakfast I have to just... I have to get in to work, I don't know what I was thinking. \nELLEN (A BEAT) Did you uh, finish the deal with the hospital? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 78. \nROBERT Five-fifty. \nMAYFIELD Four-fifty. \nROBERT Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no? (SHORT BEAT) And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can. \nMAYFIELD (extending his hand) It's a deal. \nROBERT (GRASPING IT) One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her. \nMAYFIELD Alright. \nROBERT And you're gonna have to make my son a VP. \nMAYFIELD (LAUGHS) Robert... \nROBERT No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no? \nMAYFIELD Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82. \nRobert pulls out a pen and jots down the deal points they have just outlined onto the paper menu. \nMAYFIELD (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nROBERT I'm writing the deal. \nMAYFIELD Are you serious? \nROBERT (ripping off the tablecloth) I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. \nMayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu. Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket. \nMAYFIELD I'll send over a draft of the press release. \nAs Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib. \nMAYFIELD (CONT'D) Are you all right? \nROBERT I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...? \nMAYFIELD Six hundred. And you would've taken...? \nROBERT Four seventy-five. \nMAYFIELD So we made a good deal. \nROBERT (as he heads away) Yeah. \nRobert turns back to the table. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. \nMayfield shrugs and returns to his paper. Robert walks out of the restaurant, beaming. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83. \nINT. MILLER CAPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nPeter, Gavin, and many of the various STAFF we have met are gathered around a long conference table. Robert stands at the front of the room. \nROBERT ...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions? \nPETER (JOVIAL) Will we get new business cards? \nROBERT (NODS) Yes, everyone but you. (HEADING OUT) Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happen \nThey all clap as Gavin and Robert exit the room. \nGAVIN (SOTTO) So how'd you make Mayfield come around? \nROBERT I met his price. I just took it out of your share. \nGAVIN Robert? \nROBERT Yeah. \nJIMMY Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man! Earl's telling me it could be ten years? Ten fucking years! How much are ten years worth, Robert? (off his silence) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86. \nJIMMY (CONT'D) Look man, I told you, I ain't no fuckin snitch, but this is bad. This is real bad. Reina and I got a whole plan we're about to make happen next week! \nROBERT (as Jimmy sits) What plan? \nJIMMY I got money saved up; I'm buying a business. \nROBERT What business? \nJIMMY I bought an Applebee's. \nROBERT What's an Applebee's? \nJIMMY It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's a chain restaurant. \nROBERT You bought an Applebee's in Virginia? \nJIMMY Is this really what you came here to talk about? What are you gonna do? \nROBERT (SITS) It's not really that simple, Jimmy. I'm in a situation now. \nJIMMY What situation? \nROBERT I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that? \nJIMMY Yeah but what about me? What about my situation? (off his silence) They showed me pictures, man; that's fucked up what you did. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87. \nROBERT (SOTTO) It was an accident. \nJIMMY And yeah, I know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but -- you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Now you know I care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up. (BEAT) Why are you putting me in this position, man? Why are you putting me in this situation? \nROBERT (LEANS FORWARD) Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer? \nJIMMY Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose. \nROBERT (nods, stands) Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. \nJimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the living room as he approaches the door and exits. \nREINA You gotta give him up. \nJIMMY You said take the money. \nREINA That was to keep quiet, not to go away. (BEAT) What's he offering you now? \nJIMMY What can he offer me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88. \nReina crosses to Jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry, then wipes away his tears. \nINT. ROBERT'S LIMO - NIGHT \nThe limo drives down Fifth Avenue. Robert's on the phone. \nSYD (O.S.) We went to the toll authority. They said they gave the tape to the cops. I've requested our investigator go examine it at the evidence room, but honestly what's the point? \nROBERT He says he didn't take the toll. \nSYD (O.S.) And you believe him? \nROBERT (after a beat) Does Standard have clawback? \nSYD (O.S.) What? What do you mean? \nROBERT Let's just say I decide to go in... \nSYD (O.S.) Have you lost your mind? \nROBERT No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal? \nSYD (O.S.) (after a beat) No, what's done is done. There's no intent to defraud. You haven't warranted any behavior. So it's just money. \nROBERT Four years, you think? \nSyd lays the PHOTOGRAPH we saw earlier of Jimmy's car going through the toll onto the counter next to the one Earl has just placed there. \nRobert picks up a high-end MAGNIFYING GLASS and leans over to look at the two photos. \nCLOSE-UP: \nHe scans the photograph of Earl's car, moving slowly through it left-to-right. \nThen he scans the photograph of Jimmy's car, passing left-to- right until -- \nHe passes back by the license plate area and stops -- \nThe lines around the license plate of Jimmy's car are all slightly-pixelated. \nHe switches back to the plate on Earl's car. The lines are fine. Back to Jimmy's. Pixelated. \nRobert puts down the magnifier, straightens, and smiles. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Son of a bitch. \nEarl's dark laugh cackles across the soundtrack as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY \nEarl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS. \nRITTENBAND Well they look a little different to me, too... Is there a reason you haven't allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to conduct his own analysis? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92. \nDEFERLITO We've had some issues regarding chain-of-custody... \nRITTENBAND ...You don't have them anymore. You're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour. \nDEFERLITO I'm afraid that's not possible. \nA beat. \nRITTENBAND Where's the tape? (ANOTHER BEAT) Am I not speaking loud enough? \nBRYER Your honor... \nRITTENBAND Yes? \nDEFERLITO It seems there's been... \nRITTENBAND ...Let him tell me. \nBRYER We don't know where it is. \nRITTENBAND Come again? \nBRYER It's not in the evidence locker. \nRITTENBAND Where is it? \nBRYER We don't know. \nSilence. Rittenband leans forward. \nRITTENBAND I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape? \nBRYER (after a beat) We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93. \nRITTENBAND Hmmm... In light of these developments, and I would think you should be very happy to hear this, with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going to offer Mr. Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment. \nDEFERLITO I don't feel comfortable with that, your honor. \nRITTENBAND Further I'm going to put all charges against Mr. Grant under seal. (Bryer starts heading to THE DOOR) This case is dismissed with prejudice and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON, Detective. (Bryer stops.) If you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him, but Mr. Grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter. This is over. Do I have your understanding? \nEARL Thank you. \nDeferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer. \nROBERT Did she tell you that? \nELLEN No. She didn't have to. \nROBERT Yeah, I explained to Brooke that... \nELLEN ...you explained, did you? (A BEAT) Did you tell her everything? \nROBERT Yes. \nELLEN Everything? (off his silence) Lift up your shirt. \nROBERT What? \nELLEN Lift up -- your shirt. \nHe doesn't move. \nShe stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib. \nHe winces a little, then looks down at the floor. \nIt's the Post article chronicling Julie's death. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 97. \nELLEN (CONT'D) Did you tell her about that? \nROBERT (LONG BEAT) Ellen I don't know what you think you know... \nELLEN Oh, don't treat me like an idiot. You've been sneaking off to see her for months. You don't think I know that? \nROBERT What do you think you know? \nELLEN I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your- gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. I cared about our home. And now you have brought this to our door. \nROBERT I did what was necessary. \nELLEN No you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests. \nROBERT For my interests? \nELLEN Yes. \nROBERT Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business. \nELLEN This isn't about your business, this is our life! Where do you think we're going tonight? Why do you think I've even tolerated this for so long? \nROBERT (he's had enough) What you've tolerated? Wow! \nELLEN I'm glad you find that funny. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98. \nROBERT What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them? \nELLEN I didn't ask you because I didn't want you to lie. \nROBERT (WALKS OFF) It's cause you didn't want to give `em up! \nELLEN But I thought that we had an understanding. And you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it. \nROBERT No, I kept her out. \nELLEN When you made Brooke complicit-- when you risked her future-- and I'm done. \nShe opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides them toward him. \nROBERT What is this? \nELLEN Read it. \nHe crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the title: \"SEPARATION AGREEMENT\" and hold on him reading for a few brief seconds until... \nROBERT \"All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?\" Did you really expect me to sign this thing? \nELLEN You're not following.

Why? \nROBERT (O.S.) I'm a child of the 50's. My father welded steel for the Navy. And my mother worked at the VA. \nINT. ROBERT'S MANSION - DAY \nAs the conversation continues we see: \n1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany table. \n2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting room. \n3. An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long winding staircase. \nROBERT They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen. \nMARIA Is that what's happening now? \nROBERT When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things: (extending his fingers one- BY-ONE) \nINT. ROBERT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAnd right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER (60) -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a CAMERA CREW, mid-interview. ELLEN MILLER (58) watches on a nearby MONITOR. \nROBERT M-O-N-E-Y. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 2. \nMARIA (LAUGHING) Was this freshman econ? \nROBERT This was fifth-grade econ. (smiles, off her laugh) But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst. \nCUT TO BLACK. \n\"ARBITRAGE\" \nCLOUDS GIVE WAY TO A: \nFALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH \nAnd we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine, as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing... \nINT. FALCON \nA sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas. \nAt the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed tones, pouring over a sea of red-inked paper. \nIn the galley, GAVIN BRIAR (42), pours a coffee. He brings it BACK TO \nROBERT \nwho sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit, scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT DOCUMENTS. His effortless slouch, silver hair, and all- commanding mannerisms make one thing clear: Robert's our man. \nGAVIN (handing him the coffee) Here you go... \nRobert sips it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3. \nGAVIN (CONT'D) (SITTING) You're disappointed. \nROBERT Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about? \nGAVIN It makes no sense. \nROBERT That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there? \n", "test1_true": "ROBERT And did we sign? \nGAVIN No. \nROBERT No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting... And where was Mayfield? What was this \"emergency\"? What was that about? \nGAVIN (after a beat) Did you speak to the auditors? \nROBERT Why? \nGAVIN What if... we don't don't close this week... \nWe push into a close-up of Robert, as he contemplates what this would mean. \nEXT. WESTCHESTER AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER \nThe ROAR of thirty million dollars landing near tall grass. \nEXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS \nRobert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac, followed by Gavin and the aides. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 4. \nThey approach a waiting MERCEDES MAYBACH. The aides hand file BOXES and BRIEFCASES to the Hispanic driver, RAMON, who loads them into the trunk. \nEXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nThe blur of city lights as the limo passes over bridges and towards the city and Park Avenue and finally approaches \nEXT. GRACIE SQUARE - ROBERT'S MANSION - CONTINUOUS \nAn enormous turn-of-the-last-century Stanford-White-designed red-brick MANSION- two already-giant townhouses combined. Robert and Gavin exit the limo and head inside. \nINT. ROBERT'S MANSION - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS \nIt's our first glimpse of Robert's home, and it doesn't disappoint. It's an 1850's Tudor given a full once-over, maintaining period details but updated with a Modernist flair. It actually works. \nA SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters, handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm. \nWe HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN laughing. Hold on Robert's face- some mixture of excitement and anticipation. \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA party in progress, dinner already served. \nSeated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and THREE GRANDCHILDREN. \nEllen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert. \nELLEN (LIGHTING UP) Look, your grandfather's here! \nThe kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the table, hugging them all. \nROBERT Hi, guys! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5. \nGRANDCHILD Hi Grampi! What did you bring us? \nRobert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other. \nThey embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast to his behavior towards their kids. \nBROOKE It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs. You're spoiling them rotten. \nROBERT (GRINNING) It's my job! It's my job. You guys turned out fine! \nBROOKE (HALF-SMILE) Debatable. \nROBERT (to Peter, as they hug and SMILE) How you doin', son? Good? \nRobert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS. \nELLEN We had to eat. The kids were starving... \n", "test2_input": "ROBERT (slight beat, then DEFINITIVE) I will be there. \nShe stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (LAUGHING) Oh wow, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11. \nJULIE I made this for you. \nROBERT You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very... \nShe reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her hand and... SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE. \nThe tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love. \nINT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY \nRobert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate 18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive glass conference room. They arrive at \nINT. GREENBERG'S OFFICE - SAME \nThe receptionist escorts Robert in. Standing to greet him is JEFFREY GREENBERG (53), handsome and charming. \nJEFFREY Thank you, Diane. \nShe exits. Robert sits. A moment of silence. \nJEFFREY (CONT'D) So? \nROBERT I'm here. \nJEFFREY Guess what's not? \nROBERT Jeffrey, I told you, I'm... \nJEFFREY \"...working on it,\" yeah. Well, while you're doing that, lemme tell you what's not working... \nROBERT (LEANING FORWARD) Jeffrey... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12. \nJEFFREY (LOUDER) ...what's not working is my four hundred twelve million dollars that's sitting in your account so you can pass your audit, the four hundred twelve million that you needed, you said, for two weeks, and which has been languishing now for (looks down at paper) thirty-two days, while it could be elsewhere invested, earning an actual return, instead of couching the absurd lie that you're spinning. \nROBERT What do you want me to say? \nJEFFREY That you're gonna get a signature from Mayfield, and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly, say... by tomorrow? \nA beat. \nROBERT I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly. \nJEFFREY When? \nROBERT As soon as they sign the contract. \nJEFFREY (BEAT) You know, I'm not the one with the liability, pal. I just made a loan. You're looking at jail for a thousand years for fraudulent conveyance and... \nROBERT ...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!... \nJEFFREY I didn't get you into this mess! \nROBERT You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13. \nJEFFREY ...remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine? What did I tell you? \nROBERT (stands, heading to door WITH COAT) Are we done here? I think we're done here. \nJeffrey stares at him contemplatively for a moment, then appears to reach some sort of conclusion. \nJEFFREY (MATTER-OF-FACT) Friday morning I take my money back. \nROBERT (SHAKES HEAD) You can't do that... \nJEFFREY ...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill with one-day call rights... \nROBERT ...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey.

Goldenrod - 4.17.11 14. \nCNBC ANNOUNCER The DOW continues its uptick this morning on new housing starts to rise 132 points. Asian markets fared less well, especially in Russia, where further nationalization plans caused foreign investment to sputter, leading to various... \nClose on Robert, trying hard to contain his building rage. \nHis phone VIBRATES a TEXT, from Julie: \"See you at 8!\" He stares at it, breathes in deeply. \nThe CARPHONE rings: \"Gavin.\" \nROBERT (BARKS) What? \nGAVIN (O.S.) Seven-thirty tonight at the Four Seasons. We'll get it straight with Mayfield then. \nROBERT (calming a little) Good. Very good. \nINT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER \nEllen stands tying Robert's TIE in front of a dressing mirror. \nROBERT Is this too blue? \nELLEN It's the third one you've tried. \nShe finishes tying it.

Just follow the plan. \nROBERT What plan is that? \nELLEN \"Confidence equals contract.\" \nROBERT (LAUGHS) You sound like a fortune cookie. \nELLEN They're your words, actually. \nROBERT Then you married an idiot. \nELLEN (BEAT) Okay, but I was thinking, idiot, that, after the deal is done, which it definitely will be, why don't we just take off? Pete's in the best place he's ever been, your daughter is always as brilliant, right? So, I wanna have some fun. I wanna have fun with you! \nHe stares at her softly, but stays silent. \nELLEN (CONT'D) Let's go to Ravello- the house there.

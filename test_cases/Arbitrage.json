{"test1_input": "He scans the party further. No Julie. \nROBERT Where's Julie? \nASSISTANT She's in the back. \nINT. GALLERY - OFFICE IN BACK - CONTINUOUS \nWe pick up on Julie bumping two rails of COCAINE. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 21. \nShe's dressed in a burnt red, form-fitting Lanvin dress, hair coiffed, perfectly made-up-- if we didn't suspect anything, we'd think she was the precise image of New York art-world success. \nJulie pulls her hair back and straightens, enters the main gallery... \nINT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS \nWhere she quickly sees Robert searching for her through the crowd. She stops dead, considers going back into the office... \nBut she stands firm. Robert finds her eyes. He stares at her. \nShe stares back, with a simple look that says, plainly: \"Go away.\" \nShe turns and heads off to talk to a group of PATRONS, including the painter VICTOR. One of the group is a DASHING YOUNG MAN- is he flirting with her? \nRobert approaches, staring at the young man, then at Julie. She's all smiles, but she doesn't immediately introduce him. He stands there, until-- \nROBERT Hey, Julie. \nJULIE Oh... (to the group) This is Robert Miller, one of our collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava, who is a talented young artist. \nRobert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries, especially kind to young AVA (15). \nROBERT Oh, really? Painter? \nAVA Drawings. \nJulie begins to walk off, disappearing into the crowd. \nROBERT (LOOKING AROUND) Yeah, that's great. (as he notices Julie leave, to the group) (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22. ROBERT (CONT'D) I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second. \nRobert trails Julie, moving up to her quickly. He reaches out to touch her and she spins towards him violent, definitive. \nROBERT (CONT'D) What? Why are you doing this? \nJULIE Go -- away. \nJulie heads back to the buyers. \nDismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out towards the entry desk. \nHe approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces. \nROBERT I will take (POINTING) those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall. \nASSISTANT (pointing to list) Right there, number seven. \nROBERT Don't tell her it was me. (off her nod) I mean it. \nASSISTANT You got it. \nRobert walks out and hails his driver. \nINT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER \nOff Robert, in bed with Ellen who is asleep. He gets up and stumbles to the bathroom, puts on a robe. \nINT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR \nHe approaches the basement level carrying a folder of papers... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 23. \nINT. SERVICE KITCHEN \nAnd sits at the counter, staring at a REPORT of some kind. He refills a glass of SCOTCH, downs it. \n", "test1_true": "Julie's a touch worn from the evening, but she's still composed. She sits with five guests including her gallery assistant, the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN from earlier, TWO WOMEN, and TWO GUYS who look like painters. One does a line of COCAINE off a \"Fantom\" magazine. \nPAINTER ...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it a \"State of Contemporism...\" \nJulie's phone RINGS. She looks at the Caller-ID, (which shows her home line calling) confused. \nJULIE (INTO PHONE) Who's this? \nROBERT (O.S.) It's me. \nJULIE What do you want? \nROBERT (O.S.) I'm here. \nJULIE Where? \nINT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM \nRobert watches Julie through a crack in the doorway. He's on her CORDLESS phone. We INTERCUT. \nROBERT I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here? \nJULIE Are you serious? \nROBERT Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24. \nJULIE (LOOKING) I see you. \nROBERT Okay, so I'm serious. \nShe hangs up and begins to clear out the guests. \nRobert sits, unbuttoning his collar. \nINT. JULIE'S LOFT - LIVING ROOM \nThe guests finally leave. Julie heads to the bedroom... \nINT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM \nAnd finds Robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable. \nJULIE You just come in and out whenever you want? \nROBERT I thought we should talk... \nJULIE (laughs, then in a rage) One damn night in a month I told you was important to me, et tu es meme pas capable d'etre la... \nROBERT ...I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations... \nJULIE ...I don't want to hear about your obligations. If you cared -- YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE! \nROBERT I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now. \nJULIE No, no, no. You're here when it's convenient for you to be here. C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means YOU FUCKING SHOW UP! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 25. \nShe walks off into the \nLIVING ROOM \nRobert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she downs a red wine. \nROBERT I'm sorry. \nJULIE Why did you buy those paintings? \nROBERT Because I liked them. \nHer face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and her anger. \nJULIE Okay, thank you for helping me get started.

PARK BENCH - DAY \nSYD FELDER (64) sits next to Robert. \nSYD Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter. \nROBERT And such a person... \nSYD ...would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction. (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 35. SYD (CONT'D) But that's only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime. \nROBERT Fingerprints, DNA? \nSYD Very hard to collect after an explosion. The real world's different from television. \nROBERT What about cell phone records? \nSYD Did this person make any calls from the area? \nROBERT Not from a cell phone, no. \nSYD Then they won't be able to place him there. \nROBERT What would you advise such a person to do? \nSYD To confess immediately. \nROBERT Failing which? \nSYD To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. But let me tell you something, and I'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him. \nRobert stands. \nSYD (CONT'D) (FRENCH ACCENT) Robert... \nROBERT Yeah. \nSYD They're going to come to you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36. \nROBERT I know. \nSYD An accident's not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now we can probably work it out. \nROBERT You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses? \nSYD Nothing good. \nROBERT And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years? \nSYD I did. \nROBERT (laughs in pain) What choice do I really have? \nEXT. FREMAUT ACCOUNTING HEADQUARTERS - LATER \nWe follow CHRIS VOGLER (52) through the busy lobby out to the street. He crosses Park Avenue and gets into Robert's limo. \nINT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nRobert opens the Percocet bottle, downs four PILLS. \nChris enters and sits. Robert mimes a question. \nCHRIS You're aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds. \nROBERT Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. (ZEROING IN) You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37. \nCHRIS Well, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets. \nROBERT No. Absolutely not. That's impossible. \n", "test2_true": "ROBERT The audit's cleared? \nCHRIS The report will be issued today. Actually, I'm calling it my \"swan song.\" \nROBERT You're leaving? \nCHRIS Yeah, on Friday, it's a five-year clock. \nROBERT (EXACERBATED) And why? \nCHRIS Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're doing. But honestly, there's nothing left to worry about. It's -- great. \nThe carphone RINGS. \nROBERT (TO CHRIS) Get out. \nChris exits. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) What? \nGAVIN (O.S.) How was it? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 38. \nROBERT What? \nGAVIN (O.S.) The show. \nROBERT What the fuck are you talking about? \nGAVIN (O.S.) The show, Julie's show? \nROBERT Oh... Oh, it was fine... \nA beat as Robert rubs his eyes. \nGAVIN (O.S.) Mayfield's here. \nROBERT He's here? Where? \nGAVIN (O.S.) Sherry Netherland. Checked in about an hour ago. \nROBERT He called? \nGAVIN (O.S.) No, Brooke has a friend on the executive committee who said he's taking meetings in his room... (NO RESPONSE) Maybe he's settling in. \nROBERT You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot? \nGAVIN (O.S.) (BEAT) I spoke to legal. They said Standard will sign once they get the audit report. \nROBERT That's being issued now. \nGAVIN (O.S.) How do you know that? \nROBERT Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39. \nGAVIN (O.S.) How am I...? \nROBERT Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU PLEASE...? THANK YOU! \nHe hangs up and exhales deeply. \nINT. MILLER CAPITAL - LATER \nWe track through a Spartanly-furnished trading office: high- design with lacquer and muted mahogany. PEOPLE at COMPUTERS make phone calls. CLOCKS show different time zones. \nINT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nBrooke sits across from Robert.

Motherfucker, I'm Black! \nROBERT I am aware of that. \nJIMMY And what exactly would you like me to do about it? \nSYD (BUZZING the driver) Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you wanna go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation, so this is where I get out... \nEXT. STREET \nSyd steps out of the limo and watches as it rolls away up Tenth Avenue. \nINT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nJIMMY Why couldn't you have just stayed? \nROBERT I couldn't. \nJIMMY Why not? \nROBERT Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt. \nJIMMY Somebody was hurt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55. \nROBERT Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me. \nJimmy chews on this, dissatisfied. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something. \nJimmy slides over to sit next to Robert. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you. \nJIMMY Yeah. \nROBERT Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that. (handing Jimmy the folder) So I've been able to set up a situation for you. \nJIMMY What's that? \nROBERT It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that. \nJIMMY (ASTOUNDED) Are you serious? You think money's gonna fix this? \nROBERT What else is there? \nJimmy laughs, then rises and knocks on the limo's partition. \nJIMMY (to the driver) Yo, yo man, pull over. \nROBERT (stares at him) What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56. \nJIMMY I look like a fucking snitch to you? \nROBERT I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you? \nJimmy laughs in disgust, begins to open the door. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you. \nJimmy grabs the document and gets out. Robert stares ahead into space. His CELLPHONE RINGS. \nROBERT (CONT'D) (AGITATED) What? \nCINDY (O.S.) I've got Chris Vogler from Fremaut accounting, you asked me to interrupt you. \nROBERT Yeah, put him through...

I've gotta go. \nROBERT Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57. \nINT. MILLER CAPITAL - ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - DAY \nBrooke sits alone in the accountant's office we saw earlier. She reviews SPREADSHEETS on his COMPUTER and compares them with PRINTOUTS from a FILE CABINET that she has broken open. \nNumbers from the screen reflect across her reading glasses as she stares in disbelief. She DIALS a number. \nBROOKE (INTO PHONE) Peter...? I'm looking at some statements right now... How much did you book last quarter?... No, I'm not... No, Peter, I'm really just asking you... \nShe's looking at an entry on the screen: \n\"Miller Capital Management - PETER MILLER GROUP - $68.3MM\" \nBROOKE (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) Thirty-five million. For your entire group, right?... It wasn't sixty-eight?... Of course it's a big number... No, I'm not... Oh, Peter I'll talk to you later . \nBrooke taps the keyboard and a PRINTER spits out pages. Suddenly, BEN (40s), an accountant we saw earlier, appears. \nBEN What are you doing in my office? \nBrooke bolts up, startled. She collects the papers she printed. \nBEN (CONT'D) Hello? \nBROOKE (holding up pages) Can you explain these? \nBEN Explain what? \nBROOKE Old Hill. All the numbers you've falsified. \nBEN (BEAT) You don't know what you're saying. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 58. \nBrooke nods, heads to the door. Ben put his arm on her shoulder to stop her. \nBROOKE Get out of my way. \nBEN Brooke... \nBROOKE You're hurting my arm. \nBEN Can't you just leave it alone? \nShe stares at him. He drops his arm. She exits and turns. \nBROOKE You're fired, Ben. \nBEN You can't fire me. \nBROOKE I just did. \nBEN Who do you think asked me to make those changes? \nShe stares, then approaches him. \nBROOKE 83 You tell me. 83 \nINT.

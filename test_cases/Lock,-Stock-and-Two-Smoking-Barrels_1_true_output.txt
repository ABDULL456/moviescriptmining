It doesn't look . . . 
HATCHET (interrupts) I will. 
EDDY You will what? 
HATCHET I will loan you the money. 
Silence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a second, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its long silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's cards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this worrying news. 
EDDY I think I would rather just turn them over. 
HATCHET I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow. 
EDDY I need two hundred and fifty grand. 
HATCHET No, you need five hundred grand to see me. 
Ed's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat. 
EDDY That's if I want to see you. 
HATCHET Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha. 
The pause is painful. 
CRUOPIER You can still fold. 
EDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice. Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier pleads with Eddy. 
EDDY I'll see ya. 
HATCHET For half a million? 
EDDY Unless you are going to accept twenty quid. 
HATCHET And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold. (Pause) OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK? 
These last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He is committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet turns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY ushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; then the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a loud pause . . . 
CROUPIER Is that it? 
* Cut from completed film. 
FRAZER He was bluffing! 
Hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant. 
HATCHET Let's see your fucking cards. 
Nobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY expectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They contract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever. 
FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY 
EDDY (voice-over) I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million. 
RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY 
Harry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear. 
HATCHET I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give you all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?

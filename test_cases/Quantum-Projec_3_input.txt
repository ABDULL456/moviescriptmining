CLICK - THE PICTURE SHARPENS 
on a man and a woman, MAKING LOVE on a big brocade couch.  Their bodies rock in unison, faces unseen. 
SINGER'S VOICE (CONT'D) My aim is true-ooooh. 
The field collapses closed upon: 
19     EXT.  THE FREEWAY ACCIDENT SITE - DAY                   19 
A woman from the Durango is approaching, as Will, back on the phone, argues with his boss. 
WILL I'll be there, Trent.  Yes.  20 minutes -- 
Click.  Will reddens, sees the sunglassed face of the woman, looking past him and over to PENTCHO, signing the tow truck papers.  The battered front end of his Beetle CRANKS upward. 
WILL (CONT'D) Son-of-a-bitch.  As if it was my fault I got rear-ended by... 
The woman stares, curiously, at Pentcho. 
WILL (CONT'D) ...some schmuck dreaming about God.  Mia? 
She doesn't hear him.  Takes off her sunglasses, slowly.  Wide-set brown eyes.

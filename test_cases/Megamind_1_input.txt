ROXANNE It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen. 
The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time. 
"JOHN CUSACK" (almost to himself) I think I finally understand...The only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that's impossible, create one of equal structure. That's it! 
ROXANNE What? 
John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's heard every word. 
"JOHN CUSACK" Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing for a part...where I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times. 
In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair. 
"JOHN CUSACK" I have to go right now, but I'd really like to see you again - if that's alright. 
Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the craziness of the situation. 
ROXANNE I'd love that. 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY 
Master storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein playing darts with the original Mona Lisa. 
EINSTEIN Got her nose! 
MASTER MIND I've got it! 
Everyone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their master has returned. 
MASTER MIND I've got it! 
MASTER MIND It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero. 
EINSTEIN Yeah, maybe that's not such hot idea... 
MASTER MIND (ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY 
The lab is slick, white and ultra modern. 
Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly. 
MASTER MIND Prepare the subject. 
He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a huge vat dangles precariously. 
Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and Einstein. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Plato, pour the toxic waste. 
Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Drainage. 
The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo- soaked Severs. 
Master Mind looks into the pit. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Well, Severs? 
SEVERS I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely - 
BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch. Finally... 
MASTER MIND Okay then. 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY 
Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally. 
MASTER MIND And this one? 
PLATO We attached gills to him. He can breath under water. 
MASTER MIND Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? 
PLATO Well...no. 
MASTER MIND Can he fly? 
PLATO No. 
MASTER MIND Resilient to weapons fire? 
PLATO No. 
MASTER MIND He just breathes under water, then.

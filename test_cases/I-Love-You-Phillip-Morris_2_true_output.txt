STEVEN (CONT'D) Merry Christmas! 
32   INT. DEBBIE'S HOUSTON HOME, 1992 - MORNING - CONTINUOUS        32 
Debbie, on the phone, is INTERCUT. Stephanie is in the background, opening gifts at the base of their tree. 
DEBBIE Merry Christmas. 
STEVEN Hi Debbie! "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages     5-23-08   21. 
DEBBIE How's Jimmy? 
STEVEN Good.   Did you get the gifts? 
DEBBIE Well that's why I'm calling... 
CUT WIDE to reveal a GIFT BOX FILLED WITH STACKS OF CASH. 
STEVEN You're welcome! 
DEBBIE I can't keep this. 
STEVEN Why not? 
DEBBIE Well... it's not Christian. 
STEVEN Not Christian? Why's that? 
DEBBIE This is not what the Lord wants. 
STEVEN So you're saying you know what the Lord wants? 
DEBBIE No. I would never say that. Why? Do you think this is what he wants? 
STEVEN It's the leap of faith Deb.       It's the not knowing that's the answer. 
This gets traction with Debbie. 
DEBBIE Well I never thought about it that way... 
STEPHANIE (O.S.) Mommy look! 
CUT TO REVEAL Stephanie has her own BOX OF CASH. 
DEBBIE Steven! "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages    5-23-08   22. 
And as Steven listens to Debbie's rant-- 
STEVEN (V.O.) Of course, Jimmy and Debbie had no idea what I was up to. For the time being, at least... 
33   INT. AMITY FOOD SERVICE - MIAMI, 1992 - MORNING             33 
Steven exits an elevator and saunters into work, happy as ever. He passes the AMITY FOODSERVICE Logo and a CHERUBIC SECRETARY. 
STEVEN Morning Sandy! 
CHERUBIC SECRETARY Morning Steven. You have visitors. 
STEVEN Okey-dokey! 
Steven quickly gets a deeply concerned look on his face as he approaches his office. 
The door is slightly ajar. He secretly peeks in to see... 
TWO FEDERAL MARSHALLS wait in Steven's office. He instantly knows what's going on. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Federal Marshalls... 
CUT TO: 
34   INT. AMITY FOOD SERVICE - MIAMI, 1992 - MORNING             34 
Steven paces nervously outside the elevator, growing more and more anxious as he waits. 
STEVEN (V.O.) They wanted me for all sorts of stuff- Insurance fraud, identity theft, passport fraud. They were probably gonna extradite me all the way back to Texas. I had to decide what to do next. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08    23. 
34A   EXT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1992 - DAY                     34A 
Steven's Ford Bronco cruises past the apartment building to find a few POLICE CARS parked outside. He drives on. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
35    EXT. ABANDONED LOT - FLORIDA, 1992 - DAY                    35 
Steven BLUBBERS TO HIMSELF inside his Bronco which is parked in a bleak lot near a looming billboard. 
STEVEN (V.O.) But one thing was for sure-- I was not gonna let them put me away. I was a cop and I knew what jail was like. And there was no way I was going there. I had a plan.

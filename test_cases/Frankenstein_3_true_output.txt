WALTON GRIGORI! 
THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their fellows from the water, hauling them to safety. 
FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on its own ice floe. 
THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning. 
ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL 
Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming: 
WALTON GRIGORI! 
The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight of his own clothing. 
Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's dying right in front of Walton's eyes. 
WALTON SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF! 
Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his head back with a bellow of anguish... 
...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath him. The face of a nightmare. 
The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature. 
The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out his arm, fingers grasping to help. 
WALTON Swim. 
The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to him. Come. Grab my hand. 
The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice. 
CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered by ice floes on all sides. Going under. 
WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught. 
Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard. 
BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand. 
The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high. 
Swims grimly on. 
ABOARD THE NEVSKY 
The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing off. The men crowd to his-side. 
THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and sinking beneath the surface... 
...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the top. Never giving up. 
The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his creation's knees, content to be shown the way... 
The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. So very cold. 
He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother comforting a baby. 
WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning: 
GRIGORI (SOFTLY) Don't do it... (screaming) FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT! 
THE CREATURE 
turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the sympathy held so long sought. A whisper: 
CREATURE For God's sake... I will. 
And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. Blossoming. Roiling. 
WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as: 
THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps it never will... 
FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance. 
WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers of lightning kiss the world. Softly: 
WALTON Home 
EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT 
HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK. 
THE END

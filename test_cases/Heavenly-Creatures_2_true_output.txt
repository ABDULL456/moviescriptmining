SCHOOL FRENCH CLASS - MORNINGClass 3A are in the midst of a French lesson. All the class have name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen "French name." MISS WALLER gestures at a screed of subjugated verbs scrawled on the blackboard. 
MISS WALLER The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "II voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." Translate, somebody . . . quickly! 
A SCHOOLGIRL - LAURA - blurts out from the front of the class. 
LAURA "He wanted her to give him some money."

JULIET I am actually from England, Miss Stewart. 
MISS STEWART Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University. 
Miss Waller looks impressed. Pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class. 
MISS STEWART Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet. 
Miss Stewart leaves. Miss Waller smiles at Juliet. 
MISS WALLER You can sit over here, Juliet. 
Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives Juliet a cardboard name card.

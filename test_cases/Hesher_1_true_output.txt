HESHER (IMPRESSED) Hang on a second. Can I see that? 
Hesher sniffs the "cigarette". 
HESHER (CONT'D) No shit. 
Hesher sets the "cigarette" down. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I'll be right back. 
Hesher dashes out of Grandma's room. 
After a few moments, he comes back and sits on the edge of the bed. He is holding a glass BONG. The bong has so much resin caked onto the sides, it looks as though a thousand pounds of marijuana have been smoked through it. 
HESHER (CONT'D) May I? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Hesher takes one of Grandma's medical joints and breaks it in half and loads the bowl of the pipe. 
GRANDMA What is that? 
HESHER It's a bong. The water filters the smoke. It's probably the most healthy way to smoke weed. 
Hesher lights up and takes a HUGE hit from the bong. He explains his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in. 
HESHER (CONT'D) OK, so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in. 
Hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into his lungs. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible, OK bro? 
GRANDMA Umm, OK. 
Grandma takes the bong and has a hit. It's a bit clunky, but she manages to make it work. 
HESHER Ok, lift your finger. 
Hesher helps her. The smoke shoots into her lungs. Grandma begins to cough. 
GRANDMA Oh, wow... That was a big one. 
HESHER Yeah, that was good. Hit it again. 
Grandma has another hit. It goes well. She blows out the smoke. 
Hesher takes the bong off her and has another HUGE one for himself. He passes the bong back. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
GRANDMA I think I'm OK, dear. 
Hesher takes the last hit. He dusts off the bowl and sets the water pipe down. 
They sit for a moment and let the drug sink in. 
GRANDMA (CONT'D) Honey, how old are you? 
HESHER Who wants to know? 
GRANDMA I don't know. You seem a little older than TJ. 
HESHER Who? 
GRANDMA Oh, stop it. Aren't you a little old to be hanging around TJ all the time? 
HESHER Aren't you? 
GRANDMA No, I'm his grandmother. 
HESHER Yeah, I guess you have a point... OK, well I used to have a mouse. No, wait... hang on a minute. I used to have a snake. And do you know what snakes eat? 
GRANDMA Actually, there's no limit to the food items that you can even think of that a snake might eat. Whatever is available in abundance would become the prey for the snakes. Depending on their growth, their diet - 
Hesher cuts her off. 
HESHER Yeah, OK, OK well, actually they eat mice. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
GRANDMA They do eat mice. A lot of times snakes eat other snakes because they're the right shape - 
HESHER Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to have a snake and I fed it mice. But one time I fed this little fuckin' mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough. I dropped that mouse in the snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go near him, and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little, you know... 
Hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are called. 
HESHER (CONT'D) With his little mouse hand. So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse I had to feed him other mice, but every time I dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse. And so eventually the snake starved to death. I had a cage full of mice.

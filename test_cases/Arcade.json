{"train": "Arcade \nby David S. Goyer \nLast revised November 6, 1990 \nINT. ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESS \nWe don't know if it's night or day.  It's just black. \nAnd maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barely perceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed. \nBREATHING, \nslow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  A feeling of utter loneliness. \nAnd now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever it was...it's gone now. \nMAIN CREDITS ROLL. \nWe hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody. \nAnd now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equally intricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowers opening up in time lapse photography. \nFRACTALS... \nis what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas. The Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up of progressively smaller forms and on into infinity. \nGlorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves and regenerating. \nThis is creation we're witnessing. \nThis is life in the making. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY \nAN EYE \nFor a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last of the fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blue one.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye. \nALEX (V.O.) Time.  That's all I ever think about anymore.  It's like there's never enough of it, you know? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY \nThis is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hear Alex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything is very bright and dreamlike. \nRight now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway is an open door. \nWe stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in. \nALEX (V.O.) It's strange.  When the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean, you never really get there.  It's always one step ahead of you.  It's like there's no present. There's no \"now\".  As soon as you think, \"I'm here\", the moment's already gone.  Either everything's in the future, or it's in the past. (beat) There's no \"now\". \nMAN (V.O.) So where are you then? \nALEX (V.O.) I'm in the past. \nWe move through the doorway. \nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY \nEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases. Everything looks perfect. \nThen we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on the floor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfway out. \nIt's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  We can't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  And all around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom and the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD. \nA shrill BELL shatters the moment. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY \nThe bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period. \nON ALEX \nas we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty, though in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense. If Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's reflected in her eyes. \nAcross from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and that was his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged, incapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his office we're in. Typical \"SAY NO TO DRUGS\" teen propaganda decorate the room. Fun. \nAs the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling in the halls. \nGREG So tell me you're okay, then. \nALEX I'm okay. \nGREG (smiles) Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't. \nGreg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches into exaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making \"smooching faces\" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS. \nThings are okay now. \nGREG (to Alex) Hey...watch this... \nGreg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close to her and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH! And the moment's captured forever. \nGreg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the picture even develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the emulsion. \nNICK (engrossed in his game again) You making another one, Greg? \nGREG Sure.  Practice. \nBENZ Lemme see... \nGreg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz. The papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed with them, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts and Laurie lean in. \nSTILTS Cool. \nGREG (still working) See, when the emulsion's still warm you can move it around... (stops) There. \nGreg holds up the Polaroid for Alex to see. \nPOLAROID \nGreg and Alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has spun into strange colors.  It's an odd effect. \nGreg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it. \nGREG Safe keeping. \nMeanwhile, Nick's pocket video game emits an EXPLOSION NOISE. \nNICK Shit.  I'm out. \nHe sets the game down, dejected. \nBENZ You guys going to Dante's after school? \nGREG I don't know. \nBENZ Check it out... \nBenz pulls a flyer from inside his coat.  It's an ad for a new game called \"ARCADE\", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a circuit board.  The tag at the bottom reads, \"COMING THIS FALL.  REALITY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME\". \nNICK (excited) That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys are good.  It's supposed to be interactive. Graphics are unbelievable. \nBENZ Yeah?  They were handing these out at Dante's.  Test marketing it or something. Gonna have a demonstration today. \nSTILTS Cool. \nLAURIE Can you say anything but \"cool\"? \nSTILTS Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things... \nGREG (annoyed) Guys... \nBenz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again. \nBENZ So how 'bout it? \nNICK I'm game... (to Greg) Greg? \nGreg turns to Alex. \nGREG Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner. \nALEX And then keep on driving? \nGREG Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever. \nLAURIE (nodding) I could go for that. \nAlex laughs.  Laurie took the words right out of her mouth. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY \nDifford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod. \nDIFFORD (smooth as silk) We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us. \nNICK So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months. \nDifford turns to Nick and salutes him. \nDIFFORD A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point. (to everyone) What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy. \nNICK That's impossible. \nDIFFORD (taking the bait) Is it?  Why don't you see for your self? \nDifford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter.  He tosses it at... \nNICK \nwho snags it out of mid-air and grins. \nGREG Go for it, Nick. \nDifford steps aside and waves Nick to the machine.  The rest of the kids crowd around. \nARCADE \nisn't just your typical video game.  First of all there are three screens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while playing.  Second, the player wears \"data gloves\" (which provide an actual sensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired directly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling that he/she has actually entered the video game universe. \nDifford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows. \nDIFFORD (indicating equipment) The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick things up inside the world...tools, weapons ... it'll feel like they're really in your hands... \nNick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps. \nDIFFORD (continuing) The goggles heighten the experience. When we said \"Reality will never be the same\", we weren't kidding. \nDifford places the goggles on Nick's face.  Then he points to the control board, which features two joy-sticks and a large RED BUTTON labeled \"ESCAPE\". \nNICK (skeptical) \"Escape\"? \nDIFFORD In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild... \nBENZ (scoffing) Nick won't need it. \nDIFFORD You're good, eh? \nNICK (grins) The best. \nNick winks at Alex and Greg. \nNICK (to Difford) So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies? \nDIFFORD It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain. \nNICK So how do I start? \nDIFFORD The game will guide you. \nNick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot. He punches the \"START\" button on the top of one of the joy-sticks. \nImmediately the screens come to life.  Darkness with shooting stars of light racing back and forth. \nON SCREEN \nA three-dimensional computer-generated FACE appears out of the darkness, spinning in from far away and coming to rest. \nARCADE I AM ARCADE. (breathing) YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE WRONG MACHINE. \nThe crowd of kids is suitably impressed.  Even Alex is amused. So far, so good. \nARCADE WHAT'S YOUR NAME? \nNICK Nick. \nARCADE (almost contemptuous) NICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE. \nSUDDENLY, \nA LIGHTBEAM above the video screen illuminates Nick's face. \nLAURIE (concerned) What's it doing?! \nDIFFORD Memorizing Nick's features.  Watch. \nON SCREEN \nGREG'S FACE \nAs a smile slowly creeps across it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DANTE'S INFERNO - LATER \nAt the front of The Inferno, Difford and two SLIP-STREAM HELPERS are unpacking cardboard boxes.  The KIDS have clustered around them, momentarily forgetting the ARCADE machine. \nDifford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles which dangle over his arm. \nDIFFORD Here's what we're going to do.  What I'm holding are the home versions of ARCADE, the prototypes... \nThis is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids. \nDIFFORD (continuing) In a month or so we're planning on releasing ARCADE in both versions, but we're still fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck out.  So what we'll do is have you register with us, and then we're going to loan these out to you for a week or so.  The only thing you have to do in return is answer some marketing questions. Sound fair? \nThe kids can't line up fast enough. \nOUR GROUP \nis right up front, with Nick and Alex being the first two in line. \nDifford winks at Nick. \nDIFFORD So what do you think? \nNICK Sign me up. \nAlex is glancing around now.  She sees Benz, Stilts, and Laurie, but not Greg. \nALEX Where's Greg? \nLaurie jerks her thumb back at the ARCADE machine. \nLAURIE He's still working on the game. \nAnd Alex finds Greg for a moment, spotting him over the heads of the other kids. \nON GREG \nHis face is a mirror of Nick's...sweat pouring down, grinning from ear to ear.  It's addictive as hell.  SIGHTS and SOUNDS rush past us on the three screens, racing at incredible speeds. \nAnd now, from within the game, we hear a strange sound...a SCREAM of sorts, halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom. \nARCADE TIME'S UP, FRIEND. \nThe SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screens EXPLODE WITH LIGHT. \nAT THE FRONT OF THE INFERNO... \neveryone turns in response.  It's as if someone set off a flashbulb. \nALEX \npushes her way back through the kids, making her way to the ARCADE machine. \nARCADE \nGreg is nowhere to be found.  In fact, the CyberGloves and goggles are dangling from the control board, abandoned. \nAlex turns to a nearby KID. \nALEX Where's Greg? \nThe kid shrugs. \nKID Don't know.  I think I saw him walk out, but I'm not sure... \nAlex isn't listening anymore.  She's staring at the floor of the ARCADE machine. \nGREG'S POLAROID \nis on the floor...the photo of Greg and Alex which he manipulated. \nAlex picks it up, glancing around.  She scans the faces of the crowd and she doesn't see Greg anywhere.  She turns away. \nON SCREEN \nA video figure is lying on the computer-generated ground. It sits up, brushing dust from itself, and looks around. It faces us.  Only the image isn't of Nick anymore.  It's VIDEO GREG now. \nUP FRONT, \nAlex has re-joined her friends.  The four of them are now clutching ARCADE home versions in their arms, CyberGloves and all.  They look like kids on Christmas Day. \nNICK (O.S.) (filtered) Hey, kid. \nAlex clutches the phone, still shaking. \nALEX Nick... \nNICK  (O.S.) (filtered) Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just... \nALEX (cutting him off) Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it. \nNICK (O.S.) (filtered) What the hell are you talking about? \nAlex continues to watch the television screen, almost mesmerized by the flickering sparks.  Her eyes begin to glaze over... \nNICK (O.S.) (filtered) You there?  Hello? \nAlex snaps out of it, tearing her gaze from the screen \nALEX I have to talk to you. \nNICK (O.S.) (filtered) We are talking... \nALEX No, in person.  Now. \nNICK (O.S.) (filtered) It's twelve-thirty! \nALEX I'm coming over. \nAlex quickly hangs up the phone and moves back to the television.  She reaches for the control box and hits the \"OFF\" switch. \nNothing happens.  Sparks continue to shoot across the screen. \nAlex tries it again.  Same result. \nALEX Shit... \nAgain and again she hits the button, but nothing is happening. \nAlex reaches behind the t.v., grabs hold of the electrical cords, and YANKS. \nThe fucking cord won't come out! \nAnd then she hears it, an ELECTRONIC WHISPER, both seductive and horrific. \nARCADE ALEX... \nWith all her might, Alex pulls on the cords. POP!  They fling out of the t.v. and the screen goes dead. \nAlex sits back against the wall for a moment, catching her breath and trying to calm the rising hysteria within her. \nALEX (to herself) Okay...don't think about it... (deep breath) Okay. \nAlex stands up, grabbing her coat off the bed. \nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nAlex comes down the stairs, heading for the front door. Only she stops for a moment...noticing the LIGHT. \nON THE COUCH, \nher father is once again bathed in the blue light of the television. STATIC WHISPERS, the same as before, are coming from the set. \nAlex looks at her father.  He hasn't moved.  And yet, the t.v. is on once again. \nTHE SCREEN \nBlue static.  Unexceptional.  And a face?  Someone in the static? \nAlex draws closer to the screen.  She can hear SOMETHING now, other than static whispers.  Sounds kind of like a VOICE... \nTHE SCREEN \nA definite, ghostly FACE is there.  It turns, looks at Alex (us) and it's Greg. \nGREG (on screen, strange) Alex... \nAlex jerks and SNAPS off the t.v., spooked as hell.  She stands in the darkness and all but runs out of the house. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MANNING HOUSE - NIGHT \nAlex races to the Skylark and fumbles with the keys. Finally she gets it right, guns the gas, and rips out of the driveway. \nA STREETLIGHT \nAlex is furious.  She rises and begins pacing back and forth, voice growing louder.  She draws in close. \nALEX See, men always do this.  \"Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium\". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick! (screaming) I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!! \nNICK (a strained whisper) Quiet.  I do have parents, you know. \nAlex spins around and points at the computer monitor. \nALEX There! \nTHE MONITOR \nARCADE is back on again, fractals unfolding and green monitor light blinking. \nON NICK \nOkay.  Alright.  This does throw him for a second. \nALEX It turned itself back on, Nick. \nNICK No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens. \nNick crosses to the monitor and flips the \"OFF\" switch.  He tries it again and again, but the game won't turn off. \nALEX It's alive, Nick.  It's listening to us ... \nNick spins around, angry, maybe a little freaked out. \nNICK Just shut up!  Enough already, okay? \nSilence for a moment.  Nick takes a deep breath.  Over-reacted.  After a moment... \nNICK Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium. \nALEX Call the others.  Laurie, Benz... \nNick acquiesces.  He pulls out his phone and punches in a number. \nNICK I'll try Stilts.  He's got insomnia. \nNick and Alex watch each other in silence as the connection is made.  We can faintly hear the phone RINGING. \nNo answer. \nNICK Okay...Laurie, then. \nAlex turns away, sinking to Nick's bed.  All the anger has drained out of her.  She knows they won't reach them. \nON NICK \nAs he listens for an answer.  Three RINGS, four, five... He hangs up. Punches in the final number. \nNICK Benz... \nAgain.  No answer. \nNick hangs up and sets the phone aside.  He looks at Alex. \nALEX (fatalistic) Something's happened to them. \nNICK It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them. \nALEX All of them? \nNick shrugs.  He's not willing to accept anything, but he's uncomfortable all the same. \nNICK Look, why are you fucking with me like this? \nAlex rises.  She's tired.  Tired and scared. \nALEX Because I didn't know where else to go. \nNICK (glances at a clock) It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning. \nAnd then, more for himself than for her. \nNICK (continuing) It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right? \nALEX (half-hearted) Sure. \nShe turns and climbs back out the window onto the roof. Then she ducks her head back in. \nALEX If I were you, I'd think twice about playing that game again. \nThen she's gone.  Nick moves over and watches. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BENZ' HOUSE -- DAY \nNick sits in the passenger seat of Greg's car, glancing across the street at... \nALEX \nShe's standing on the front porch of Benz' house, talking with his MOM. Mom is currently shaking her head.  Alex turns away and heads back towards Nick.  She comes around the Skylark and pulls open her door. \nNICK Well? \nALEX She thought Benz was at school. \nAlex remains calm.  She sits for a moment, staring ahead. Finally she puts the key in the ignition. \nNICK Where to now? \nALEX Laurie's. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAlex pulls the Skylark into Laurie's driveway.  The house is run down. You wouldn't want to live here.  Above, the sky has clouded over.  It looks like it's going to get nasty. \nALEX Come on. \nNick follows Alex to the front door and Alex hits the buzzer. \nALEX (to herself) Laurie...answer...come on... \nAlex tries the buzzer again.  Persistently. \nALEX Shit. \nAlex looks close to cracking.  There's a desperation in her face. \nALEX This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what? \nNICK It doesn't necessarily mean she's... \nALEX (cutting him off) Let's go around back. \nBefore Nick can stop her, Alex is running around to the back. \nEXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- DAY \nThe backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere.  There's a cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing-set that's hopelessly rusted. \nAlex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors.  She steps up and clears a spot to look through. \nALEX (visibly relieved) She's here! \nNick joins her at the window, peering inside. \nTHEIR P.O.V. \nThey are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light that's issuing from the television.  The television faces away from us, but we can see Laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized. \nLAURIE \nShe looks like shit.  Wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair.  Mascara has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes. Yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face.  We can't hear her, but she seems to be talking to the television. \nALEX \nsteps back a moment, concerned. \nALEX It is the game. \nShe taps on the window. \nALEX Laurie! \nINSIDE, \nLaurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world. \nAlex TAPS the harder, using her fist now. \nALEX (louder) LAURIE! \nNick joins Alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass. There's no way in hell Laurie wouldn't be able to hear them. \nAlex steps back from the window again, panicking. \nAlex drops the remote, stunned. \nALEX Oh God...  He's in the cable system! He's out of the game! \nNick's eyes find the cable wire extending from the wall and into the t.v. Sure enough, SPARKS are crackling down that wire and into the wall. \nARCADE LAUGHS and it's the most awful sound we've ever heard. \nLAURIE \nis convulsing now, and tiny SPARKS are racing around her eyes. \nAlex sees her and SCREAMS, clutching her hands to her ears in an attempt to block out the deafening ROAR. \nNICK \nmoves without thinking, picking up a nearby chair and SLAMMING it into the television.  It EXPLODES glass, sparks, and smoke. \nThe HUMMING stops altogether, quiet now.  And then, from everywhere at once... \nARCADE SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. \nWith a final ROAR, the energy behind the walls whips around and around, then rushes away. \nOUTSIDE, \nNick catches a quick glimpse of SPARKS racing across the telephone wires suspended above the back yard. \nTotal silence for a moment.  Alex and Nick are too stunned to speak.  Then Alex looks at Laurie. \nLAURIE \nlies on the ground, unconscious.  Glass scattered all around her. \nALEX Laurie... \nAlex drops to her side, trying to find a pulse...anything. \nNICK Is she breathing? \nAlex nods. \nNICK Then leave her. \nALEX We can't... \nNICK We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here! \nAlex glances around.  The room is a mess.  All the outlet are singed.  And now she notices that everything electronic...t.v., clock, thermostat...all of them have exploded open. \nNICK (continuing) I believe you now.  I don't know what the fuck just happened, but it did. Now let's get the hell out of here. \nAlex slowly rises, reluctant to leave Laurie's side. \nALEX Where do we go? \nNICK My house.  I want to try something. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  NICK'S HOUSE -- DAY \nAs Alex and Nick pull up, the streetlights BUZZ on and off even though it's still daylight.  This doesn't escape Nick's notice. \nAlex parks the car and the two of them jump out. \nNICK Around back. \nEXT. NICK'S BACKYARD -- DAY \nNick leads Alex to a cellar door and down inside. \nINT. NICK'S CELLAR -- DAY \nRear the doorway is an old, paint-caked fuse box.  Nick pries it open and begins unscrewing fuses. \nNICK I'm not taking any chances. \nNick steps back. \nNICK Okay.  I'm going inside.  If I'm not back out in, say, two minutes, you get the hell out of here. \nAlex nods.  She lifts her digital watch up and sets her timer with a BEEP. \nALEX Meet you by the car. \nRECEPTIONIST May I help you? \nALEX We need to see Mr. Difford. \nRECEPTIONIST I see.  And do you have an appointment? \nNICK No, but it's important and if you'd... \nRECEPTIONIST (cutting him off) I'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment, I won't be able to help you. If you'd like, you can call his office from our courtesy phone outside and schedule one ... \nNick reaches across the desk and snags the receptionist by his shirt, jerking him forward. \nNICK (menacing) If Difford's not out here it one minute we're calling the news and informing them that your fucking games are whispering in our ears and telling us to commit suicide. I'm talking public relations nightmare here, buddy.  Satanism, virgin sacrifices, backward messages, the whole bit. \nThe receptionist glances at Alex who puts on a stern face and nods. \nNick releases his grip.  The receptionist smooths out his shirt and smiles. \nRECEPTIONIST One moment please... (punches in extension) Rachel, would you be kind enough to tell Mr. Difford that we have a situation in the lobby which requires his immediate attention? (beat) Thank-you. \nThe receptionist clasps his hands together and looks back up. \nRECEPTIONIST (continuing) Mr. Difford will be right with you. \nALEX Why thank-you. \nAlex and Nick move away from the reception desk, having caused quite a scene.  The rest of the VISITORS watch them with curiosity. \nALEX Virgin sacrifices? \nNICK (shrugs) Drives 'em crazy every time. \nNick casts his eyes over the walls where graphics from various SLIP-STREAM games are displayed.  He stops on one display in particular, a triptych of sorts featuring the haunting face of ARCADE. \nBING! \nAlex and Nick turn at the sound, just in time to see Difford exiting an elevator and briskly making his way towards them. \nDIFFORD Nick, Alex, how are we today? \nALEX How'd you know it was us? \nDIFFORD Security camera. (points to one) Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live. \nDifford laughs and claps Nick on the back. \nDIFFORD (continuing) Now what seems to be the problem? \nALEX It's the game, ARCADE. \nDIFFORD You don't like it? \nNICK That's gotta be the understatement of the century.  It's killing people. \nBeat.  Difford looks from Alex to Nick, and back again. His smile fades from his face. \nDIFFORD If this is a joke, I'm not laughing. \nALEX Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford. \nDIFFORD (clearing his throat) Why don't we take this into my office. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DIFFORD'S OFFICE -- DAY \nDifford closes the doors behind him.  He stares and Alex and Nick for a moment, assessing, calculating risks... \nDIFFORD Talk to me. \nALEX There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow... \nAt this Difford breaks into a smile.  Nick sees this and acts quickly to save the situation. \nNICK What Alex is trying to say is that it \"seems\" like it's alive. \nALEX No I'm not... \nNICK (freezing her with a stare) We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... (beat) I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right? \nDIFFORD (relieved) That's what this is all about? Tricks? Sure, I'd be happy to introduce you to ARCADE's programmer. \nAlex has caught on.  She shuts up for the moment. \nDIFFORD (continuing) Tell you what, I'll take you down to our R&D labs right now. \nALEX But how can it change every time? \nALBERT It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible. \nNICK How the hell did you do that? \nALBERT Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening. \nAt this, a chill runs down Alex's spine. \nALEX Dead? \nALBERT Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important. \nALEX Maybe he's not dead. \nALBERT He? \nALEX The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game. \nALBERT (laughs) And maybe you've been taking too many drugs. \nNick glances at the helmet again. \nNICK Could you play ARCADE with that? \nALBERT Well, technically \"yes\", but this is only the prototype. \nNick nods and smiles, offering his hand. \nNICK Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics? \nALBERT Sure. \nAlbert moves back to the computer console.  Meanwhile, Nick pulls Alex aside. \nNICK (quietly) Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay? \nALEX What are you going to do? \nNICK Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible. \nACROSS THE LAB, \nAlbert is oblivious to their conversation. \nAlex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY \nAlex makes her way quickly down the hall, turning a corner and passing a SECURITY GUARD.  She waves at him, her smile fading as soon as she's passed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. R&D LAB - DAY \nAlbert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from a laser printer.  He turns and hands them to Nick. \nALBERT Here you go.  Happy hunting. \nNick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket. \nNICK Thanks again. \nAnd with that, Nick pulls back his fist and punches Albert square in the face. \nAlbert goes down, more stunned than hurt, and Nick springs into action. He scoops up the CyberHelmet in his free hand, kicks open the doors, and tosses his skateboard into the hallway... \nINT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY \nNick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, picking up speed like mad... \nHe's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled EMPLOYEES.  And here comes a MAN with a mail cart... \nWHOOSH!  Nick zips by him.  And now an ALARM is ringing. \nNICK Shit... \nINT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY \nNick comes SCREECHING around the corner, narrowly missing a collision with two SECURITY GUARDS. \nGUARD #1 That's him! \nNICK Jesus Christ! \nALEX I can't believe you made it! \nNick climbs into the front seat next to Alex, and for a second, he's pretty close to her.  He kisses her on the cheek...caught up in the moment.  Then he sinks back, catching his breath. \nALEX You got the schematics? \nNICK Everything. \nNeither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again.  Driving. Wind whipping Alex's hair around.  She stares at the road ahead. \nALEX So where do we play the game, Nick? \nNick doesn't answer at first.  For a second there, he'd managed to forget everything. \nNICK I've been thinking about that. (beat) ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin? \nALEX (grim) Dante's Inferno. \nNICK Yeah. (deep breath) The Inferno. \nOVERHEAD, \nas we watch Alex's Skylark speed away from us.  Shadows are creeping across the landscape now.  Streetlights are flickering, sputtering on. \nAnd night is falling. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT \nSweeping down from the sky, we follow The Skylark.  As Alex and Nick near The Inferno, streetlights blink off in succession... progressive darkness working its way towards their destination. \nDANTE'S INFERNO \nWe move past the painted walls, the various demons illuminated by moonlight. \nAlex and Nick rush to the front door.  It's gated.  Inside, The Inferno is totally dark.  Shadows. \nALEX The windows are barred... (thinking) There's a skylight.  We can get in through the roof. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO ROOF - NIGHT \nAlex and Nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight in the center, caked with grime. \nNick stands and plants his foot through the skylight.  It SHATTERS, raining down glass into the darkness below. \nNick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars. Gripping the belt, he lowers himself down. After a moment, he disappears from view. \nAlex leans over the skylight.  She can't see a thing. \nALEX Nick... (beat) Nick! \nFor the longest moment there's no response.  Then... \nNICK (O.S.) (from below) Okay, your turn. \nAlex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly, lowering herself down into The Inferno. \nINT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT \nAlex dangles from the skylight, a good eight feet from the floor. \nALEX (warily) Are you there? \nHER P.O.V. \nThe Inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows. And Nick is nowhere to be seen. \nAlex steels herself and drops to the floor. \nShe stands, a bit shaky, and cautiously moves around a cluster of video games. \nNICK \nis standing on the other side, staring at a game screen which pulses with a DIM LIGHT. \nAlex approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.  He turns. \nNICK Alex... \nALEX You didn't hear me? \nNICK No.  If you're smart, you run like hell. \nAlex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot. \nALEX I'm going. \nNick stares at her a moment, then nods tiredly.  She reaches for the second pair of CyberGloves and pulls them on. \nNICK You don't get it, do you? \nALEX (strapping on goggles) What? \nNICK I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you. \nALEX I already have a boyfriend, Nick. \nNICK I know. (beat) It sucks. \nThe two of them stand there a moment, looking at one another.  After a moment, Nick laughs tiredly. \nNICK What can I say? (pulls on the CyberHelmet) Tough being a hero, isn't it? \nNick reaches out for the joy-stick and hits the \"START\" button. \nNICK (grim) Here goes nothing. \nAs before, the screen comes to life.  Darkness and sparks. Then we hear the BREATHING. \nARCADE'S FACE \nspins into view, grinning at Alex and Nick. \nARCADE NICK.  ALEX.  I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE. \nALEX Fuck-you. \nARCADE ANY TIME. \nALEX We know what you are. \nARCADE A HEARTLESS MONSTER, OF COURSE. (incredibly evil) OH SAVE ME, ALEX, SAVE ME FROM MYSELF. \nARCADE laughs and it's not a sound you'd want to hear twice. \nTHE LIGHTBEAM \nclicks on, playing over their faces and analyzing their features. \nON SCREEN \nARCADE'S face spins away and computer-generated versions of Alex and Nick appear.  As before, they are suited up in video game armor, each carrying a thrasher board. \nARCADE KISS REALITY GOODBYE. \nThe video versions of Nick and Alex hop onto their thrasher boards and the world around them curls in upon itself. \nThe process is similar to what we've seen before, but even more extreme. LIGHTS and SOUNDS are pouring out of the ARCADE machine in almost unbearable intensities.  It seems as if the \"real\" world is going to be shaken apart. \nNICK (over noise) Hold on! \nARCADE SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. \nANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND... \nAlex and Nick disappear from the real world completely. Their equipment, gloves and goggles, fall to the floor, empty.  They've been physically sucked inside the game! \nThe light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet. \nON SCREEN \nBOOM!  Suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them! \n(Note:  As we move through each level, video legends will appear on the screen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a video game.) \nThe words \"LEVEL ONE -- BLOOD RED SKY\" flash across the screen and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY \nAlex and Nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up water and muck. \nTHE RED SKY \ncrackles with LIGHTNING.  Smoke obscures everything. Alex and Nick pull themselves up, a bit dazed. \nNICK And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake. \nALEX Yeah, that's what worries me. \nShe steps through the doorway and disappears.  Nick follows. \nWe hold on the empty doorway.  Hold for a moment, and then... \nWe hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.  It's grating, seeping inside our brains and mucking around in there.  On the horizon there is a quick FLASH OF LIGHT. \nSomething is coming. \nCUT TO: \nThe words \"LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS\" \nEXT.  LEVEL TWO, SALT FLATS -- DAY \nAlex and Nick are cruising along salt flats.  Sporadic pools of water and strange ROARING sounds in the mist.  So far so good. Nick glances at his wrist display.  His \"STRENGTH\" only has a few blocks left. \nNICK Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies. \nALEX There... \nShe points North.  A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, just above the watery plains. \nAlex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.  As they near it, Nick swings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up. As soon as he touches it, it bursts like a bubble. \nNICK Shit... \nALEX Check your read-out. \nNick does.  His \"STRENGTH\" is back to normal again. \nNICK You're right.  It worked. \nNick and Alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them. \nALEX (pointing) There's another... \nShe sweeps left and scoops the second Firefly out of the sky.  Off in the distance we can hear that RINGING again, just at the edge of our vision. Alex and Nick don't hear it yet. \nNick is glancing down at his schematic of Level Two. \nNICK According to this, the doorway should be somewhere around here... \nTHEIR P.O.V. \nThe salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water. Ahead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water, muck, and strange reeds poking through the mist. \nAlex's wrist display begins to BEEP.  She glances down. \nWRIST DISPLAY \nOnly one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. The RINGING is a little louder now. \nALEX (worried) Our time's up. \nNICK What?!  There's nothing here! \nALEX Look around... \nThe two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they're looking for. \nNICK (starting to panic) I don't see the doorway! \nAlex and Nick's wrist displays are BEEPING like crazy now. The beeps come closer and closer until they meld into one piercing high-pitched TONE. \nJUST THEN, \nthe RINGING turns into the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer.  A burst of light on the horizon shatters the sky. \nNICK What the fuck is that?! \nALEX Screamer. \nALEX \nplunges into the marsh-like water, waist-high, and it's then that she sees a glow emanating from beneath the water. She dives forward... \nBENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRACKISH WATER \nAlex swims towards the GLOW.  Ahead of her, the depths drop off sharply, perhaps some hundred feet or so. \nHER P.O.V. \nNick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around.  They are on the top of a massive dune. \nTHEIR THRASHER BOARDS \nnow looks like snowboards.  It doesn't take Nick long to figure out what to do. \nNICK We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard. \nALEX (snapping down her visor) Never been on a snowboard. \nNick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune.  He begins to slide down, slowly picking up speed. \nA SERIES OF SHOTS... \n...as Alex and Nick negotiate the dunes.  They glide over the sand gracefully, cutting back left and right to keep their speed down, sweeping in wide arcs... \nUnder any other circumstances, they'd be having the time of their lives. Alex has adjusted to the environment quickly, at ease of the Thrasherboard. \nLATER -- \nThe dunes gradually level out.  Alex and Nick slow to a stop. Alex flips up her visor.  Her face is covered with grime now, hardened. \nALEX I guess we're walking from here on out. \nThey pick up their boards and walk. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- LATER \nAlex and Nick have been walking for a long time.  Nick is silent, just staring straight ahead at the endless sand. He looks wasted.  Zoned out. His face is beaded with sweat. \nOnce again, their wrist displays begin to BEEP. \nALEX (almost a whisper) Time's up. \nNick starts to LAUGH, sinking to his knees. \nNICK We're fucked.  That's it. \nAlex pulls on Nick's arm, forcing him to his feet. \nALEX Get up, Nick... \nNick isn't going anywhere fast.  Alex tries to drag him forward, but she slips in the sand. \nALEX GET UP!!! \nAnd then, from off in the distance... \nVOICE (O.S.) (far away) Alex...help me... \nAlex turns.  She focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck.  She taps a control on her helmet and her view is magnified. \nALEX'S P.O.V. \nBenz is up ahead. buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking quickly.  He waves his hands for help. and clutched in one of them is the second key. \nALEX It's Benz!!! \nAlex breaks into a run, and after a moment, Nick follows. He's walking, though...in no hurry to reach Benz. \nON BENZ \nThe desert is swallowing him up.  Only his head and arms remain.  He's in a state of total panic. \nBENZ (terrified) Get me out of here!  Oh God!!! \nALEX \nis running at top speed, half-stumbling across the dunes. Her wrist-display is BEEPING furiously. \nBENZ \nHis head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked off. \nALEX Benz! \nAlex reaches the spot and now, only Benz' clutched fist remains.  The hand opens and the gold key falls onto the sand. \nAlex DIVES for Benz' hand, but it sinks just before she can reach it.  She SCREAMS and claws at the sand, trying to find him.  She digs and digs, but all she finds is more sand.  With each second she becomes more frantic. \nFinally Alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up. \nTHE SAND \nAlex stares after it a moment.  Then she lets out a tired little laugh and starts to climb. \nA SERIES OF DISSOLVES... \nas Alex climbs, sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold. \nWe see her \"TIME ELAPSED\" blocks blinking away. \nTime running out and more climbing.  Then... \nEXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO RIM -- DAY \nAlex stands on the rim of the volcano.  At her feet is a golden key.  And before her, a big drop. \nALEX'S WRIST DISPLAY \nHer final block of time disappears.  The BEEPING starts. \nAlex doesn't even pause.  She steps off the rim into empty space... \n...and just as she's about to fall, a doorway of light appears in the air. Alex falls through it, vanishing. \n\"LEVEL FIVE -- KINGDOM OF THE BLIND\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LEVEL FIVE, ARCTIC WASTES -- DAY \nSnow whips across a world of white in wraith-like sheets. We move in on one particular bank... \nSomething is buried there.  The wind gradually blows the snow away, uncovering... \nALEX \nShe rises from the snow bank, disoriented.  Everything is impossibly bright, blinding.  Alex stands.  She draws up her hand to shade her eyes and we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nBEGIN MONTAGE: \nMusic begins.  CELLOS.  Like before. \nAlex, snowboarding for real this time, over slopes of powder... \nAlex's \"STRENGTH\" diminishing... \nAlex catching Fireflies... \nAlex jumping across a crevice on her board.  (Warren Miller stuff here)... \n\"TIME ELAPSED\" growing with every moment... \nAlex gliding down mountainsides... \nA flash of Greg, of Benz, of Laurie... \nA flash of Nick... \nNICK'S VOICE (V.O.) I know how to do this.  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd get nailed in a second. \nAnd a flash of Nick's horrified face at the Screamer reaches him... \nAlex's face, grim and determined... \nEXT.  LEVEL FIVE, ARCTIC WASTES -- LATER \nAlex glides to a stop even as her wrist display starts to BEEP.  This time a wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her, the golden key sticking out of the lock. \nAs Alex reaches for it, the Screamer enters Level Four. Alex slowly opens the door. \nALBERT'S VOICE (V.O.) You can get a free life on Level Four, but you have to wait for the last possible instant... \nAlex turns and waits calmly for the Screamer. \nTHE SCREAMER \nis a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish face bearing down on her... \nIT'S JAWS \nflare open to engulf her. \nAlex doesn't flinch at all.  And at the last possible second before impact... \nBLINK!  A stylized figure appears on her wrist-display next to the \"TIME ELAPSED\" meter.  Beneath the figure it says \"FREE LIFE\". \nShe fingers the throttle and the cycle ROARS to life.  It rockets off the incline and down into the tunnels. \nA SERIES OF SHOTS \nas Alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete. It's a harrowing ride, as her headlight reveals little of what's up ahead.  Somewhere above the tunnels, the Screamer has arrived.  In the course of the chase, it's SHRIEK will become louder and louder as it draws closer, locating Alex. \nANOTHER CYCLE \nappears out of side tunnels and a chase is on.  The RIDER is dressed in black with glowing death's head masks. \nBOY (to Alex) Dark Riders!  If they touch us, we're dead! \nThe tunnels get narrower and narrower, as Alex keeps pushing the limit off the bike. \nRider #1 tries to cut Alex off, charging forward and ramming her bike... \nAlex almost loses it, but finds balance once again, sweeping left and up the side of a circular tunnel... \nRIDER #1 \nbites it.  His cycle careens into the wall and EXPLODES in a shower of GREEN LIGHT.  The death's head tumbles away, spinning end over end.  The Screamer BLASTS over the remains of the Rider, having entered the tunnels. \nTWO MORE RIDERS APPEARS \ngaining on Alex.  Rider #2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts it forward like a lance.  CHINK!  The staff hits Alex's rear wheel, nearly throwing her.  The rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing, skeletal hand towards them.  Death touch.  The boy SCREAMS in terror. \nUP AHEAD, \na wall is rushing to meet them.  Alex jams the breaks and slides/skids sideways, cutting right at the last possible moment... \nWHAM!!!  Rider #2 slams into the end wall, not able to negotiate the turn. Another EXPLOSION of green and the second death's head comes tumbling away. \nAlex looks back.  There should be one Rider left, only now their are three!  Alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right... \nNEW TUNNEL -- \nAlex SCREECHES to a stop, having found yet another fork. The tunnel branches off into two directions.  Two neon signs with arrows point in opposite directions. \nNEON SIGNS \nThey read, \"THIS WAY\" and \"THAT WAY\". Alex checks her wrist display.  Not much time left. \nALEX Which way? \nBOY (pointing) That way. \nAlex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked \"THIS WAY\" instead. \nALEX Sorry. \nTHE TUNNEL \nIt narrows almost immediately.  Alex hears a ROAR, glances behind her, and sees four death's head RIDERS on her tail. She makes another turn... \nAHEAD, \nis a crumbling brick wall with the words \"WRONG WAY\" painted in blood-red. \nBOY (screaming) It's the wrong way! \nALEX (over the noise) In this world, wrong is right! \nSUDDENLY, \nthe tunnel behind them flares with light, shaking like an earthquake.  The Screamer has found them. \nA KEY \nhangs out from the wall, sort of like the brass ring on a merry-go-round. Alex snags it as she sweeps by. \nTHE SCREAMER \nrockets around the corner, twisting down the narrow tunnel. \nAlex grinds the motorcycle forward for all it's worth, and the Screamer is literally breathing down her neck.  She turns corner after corner, faster and faster, scraping the bike into the scum-covered walls and shooting out showers of SPARKS.  If she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn, pauses for even an instant, the Screamer will be on them... \nA CLAWED HAND \nlashes out and tears away the cycle's tail-pipe.  Another hand takes out a chunk of the seat... \nTHE BOY \nis WAILING, curling low to avoid the Screamer's claws... \nAHEAD, \nEXT.  LEVEL TEN, TECHNO-SKYSCRAPER -- NIGHT \nON ALEX AND THE BOY \nas they blink into existence on this level.  Alex rises, shaking badly. Her armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's impossible to tell who's blood, though.  She looks like she's just walked out of a slaughter-house. \nA bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns... \nARCADE'S BRAIN \nlooms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky and keeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down it, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely appears to be alive. \nTWO GLASS DOORS \nswing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within the building, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls completely, ending just at Alex's feet. \nAbove the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time, \"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE\".  Fucking-A. \nAlex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore. \nTHE BOY \nlooks up at Alex, frightened. \nBOY We have to go in there, don't we? \nAlex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet towards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain. \nINT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT \nInside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OF VOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channels being changed.  A snippet of an opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice there...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, a woman in the throes of orgasm, Nazis screaming \"HEIL HITLER!\", anything and everything. \nSIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF... \nCatchy phrases like, \"THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT\", and \"I THINK, THEREFORE, I'M FUCKED\" flash before us. \nT.V. MONITORS \nare everywhere, displaying an endless array of STATIC.  And now the monitors are displaying FRACTALS.  Every single one of them.  We hear the CELLOS, like an orchestra tuning up. \nALEX \nthrows her hands over her ears as the SOUNDS become unbearable. \nALEX (top of her lungs) SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nShe pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting the fuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and... \n...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink off, and it's dark once again. \nINT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM -- \nA SPOTLIGHT \ncomes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else is dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on forever. \nMORE LIGHTS \ncome on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends. They're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in rows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell. \nAnd now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice. A frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very unusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had just pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S heart. \nAlex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved into the ice. \nAlex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden keys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit them together...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a single, greater key. \nTHE KEY \nAlex fits it into the keyhole and turns it. \nTHE CASE OF ICE \nsplits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg is frozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiff grip, lifting it up. \nALEX (looking around) Okay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you? \nNo answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness. \nALEX (shouting) Where are you, damnit?! \nHer voice echoes in the cavernous room. \nARCADE (O.S.) RIGHT HERE, BITCH. \nAlex spins around and... \n", "test1_input": "ALEX Dad...Dad... \nJim stirs, though barely.  He turns a sleepy face towards her, looking gray and lifeless. \nJIM Yeah? \nALEX Did Greg call, Dad? \nJim shakes his head and sinks back into the couch. \nFrom Alex's attitude, it's obvious that this scene has played itself out many times before. \nALEX You should go to bed, Dad. \nJim waves a tired hand, dismissing her. \nJIM ...am in bed... \nALEX (standing back up) Yeah. \nShe turns and grabs a comforter that's bunched up at the end of the couch, spreading it over her father. \nON THE T.V. \nWe're getting a de-saturated view of carnage...some sort of war going on in some far-off land. \nAlex grabs the remote and flicks the t.v. off, plunging the room into darkness. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ALEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nSTATIC. \nLate-night t.v. static, filling up the entire screen. \nWE PULL BACK, \nrevealing a television...and further back until we see Alex crouched behind it in silhouette.  She's fiddling with wires back there and... \nBLINK! Suddenly the SLIP-STREAM logo appears on the t.v. screen with nifty computer graphics.  She's just hooked up the home version of ARCADE.  Alex moves back to the front of the set. \nALEX'S ROOM \nis her haven, a virtual library, filled with books which she loses herself in.  They're stacked everywhere. \nAnd puzzles too.  Half-assembled jig-saws.  Intricate things.  An Escher print.  The descendants of Rubik's Cube. Boxes within boxes.  This is Alex's life, what she retreats to. \nA PHOTO \nof Alex and her MOTHER sits by her bed, neglected and collecting dust. We'll see her later. \nCANDLES \nor what's left of them, have dripped and spread across her night table. \nALEX \nsits at the foot of her bed, facing her television. Slowly, she draws on the CyberGloves, testing her fingers. Next, she pulls on the goggles. Instead of a control panel, the home version has a control box, complete with joy-stick and a mini \"ESCAPE\" button. \nAlex fingers the \"START\" button on top of the joy-stick. \nTHE SCREEN \ngoes black, black with intermittent sparks.  And the BREATHING begins. \nARCADE'S FACE \nappears in the black, a pin-point at first, spinning round and round and growing larger.  It comes to a rest, eyes glowing. \nARCADE (malevolent) HELLO, ALEX. \nAlex jumps back, dropping the control box.  ARCADE continues to BREATHE. \nALEX How ... \nA thing BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the ARCADE terminal, playing over Alex's face. \nARCADE KISS REALITY GOODBYE. \nON SCREEN \nARCADE'S face spins away, to be replaced by a pixel-rendered image of Alex, dressed in battle gear. \nVideo Alex sets her thrasher on the ground and mounts it. \n", "test1_true": "And from the screen... \nARCADE IN HERE, OF COURSE. \nON SCREEN, \nthe vortex of light EXPLODES around video Alex, twisting reality.  And Alex is spinning round and round, plummeting towards... \nTHE CIRCUIT GRID \nbeneath her, a world of geometric shapes and light and... The words: \"LEVEL ONE\"  flash across the screen and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY \nAlex SLAMS into the ground, splashing up water and smoke alike. We are inside ARCADE now, experiencing what Alex experiences. \nTHE PLAINS -- \nIn many respects it looks like Earth.  Land, water, sky... Yet certain things are off.  Small things, like the color of light, a sluggish smoke-filled RED, or the occasional FLICKER OF LIGHTNING which races beneath the cloud cover above. \nALEX \npulls herself up from the muck, brushing dirt and water from her face. She coughs, totally disoriented.  Looks around. \nLooks at herself.  She's wearing... \nBATTLE GEAR \nThis is the real thing, as opposed to the cartoon version we saw Nick wearing when he played the game before.  It's a cross between a skateboarder's protective guardpads and full-blown armor.  A helmet rests on her head, with a visor raised up. \nAlex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her.  (Note: Depending on the terrain of each level, the thrasher board will adjust itself...working as a skateboard, snowboard, or hover board). \nON ALEX'S RIGHT CYBERGLOVE \nis an LED display.  In the upper left-hand corner it says \"LEVEL ONE\".  To the right, two pulsing bars of light labeled \"TIME ELAPSED\" and \"STRENGTH\". \nAt this very moment, the \"TIME ELAPSED\" bar is just shrinking away to nothing. \nBLINK!  Now it's gone. \nNo rest for the weary. \nA SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM \nis immediately heard on the horizon, and it's the most god-awful noise we've ever heard.  It fills up the world. \nALEX \njerks her head up, terrified. \nALEX (to herself, remembering) Screamer. \nAll around her, the world begins to vibrate... \nSOMETHING \nis rushing towards her now at an unbelievable speed.  The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM is deafening.  The world is shaking apart. \nAnd suddenly the thing is upon her! \nAlex SCREAMS. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ALEX'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAlex flies back from the t.v. screen, violently ripping the goggles and CyberGloves off.  But the SHRIEK is continuing and then she realizes that... \nThe phone is RINGING. \nAlex stops shaking.  The phone continues to RING.  She's back in her room. Everything's fine.  Normal. \nShe glances at the game. \nON SCREEN \nwe see the black again, black with sparks racing past. Benign. \nAlex reaches over and picks up the phone, all the while keeping her eyes glued to the screen. \nALEX (dry-mouthed) Hello? \n", "test1_id": 1509, "test2_input": "the mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer.  Her wrist display indicates that time is up with a prolonged BEEP and her own reflection vanishes.  It's the Screamer in her reflection's place.  Only it's rocketing towards her in the mirror.  It's in front of her this time, instead of behind her. \nRock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers? \nIt's really no choice at all.  Her guts says \"Screamer\". \nAlex leaps and SMASHES into the mirror at full speed.  The world is filled with SHATTERING GLASS and a shower of infinite reflections and then we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LEVEL SEVEN, PIER -- DAY \nThe sound of SHATTERING GLASS carried through as Alex EXPLODES out of the sky.  And it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering... \nTitle reads \"LEVEL SEVEN -- SEA OF DARKNESS\" \nALEX \ncontinues her fall.  She lands hard.  No blue desert sand to cushion her here.  It takes her a moment to rise... \nAlex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.  The shore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.  Storms clouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the open sea, you know what it looks like... \n...the and of the world.  A strange and scary yellow/green sky presses down on us.  It's a hurricane sky.  The calm before the storm. \nON THE HORIZON, \nTWO CITIES can be seen.  Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking, towers jutting up from the sea like knives. \nAT THE END OF THE PIERS \nare two boats.  Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES. Like Charon, the boatman on the river Styx. \nSomewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now. But Alex is preoccupied now.  As she moves down the pier, recognition dawns on her. \nIt's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hair slicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each is holding a wooden staff, staring into space. \nALEX Guys!  Oh my God... \nAlex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement fades.  A chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a metronome, lulling the world into stillness. \nALEX (unsure) Laurie?  Stilts? \nNeither of them acknowledges Alex with their eyes. \nSTILTS (like ARCADE) You may ask one of us a question. One tells the truth, and the other lies. Who you ask, remains your discretion. But if the answer is wrong, the questioner dies. \nLaurie motions to the techno-cities behind her. \nLAURIE (like ARCADE) One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware. \nSTILTS I am The Liar.  Where should I take you? \nLAURIE I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you? \nAlex stares at them a moment, utterly confused.  The sky above darkens, and the wind picks up.  She looks to the horizon, from one city to another, then back at her friends. \nALEX (horrified) What did he do to you? \nLAURIE Is that your question? \nALEX (realizing) Wait!  No!  That's not it! \nBEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  Alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist display anymore.  She begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing at the horizon.  And yes, there's the FLASH followed by the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM. \nALEX (to herself) Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think! \nLAURIE You have no time.  What is your question? \nALEX (snapping back) I'm thinking! \nLAURIE You have no time. \nTHE SCREAMER \nis visible now, arms opening to engulf Alex.  Talk about pressure. \nALEX (she stops pacing) The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar... \nAlex rushes over to Stilts. \nALEX Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right? \nSTILTS (pointing) I came from the city on the left. \nALEX (grins) But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth. \n", "test2_true": "has reached the pier now, rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking the entire structure... \nAlex turns to Laurie. \nALEX (quickly) Take me to the city on the left! \nLaurie nods and steps aside, making room for Alex to climb into the boat. She does and... \nTHE SCREAMER \ndissipates just before it reaches Alex.  It turns into mist and vanishes, the HOWL lingering as an echo long after the Screamer itself has gone. \nAt once, the boat begins to glide through the water, away from the pier. Alex gets a last glimpse of Stilts standing in his boat, diminishing as Alex and Laurie move away from him.  He looks like the loneliest person in the world. \n\"LEVEL EIGHT -- CITY OF TRUTH\" \nEXT. LEVEL SEVEN, OPEN SEA -- LATER \nAs Alex and Laurie near the city, its features become more apparent.  It is truly a Necropolis, black and angular. It's a shadow on the sunset horizon, empty of all life and looming above them. \nJust then, Alex hears a tiny VOICE. \nVOICE (weak) Help...help me... \nA SMALL FIGURE \nbobs in the water about fifty yards in front of them.  It waves it's hands frantically, sinking below the water's surface, then rising once again. It's a little BOY. \nAlex's boat is going to pass right by the boy.  She grabs hold of the gunwale and reaches out for him... \nALEX Grab my hand! \nTheir hands lock and Alex YANKS the boy out of the water as the boat cruises by. \nTHE BOY \ncan't be more than seven or eight.  Small and frail-looking, he shivers in her arms. \nBOY (terrified) Where are we? \nJust then the boat comes to a CRASHING stop, slamming into the black rocks which the city rests on.  Alex and the boy are violently pitched forward and out of the boat. \nThey land roughly on a beach of black gravel.  Alex turns. \nLAURIE \nstands in the boat.  In an instant, night has fallen.  She is a silhouette in the moonlight. \nLAURIE (in a voice like Death) The City of Truth. \nAnd Laurie literally fades before their eyes.  In her place, is a small golden key. \nAlex snatches up the key.  Alex turns back to the boy and... \nINT. LEVEL EIGHT, CONCRETE WASTELAND -- NIGHT \n...Alex and the boy are now standing on the top of a concrete incline.  It extends downward into a system of tunnels and viaducts.  The RINGING starts immediately, followed by the FLASH on the horizon.  Time's already up. The little boy reaches for Alex's hand, frightened. \nALEX How did you get here?  Did you play the game?! \nBOY Yes... \nALEX Thought so. \nAlex removes pulls her Thrasher board from her back and drops it on the lip of the incline.  There's a FLASH and the board has changes into a motorcycle.  A sleek black one. \nALEX Can you hang onto my back? \nThe little boy nods.  He knows that Alex is his only chance of getting out of here.  Nevertheless, we can tell that he's terrified.  Alex kneels down next to him.  The wind around them has picked up and the RINGING increases.  High-pitched, stabbing into our brains. \nALEX (over noise) There's a monster here.  We have to kill it before we can leave.  That's what we have to do.  I know it's scary, but I won't let anything happen to you.  Okay? \nThe boy nods again. \nBOY Then we'll go home? \nALEX Then we'll go home. \nAlex's wrist display starts BEEPING and...BOOM!  The RINGING is replaced by the Screamer's shriek.  In the distance, the Screamer is a fireball spiraling towards the city. \nAlex jumps on the motorcycle and pulls the boy up.  He crawls behind her and hugs her back tightly. \nALEX (pulling down her visor) Here goes everything. \n", "test2_id": 1510, "test3_input": "ALEX Mom? (uncomprehending) You're alive... \nALEX'S MOTHER Of course I am. \nALEX But I don't understand... \nALEX'S MOTHER I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you... \nTears are running freely down Alex's face now. \nALEX'S MOTHER (continuing) I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you? \nALEX (nodding) Yes...but...how did you... \nHer mother looks ecstatic.  And now there are tears in her eyes.  Joy, reunion...it's unclear which. \nALEX'S MOTHER Magic.  We'll be together again. (beat) I know you don't believe in an afterlife, but there is one.  Heaven is real. \nAlex looks around her.  It's all too much to take in.  Her mother.  Back in her own home.  Sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around her in gold and the moment is crystallized.  A still-life.  Forever. \nALEX Is...is that where we are?  Did I die? \nALEX'S MOTHER Not yet, honey... \nHer mother stands and Alex sees that she is holding a gun...no, the gun, in her hands.  She raises at Alex. \nALEX'S MOTHER (continuing) ...but I can fix that. \nAlex has no time to respond.  A still-born scream is frozen in her throat. A split-second of realization.  And then her mother FIRES the gun... \nCRACK!  The bullet hits Alex square in the forehead, snapping her head back as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward.  The world spins to a stop, like a record player running down. \nAlex is killed instantly.  Her body collapse, head thumping unceremoniously against the carpeted floor. \nHER EYES \nopen and fixed on infinity.  No life here.  Seems hard to believe that there ever was. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LEVEL NINE, THE NIGHT ROOM -- \nON ALEX'S FACE \nThere is no bullet-hole in her forehead, but her eyes are just as lifeless. \nTHE PEANUT GALLERY \nRow after row of frozen faces.  Are they aware that Alex has died?  Is there consciousness inside those skulls? \nON ARCADE \nas he crouches over Alex's body.  A smile creeps across his face. \nARCADE OH ALEX.  SO SORRY.  BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, I'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME.  MAYBE I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN. \nHe laughs. \nALEX'S BODY \nbegins to decompose in front of us, skin sinking in and shriveling up.  In moments, she's just a husk. \nARCADE rears back, and is about to turn away, when something catches his eye.  He hears a tiny BEEPING. \nALEX'S WRIST MONITOR \nRemember the stylized symbol of a woman?  The one that said \"FREE LIFE\" beneath it?  Well it disappears now. \nThere's a sudden FLASH behind ARCADE and he spins around.. \nANOTHER ALEX \nis standing behind him. and she's got the heart/sword in her hands! \nALEX Guess what, ass-hole?  You forgot about my free life!!! \nShe DIVES forward, thrusting the sword with all her might. It sinks into ARCADE'S chest and she pushes further, burying it up to the hilt. \nARCADE lets loose the most terribly SCREAM we've ever heard.  It literally shakes world. \nTHE SWORD \nis glowing like molten lava.  The heart-shaped hilt burns into the monster's chest, spreading crackling fire over his entire body.  His body is immersed fire now, vibrating like mad and suddenly... \n...ARCADE EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL OF GREEN LIGHT AND... \n", "test3_true": "Alex stands there a moment, stunned, not quite willing to believe that she's won. \nA NEON SIGN \nabove her drops down.  It flashes \"CONGRATULATIONS\" over and over again. \"CONGRATULATIONS\". \nALEX \nlooks down at herself.  She feels odd.  Something is happening.  She's fading out, as if she were a signal being lost.  Her image stutters, flickers and... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT \nAlex FLASHES back into the real world. And then one by one, so do the others. \nIt's a glorious sight.  Each one is heralded by BUZZING STATIC, and then a rippling in space, an image stuttering in and... \nPOP!  POP!  POP!  One after another come FLASHING back in bursts of light! There are dozens.  The Inferno is filled with them, like a flurry of flashbulbs going off.  Familiar faces and people we've never seen.  Benz, Laurie, Stilts, DeLoach... \nPOP!  And there's Nick!  And more, and still more!  Forty, fifty...  Just how many people did ARCADE take? \nEveryone is grinning, crying, hugging one another. \nSPACE SHIMMERS \njust before Alex.  SOMEONE else is trying to fight their way back.  It's Greg.  He's blinking back into reality. \nALEX (crying) Greg!!! \nHe flickers for a moment, tentative... \nGREG (fading in and out) Alex!  You did it! \n...and then he's back for good.  He wraps his arms around Alex, grabbing her so tight that it's almost painful.  Both of them are sobbing. \nGREG (in between kisses) You did it... \nTogether, the two of them start towards the door, eager to leave this place. \nIn groups of twos and threes, the others follow. \nEXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAWN \nOutside, light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world. Alex glances up and can't help but notice the streetlight fading out as the sun returns.  She points and laughs. \nWE BEGIN TO RISE UP, \nas Nick and the others join them.  Everyone is laughing now.  It's uncontrollable.  This is positive.  Life affirming.  And hell, we should probably wrap this thing up on that note. \nWe should... \n...but we won't. \nWE WATCH \nas a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving, bit by bit, until only our original group is left. \nTHE GROUP \nas they make their way down the street and away from The Inferno. \nGREG So how did you do it, Alex? \nALEX Well, it's a long story... \nAlex catches Nick's eye briefly, and he smiles.  Whatever happened between them is over now.  Friends again. \nSuddenly Alex stops in her tracks, a look of concern washing over her face. \nNICK What is it? \nALEX I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game... (turning to Nick) ...what if ARCADE did too? \nA beat as the group mulls it over.  Then Greg shakes his head. \nGREG Nah.  You won, right?  You played by the rules. \nGreg's right.  Alex grins and dismisses the thought. \nALEX Okay.  Forget I ever said it. \nThe group moves away from us once more. \n", "test3_id": 1511}

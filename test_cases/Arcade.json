I do have parents, you know. \nAlex spins around and points at the computer monitor. \nALEX There! \nTHE MONITOR \nARCADE is back on again, fractals unfolding and green monitor light blinking. \nON NICK \nOkay.  Alright.  This does throw him for a second. \nALEX It turned itself back on, Nick. \nNICK No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens. \nNick crosses to the monitor and flips the \"OFF\" switch.  He tries it again and again, but the game won't turn off. \nALEX It's alive, Nick.  It's listening to us ... \nNick spins around, angry, maybe a little freaked out. \nNICK Just shut up!  Enough already, okay? \nSilence for a moment.  Nick takes a deep breath.  Over-reacted.  After a moment... \nNICK Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium. \nALEX Call the others.  Laurie, Benz... \nNick acquiesces.  He pulls out his phone and punches in a number. \nNICK I'll try Stilts.  He's got insomnia. \nNick and Alex watch each other in silence as the connection is made.  We can faintly hear the phone RINGING. \nNo answer. \nNICK Okay...Laurie, then. \nAlex turns away, sinking to Nick's bed.  All the anger has drained out of her.  She knows they won't reach them. \nON NICK \nAs he listens for an answer.  Three RINGS, four, five... He hangs up. Punches in the final number. \nNICK Benz... \nAgain.  No answer. \nNick hangs up and sets the phone aside.  He looks at Alex. \nALEX (fatalistic) Something's happened to them. \nNICK It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them. \nALEX All of them? \nNick shrugs.  He's not willing to accept anything, but he's uncomfortable all the same. \nNICK Look, why are you fucking with me like this? \nAlex rises.  She's tired.  Tired and scared. \nALEX Because I didn't know where else to go. \nNICK (glances at a clock) It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning. \nAnd then, more for himself than for her. \nNICK (continuing) It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right? \nALEX (half-hearted) Sure. \nShe turns and climbs back out the window onto the roof.

Where are the others? \nNick shrugs, looking elsewhere. \nSTILTS Sick? \nALEX Everybody's sick, huh? (glances at watch) It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that. \nSTILTS (to Nick) What's her problem? \nALEX Did you play ARCADE last night? \nSTILTS Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted... \nAlex nods, glaring at Nick.  His reluctance to believe her is understandable, but the events unfolding are scaring him. \nALEX You want to hear something else, Nick? I tried to call them this morning...Greg, Benz, Laurie...  Their phones are out of order. \nAlex reaches into her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper with names on it. \nALEX (continuing) And then I started thinking...about everyone else that was at Dante's yesterday.  I drew up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ... their phones are out of order too. \nStilts starts HUMMING The Twilight Zone theme. \nNICK (annoyed) So what do you want me to do? \nAlex softens, then reaches for Nick's hand. \nALEX We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone... \nNICK No way. \nALEX If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure. (pleading) Come on, Nick. \nNICK Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean? \nNick and Alex rise. \nSTILTS So you guys are cutting school?  Lemme go with you. \nNICK Just stay here, Stilts. \nALEX (dead serious) And don't watch any television. \nStilts thinks Nick and Alex are involved in some sort of joke, but he's playing along, grinning. \nSTILTS Oh, okay.  Forget Twilight Zone, now we're talking Outer Limits here.  We control your horizontal, your vertical... \nNICK Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're not back... \nSTILTS I'll call the National Guard.  I got it under control. (giggles) Oh, just one more thing.  Is it a supernatural thing you guys are going off to fight, or is it aliens, like Pod People and stuff like that?  Cause there's a difference, you know.  One you need garlic and silver bullets for, the other... \nNICK (irritated) Look at me, Stilts.  Am I laughing? \nThe grins fades from Stilts' face.

This time a wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her, the golden key sticking out of the lock. \nAs Alex reaches for it, the Screamer enters Level Four.

You can get a free life on Level Four, but you have to wait for the last possible instant... \nAlex turns and waits calmly for the Screamer. \nTHE SCREAMER \nis a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish face bearing down on her... \nIT'S JAWS \nflare open to engulf her. \nAlex doesn't flinch at all.

LEVEL SIX, SHOCK CORRIDOR -- NIGHT \nAlex steps out of a doorway into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway is mirrored on one side.  It has no doors or windows, and up ahead, it branches off to the right and the left. \nAlex turns and looks behind her.  The doorway she came through is gone now.  A mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staring back at her. \nTHE REFLECTION \nThere are subtle changes.  They shouldn't be noticeable at first, but the reflection seems somehow more threatening. \nAlex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her.  Up ahead, she hears a BUZZING noise, drawing closer. \nLIGHT flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it is that's BUZZING.  Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor, turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex. \nThe light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown back against the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her and disappears into the mirror at the hall's end.  It's like a moving electrical pulse. \nALEX \nShe's been given a pretty good jolt.  Her hands shake for a moment, an after-seizure of sorts, and she stands... \nHER MIRRORED REFLECTION \nis watching her, arms crossed.  This wouldn't be a problem were it not for the fact that Alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed! \nALEX (to her reflection) Fuck you. \nThe reflection grins and its/her eyes GLOW with fractals. \nALEX REFLECTION (in ARCADE'S voice) ANY TIME, BITCH. \nSpooked, Alex continues down the hallway, reaching the end and turning left... \nNEW CORRIDOR \nAlex moves quicker now, glancing left as her reflection follows. \nBUZZZZZ!!!  Here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floor from a side corridor... \nAlex LEAPS over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. Now she's getting the hang of it.  She starts forward again. \nBUZZZZZ!!!  Here come two at a time from opposite directions... \nAlex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the path of the second.  Then she jumps back to the right again... \nTHE TWO STREAKS \npass by, zipping away from each other. \nANOTHER CORRIDOR \nThe pace quickens, with Alex racing down the corridors. She turns corner after corner.  It's become a virtual maze. \nWe cut back to Alex's \"STRENGTH\" and \"TIME ELAPSED\" meters again and again.  Both are shrinking away to nothing. \nAnd all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing increasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, the reflection seems to gain more strength. \nBUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with more frequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumping left and right, with SPARKS exploding around her. \nTHE REFLECTION \nseems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a little different.  What's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that Alex's reflection is turning into The Screamer. \nAlex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her.  The corridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light. SPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over. \nShe stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a streak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away. \nBEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!  Alex is up and running now, desperate. \nWe cut faster and faster  Alex running, the streaks of light, the reflection until... \nEND CORRIDOR \nShe's back where she started.  And the corridor dead-ends in a mirrored wall... \nBEHIND ALEX, \nDozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her.

Her armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's impossible to tell who's blood, though.  She looks like she's just walked out of a slaughter-house. \nA bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns... \nARCADE'S BRAIN \nlooms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky and keeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down it, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely appears to be alive. \nTWO GLASS DOORS \nswing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within the building, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls completely, ending just at Alex's feet. \nAbove the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time, \"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE\".  Fucking-A. \nAlex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore. \nTHE BOY \nlooks up at Alex, frightened. \nBOY We have to go in there, don't we? \nAlex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet towards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain. \nINT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT \nInside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OF VOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channels being changed.  A snippet of an opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice there...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, a woman in the throes of orgasm, Nazis screaming \"HEIL HITLER!\", anything and everything. \nSIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF... \nCatchy phrases like, \"THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT\", and \"I THINK, THEREFORE, I'M FUCKED\" flash before us. \nT.V. MONITORS \nare everywhere, displaying an endless array of STATIC.  And now the monitors are displaying FRACTALS.  Every single one of them.  We hear the CELLOS, like an orchestra tuning up. \nALEX \nthrows her hands over her ears as the SOUNDS become unbearable. \nALEX (top of her lungs) SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nShe pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting the fuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and... \n...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink off, and it's dark once again. \nINT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM -- \nA SPOTLIGHT \ncomes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else is dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on forever. \nMORE LIGHTS \ncome on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends. They're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in rows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell. \nAnd now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice. A frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very unusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had just pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S heart. \nAlex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved into the ice. \nAlex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden keys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit them together...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a single, greater key. \nTHE KEY \nAlex fits it into the keyhole and turns it. \nTHE CASE OF ICE \nsplits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg is frozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiff grip, lifting it up. \nALEX (looking around) Okay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you? \nNo answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness. \nALEX (shouting) Where are you, damnit?! \nHer voice echoes in the cavernous room. \nARCADE (O.S.) RIGHT HERE, BITCH. \nAlex spins around and... \n", "test3_true": "stands before her.  He grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light. We can hear him BREATHING now, just like before.

THEN I WENT TO SLEEP FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP, I WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE... (shivers) ...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD... \nARCADE begins to change, shaking and ROARING as something black and insect-like bursts out of the boy's skin.  It claws at its face, ripping the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath. \nNothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her and it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alex finds a reserve of strength. \nAlex swings the sword and... \nARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that's academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat. \nARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning her there.  He thrusts his face into hers. \nARCADE YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART FOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE ARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT, I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX. THANK-YOU SO MUCH. \nARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air that isn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  She tries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't... \nHER P.O.V. \nas she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then the images swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness. \nARCADE YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN. \nARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags her across the floor... \nA DOORWAY \nstands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness beyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality. It sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort of primal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever. \nALEX (screaming) No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nShe twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  He shoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto the doorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slip and she tumbles through. \nARCADE slams the door shut. \nARCADE GOODBYE, ALEX.

Somewhere, we can hear a clock TICKING.  But other than that the house is silent, in stark contrast to the storm of sounds a moment ago. \nTHE HOUSE \nlooks just like the dream/flashback we saw earlier. Everything is white. Bright and dreamlike.  Hyper reality. Alex looks up and... \nANOTHER ALEX \nis sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap. Reserved. \nOTHER ALEX Time.  That's all I ever think about anymore.  It's like there's never enough of it, you know? \nThe other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look down the long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A door we've seen before.  The words fade in like phantoms... \nMAN (V.O.) So where are you then? \nALEX (V.O.) I'm in the past. \nALEX (a whisper) No ... oh no ... \nWith a building sense of dread, Alex moves towards that doorway.  She stops at the threshold, terrified. \nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY \nEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases. Everything looks perfect. \nWe turn with Alex.  Ever so slowly.  Over to the right and the entranceway of the bathroom.  Over to where her mother is... \n...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth! \nALEX'S MOM Hi, honey. \nHER MOTHER \nlooks beautiful.  Eyes sparkling.  Alive and vital. \nAlex can't believe what she's seeing.  Immediately, tears come to her eyes and her voice falters... \n", "test3_id": 1511}

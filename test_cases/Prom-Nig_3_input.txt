ADELE Nope. Haven't seen him all afternoon. 
KIM And he didn't leave a message? 
ADELE Not a word. 
KIM 
(PUZZLED) Strange... He usually gives me a ride home. 
ADELE Let me finish and I'll give you a lift. 
KIM Thanks, but I can walk. Kim starts to leave, turning around at the door. 
KIM 
(CONTINUING) Guess I won't be seeing you again. Standing on her head, Adele smiles. 
ADELE Guess again. Three different students asked me to the prom tonight... I thought you had to be enrolled! 
KIM You're going? 
ADELE 
(NODS) Not with any of them. Know any good-looking fathers?

KIM 
(SMILES) - I'll keep my eyes open. See you later. She exits as Adele slowly lowers her legs to the floor. 
85 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 85 
Jude approaches her locker, stops. There's a picture taped to her locker door, her picture, ripped out of the Winston High Yearbook. She looks at it, reaches up and pulls it off the door. She winces, looks at her finger. It's bleeding. She looks at the picture. There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it. Jude hears SOMEONE COMING. She turns to see Kelly com- ing toward her. 
KELLY Jude... look... She has something in her hand. It's a photo of her, a, Yearbook photo with the same torn edges. Jude holds up her version. 
KELLY 
(CONTINUING) Why? 
86 INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY 86 
The DOOR CREAKS open. A light is flicked on. Sykes stands there, a broom and a big waste-pan in his hands. He stares at the broken mirror with its center hole and its missing wedge. He shuffles across the floor and starts to clean up the debris. 
87 EXT. HAMMONDS' HOUSE - DUSK 87 
The split-level suburban residence sits on a tree-lined street in an older, middle-class neighborhood. Walking up the driveway, Kim hears a LOUD THUD from behind the house. As the SOUND CONTINUES, Kim walks around back to investigate. 
88 EXT. HAMONDS ' BACKYARD - DUSK 88 
Stepping around the corner of the house, Kim sees her father furiously chopping an old stump in the flower garden.

(LAUGHS) Ma'am? How old do you think I am? He gives her a wary look. Considers. 
COLTER Twenty five? She smiles, pleased. 
CHRISTINA No, but thanks. 
(BEAT) What did you mean, there's a criminal on the train? How do you know that? Colter looks away. Careful. 
COLTER I just do. 
CHRISTINA How can I help you if you don't tell me everything about this? 
INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING 
Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to follow him into the bathroom. 
COLTER You said you wanted to know. 
CHRISTINA Can't you just tell me? He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in next to him. 
CHRISTINA Try anything and I'll kill you. 
COLTER Shut the door. As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink. 
CHRISTINA What are you doing? He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside. 
COLTER It's up here. He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest of the way. 
CHRISTINA (startled, feels his hands 
ON HER) What are you -- 
COLTER Just look. Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb. 
CHRISTINA Is that...? 
COLTER Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid explosive. There's fourteen cannisters of it. Simple detonator. Cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom. He lowers her. An incredulous beat. 
CHRISTINA Did you put this here? 
COLTER No. It was someone else. They don't know who. That's why I'm here. To find out. Watching her. Will she believe him? 
CHRISTINA We have to tell someone. We have to stop this. 
INT. TRAIN - MORNING 
The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away. Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her. 
COLTER It won't matter. The train's already... 
CHRISTINA Already what? 
COLTER I've been sent here. It sounds crazy, but it's true. I've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future. This train's already been blown up. She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be. 
COLTER You wanted to know. Now you know. She turns and hurries for the exit doors. 
CHRISTINA This isn't happening. I've got to get off. Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's stabbing at the door release button. 
CHRISTINA Why won't it open?! Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the number. 
CHRISTINA It's Steph.

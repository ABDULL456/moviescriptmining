ROBY Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs. 
STANDARD Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean. 
FAUST I kind of like it. 
ROBY You like this shit? 
FAUST It grows on you. 
ROBY You know what they make this stuff out of? 
FAUST (annoyed) Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  You're eating it. 
ROBY I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all. 
HUNTER Do we have to talk about this kind of crap at the dinner table? 
Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS. 
STANDARD What's wrong? 
BROUSSARD (his voice straining) I don't know... I'm getting these CRAMPS! 
The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips. He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles whitening. 
STANDARD Breathe deeply. 
BROUSSARD (screaming) OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD! 
ROBY What Dell -- what? 
Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot. 
BROUSSARD (incoherent shriek) OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!! 
A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC. 
THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT. 
Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and bolts. 
The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground. 
When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped. Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest, spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime. 
HUNTER Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
FAUST What was that?  What the Christ was that? 
MELKONIS It was growing in him the whole time and he didn't even know it! 
Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse. 
ROBY That thing used him for an incubator! 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped body tumbles silently out. 
AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into eternity. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS 
The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge. 
MELKONIS We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose. 
HUNTER We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers. 
ROBY But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space. 
FAUST Shit... 
STANDARD We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. 
MELKONIS (sighs) Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting. 
STANDARD We've got about a week left, right? 
HUNTER And then we run out of food and oxygen. 
FAUST The water will still recycle. 
ROBY We won't need it then. 
STANDARD All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time. 
ROBY But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.

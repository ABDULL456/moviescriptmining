HANDS                        - 
I 'l l pay for it, I won't pay you the top fuckin whack but you'll never get that anyway. You got it? 
BRICK TOP 
I can't sell you something I haven't got now can I? BTT returns to them - there is a scream from Ken 
KEN 
You're a dead fuckin man. You listen to me Tony you're a dead fuckin... Brick top frowns at Ken, and Ken shuts up quickly. 
BRICK TOP 
What did you do to upset Ken, Tony? Tony shrugs 
KEN 
He's pissed in my fuckin pocket, look! Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers. 
BRICK TOP 
Do shut up Ken.   That was a bit naughty Tony. Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression. 
HANDS 
Well come on, let's have a look. Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his eye. 
HANDS (CONT'D) 
What are you playing at? - He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground. 
HANDS (CONT'D) 
It's a zirconia. We crash track in to Brick Top's expression of shock. 
115   INT. VAULT(DOUG'S OFFICE) 
The four black guys are trying to pick the lock of the vault, having been locked in it by Bullet Tooth, Hands and Doug. 
VINNY 
I changed the stone. 
SOL 
You what? 
VINNY 
I changed it. I know Brick Top knows nothing about stones. 
SOL 
Yes but Doug the fuckin head does! 
VINNY 
Yeah well I didn't expect them to lock us up in here did I? 
SOL 
Ohh your one clever bastard Vin, you really are. Where is it? 
VINNY 
It's at Lincoln's. 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
What the fuck's it doing at my place? 
VINNY 
Waiting for us to pick it up. 
SOL 
What happen if they find that it's a fake stone Vince? 
VINNY 
Well we are going to get fucked Sol what do you think is going to happen? The door opens. 
BTT 
Ohh yes you are going to get fucked Vince.                 -

A distant voice is shouting 
TURKISH 
Oi Micky.   Oi Micky. 
117 ' INT. VAN -- NIGHT 
We fade out of black to Micky's pov. Thisis shot in slow motion. Micky opens his eyes, in the backof.a large van, there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his tired eyes. 
TURKISH 
You feeling alright Micky? 
MICKY 
I've felt better. 
TURKISH 
We are nearly there. They are a horrible bunch this lot Micky so pay attention to what you are doing. Micky just yawns. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Put up some kind of a show, he's a hard bastard this "good night" Anderson so don't get too clever, he used to be a pro. Just keep moving round the ring, and let the odd one go when push has come to shove. 
MICKY 
Let's get on with it, shall we? 
118   INT. WAREHOUSE                                -    ' 
A temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of padding. Around the    ropes it's starting to fill. Brick Top approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'.

PETER Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat. If it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie. 
CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE 
HEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane. 
HEATHER CHANDLER If you're going to openly be a bitch.... 
VERONICA (submissive) I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people? 
HEATHER CHANDLER Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad. 
She points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed students. Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both. 
THE GEEKS' TABLE 
The GEEKS react to being pointed at. Their boney leader RODNEY splatters milk over himself. 
RODNEY Did you see that? Heather Number One looked right at us. 
BIG CYNIC It must be love. 
CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE 
VERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER. 
VERONICA Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna? 
HEATHER CHANDLER Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior. 
VERONICA Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims. 
HEATHER CHANDLER (giving in) Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school. 
MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE 
Her sweaty lips moving rapidly, MARTHA anxiously reads the note. 
THE GEEKS' TABLE 
The nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers. 
GEEK WITH BRACES No seriously, I'd probably go to the Pyrimads. With a girl. 
GEEK WITH GLASSES Where you going to get a girl, stud? K-Mart? 
BIG CYNIC Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind. You sentimental old fart. 
BRACES Geez, forget it. 
VERONICA What about you Rodney? 
RODNEY (quietly to the others) I told you she knew my name. (beat of contemplation) I'd change my life. New clothes. New haircut. New house. New home. 
HEATHER CHANDLER How sad! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip. 
VERONICA tugs HEATHER CHANDLER away from the table. 
VERONICA If you're going to openly be a bitch.... 
VERONICA again catches sight of the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY. He wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back. The egg is gone. He smiles. VERONICA smiles back. 
Her trance is broken by a boisterous HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE who careen into the two pollsters. 
HEATHER MCNAMARA God, scan on Martha Dumptruck. 
POV ON MARTHA 
MARTHA looks up from the note to the JOCKS' table and KURT KELLY, then flustered, back down at the note. 
HEATHER CHANDLER This is the part I hate. The waiting. I'd say we're like twenty minutes from major humiliation. Come on, Veronica. 
HEATHER CHANDLER floats off. A disturbed VERONICA takes a moment to react. 
HEATHER CHANDLER Veronica? 
VERONICA follows the leader. She calls out. 
VERONICA Damn..

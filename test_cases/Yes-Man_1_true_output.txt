Carl gets dressed. He puts on his suit and tie. His apartment is noticeably nicer than the last time we saw it. 
EXT. STREET 
Carl drives down the street in a FANCY CAR. He PULLS INTO DUNKIN DONUTS. He gets out of the car and passes a guy handing out fliers. 
FLIER GUY You want to pawn -- 
CARL No. 
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts. 
INT. DUNKIN DONUTS 
The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an -- 
CARL No. 
Carl hands the Cashier the money. 
INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE 
Carl sits in his office.   Lucy walks in. 
CARL Hey, Luce. What're you doing all the way over here? 
LUCY It's been hard to reach you. 
CARL I've been a little swamped. 
LUCY Everything OK? 
CARL Yeah.   Things are great. 
LUCY I was wondering when you want to meet with the florist. 
CARL Sorry, but I'm too busy these days. Don't have time to help with the party anymore. Good luck. 
LUCY You're just stopping, just like that? 
CARL I'm not the one marrying you. Maybe you should ask him for some help. 
LUCY He is helping. Here I was thinking we were actual friends. 
Lucy leaves, upset.   Carl doesn't move. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK CORPORATE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM 
Carl, Chris and the other VPs sit around the conference table. 
CHRIS PARKER (with great importance) What is the best way for us to enter the teenage credit card market? 
VP Give away a free iPod. 
CHRIS PARKER Yes. 
ANOTHER VP Include one with cans of Mountain Dew Code Red. 
CHRIS PARKER Nice.   Anyone else? Carl? 
CARL Have you guys thought that teenagers don't have the financial knowhow to use a credit card? 
CHRIS PARKER That's why they're such a ripe market. Any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit? 
CARL Include a Mastercard with every xBox. 
CHRIS PARKER I like that. I like that a lot. 
Chris SLAPS FIVE with Carl. 
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) Now remember, tomorrow's our official merger ceremony with KBI. So wear your nice suits. I'm talking to you, Feldman. 
All the VPs laugh.   Carl fake laughs along with them. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl gets home.   He hits play on his answering machine. 
PETER (V.O.) (over the answering MACHINE) Hey, Carl. Peter here. Long time no see. Sorry to hear you won't be planning our engagement party. Although I guess that makes you less gay than I thought you were. We'll be watching the game at Rudy's tonight, if you're interested. 
Carl DELETES the message. He FLIPS ON Survivor and starts to absentmindedly sort through his mail. He throws away junkmail until he gets to a postcard that catches his eye. He reads the postcard. 
JASON (V.O.) Dear Carl. I know this is kind of random, but I thought I should write you. We met at that party at Norman's apartment. I was the INS guy who hated his life and hated you. I just wanted to tell you that I took your advice. I quit my job and have founded a home in Botswana for elderly orangutans. I've never been happier. You told me to say "yes" and it has turned out to be incredible. Thank you. Yours truly, Jason Newmark 
Carl TURNS OVER the post card.   On the cover of the card is a picture an orangutan. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl's alarm goes off. He opens his eyes. He's PROPPED the post card up next to his alarm clock. The orangutan seems to be staring into his soul.

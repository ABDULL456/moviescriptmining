THE DOORMAN (standing there) (Can he walk?) 
KIRILL stirs. His stupor a futile attempt to escape.                 Eyes still those of an exceptionally hard man. 
A minute later. KIRILL can walk. The most graceful drunk you've ever seen. Making his way through the club. Tuning out everything but the need to get to THE DOOR and --

GRETKOV sitting in his Mercedes, not happy. 
FOLLOW CAR and SECURITY and ASSISTANT equally unhappy.

KIRILL blinking against the sunlight -- trying to process.

THE KITCHEN. He drops his briefcase on the table, opens the fridge for a drink. Except what he comes out with is -- 
A GUN! 
Wheeling around. The salaryman is JARDA.        JARDA from Bourne's dream. But as he turns -- 
BOURNE behind him.   Bigger gun.     Waiting.   So ready. 
BOURNE I emptied it. 
JARDA (a total pro) Felt a little light. 
BOURNE Drop it. 
JARDA lets the gun fall, looks his old comrade over a beat. 
But Bourne's not interested in a reunion. 
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D) Here... 
Bourne tosses him FLEXCUFFS -- JARDA puts his hands behind his back, turns to let BOURNE cinch them. 
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D) Front.    Use your teeth. 
JARDA (caught scamming) Sorry. Old habits. 
Sit. BOURNE kicks over a chair. JARDA (CONT'D)                              * Word in the ether was you'd lost your memory. 
BOURNE checking JARDA'S briefcase -- tearing through it -- 
BOURNE You still should've moved. 
JARDA I like it here. (a beat) (MORE) 
JARDA (CONT'D) Last time I saw you was Greece.      You had a good spot. 
BOURNE reacts -- doesn't look over -- but realizes... 
JARDA (CONT'D)                          * I had the gi   rl. I had her lined up that whole aftern   oon. Waiting for you, that was the prob   lem. (defen   sive) You ever do    two targets? It's tough. 
BOURNE turns.   Cold. 
JARDA (CONT'D)                             * (his real question) So why didn't you kill me then?                        * 
BOURNE She wouldn't let me. (beat) She's the only reason you're alive. 
Silence.   JARDA down a peg.       Or two. 
JARDA What do you want? 
BOURNE Conklin.

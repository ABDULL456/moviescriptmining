AMANDA (thrilled with this game) Noooo! I don't like the crusts on! 
DOYLE 
(FAKES REMEMBERING) That' s right, that's right. Patrick and Angie have ducked into the woods. They are both in shock. 
PATRICK Jesus. 
ANGIE She's alive. 
SERIES OF FLASHBACKS SHOWING WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN 
EXTREMELY QUICK SUCCESSION. 
-       EXT. TOWNSEND ROAD - AFTERNOON 
Patrick walks down Doyle's driveway toward the car. Angie is sitting, leaned up against the hood, he head tilted forward. As Patrick draws near, she lifts her head up to him and we see she has been crying. This isn't what Patrick expected and he is taken aback for a beat, long enough for Angie to say: 
ANGIE She's happy. 
PATRICK No.. . 
ANGIE She' s happy here. 
(BEAT) I saw her. 
PATRICK Angie, don't do this. 
ANGIE If you call the Police they'll send her back. 
PATRICK I need you on my side. 
ANGIE I am on your side but I can't send her back. 
PATRICK We're not sending her anywhere. That's her mother. She has a right to her child. 
ANGIE He's better for her. 
PATRICK Why? Because he has money and makes sandwiches? 
ANGIE 
SIMPLY) Because he loves her. 
PATRICK Helene loves her, too. 
ANGIE No. 
PATRICK She might learn from this. 
ANGIE No.   People don't change. 
Angle grows more impassioned. 
ANGIE (CONT'D) Helene is arsenic. She'll kill her. She'll burn the life out of her. 
PATRICK You can't take away someone's kid. 
ANGIE I don't want to.   I want to leave their child with them. 
PATRICK ~ l this time we wanted to bring her 
L home. Why is that wrong now? 
ANGIE Because I know right and wrong when I see it. 
PATRICK I need you to understand me right now. I need you to love me and say I know this is a hard decision but I stand by you. I need you to take me home and make this okay. 
ANGIE I can do that. I can take you home and I know how to make it okay. 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
ANGIE (CONT'D) It will be okay because every now and again we'll talk about her and where she might be and what grade she's in and we'll be proud of her and that will be okay. 
(BEAT) Because we'll know she's in a good school and safe and has sleep overs and birthday parties and smiles every day. 
(BEAT) And maybe sometime we'll drive out here and watch a softball game with a teenager in it from the back bleachers and we'll see how much she's grown. And then I'll take you home and we' 11 know it's okay. 
PATRICK You can't ask me to do something I can't do. 
ANGIE You can't ask me to live with it, 
She makes a plea. 
ANGIE (CONT'D) Patrick, for me. Please? 
(BEAT) I'll hate you for doing it.   I don't want to but I will. 
She walks away, leaving him alone by the side of the road. 
EXT. DOYLE SUMMER COTTAGE, DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
We push in, approaching Doyle who turns to see Patrick. Doyle watches Patrick. He offers a measured greeting.

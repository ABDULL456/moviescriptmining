EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT 
As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS." 
FOLEY Have your clothes cleaned and send me the bill. 
Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade, move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers blinking. 
KAREN I'll send it to you at Glades. 
GLENN Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer? 
FOLEY Take your sunglasses off. 
GLENN I see better with them on. 
FOLEY You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head. 
Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Wait in the car. 
GLENN You're in civilization now, man, ease up. 
FOLEY I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back. 
GLENN In the trunk? 
FOLEY The backseat. 
Foley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen... 
GLENN Come on.  I have to do what I'm told. 
She walks past Foley without looking at him. 
FOLEY Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat. (looks at Buddy) Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes. 
BUDDY I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car. 
KAREN You can blame me if you want.  I don't mind. 
He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds it up, then throws it at Foley's feet. 
GLENN Here you are, sir. 
Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back on and takes Karen by the arm. 
BUDDY What's wrong with you? 
Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the backseat. 
FOLEY Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know. 
BUDDY How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with? 
FOLEY His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out. 
Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform, all of them caked with muck. 
BUDDY You're pulling at it.  Here... 
He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and tearing the shirt. 
FOLEY I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out. 
BUDDY He ain't the problem, Jack. 
Foley looks at him. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) You wanna pull your head outta your ass and tell me why we're bringing her with us? 
INT. CAR - SAME 
As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door. He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs his hand through his hair... 
GLENN ...if he thinks he can talk to me like this.  Shit, I don't even know what I need them for. 
Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against the dark foliage. 
GLENN (CONT'D) I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January-- 
KAREN Glenn? 
His head turns so that we can see his designer shades. 
KAREN (CONT'D) You don't remember me, do you? 
GLENN (beat) It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there. 
KAREN No, that's not what I'm thinking. 
He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face. 
GLENN But you're sure we've met, huh? 
KAREN Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels. (then) I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled. 
He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's been turned to stone. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if we can work this out... 
He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead... 
KAREN (CONT'D) Do we have a gun in the car? 
GLENN I remember you now.  Shit. 
KAREN Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him. 
She touches his shoulder and he jumps. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are focused straight ahead. 
She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her. 
ARMANI SUIT She's gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator. You make the pick-up. 
PLAID SPORTCOAT Piece of cake. 
EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport window and SEES MARY 
WALKING ALONG. 
When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too. She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He turns to see a car irectly behind him. 
LLOYD (to car's driver) Drive around me, you pinhead! 
When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION. 
He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim. 
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL 
The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at each other, dumbstruck. 
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE 
Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion of numbers. 
LLOYD Damn! 
QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away. 
EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 
Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. 
HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision of the Police Officer. 
He takes off after it, but to no avail. LLOYD You can't do this! I'll lose my job! 
As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his fingers through his hair. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON 
We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building. They disappear inside without acknowledging each other. 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat. They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE 
MENTAL). 
MENTAL Who the hell do you figure this guy's working for? 
SHAY I don't know, but we'd better find out... 
Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them. 
SHAY (CONT'D) Your ulcer? 
MENTAL It ain't gonna kill me. 
INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR 
Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment. 
INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM 
Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY, tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY. 
The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes. 
HARRY I got fired again. 
Lloyd shakes his head. 
LLOYD I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. 
HARRY None taken. Were you shitcanned, too? 
LLOYD Of course not. (beat) I quit. 
HARRY Why'd you quit? 
LLOYD I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me.

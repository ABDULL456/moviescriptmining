Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to see INDY still sitting on the ground. 
HENRY Let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? Come on let's go! 
HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA. 
DONOVAN The Canyon of the Crescent Moon. 
Now ELSA peers through the binoculars. 
EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY 
INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger. 
Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles, camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TEMPLE - DAY 
INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see: 
THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER 
He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath. What's going on here? 
FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE 
THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter. 
ELSA AND DONOVAN 
watch him from a safe distance. 
THE TURK 
is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED. 
THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier. 
THE TURK 
takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND BOUNCE across the ground. 
INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH 
react to the sight. 
ELSA AND DONOVAN 
She looks at him, horrified. 
DONOVAN Helmut, another volunteer! 
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly... 
The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns. 
FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE 
INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers. 
ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues more coldly. 
ELSA (to INDY) I never expected to see you again. 
INDY I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up. 
DONOVAN Step back now, Doctor Schneider. Give Doctor Jones some room. He's going to recover the Grail for us. 
CONTINUED: 
INDY laughs. 
DONOVAN Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history? 
INDY As what? A Nazi stooge like you? 
DONOVAN (scornfully) Nazis?!Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo. (he draws his pistol) The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me. 
INDY Shooting me won't get you anywhere. 
DONOVAN You know something, Doctor Jones?... you're absolutely right. 
Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters his side below the ribs. 
INDY Dad?! 
HENRY Junior. . . 
ELSA No!! 
DONOVAN ( to ELSA) Get back!

GABRIEL Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear. 
MARION Flanking riders? 
GABRIEL I didn't see any. 
Marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word.  Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father. 
EXT.  SANTEE ROAD - NIGHT 
The British convoy rounds the curve.  When two-thirds of the wagons have crossed the bridge, Marion FIRES, killing the Redcoat of highest rank, a CAPTAIN. 
BILLINGS AND DALTON heave CORKED BOTTLES which break, spreading their OILY CONTENTS on the wooden bridge. 
BROTHER JOSEPH fires a FLAMING ARROW, igniting the oil. 
The BRIDGE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, cutting off the tail of the convoy, stranding a dozen wagons and the herd of horses on Marion's side of the river. 
A REDCOAT LIEUTENANT takes command. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT Across the river!  Covering fire! Double rank! 
Marion calls to his men. 
MARION Epaulets first... Kill the officers. 
Marion and his men FIRE A WITHERING VOLLEY, KILLING ALL REDCOATS OF RANK -- two lieutenants, a sergeant and several corporals. 
The LEADERLESS REDCOAT PRIVATES take cover as Marion's men OPEN UP on the Redcoats on their side of the river. 
MARION THE WAGONS! 
With half of his men FIRING COVER, Marion and the other half run to the wagons, passing Redcoat dead and wounded... 
DALTON, notices a WOUNDED REDCOAT and pauses... 
The Redcoat looks up imploringly at Dalton who finishes reloading, then coldly FIRES, KILLING THE helpless Redcoat... 
Marion, Gabriel and Rev. Oliver see Dalton kill the wounded Redcoat as they race toward the wagons, British musketballs SPLINTERING TREES all around them... 
The horses nearest the burning bridge are terrified, BUCKING AND REARING, STRUGGLING in their traces... 
MARION LEAPS INTO THE SEAT of one wagon.  Gabriel and Billings grab the reins of two more wagons. 
The Redcoats keep up a STEADY FIRE.  TWO OF MARION'S MEN FALL, one dead another wounded. 
Marion, Gabriel and Billings STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE FRIGHTENED HORSES, backing them up around the curve to the cover of the woods. 
MARION'S REARGUARD, Brother Joseph, Abner, Dan Scott and others, withdraws in leapfrog, FIRING BACK ACROSS THE RIVER. 
BRITISH MUSKET BALLS SLAM into the trees and SPLINTER THE WAGONS... 
Another of Marion's men is WOUNDED.  Two of his comrades HEAVE HIM onto one of the wagons... 
As Marion's men get the wagons turned and unblocked from each other, they DRIVE THEM OFF, one after another... 
Brother Joseph, Abner and the rest of the rearguard make it to Marion and LEAP INTO HIS WAGON... 
MARION snaps the reins and they THUNDER OFF, away from the BURNING BRIDGE and the FIRING Redcoats. 
EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAY 
Marion's men tend their wounded and look through the British wagons, taking inventory. 
REV. OLIVER ... two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping... 
BILLINGS We have enough arms for an army. Now all we need is an army. 
Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  They overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans. 
SCOTT Reamer, boring tool... 
MARION Swage, broach, etching tool... 
FIELDING A rolling gunsmith's shop... 
SCOTT We can rifle those musket barrels... 
FIELDING Get another hundred yards out of 'em... 
MARION We'll need a forge... 
SCOTT Easy enough... 
MARION We've got clay to make a chamber... 
FIELDING Oak to make charcoal... 
SCOTT Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows... 
MARION And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it, rig a piston and drive shaft and we'll have a flywheel to power the bellows... 
Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look. 
SCOTT (to Fielding) That's why he's a colonel. 
Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work. Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons. 
BILLINGS Shoot them!  Shoot the damn things! 
Dalton prepares to do so. 
MARION Put that pistol down! 
SCOTT They followed us from the bridge. They won't let anyone near the wagon. 
Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the dogs.

{"train": "ORPHAN \nWritten by \nDavid Leslie Johnson \nFebruary 5, 2007 \nFADE IN: CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S ) She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed, wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over Caitti before you know it. Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL: \nINT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT \nHarsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a. delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs- across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist. A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She tries to sit up. \nKATE Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't want to do this anymore. The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table. \nNURSE Your baby is dead. There's nothing. else we can do. Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall. \nKATE No, this isn't what's supposed to happen. My baby's alive! \nNURSE We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're so sorry... \nKATE But it's still alive! It's moving! Feel it, you can feel it! Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse- pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs, disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps. \nRATE No, stop! I want to be asleep! \n-DOCTOR- TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's coming. You're.going to experience some pressure now... - Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him.. Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband, JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera. \nJOHN It's okay, honeys You're doing great! The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse. H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes. \nKATE This isn't happening. Wake up, wake up, wake up... Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric. W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING. \nNURSE Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a girl . The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams - \nINT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n-- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom; \nINT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry... \nINT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY \nWater TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's. \nDR. BROWNING A lot of women experience difficulties around the anniversary of the miscarriage or the baby's expected due date. It's perfectly normal. \nKATE I was thinking of\" going back to work. I really thought 1 was doing better. \nDR. BROWNING You are. Think about where you were just four months ago. - (off Kate's look) Are you still sober? Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look. \nKATE I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome the other day. \nDR. BROWNING Did you stop? \nKATE I really wanted to. The thought went through m' head, you know. it wasn't for me, it just might be nice to have a bottle handy in case we had guests. \nDR. BROWNING. But you didn't go in? \nKATE No. \nDR. BROWNING That's all that matters. Let's try to stay focused on the. positive. Grief is different for everyone. You have to take it at your own pace.. Keep writing in your journal. You're doing fine. Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY \nRate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps' back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big. \nINT. NURSERY - DAY \nKate sits on Max's bed, reading and showing her the pictures: \nKATE \"People send us flowers and cards, but we still miss our baby. If this just happened to you, I'm sorry you got an angel instead of a'baby. I.think a baby would have been more fun.\" The last picture is a FAMILY WITH A BABY ANGEL watching over them. \nMAX \nIS BABY JESSIE AN ANGEL? \nKATE Yes, she is. She's with us every day. Kate gives Max a gentle kiss on the forehead. \nINT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKate opens a medicine chest 'and shakes a PILL from a prescription bottle. She swallows the pill-with a Dixie cup of water. \nINT. XATB AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJohn watches TV in bed. Kate enters from the bathroom in a nightshirt and sits on the bed. She.rubs lotion on her feet. John watches her, then reaches out, runs his fingers uup and down her back. Kate freezes. He can't see the-nervous look that crosses her face. He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing hex-. neck. Kate responds stiffly, trying to get. in the mood. He slides a hand around her waist, moves it up to her breast... \nKATE I'm sorry. I can't. Shit... She moves away, tears suddenly in.her eyes. He gives a concerned look, lets her have her space. A beat. \nKATE I'm so sick of feeling like this. Christ, the kids must thing I'm crazy. \nJOHN Will you stop worrying about what everybody else thinks? \nKATE How can I? I saw a pregnant woman today on the way home and I almost lost it. Just burst into tears with Max sitting right there. Daniel barely talks to me. You and I haven't had sex in over a year now. What if I.never get better? I don't want to lose you. \nJOHN You're never going to lose us. I promise you. I just wish... (off her look) Have you thought any more about adopting? \nKATE I can't even be a mother to the children we already have. \nJOHN That's not true. The kids understand. They just know you're not happy. \nKATE But I should be. \nJOHN - Do you want another child? \nB. \nKATE You Snow I do. More than anything. \nJOHN Even if it can-'t be'biologically ours. \nKATE- \nYES \nJOHN Then what are we talking about this -for? Let's do it. \nKATE You-don't just adopt a child because you're lonely and depressed. \nJOHN That's not why we'd be doing..it. We wanted a child a year ago and we still want one, now.. \nKATE We can't replace our baby. \nJOHN No, 'we can't. But we can take the' place we made for her in our hearts and our home and give it to a child who needs a family. \n(BEAT) Kate, we love being parents. We're good at it and'it makes. us happy. What better reason-do you want? Kate looks at him for a beat, then smiles and lets her tears fall. \nINT.-LAWYER'S OFFICE -- DAY \nKate and John are being interviewed by a FEMALE LAWYER. \nLAWYER - Are you both employed? \nJOHN I'm-an architect at a firm in the city. The Lawyer turns to Kate. Kate hesitates. \nKATE I used to teach music at Yale. I haven't worked for about a year. \nLAWYER - (a beat, considering) You're sure you want an older child? - - \n(MORE) - - - \nJOHN John. It's nice to meet you. She smiles and demurely offers her hand, giggling as he takes it. She blushes, then turns back to her painting. It's a half- finished jungle scene with a SMILING LION crouched beneath a tree. \nJOHN So what's this one going to bo? \nESTHER My paintings are stories that come from my imagination. -This one'-s about a'sad mother lion who can't find her cube. \nJOHN She's smiling. \nESTHER She's dreaming about her babies. It's the only thing that makes her happy. \nJOHN Well, I hope she finds them. \nESTHER She will. I,bok. As she speaks, Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs curled up in front of their sleeping mother: \nESTHER They were lost'in the jungle 'and they were so scared because they didn't'have a mother or father. But just when they thought they'd be alone forever, they found their mother sleeping under this tree. And they felt so safe that they fell asleep too. Now when-the mother lion wakes up, her dream will have come true. She has her family again. \nJOHN Where did you learn how to do this? \nESTHER Y've just had lots of time to practice, I guess. It's so boring here. \nJOAN You don't play outside with the other girls? Sounds like they're having fun. \nESTHER I like staying inside. That way I don't get my clothes dirty. \nJOHN (amused) - Well, that's very responsible of you, but I'll- bet the sisters could find something else for you. to wear. \nESTEER You.don't like my dress? - Don't you think it's pretty? - \nJOHN Your dress is. very pretty. I'm ,just saying. you could -probably go outside if you really wanted to. \n- ESTHER (a beat, hesitant) I don't like laying with the other .girls. I'm different from everyone. \nJOHN There's nothing wrong with different. \nESTHER Yes, there is. Everybody says there's not, but it isn't true. I don't care. If I'm sad or lonely, I just come in here a nd paint a story with a happy endingg And when people say they like. my paintings, it makes me feel better. (off his look) I think.peo le should always try to take the bad things that happen to them and turn them into something good. Don't you? John is taken aback. Who j t1m1s )dc? Before he can respond: \n.- RATE (O.S.) There you are. Rate and Sister Abigail stand in the doorway. John waves for Kate to enter and Esther sits up eagerly when she does. Abigail's expression darkens when she sees who John has been talking to. \nJOHN Hey, I'd like you to meet someone. - (to Esther). Esther, this is my wife, Kate. Kate smiles and offers her hand, but instead of shaking it, Esther lovingly presses it to her cheek. \nESTIIR - Motta... Kate'and John exchange a beumsed look'. \nJOHN She painted these all by herself. \n' RATE Wow, you're quite the little-artist. \nESTHE'R Thank you. You smell nice. Kate laughs. Sister Abigail shifts uncomfortably. \nESTHER Would you like me to paint you a picture? You can watch me if-you want. I'm normally a little shy, but -- \nSISTER ABIGAIL' Esther, I'm sorry, they don't have time for you to paint them a picture. (off Esther's look) They have to come with me now. Yolanda's going home with them tomorrow. isn't that wonderful? Esther wilts. She releases Rate's hand and musters a weak smile. \nESTHER Yes. I'm sure she'll be very happy. \nKATE It was nice meeting you. \nESTHER - The pleasure was mine. \nJOHN (to Sister Abigail) You've got a real talent on your hands here. \nSISTER ABIGAIL Yes, we're very lucky to have her. But there's something -strange-in Abigail's voice -- she definitely doesn't un -lucky. Esther watches them go. \nINT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ENTRY - DAY \nSister Abigail walks Kate and John to the front door. \nI5. \nSISTER ABIGAIL The notary will be here at.ten for-you- to sign the placement agreement. \nKATE Thank you so much for all your help. Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too. \n- JOHN.. No. Don't say that. - \nRATE- - we -try to .have a baby and I have a 'third-trimester miscarriage that leaves. me sterile. 'We try to adopt and she dies the night before we bring her home. That doesn't sound like' somebody's trying to tell us. something? \nJOHN   - Yolanda didn' t the to.teach us a lesson.. We didn't make this-happen. \nKATE ' It doesn't make.anndifference. I can't go through this again. \nJOHN so let's not. Let's adopt.Bather. This brings Kate back to reality. She eyes him coolly. \nKATE Her body's barely cold and you're already thinking about replacing her? \nJOHN . We can't replace Yolanda any more than We can replace Jessie. But we can't help her anymore, either. Esther is alive and needs a family. Right now. \nKATE We have to at least wait until.-- \nJOHN -Until what? I don't want to waste .a nother year of our lives wishing for something that we.can't-have. (beat). I want us to feel like a family again. Kate regards him for a beat, conflicted. Then: \nKATE Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks. \nINT. HOME FOR GIRLS - SISTER ABIGAIL'S OFFICE - DAY - \nSister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of Esther stapled to it. Her- case file. \nSISTER ABIGAIL For the most -part, she's an'ideal child. She's originally from Russia, but her English is flawless, Smart as a.tvhip and very mature \u00c2\u00b0for her age. I don't think I've-ever had to tell her .anything-twice and I've never had to clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a- nQat-freak. \nJOHN I think we can handle that. \nSISTER.ABIGAIL She's also fiercely independent., Whatever the other-children want to do, she wants to.dc the opposite. \nJOHN She told me they make fun of her. \nSISTER ABIGAIL I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make- things any easier on herself. She just doesn't seem interested in friends.. She doesn't even play like a normal child. She just reads and paints. Most of the time she barely-speaks. \nKATE Why do'you think that is? \nSISTER ABIGAIL . Well, like most of the girls here, there's been no shortage of hardship in her life.- She's been orphaned twice-- her birthmother died of AIDS, then the American family who adopted her was- killed in.a house fire. And I strongly suspect that she's been sexually abused as well. \nKATE By who? \nSISTER ABIGAIL I don't know. There's nothing in her -history, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Russian adoption - records. are notoriously unreliable. \nJOHN Then what are you basing this on? Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say. \nSISTER ABIGAIL I wish I knew. There's just something missing with her. A-spark you see in a child's eyes that isn't there. I've only seen that-before in cases where the child had been severely traumatized. It might also explain - some of her idiosyncratic behaviors. \nJOHN Like what? \nSISTER ABIGAIL She refuses to shower or change clothes with the other girls.' She won't even allow the housemother in-the bathroom with her. She.'.s also very concerned with her physical appearance for her age. She's like a teenager getting ready for a date every morning. She insists on wearing dresses-every day. The ribbons around her wrists and neck stay on day and night. . The only trouble we ever had with her was when we tried to take them off. She kicked two of Sister Francis' teeth-out. Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs. \nSISTER ABIGAIL I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to discourage you. If you're serious, I'll do everything I can to-expedite the process, given the circumstances. \n(BEAT) My one reservation is..this. When-an adoption fails, it's usually because the parents didn't know what to expect. -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what to expect because the plain fact of the- matter is that-I don't knaw. \nINT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY Esther is happily-helping a NUN clean the sanctuary. Kate and John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel. \nKATE She really did open up with us, didn't she? \nJOHN She latched. right onto you. We're probably the best chance she has at a. normal life. Esther looks up from her work and waves at them. They wave back. \nKATE A normal life..' That sounds really good,',doesn't it? - She smiles. and takes John- .'s hand. \nEXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DAY. \nCAXERA FOLLOWS Esther's feet, saddle shoes CLICKING on -the walk. Kate walks beside her, holding her hand. In Esther's free hand, she clutches a DOG-EARED BIBLE held together with a rubber band. Activity on the playground stops as the girls watch Esther leave. None of them look sorry to see her go. She ignores them. John puts.Esther's things ---- a small suitcase and her-paintings in the trunk of the car.. Sister-Abigail sees them off.- \nSISTER ABIGAIL If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to call. Before Kate. can respond, Esther tugs on her arm. \n_ESTHER Come on! Let's-go) Kate laughingly lets Esther drag her away. \nRATE (to Abigail) We wills Sister Abigail happily watches them go.. Rate and Esther smile and wave goodbye.' She'waves back... but once the car pulls out, her smile fades. She seems'vaguely troubled as they drive away... \nJOHN Don't be rude. \nEsther overhears them, but pretends she didn't. Kate sees this- and tries to distract her. - \nKATE Would you like to see-your room? Esther smiles and nods eagerly. But on the way up the stairs, she eyes Daniel furtively, sizing him up... \nINT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKate pushes the door open and Esther enters. We recognize the room by the arched windows -- this used to be the-nursery.- It's been completely made over as a little girl's room, complete with a lacy white canopy bed covered with a mountain of STUFFED ANIMALS.. Esther turns to Kate and John with a toothpaste-commercial smile. \nESTHER It's perfect. \nINT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEsther is in bed, wearing a nightgown. Kate and John tuck her in. \nESTHER I love.you, motta -- I mean, Monmiy. \nKATE I love you, too, sweetie. She kisses Esther on the forehead. John leans in for a kiss and Esther,hugs -him tight. Then he and Kate turn out the light and close the door. Esther watches them go...- \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKate and John walk to their room, arms lovingly around each other. They close their door, leaving the hallway empty and dark. Then: CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES back down the hall toward.the closed door of Esther's_room, PUSHING IN'on the doorknob, lingering there fora long beat... Then we hear the lock CLICK shut. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - ESTABLISHING -- MORNING \nJOGGERS. PAPERBOY. Lawn sprinklers. KIDS running and -riding bicycles. Saturday in the suburbs. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING ' \nEsther and Max eat breakfast at the table while rate pours their juice. Daniel tears through wearing a soccer iuniform. \nKATE Good luck II I love you II \nDANIEL Love you, tools John follows Daniel, kissing Kate on his way out.' \nKATE Remember, it's only a game. \nJORN I'm a fan. Fans yell. _.I'll call to let you know who won. \nINT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKate and Esther are decorating. Esther pins up some of her paintings. Kate spreads out a selection of wallpaper borders. \nKATE Okay, which one do you like? \nESTHER These are for a'younger child. Did you pick them out for Yolanda? Kate is taken aback. She stammers for a beat. \nKATE I'm sorry. I'll take them back and pick some just for you. \nESTHER It's all right. I rather like this one. Esther points out her.favorite and goes back to pinning up her paintings. Kate sighs. As she rolls up the samples, she notices the same Gothic mansion in several of Esther's older paintings. \nKATE '1s that a real place? \nESTHER No. I just made it up. It's a haunted castle where a beautiful- princess was locked away. She waited so long and was so sad that she filled the moat with her tears, but then a handsome prince swam ,across it and rescued her. \n(SMILES) I like happy ending's. Don't you? \nINS'. SHOPPING MALL - DAY Sliding doors open. Rate and the girls enter. Esther looks around, dazzled by three stories of glass-ceilinged extravagance. It's totally alien to her. - \nM. CLOTHING STORE - DAY Kate and the girls look through racks'. of children's clothes. Kate pulls a pair'of jeans with. flowers embroidered on the pockets. \nKATE These are cute. \nESTHER -Jeans are ugly. \nKATE But sweetie, you have to have something you can play outside in. \nESTHER That doesn't mean I have to look like a boy. \nINT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY \nRATE . If you want, we can put your other pictures in here, too. \nESTHER What other pictures? \nKATE The ones I saw in. your Bible. Esther gives her a dismayed look. \nKATE - I'm sorry. They slipped out at church. If they're private, we don't have.to --- \nESTHER It's okay.' I want you to -see them. She smiles, but it looks forced. \nINT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nKate and Esther sit on the floor. Esther. removes the rubber band from around her Bible and takes out a few battered photographs. They're all of Esther with a rural family -- the man.Kate saw in the photo at church, his WIFE,. and THREE BOYS, aged 6, 10, and 14. In one, they're all posed together in front of a farmhouse. \nESTHER These are the Wallaces. That's James and Hannah. And that's Micah, Luke, and Isaiah. \nKATE - This is the American family that adopted you from Russia? \nEsther nods'. They're candid -family snapshots full -of. laughter and hugs. Esther'.s adopted father is in all-of them. The last one is of him and. Esther, the same photo Kate. saw part, of at church. \nKATE'. They lookvery'n.ice. They must have loved you'very much. Ksther nods, but Kate-sees that she's holding back tears. \nRATE What's wrong?. \nESTHER I hid these because Ididn't want you to know how much I miss' them, I was afraid you'd think I didn't love you. \nKATE It's okay, sweetie... I understand. (beat; considers) You know, I lost someone who was very .special to me once, too. Esther wipes her eyes and looks up, interest piqued. \nESTHER Really? \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nKate shows Esther the orchid in its ornate planter. \nRATE We don't have any pictures of Jessica because she died while she was still in my tunny. But we spread her ashes in here and as long as. this flower grows, part of her will be alive inside it. \n(BEAT) It's okay to be sad.about the people we've lost.. And it.'s okay to iniss them, too. Esther nods. They'smile at one another through their tears. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nBetween classes, crowded with KIDS.,. Esther clutches her books to her chest. Daniel and Trovor are walking the other way and as they pass, Daniel dumps Esther's books. Trevor laughs. Esther glares at'Daniel and kneels to pick up her books, bitt the kids walking by purposefully kick them, laughing faces leering down at her. She gathers her books, but one of them is missing. She looks around. -Spots it. \nEsther's Bible lies on the floor at Someone's feet. A.hand reaches down. and picks it up. It's Brenda. \nBRENDA Is this a Bibl? \nESTHER Give it back to me. She reaches for it, but Brenda laughs and raises-it over her head. \nBRENDA Jesus-freak brought a Bible to school! Esther angrily swipes at it again, but one of Brenda's friends grabs it first. Esther takes a deep breath, trying to calm down. \nI3STUER May I pleas. have my Bible? The girl hesitates, shrugs and offers Sather the Bible... but snatches it away again at the last second. Brenda laughs. 8sther reaches for it, but the girls keep passing it between them. Esther and Brenda grab it at the same time. There's a brief tug- of-war, then the rubber band SNAPS and the Bible flies apart, pages and hp otos scattering everywhere. Esther gasps in horror and dives to the floor, desperately scooping up the loose pages. A\"crowd gathers, watching and snickering, Daniel and Trevor among them. Esther looks to Daniel for help, but he just stands there, watching uncomfortably. Brenda laughs at Esther crawling around on all fours. \nBRENDA Look at the cute little doggied Is this your collar, little doggie? Brenda reaches out and grabs the ribbon-around Rsthdrls neck... The-second Brenda touches the ribbon, Esther flies into panic. She screams an s Brenda'e hand away, aching h_ex e and k coking feet, ster 11 s 5 riekincr At the toy Dg her.lungs.

She makes a face and looks down. Thg g are ante arwl ng loon a-: arou her feet. She quickly steps back,- brushing at her- arms and legs. She looks under one of the plant tables to'see what's attracted them: It's Hodgepodge. He's been dead for several days, his body swarming with ants and MAGGOTS. \nEXT.-COLEMAN RESIDENCE \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd GARDEN - NIGHT \nA hole has been dug in the backyard flower garden. Kate, John, Esther, and Max stand around it. Max places a shoebox with \"HODGEPODGE\" written on it in the hole and lays a flower on top of it. John starts shoveling dirt into the bole. Esther and Max exchange a knowing look... \nINT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY \nEsther and Max are giggling and playing dress-up. Clothes are strewn everywhere. They're both trying to look grown-up. They're even wearing makeup -- heavy mascara and pink, painted cheeks. Daniel walks by and sees Max putting on lipstick. He takes it away from her. \nDANIEL Hey, you're not allowed to wear makeup. Does mom know you have this? \nESTHER Give it-back. \nDANIEL, Make me. \nSISTER ABIGAIL Really? is the girl all right? \nRATE She broke her arm and had to have something like eleven stitches, I think.

Maybe Kate and I -could help you -out. \nJOYCE Okay, I'll call you. John and Max start off again, but'Esther doesn't move. She's openly looking Joyce over from head to toe. \nESTHER You have a l ovely body. \nJOHN. Come on, Esther. Let's go. Esther reluctantly follows. Joyce eyes her dubiously. \nINT. KITCHEN -- DAY \nJohn acid the girls enter. Kate has juice boxes for the girls. A. look passes between John and Rate. Esther notices. \nKATE How was the.iide? Did you have fun?

Daniel's dressed as a ninja, Max is a \"FINDING NEMO\" fish, and Esther's an angel, complete with a shiny halo. \nSERIES OF SHOTS John gives Daniel some money to hang out with Austin and Trevor... On the BOARDWALK, playing games, winning prizes. Esther shoots BBs at balloons with a toy rifle. She's pretty good at it... On the MIDWAY, Esther and Max are whirled around on the Scrambler, screaming and laughing. Kate and John watch and take pictures..'. \nTHE HAUNTED -MAZE A cheap fun house attraction.

She wants him to come over to her house. Did you know that? (off Kate's look)) Please don't tell Aaddy I told. I don't want him to be mad at me.- Kate doesn't respond, clearly disturbed. \nI EXT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - PARKING' LOT - DAY \nKate gets out Of the minivan, but Esther stays put'-in her seat. Rate sighs, frazzled and distracted. \nKATE Esther, come on. \nESTHER X told you, I don't like the de ntist. \nKATE There's nothing to be afraid of. \nESTHER - I know. Because I'm not- going- \nKATE Esther, get out of the cart Righ t now! For a moment, they just glare at each other. Mexican stand-off.. Then Esther sticks her nose in the air and does as she's told. \nINT.-DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM -- DAY \nThe DENTIST lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber gloves. The HYGIENIST clips a dental bib around Esther's neck. \nHYGIENIST She hasn't had a check-up in about two years, so she's a little nervous. \n-DENTIST she doesn't look to me. Now let's have a look at those co ppers. Esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut. \nDENTIST. Come on, darling, open wide. -Esther eyes him anxiously; then reluctantly opens. Just a bit. \nDENTIST That a girl: Little wider... She opens more. He leans in to take a look... Suddenly, she SHdMPS dawnn his jinx s hard Pnou h to draw blo-mss fr and locks \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdn like Rottweile\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd] The Hygienist is frozen in shock. \nDENTIST Aaagh! Goddammit!! Help me with her ! The Hygienist holds her down while the Dentist tries to pry her mouth open. Finally, he yanks his fingers free, cradling them \npainfully. Esther HISSES at ldm like a cat, lips flecked with blood. The Dentist and Hygienist exchange a startled. lock. \nINT. DENTIST'S-OFFICE - WAITING ROOM -- DAY \nCanned MUSAK.. Kate bits waiting. The Hygienist enters. \nHYGIENIST - Mrs. Coleman? Kate gives her a confused look. Then she notices Esther htanding behind the Hygienist with a-smug grin on'her face. \nINT./EXT. KATE'S MINIVAN - DAY \nDriving home.. Kate stews, on her last frayed nerve. Esther gazes out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense song under her breath: \"La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La--la-la ...\" Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside. She's stopped next to a LIQUOR.STORE. Kate quickly looks .away, her temptation real enough to startle her. The light turns green and she drives off without looking back. Esther keeps SINGING.. A few blocks later, they pass a BAR. Then a bus shelter with a big ABSOLUTE VODKA AD. Kate probably drives by them every day, but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never really left, re-emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind. She tries to focus on the road, Esther's VOICE grating in her head... \"La-la-la, la-la-la-la:.. La-la-la, la-la-la-la...\" \nINT. FOYER -- DAY \nKate and Esther enter. Esther skips upstairs. Kate sighs, angry and frustrated. She plays a message on the ANSWERING MACHINE. \nSISTER ABIGAIL (V.0.) Hello, this is Sister Abigail calling for John and Kate. Please call me as soon as you get this message. I have. something that we need to discuss in person. It's regarding. Esther. \nUPSTAIRS Esther stands at the top of the stairs, listening to-the message- She's heard everything. And she's scared. Scared and pissed. \nINT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM.- NIGHT \nKate and John get ready for bed. \nKATE He's been our dentist for ten years. Why would he lie to us? \nJQAN I didn't say he's lying. I just think Ws-blowing it out of proportion, \nKATE I saw the bite marks. We're lucky he's not suing us. \nJOHN Fine, but I don't believe for a\"second that she just did it for no reason. \nRATE That's because she's always on her best behavior with you. \nJOHN' That's. not true. I've had to deal with her at her worst.. \n- KATE What you think is her worst is what she's like with me all the time. She's completely- different with me than she is with you'., \nJOHN So you've seen her haul off'and bite someone like an animal? \nESTHER ' Look for the key to the treehouse.' -Max nods and they start searching the room. Esther rifles through John 's desk. - Nothing.  She looks in a closet. A DARK PLASTIC CASE with Two PADLOCKS on it catches her eye... \nMax opens a. keepsake chest and finds SEVERAL KEYS on:a ring. She excitedly shows them to Esther. Esther smiles and takes them. As they're about to leave,.Esther. Uses. She looks back at the- closed closet. Then looks at the keys. Max eyes her curiously. Esther slides a chair over to. the closet and opens it.. She stands on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and sets it on the floor. She tries a couple of.keys. Then -- CLICK. There's a GUN inside. A shiny revolver and a BOX OF AMMUNITION. Esther's face lights up. She.carefully picks up the gun{-turns it over, looks at it. Max's eyes nearly pop out. Esther gives her a sly look, then loads a single bullet, SPINS. the cylinder... .and points the cmn at ax. Ri.aht between the Bye \nESTHER Do you -want to_ play? - A beat. Max shakes her head. Esther smiles, fingers the trigger. After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun. \nESTHER You're right. We'd better not. \n(BEAT) Not yet. - \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nSister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look. \nSISTER ABIGAIL When you first asked about adopting Esther, I expressed some misgivings. But I wasn't completely straightforward with you. You see, I love children. I've worked with them my entire life. And the thing about love is that it sometimes clouds your judgement. \n(BEAT) But the truth is that I knew there was something wrong with Esther from the moment I laid eyes on her. Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles. \n- KATE You said you suspected, some kind of abuse. \nSISTER ABIGAIL Yes, but there was something else. It was hard to say chat it was at first. Just-a feeling that she was a profoundly damaged little girl. \n(MORE) \nSISTER ABIGAIL ' (CONY' D) (beat) s eemed Then I notaced that she - always k_ to. be around whenever ther' wwasa get kind of trouble.- Two girls iii a fight. And there she'd be . Someone would get caught stealing. And ell she'd - myself it Was But I never really. believed it. (beat) l who After you told me about the gir broke her arm, -:E -started wondering again. I called the achool:Esther went to while she was with the Wallaces and asked if there'd been any serious accidents while she.Was there.. One incident was still fresh in everyone's minds. A boy in one of her classes was stabbed in the throat with a pair of 'scissors. All the kids-who saw it happen said it was an accident, that he was running with the scissors and fell. But once again, Esther, was there. \nANGLE - ESTHER is eavesdropping from around the corner. She slips away. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJOAN But none of these things were her fault. \nSISTER ABIGAIL That's; g I was reluc!tant to t anything bef ore. Now'I think th at may a have been a mistake. (off their-looks) Children like Esther, who've spent their entire lives-in institutions, have never had' a chance to 'form normal, lasting bonds.. The longterm effects of 'this- can be devastating.   In the very worst cases, children who fail to form early attachments are unable to learn the difference between'right and wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal --- .or worse -and and have no remorse whatsoever for their actions.' They view other human beings as objects, pawns for their amusement. And they can-be potentially very dangerous. \nINT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nwhite s gloves, like she's Esther pulls on -a pair of . dinty hurCh services dressing for morninga \nC \nINT. LIVING ROOM'- DAY \nJOEt7- This.doesh't sound like Esther at all. \nSISTER ABIGAIL A severely character-disturbed child can appear to be -completely normal, -even exceptional. It's like they have two faces one-they show the outside world in order'to get what they want, and the other, their true face, lying just beneath the surface. \nINT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY \nMax sits on her bed, wearing a jacket and clutching her \"Bello. Kitty\" backpack. Anxious and waiting. Esther enters. - \n- E5T_HBR Let's go. \nINT. LIVING ROOM  - DAY - \nKATE What about the orphanage in Russia where she was raised? Wouldn't they have been able to tell? \nSISTER ABIGAIL - I've put in a call to the director there, but she could have easily slipped through the. cracks. \nJOHN - So the bottom line here is that you don't have proof of any of this. \nSISTER ABIGAIL That's true,-I don't. But I believe the circumstantial evidence is enough to warrant taking the next step. \nRATE Which is what? - \nSISTER -ABIGAIL Get Esther out of'the house. Kate and John are stunned. \nJOHN You want to disrupt the adoption over this?! \nSISTER ABIGAIL - If I'm-wrong, she-can come back home. But you need to get her to a therapist who can tell you what you're dealing \nWITH \nEND   INTERCUT : Esther's fit has passed. She neatly composes herself and emerges from the stall... and sees that there's a WOMAN at the sink. She eyes Esther warily. Probably heard everything. Esther hesitates , then walks right by with. her nose in the air. \nTNT. GARAGE -. DAY John pulls the car in out of the RAIN. They get out and Esther. goes Inside. When Kate is sure she's out of earshot: \nKATE Thanks for the support back there. \nJOHN Hey, I'm not a psychiatrist. And a lot of what she's saying makes sense. Before she can respond, Nate's cell phone RINGS. She turns away from John' and'answers it. He sighs and goes inside. \nKATE - Hello? \nSISTER JUDITH (V.O.) is this Mrs. Coleman? \nKATE Yes. Who's calling? \nSISTER JUDITH (V:O.) This is Sister Judith from Saint Cabrini's. I'm sorry to bother you. Did-Sister Abigail make.it to 'her appointment with you yesterday? T tXNDER rolls. \nEXT.

We at least owe her that much. \nKATE Do you have any idea who could have done this? ' \nDETECTIVE ' We have .a suspect in custody based on an anonymous -tip. We're just trying. to - place ham at the time we think the - murder took place. - \nJOHN Who is it? \nDETECTIVE I can't tell you that right now. But he was found with the murder weapon, along with some cash and credit cards. \nJOHN Jesus..:: at kind of sick' monster carjacks a nun? Kate glances up, sees Esther crouched on the stairs, watching... INT. fAMiLY ROOM - DAY Daniel sits in a big recliner, sullenly playing a VIDEO GAME SHOOT- EM-OP.

Max numbly follows. They walk up to Daniel'in the recliner. \nESTHER We want to sit there. \nKATE Esther, Daniel was there first. - Daniel eyes Esther. Wary, but defiant.

He ignores her and stomps upstairs. She watches him, concerned. \nINT.

They can be exceptionally charismatic, oftentimes playing people off one another to get what they want.\" \nJOHN save you showed this to Doctor. B\u00c2\u00b1owiiing? \nKATE (hesitates)- I'm not 'seeing her anymore.. \nJOHN You're not going to therapy? When did you decide that? \nSATE When do you think? John sighs. A tense-beat. \nJOHN I know you were. upset. But we have to at least consider the possibility that she's right about this. \nKATE No, we don't. Why does everybody around here get the.benefit of the doubt fro m you except me? \nJOHN That's not true. I'm just..worried about you, that's all. We can hire someone to help you with the kids if it's getting to be too much. \nJohn and Esther walk by the LION exhibit.- She takes John's hand and presses it to her cheek. \nESTHER You don't know how-long I've waited for a 'daddy just. like you. \nJOHN And a monany, too. Right? Esther hesitates. John notices. She gives a sad shrug. \nESTHER I don't think !'Tommy likes me very much. \nJohn is taken aback. An awkward beat.- \nJOHN That's not true..- Mc=my loves 'you. \nESTHER It's all right. I understand if she doesn't. It must be difficult to love an adopted child as much as- your own.. \nJOHN Sweetheart, .you are just as much a part of this family- as Danny. and Max are. Mommy doesn't love'you any less because you're adopted. Do you understand? She nods, but doesn't look convinced. John thinks. \nJOHN Why don't you do something special for her? So she can see what a good girl you are. I'll bet she'd like that. Esther's face brightens. \nEST LER That's a wonderful idea. I think I know just what I'm.going to do, too. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAfter dinner. Kate is loading the dishwasher. John is brig ing in dirty dishes from the dining room. Esther enters, all smiles. Hands hidden behind her back. John gives Kate an expectant smile. \nESTHER I have a special surprise for you, Mommy. Kate eyes her warily. No idea what to expect. \nKATE You do? \nESTHER- I picked this flower just for youl It's Kate's memorial orchid. Kate gasps. John is horrified.

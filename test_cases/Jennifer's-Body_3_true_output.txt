JENNIFER Thursday counts as the weekend in college. And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now. University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo! Needy continues loading her backpack. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Please, please you're a social disease? NEEDY I have to study. Jennifer pouts. With an outstretched finger, she draws a dramatic X in the air over Needy and boos loudly. JENNIFER (SHOUTING) Boo! Cross out Needy! 
Needy blushes, shrinking self-consciously. She obviously hates to displease Jennifer. NEEDY Fine. What time is the show? JENNIFER I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store. 
NEEDY He seems nice.

CONTINUED: (2) 
JENNIFER (SMIRKING) Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge... heart. So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay? NEEDY Okay. 
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - 8:45 A.M. Needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on different configurations of clothing. NEEDY V.O. "Wear something cool" meant something very specific in Jennifer-speak. It meant I couldn't look like a nerd, but I couldn't upstage her either. I could expose my stomach, but never cleavage. Tits were her trademark. 
Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her childishly round tummy. She walks out of the bathroom into her bedroom, a frilly pink hell complete with canopy bed. CHIP DOVE is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that pink. He raises an eyebrow at Needy's abdomen. CHIP Those jeans are hella low. I can almost see your front butt. NEEDY Chip, it's a rock show. This is my rock look. 
CHIP I can see, like, your womb. Needy sighs and hoists up her pants. CHIP (CONT'D) Why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert, anyway? We were supposed to have Movie Night. I even rented Orca. It's like Jaws, except with a harmless whale. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEEDY Jennifer needs me. She really wants to go see this band. It's extremely important to her. CHIP I've never even heard of Soft Shoulder. Which one is Jennifer stalking? NEEDY The lead singer, of course. Girls like her don't go out with drummers. CHIP Thanks a lot! NEEDY No offense. I mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer. CHIP Like Phil Collins. NEEDY Who's Phil Collins? CHIP Forget it. He's seminal, but whatever... 
NEEDY Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so... CHIP Salty. You guys ever going to stop using that secret language? 
NEEDY "Salty" means beautiful. CHIP Then you must be soy sauce, babe. Needy and CHIP start MAKING OUT. CHIP unbuckles his belt eagerly even though they've barely begun. Needy stops. 
(CONTINUED)

NEEDY Jennifer's here. CHIP How do you know? Needy shrugs. A beat of silence. Then we hear the door swing open. JENNIFER'S VOICE floats up from downstairs. JENNIFER (O.S.) Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here! CHIP That's fucking weird. NEEDY (straightening her CLOTHES) I'd better hurry. CHIP You always do what Jennifer tells you to do. Needy pulls her NECKLACE out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart-shaped "B.F.F." charm at Chip. 
NEEDY She's my best friend, Chip. Remember? This necklace is no joke. CHIP sighs, resigned. They head downstairs. 
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - SAME Jennifer is waiting in the front hallway. She's heavily made-up and dressed in a predictably sexy outfit. She dangles a set of car keys in front of Needy and CHIP. JENNIFER (GLOATING) Guess who's got the whip `til 11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and it's all mine.

Nabulsi flattens the coin. Something makes him stare at his fingers. He moves his hand, revealing a Canadian quarter. 
LT. NABULSI How far is it to the Canadian border? 
SGT. HARRIS Four, five hours? 
LT. NABULSI (rising) Collero!! 
320   EXT. PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TORONTO -- EVENING           320 
The SUV takes the freeway exit and climbs the ramp. 
321   INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- EVENING                   321 
Nabulsi comes out of his office, passing a waiting ERIT. 
ERIT Excuse me?   You call this coffee? 
Nabulsi shakes that off and enters the SITUATION ROOM. Every phone at the table is manned, all having the same conversation: 
SGT. HARRIS I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police Department. We have a fugitive warrant for Lara and John Brennan, they are most likely traveling with their six year-old son, and we have reason to believe they might be flying out of your airport. 
Collero hangs up from her call and looks to the next number.

321    CONTINUED:                                                           321 
LT. NABULSI How many airports in Ontario and Quebec? 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Should I stop calling and count? 
Nabulsi gives her a look.      Collero dials. 
SGT. HARRIS Yes, we are sending you photographs. We would appreciate it if you could disseminate them....How many terminals? 
DETECTIVE QUINN (bursts in) I got his parents!

323    INT. PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TORONTO -- EVENING              323 
The Brennans enter, pulling their carry-on bags. 
324    INT. PEARSON -- CHECK-IN DESK -- EVENING                             324 
AIR CANADA CLERK (as she types) Long way to go with just carry-on.

AIR CANADA CLERK I hear you. 
325    INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT                          325 
John and Lara wait for Luke to step through the metal detector. The alarm sounds. John and Lara react as the security agent takes Luke into the glass isolation booth. 
326    INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOMS -- NIGHT                       326 
Collero questions Grace on the other side of the glass.       She appears devastated. 
(CONTINUED) 
326   CONTINUED:                                                         326 
DETECTIVE COLLERO So, you just decided to go for a drive, for the entire day? 
GRACE George wanted to see the leaves. 
Track to the next room, where Nabulsi questions George. 
LT. NABULSI So you have absolutely no idea where they are going? 
GEORGE I told you.    We never spoke. 
George stares Nabulsi down. 
327   INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT                        327 
A female security agent searches Luke, digs a handful of Canadian quarters out of his pocket. John's heart races. 
328   INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - PASSPORT CONTROL -- NIGHT                   328 
The Brennans approach passport control. Lara glances at John, sees he is sweating and red. She slips her hand into his and takes the passports. 
LARA I'll do this. 
She turns and smiles at the officer, putting on all her charm. 
LARA (CONT'D) Hello. 
He remains stern-faced. Taking their passports, he examines them against PHOTOGRAPHS on his computer screen. He looks at them, looks at the passports again, then finally waves them through. 
LARA (CONT'D) Thank you. 
As they step away, the passport officer turns, sees his replacement waiting. He stands and exits to take his break. 
The SECOND PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER takes his seat and motions for the next traveler to approach. As they do an ALERT comes on his computer screen. He taps on it -- and up comes photographs of LARA and JOHN.

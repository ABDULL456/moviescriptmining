MARTINI (holding up a cigarette) What's this? 
MCMURPHY That's a dime, Martini. 
Martini breaks a cigarette in half. 
MARTINI (CONT'D) Bet a nickel! 
MCMURPHY (to Cheswick) Whadaya bet, Cheswick? 
CHESWICK She won't give me any more cigarettes! 
MCMURPHY That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want? 
CHESWICK (CONT'D) Lend me twenty. 
McMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who bets all twenty. 
The Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is divided. 
MCMURPHY (checking the board) 'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em. 
He deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the next one face up. 
MCMURPHY Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini? 
MARTINI Hit me. 
MCMURPHY (hits with a picture) That's twenty up, Martini. (turning to TV, he shouts across room) Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game? 
Taber calls back something but it's lost in the other sounds. 
MARTINI (CONT'D) Hit me! 
MCMURPHY Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing. (turning back to Taber) What? 
TABER (shouting back) Koufax against Ford! 
MISS PILBOW (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) Medication time! Medication time! Medication! 
MARTINI (simultaneously with Pilbow) Hit me! 
McMurphy slams his cards down, stands up, crosses the day room, heading for the nurses' station. He passes Washington, who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT 
as McMurphy enters. Nurse Pilbow is the only one there. 
MCMURPHY Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning... 
NURSE PILBOW (scared out of her wits) Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back! 
MCMURPHY All I'm askin' is... 
Nurse Pilbow grabs at her cross, screams and shuts her eyes, holding the cross in front of her. 
NURSE PILBOW (CONT'D) Oh, stay back, I'm a Catholic! 
Big Nurse enters from the nurses' lounge. 
BIG NURSE Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here. 
MCMURPHY Sorry, ma'am. 
McMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind him. 
INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT 
as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but doesn't take his pills. 
MCMURPHY (to Big Nurse) Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'? 
BIG NURSE (politely) Yes, Mister McMurphy? 
MCMURPHY How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think? 
BIG NURSE (pleasantly) That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy. 
McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window. 
MCMURPHY (confidentially) Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout! 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) (aware of his physical proximity) Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window. 
McMurphy jerks his hand away. 
MCMURPHY Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that... 
McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his sleeve. 
MCMURPHY Sorry to have bothered you. 
BIG NURSE Not at all, Mister McMurphy... 
McMurphy turns to walk away. 
NURSE PILBOW Your medicine, Mister McMurphy. 
MCMURPHY (turning back, he examines the contents of the cup) What's the horse pill for, honey?

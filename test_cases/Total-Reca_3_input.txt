The red-headed man nods. 
COHAAGEN (continuing) Are you sure the original suppression took? 
SUPERVISOR Absolutely, sir.  He thinks he's Quail, a computer... 
COHAAGEN (interrupting) Then how do you explain what he's doing? 
SUPERVISOR Just his instincts.  He was well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe the memory cap's fractured. Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through. 
COHAAGEN (very anxious) He'll remember Mars?  The Sphinx Project? 
SUPERVISOR Fragments.  Nothing more. Nothing he could piece together. I did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative. 
COHAAGEN What do you think I am?  A barbarian?  We're not living in the twentieth century! 
He looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl. 
COHAAGEN (continuing) Hold it there. 
He studies the picture, which changes to show the same girl from different angles. 
42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY 
Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that they shine in the face of each passenger going through. (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.) 
The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials, government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... "MARTIAN TOUR GROUP". 
The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door begins to close. 
PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1 If he had to travel to Mars with that bunch, I'd be sorry for him. 
PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2 We couldn't have missed him? 
PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1 No way.  Let's get a coffee before the next shuttle. 
43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT 
One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her handbag, and some clothes on a hanger. 
44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT 
The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we saw in Quail's emergency kit. 
She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask. 
She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL. He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute. 
He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his "FALSIES." 
CLOSE ON MASK 
We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now: "LASER FACIAL". 
45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT 
Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other direction and sees a video theater advertising "ROCKY 36" with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited, but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an announcement comes over the intercom. 
A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail looks up. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll glance out the starboard viewports, you'll behold an indeed awesome sight --

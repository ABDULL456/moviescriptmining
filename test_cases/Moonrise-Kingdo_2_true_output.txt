SAM I know! 
Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside. Suzy removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground. Sam strips off his uniform down to his white briefs. Suzy take off everything except her underwear and a training bra. They throw their clothes into the water. Sam yells: 
SAM On three! 
Suzy immediately counts very quickly. They both scream as they leap into the water. They swim toward each other, laughing and shouting. 
CUT TO: 
A clothesline hung with Sam's and Suzy's wet clothes swaying like flags and snapping in the wind. The tent has been pitched on a low, sandy plateau close to the water. Two lines of shells mark a path to the entrance. A long stick is jammed into the ground with a flickering safety-candle stuck into the Y at the top. The kitten is asleep. 
Sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel. He dips his brush into a tin cup and paints. Suzy poses stretched out and propped up on one arm. She adjusts herself slightly. 
SUZY I like it here, but I don't like the name. 
SAM Me, neither. 
SUZY Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring to it. 
SAM Let's change it. What should it be? 
SUZY Let me think for a minute. 
Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks. 
CUT TO: 
A binocular shot of a deep blue, star-filled sky. 
Suzy lies on her back on a flat rock in the middle of the cove looking up into the night. Sam wades out to her and climbs up beside her. 
SAM I made you some jewelry. 
Sam holds up two dead, shimmering, opalescent beetles with fish-hooks threaded into their shells. Suzy looks enchanted. 
SAM Are your ears pierced? 
CUT TO: 
Inside the tent, lit by a lantern. Sam clenches his teeth as he forces one of the fish-hooks through Suzy's earlobe. Suzy screams murderously. Sam releases her. The beetle dangles neatly. A line of blood runs down the side of Suzy's neck. Sam holds up a little mirror. Suzy nods. 
SUZY It's pretty. Do the other one. 
Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe. She resumes her screaming. 
CUT TO: 
Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French singer's record. They face each other, bobbing their heads and tilting awkwardly to the music. Suzy eventually begins to dance. Sam does something vaguely like the Twist. They press against each other and kiss. Suzy says quietly: 
SUZY It feels hard. 
SAM (EMBARRASSED) Do you mind? 
SUZY I like it. 
SAM (PAUSE) Tilt your head sideways. 
Sam and Suzy kiss again. Sam pushes his hands through Suzy's hair and draws it back behind her ears. Suzy whispers: 
SUZY You can touch my chest. 
Sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it onto Suzy's breast. 
SUZY They're going to grow more. 
Sam nods. He looks to be in a trance. 
CUT TO: 
Sam and Suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating raisins from Sam's hand. Suzy has flowers in her hair. She looks down into the water with her binoculars.

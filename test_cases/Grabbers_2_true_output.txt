There was nothing wrong with me Mam's house.

INT./EXT. BUNGALOW / BEDROOM - NIGHT - INTERCUT 
Tadhg scoffs, channel hopping with the remote. 
TADHG (TO HIMSELF) Apart from your Mam. 
Irene appears behind him. 
IRENE What was that? 
Tadhg flicks the TV channel onto a 'TREMORS'. (Alternative: 'FAIR CITY' is on.) 
THUD!    The door trembles with the weight of a knock. 
THUD! Cooney headbutts the door, his head flopping like a dolls, jaw slack, eyes shut. He's dead. With arms stretched above his head, weight supported by his intertwined wrists and feet barely touching ground, something is swinging him. 
THUD!    Tadhg rouses and clears his throat. 
TADHG Irene? 
Irene blow-dries her hair.     She pauses to listen. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011    29. 
IRENE What? 
TADHG Someone's at the door. 
IRENE I'm not dressed. 
THUD!    Tadhg glances disapprovingly at the clock. 
TADHG All right, all right. 
He peers through the door-window. Cooney seems drunk off his ass dirty dancing with the letterbox. Hips swiveling. 
TADHG It's that bloody Declan Cooney and he's pissed as a fart. 
Irene throws her eyes up and rises, tying her dressing gown. 
IRENE Don't give that cowboy any money. 
He'll only piss it up the wall. 
Tadhg opens the door. 
TADHG Cooney, you look like death.   What are you doing? 
Cooney swings suggestively to Tadhg's open mouthed horror. 
IRENE What does he want? 
TADHG (TO HIMSELF) To dance? 
Irene joins Tadhg at the door. Suddenly Cooney collapses, crumpling like a pile of wet laundry. 
IRENE Jesus. 
TADHG Cooney?   Are you all right, mate? 
Tadhg steps over Cooney's broken twisted body. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          30. 
TADHG Cooney? 
Suddenly Tadhg's pounced upon and whipped up out of sight. 
IRENE Tadhg!    Tadhg! 
Irene chases after him as roof tiles tumble down on her. HE'S GONE. She scurries inside and locks the door. 
INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
The TV flickers as the reception falters. Outside the window the satellite dish bounces onto the driveway. 
Irene backs through the bungalow, shaking. The violent SCUFFLE on the roof rattling the ceiling light-shade. 
IRENE Honey?    Oh God. Oh God.

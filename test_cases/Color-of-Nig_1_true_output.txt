We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight. 
THE VOICE Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We got something for you ! 
We get a better view of the helicopter. The word «police» is written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the right skid. One has a megaphone. 
VOICES OF THE COPS Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday ! The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra. 
THE CROWD For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny ! Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up. For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... ! People yell and whistle. 
One of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop, on the other skid, has another megaphone. People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks. 
BILL If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by tomorrow. 
HECTOR Me too. 
The helicopter flies away. Large shot on the orchestra singing. 
ORCHESTRA Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David. 
In a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly. Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two men get up to find a shelter. 
HECTOR Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake. Ivengan a buscar el cake ! 
People stop dancing and run to find a shelter. A MAN Everybody inside ! 
BILL How come you didn't mention Buck ? 
HECTOR There wasn't anything on him. 
BUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
It's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns around. Buck has a gun in his hand. BUCK You caught me at a bad time. 
BILL Can we get in out of the rain? 
Slowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house. 
BUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
They get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights and a unique lamp above the desk. Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and practical. We hear the storm rumbling in the distance. 
BUCK Have a seat. 
Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's hand. 
BILL I don't like guns. 
Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill takes his jacket off. A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts his hands on his face. He moans. 
BUCK Oh, shit ! 
BILL Was it raining like this that night ? 
BUCK Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said, "No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood, nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes wouldn't open. L... Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head. Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They got $31. The rain nails me every time, man. 
BILL Did they ever find out who did it ? 
BUCK No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But that's a long story. 
BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARAGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
The rain has stopped, but the ground is still wet. The garage door opens slowly and Bob's car enters the garage. The roof is still closed. Bill is on the phone. 
MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT 
A telephone rings in an empty office, separated by a glass partition from the corridor. The door is open and Anderson comes running in, with a ready-cooked dish in his hand. He picks up the phone. 
ANDERSON Officer Anderson. What can I do for you?

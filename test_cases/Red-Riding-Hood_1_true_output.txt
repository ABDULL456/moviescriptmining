GRANDMOTHER This is why it chose you. You're a good girl with a gentle heart. It's using that against you. 
ISABELLE But how could it? Unless it really does know me? Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look... 
EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY 
Isabelle is walking home through the snow. Henri is waiting for her. A beat. Then: 
HENRI I spoke with your father. I broke off our engagement. (off her look) I saw you with Peter. Don't worry, I didn't tell anyone. Isabelle can't hide her shock. She shifts anxiously. 
ISABELLE What about my family's debt? 
HENRI I have no interest in ruining your family. I will have you out of love or not at all. Isabelle is dumbfounded. Henri turns and walks away... 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 
Isabelle is cooking, lost in thought. Suddenly, there's a KNOCK at the door. Isabelle opens it. It's Prudence. 
PRUDENCE They've caught the werewolf! 
EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT 
Prudence leads Isabelle and Cesaire through the village. There are SHOUTING VOICES up ahead. 
PRUDENCE He's been hiding in a hayloft. They caught him trying to steal food. 
ISABELLE But who is it? An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob. Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way through the crowd. 
ISABELLE What's wrong? What's happening? Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd. Isabelle goes in after her. Cesaire tries to stop her. 
CESAIRE Isabelle! Get away from there! She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- it's Claude. 
ROXANNE Claude!! 
ISABELLE It's not him! It can't be! 
LUCRECE If he's not the werewolf, then why was he hiding? What's he afraid of? The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after them. Isabelle tries to follow, but Cesaire stops her. She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away. 
EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
Villagers are gathering. The whole town must be here. As Attewater approaches the entrance: 
GRANDMOTHER (O.S.) Salus populi suprema est lex. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him. She nods to the inscription above the entrance. 'SALUS 
POPULI SUPREMA EST LEX.' 
GRANDMOTHER The good of the people is the chief law. 
ATTEWATER You read Latin. 
GRANDMOTHER And write. I was studying to be a nun when I met my husband. 
ATTEWATER He must have been some man. 
GRANDMOTHER He was a priest. She grins. Is she being serious? Attewater bristles. 
GRANDMOTHER You know the boy is innocent. He's being tried because he's different. Because Father Solomon knows he can turn us against him. 
ATTEWATER Father Solomon is here to protect us. 
GRANDMOTHER A wolf hunting sheep picks off the weakest ones first. (off his look) This is just the beginning. She enters the manor hall. Attewater watches her go. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY 
The room is crammed with Villagers. Isabelle sits with Cesaire and Grandmother. Attewater sits behind the table. Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers. He looks afraid, confused. Solomon questions Lucrece. A SCRIBE records the proceedings.

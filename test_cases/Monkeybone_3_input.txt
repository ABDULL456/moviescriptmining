STU-BONE Ohhh, nothing. 
She tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her around. He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls it closed around the two of them. They kiss... 
JULIE You sure this is...medically advisable? 
STU-BONE Got a doctor on duty. 
JULIE Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone - 
STU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock. What does she mean??? 
JULIE (glancing downward) 
- which it seems to be. 
STU-BONE does a take. The good news is, she doesn't suspect. The bad news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis. 
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
All at once the air is full of Barry White's lush baritone on the bedroom CD player. Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single robe. 
The only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his mistress about the imposter in STU's body. The dog is almost drowning out Barry White - 
- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT. 
INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
JULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJ's, going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE. He circles back and forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting, FEINTING at her occasionally. 
JULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but in fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up on the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way. 
Now he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal howl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE! 
Terrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the headboard. 
JULIE Oh, God!! Baby! Are you - 
Dazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand. 
EXT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
JULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway. 
STU How was it? I don't recall. 
JULIE It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER. 
As they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his balance and topples down the stairs O.S. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT 
RASPUTIN, ATILLA, JACK THE RIPPER and STEPHEN KING are engrossed in their weekly Parcheesi game. STU is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his fate. 
STU I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular guy! I'm not a "nightmare maker." 
RASPUTIN Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked just like you. The guys who replaced us are the nightmare makers! 
ATTILA Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia. I just wanted a new recipe for yak! 
JACK THE RIPPER I was Jack the Haberdasher. 
STU But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments? ...Monkeys?? 
STEPHEN KING Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog. Go through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds up in my body? That darn Cujo. 
TYPHOID MARY runs past, GIGGLING, pursued by a huffing HITCHCOCK. 
RASPUTIN He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes. 
KAZOOS SOUND. The RAT GUARD appears to announce: 
RAT GUARD Miley. You got a visitor.

as an old-style Klingon Bird of Prey decloaks near the observatory.

Soran is continuing to SHOOT at Riker and Worf. Riker suddenly notices something off-camera.

Data is huddled in a corner of the room, cowering in fear. 
74B   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                          74B 
The firefight continues. 
RIKER Data! See if you can get to Geordi! 
Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face. 
DATA I... cannot, sir. I believe I Am... afraid. 
Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in his hand.) Riker, Data and Worf react.

77   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & OBSERVATORY (VFX-I)               77 
The Enterprise warps away just as the shock wave reaches the observatory and vaporizes it in a fiery EXPLOSION. 
CUT TO: 
78   INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE                          78 
On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL 
We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and patched in several places, obviously not a first-line model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. male Klingons man the various stations. 
The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in awe. 
B'ETOR Toh-pak-cha... (Glorious...) 
LURSA HoS qorDu... (A great power...) 
Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he strides up to the sisters. 
B'ETOR (excited, to Soran) You've done it, Soran. 
But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons... but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee. 
B'ETOR Wait! 
She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth... her expression is angry and threatening. 
B'ETOR I hope for your sake that you are initiating a mating ritual. 
SORAN You got careless. The Romulans came looking for their missing trilithium. 
B'ETOR Impossible. We left no survivors on their outpost. 
B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g. 
SORAN They knew it was aboard the observatory. If the Enterprise hadn't intervened, they would have found it. 
LURSA But they didn't find it... and now we have a weapon of unlimited power. 
SORAN I have the weapon, Lursa. And if you ever want me to give it to you, I advise you to be a little more careful in the future. 
B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to his throat.

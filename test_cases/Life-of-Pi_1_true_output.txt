Pi and the writer walk along a Montreal street. The Writer stares at Pi, bewildered. 
WRITER A tiger? Richard Parker was a tiger? 
ADULT PI He got his name through a clerical error. A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo - but the names got switched on the paperwork. The hunter was listed as Thirsty and tiger was called Richard Parker. We laughed about it and the name stuck. 
47   EXT. THE TIGER FEEDING AREA, PART TWO 1973 - DAY             47 
RAVI Let's go. Before we get into trouble. 
PI I want to see him close up. 
RAVI You're not a zoo keeper. Come on! 
An adolescent BENGAL TIGER appears at the other end of thE hall. Ravi bolts, running out of the feeding area. Pi is enchanted. 
PI (offering meat) That's it, Richard Parker. It's for you. 
Pi holds the lamb through the bars, The tiger walks slowly down the hallway, regarding Pi with a detached curiosity, as unthreatening in his manner as a large housecat. Pi begins trembling from sheer excitement. 
He doesn't hear the approach of uneven footsteps - Father appears, followed by Ravi. Just as Richard Parker approaches the offering. 
FATHER No!!! 
Father yanks Pi violently away from the cage, wrenching Pi's hand through the bars. Richard Parker, startled, raises his head, hissing. He turns and bounds back out through the gate at the other end of the hallway, disappearing into the exhibit area. Father spins Pi around and shoves him against the wall. 
FATHER (CONT'D) What are you thinking?! Are you out of your mind? Who gave you permission to come back here? You have just ignored everything I have ever taught you! 
PI I just wanted to say 'Hello' to him. 
FATHER You think that tiger is your friend. He is an animal, not a playmate! 
PI Animals have souls. I've seen it in their eyes. 
Father turns to Ravi, who stands by the gate. 
FATHER Find Selvam! 
50 EXT. THE FEEDING CAGES, 1973 - A SHORT TIME LATER 50 
Father, Pi and Ravi watch as Selvam carries a goat into the feeding area. 
SELVAM (In Tamil:) You're sure, Mr. Patel? Pi's just a kid.

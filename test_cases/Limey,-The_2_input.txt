Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue.  He was in the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking down rather than up at the color he had always felt was nature's finest. 
Swimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite green enough. 
As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous. 
There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar, though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of his daughter. 
WHOOSH!  The sound of automatic doors opening and -- 
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL.  L.A. AIRPORT.  AFTERNOON. 
WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the day.  A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before. After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as Americans on their home turf.  Things someone from England notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not. 
CUT. 
EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING. 
Wilson's not here for comfort.  Shown to a shitty room, round the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.  Airport close by. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM.  EVENING. 
He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy glide.  His moves are neat.  His expressions just as economical, not giving much away.  Outside the planes are practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and chemical. 
He's only got one light bag.  Unzips, unpacks a few things. Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar British brand names. 
Goes into the bathroom.  Turns on the shower in there. 
Comes back to sit on the bed.  Takes an envelope out of his jacket. 
ENVELOPE 
Turns it over to see the return address on the back. 
CUT. 
INT. TAXI.  NIGHT. 
Wilson in the back.  Stares at the impenetrable name on the driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver. 
DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview mirror. 
CUT. 
EXT. SMALL HOUSE.  NIGHT. 
Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door. Lower middle-class street.  Two cars in the driveway, one behind the other.  Lights on inside the house -- as he rings the bell. 
ED RAMA 
Answers it.  Hispanic.  Late 30's.  Chairman Mao on his T- shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.  Not looking for any trouble -- anymore.  But once did, and able to handle himself if any shows up.  Which it has. 
WILSON Edward Rama? 
ED Eduardo. (rolling the R) Rama. 
WILSON You're home, then. 
He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.  While Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction. 
WILSON My name's Wilson. 
Accent speaks for itself.  Hard, working-class. 
ED Wilson? 
Knows the name.  But just now it's unexpected.  He's holding a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel. 
WILSON You wrote to me about my daughter. 
CUT.

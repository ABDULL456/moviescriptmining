{"test1_input": "ERIC Why don't they just kill us? \nJEFF It's got something to do with the hill, I think. Once you step on it, you're not allowed off. Something like that. They won't step on it themselves, but now that we're here, they won't let us leave. So we have to figure out a way to survive till someone comes and finds-us. \nAMY Who? Jeff lifts one hand, palm-up, half a shrug. \nJEFF People'll start to worry when we don't return home. Right? And \nTHEY'LL-- \nAMY We're not supposed to leave till Friday. Jeff nods. AMY (cont'd) And they'll have to come searching. Again, he nods. AMY (cont'd) So you're talking--what, a week? \n.JEFF Something like that. Amy looks appalled; her voice JUMPS: \nAMY We can't live here for a week, Jeff. \nJEFF If we try to leave, they'll shoot us. That's the one thing we know for certain. An electronic CHIRPING comes from the shaft: it sounds like a cell phone ringing. Mathias turns his head, listening. No one else notices it. \nAMY But what will we eat? How will we-- The RINGING comes again, silencing her. She glances toward the shaft, not quite believing what she's hearing. It comes a THIRD TIME, and they all stand up, step to the hole, peer into its darkness. The RINGING comes yet again. \nSTACY A cell phone. \nAMY It can't be-- \nJEFF That's a cell phone, Amy. Definitely. \n.AMY But there's no signal out here. Eric can't get a signal. Reflexively, Eric pulls out his phone, checks again: nothing. There's another RING. \nJEFF It could be a different network. Something local. \nAMY Way down in that hole? How could it pick it up? Still another RING. \nERIC What else can it be? \nThe RINGING falls SILENT. They all stand there, staring into the hole. A long beat, then it RESUMES. Eric CLAPS his hands, ecstatic. The others are starting to smile, too. Mathias moves to the windlass. He unrolls some of the rope, starts to wrap it around his chest. Jeff watches him. Another RING. The vine has taken root on the windlass:- the sawhorse, the barrel, the rope. Jeff steps forward, begins to yank it off, careful not to get the sap on his hands. He turns to Amy. \nJEFF There's a lamp in the orange tent. See if you can find some matches, too. Amy hurries off toward the orange tent, vanishing inside. There's a final RING, and then SILENCE again. Mathias is knotting the rope tightly around his chest. Amy returns, carrying an oil lamp, a box of matches. Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp. Then he rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely. JEFF (cont'd) You sure? Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the hole. Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themselves at the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut. Mathias girds himself, steps out over the hole. He dangles there for a moment, hanging beneath the sawhorse, the windlass GROANING on its mount. Then Jeff and Eric begin to reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out. Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft, peering into it, watching as Mathias begins his descent--ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet down, and still only darkness beneath him, with no sign of the shaft's bottom. The windlass CREAKS as it turns; Jeff and Eric strain against it, sweating, muscles taut. Amy has turned from the shaft, is watching: the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel. \nAMY Jeff. He turns to look, and she points at the rope, where it comes off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel hanging from the sawhorse. \nAMY (cont'd) The sap... They'd cleared off most of the vine from the rope, but not all of it. Some of these remaining tendrils have been crushed as the windlass slowly unspools. Their sap is darkening the rope in spots, eating into it. AMY (cont'd) I think it's-- Jeff immediately turns back to the crank, his voice URGENT: \nJEFF Pull him up ! Eric hasn't grasped what's happening. He hesitates. JEFF (cont'd) \nNOWT Amy jumps forward to help, all three of them pushing at the crank, getting in each other's way, the windlass CREAKING as it begins to turn again, slowly reclaiming the rope. Stacy remains beside the shaft, peering anxiously into it. \nSTACY'S POV - THE SHAFT Mathias is twenty-five feet beneath us, just beginning to bump his way upward, swaying back and forth. He stares up at us, CONFUSED: \nMATHIAS What is it? The rope beneath the sawhorse is being visibly eaten away, its hemp unraveling. \nBACK TO SCENE Stacy turns toward the others, pointing, terrified. \nSTACY \nIT'S-- The rope SWAPS. Jeff, Eric and Amy fall forward, the windlass spinning wildly behind them, free'of its weight. A long beat, then there's a distant, hollow-sounding THUMP, followed instantly by the POP of the lamp shattering. Stacy leans to peer into the shaft, her hand over her mouth. \n", "test1_true": "STACY (O.S.) Mathias...? Her voice ECHOES back at us. There's no response. \nBACK TO SCENE Jeff, Eric, and Amy join Stacy at the edge of the shaft, all of them staring down into the darkness, looking horrified. \nERIC Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck. \nAMY Is he-- There's a GROAN from below, very faint, almost inaudible. \nJEFF He's moaning. They listen for a beat, but there's only silence. JEFF (cont'd) I heard him moan. The others don't seem so certain; Jeff turns to the girls. JEFF (cont'd) One of you will have to go. \nAMY Go? Jeff nods, waving into the shaft. \nJEFF Down. We'll clear the vine off the rope. And you can-- \nAMY Why can't you? Or Eric? \nJEFF We have to work the crank. You won't be strong enough. \nAmy and Stacy stare at each other; it's obvious neither of them wants to go. Stacy is the one who finally gives in. \nSTACY I can do it. \nAMY \n(RELIEVED) You sure? Stacy nods, but she doesn't look sure. She's hugging herself; it seems as if she might start trembling. Before anyone can speak, that GROANING comes from the shaft again, louder this time, unmistakable. Jeff cups his hands, SHOUTS: \nJEFF Mathias...? More SILENCE. Jeff turns to the girls. JEFF (cont'd) See if you can find a knife. And another lamp.' He waves them toward the tents; then he and Eric begin to unspool the rope from the windlass, laying it out across the clearing in long, looping circles. \nEXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY \nThe Mayans keep coming: women now, too, bearing bundles on their backs. They're setting up a campsite along the edge of the jungle. The bald man stands in their midst, his hands on his hips, staring silently up the hillside. \nCU - OIL LAMP The SCRATCH of a match being lit: Amy's hand comes into frame, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, fires the wick. \nJEFF (0.S.) Just help him into the sling. Then we'll pull him up. The chimney is carefully replaced, as WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY \nAmy is crouched, adjusting the lamp's flame. Jeff and Eric have mended the rope. \nWE SEE the excised lengths of spoiled hemp, and the ragged- looking knots on the rope itself, which has been spooled once more around the windlass. They've fashioned a sling at the rope's end. Jeff and Eric are helping Stacy into it, pulling it over her head, adjusting it under her armpits. \nJEFF Once we get him out, we'll drop the rope back down and pull you up, too. Amy offers Stacy the lamp. Stacy is scared, yet struggling not to show it. Her hands are trembling, and the lamp rattles as she takes it. The boys are stepping toward the windlass; Eric stops, glances back at her. \nERIC You okay? Stacy nods, but without much conviction. Eric steps toward her, gives her a tight hug. He holds her eyes for a moment, kisses her. Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank. They lean against it, and the rope goes taut. Stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft, the lamp in her right hand. With her left hand, she lunges, grabs at the sawhorse, clings tightly to it. Jeff glances toward her from the hand crank. \nJEFF Ready? She nods, but doesn't relinquish her grip on the sawhorse. JEFF (cont'd) You have to let go, Stacy. For a moment, it doesn't seem like she'll be able to, but then--with a visible act of will--she does, and they slowly. begin to let the rope out, dropping her into the shaft. \nON STACY - IN THE SLING She grips the sling with one hand, the lamp with the other. Wooden supports have been hammered into the walls of the shaft, buttressing the dirt. The vine clings to them, its leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above. Stacy begins to swing, pendulum-like, as she descends. She tries unsuccessfully to steady herself, then glances up. \nSTACY'S POV - ABOVE HER We're steadily dropping: thirty feet down, then forty. Amy is at the edge of the shaft, peering in at us. She waves. \nBACK TO SCENE Stacy smiles up at her. She starts to wave back, but is too scared to let go of the sling. She glances down. \nSTACY'S POV - BENEATH HER The light is swaying back and forth with Stacy, and it causes the shadows beneath us to jump and lurch. There's still no sign of the bottom; the windlass continues to CREAK. A beat, and then, very faintly, Mathias's dim shape starts to emerge: his white tennis shoes, his pale blue T-shirt. The lamp picks up bits of broken glass around his body. \n", "test1_id": 627, "test2_input": "BACK TO SCENE Stacy stands there, looking scared. There's another RING. \nJEFF (O.S.) Can you see it? Stacy lifts her head, SHOUTS: \nSTACY No. She keeps peering into the shadows, not moving. The ringing falls SILENT. Stacy turns, hobbles back toward Mathias, and the light shudders, dims for a moment. She squints at it: the oil is nearly gone. She SHOUTS up to the others: STACY (cont'd) The lamp's almost out of oil. \nJEFF (O.S.) Then blow it out. \nStacy seems terrified by this. \nSTACY Blow it out? \nJEFF (0.5.) We'll need it when we come down. To get him on the backboard. Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp down before her, stares at it. She clearly doesn't want to blow it out. Mathias watches her, silent. JEFF (O.S.) (cont'd) All right? Stacy leans forward, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, blows out the flame, dropping the shaft into darkness. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK \nThe.sun is just touching the horizon, the sky turning red. Th ey've tied the braids of nylon onto the rope, attached the finished backboard to them. It rests beside the shaft, padded with one-of the archaeologist's sleeping bags. Jeff and Eric remove their belts, drop them onto the backboard. They step to the windlass, lean against its hand crank, the rope going taut. Amy stands by the shaft, gathering her courage. Then she reaches for the backboard. \nTHE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness. The windlass begins its CREAKING. A long beat, and then: \nAMY (O.S.) Stacy? \nSTACY What? \nAMY -(0.5.) Light the lamp! Stacy shifts; once again, there's the RASP of a match, then the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its wick. Mathias's eyes are shut; there's a deep RAGGEDNESS to his breathing. Stacy looks upward. \nSTACY'S POV - ABOVE HER The backboard is dropping toward us. Above it, the light is already fading from the sky. \nBACK TO SCENE Stacy rises to her feet, lifting the lamp. \nON AMY - CROUCHING ON THE BACKBOARD She's dropping slowly down the shaft, clenching the nylon braids, her eyes tightly shut: terrified. The backboard sways, pendulum-like, as it descends, almost touching the vine-covered walls. \nTHE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT When the backboard comes within reach, Stacy grabs it, pulling it to the-right, so that it will come to rest at Mathias's side. But then, with three feet still to go, it jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch. A beat, and Jeff's voice comes toward them from above: \nJEFF (O.S.) Have you reached them? \nAMY Almost. A few more feet. \nJEFF (O.S.} How many? Amy leans, peers down at Mathias's broken body. \nAMY I don't know. Three? \nJEFF (O.S.} we're out of rope. (a beat) Can you still do it? Amy looks at Stacy; neither speaks. Finally, QUIETLY: \nSTACY We'll have to send it back up, I guess. \nAmy doesn't answer. She shifts her weight, and the backboard starts to swing. Stacy reaches to steady it. STACY (cont'd) Blow out the lamp. Wait here in the dark. Amy is silent, staring down at Mathias's still form; it's obvious she doesn't want to do this. STACY (cont'd) Or we could try to lift him, maybe. More silence. Stacy persists: STACY (cont'd) One of us at his shoulders. The other his feet. \nAMY If he twists-- \nSTACY It's only a few feet. /\"- Once more, Amy is silent. Stacy lifts the lamp, examining it, the diminishing pool of oil. STACY (cont'.d) We have to decide. The light's not going to last. Jeff's voice comes toward them from above again: \nJEFF (O.S.) Amy...? They both look up; the sky has grown too dark to see him. Amy hesitates one beat more, then YELLS: \nAMY We're gonna try itt She climbs off the backboard, crouches beside Mathias. Stacy sets down the lamp. AMY (cont'd) Mathias...? She touches his shoulder, and he opens his eyes, stares at her. He looks haggard, ashen. \n", "test2_true": "STACY You sure? \nAMY If you lift from his feet, he'll bend at the waist. \nSTACY But if I lift at his hips, won't he arch his back? They both stare down at Mathis, imagining these two different scenarios. Amy glances toward the lamp, its dwindling oil. \nAMY His knees. Stacy crouches by Mathias's knees, a little off balance, favoring her wounded leg. Amy bends, sliding her hands under his shoulders. Mathias GROANS, and Stacy starts to pull away, but Amy shakes her head. AMY (cont'd) Quickly. On three. They count together: \nSTACY AND AMY One ... two.-,.three. They lift, and Mathias immediately starts to SCREAM. His body sags at the waist; he begins to thrash his arms. Stacy starts to set him down, but Amy shakes her head, SHOUTS: \nAMY No! \nStacy's wounded leg is hindering her; she can't keep up with Amy. Mathias's shoulders are level with the backboard, but his knees are still a good foot beneath it. He keeps SCREAMING. The bend at his waist increases. AMY (cont'd) Lift I Stacy tries to hoist him higher, lunging, his torso twisting, his SCREAMS going LOUDER. His right arm, hits the backboard, sends it swinging. The girls toss him toward it. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT \nThe sun has set. There's a half moon, giving us just enough light to dimly see Eric and Jeff peering into the shaft. Mathias's SCREAMS echo up toward them. \nTHE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - NIGHT Mathias has fallen silent. He lies on the backboard, eyes clenched, sweat beading his forehead. Stacy is trying not to cry. She watches Amy buckle the two belts together, then drape them over Mathias's chest, knot them tight. Amy strips off her own belt, gestures for Stacy to do the same. She buckles these together, too. \nSTACY I have to pee. She limps toward the wall, lowers her pants, gingerly crouches. She stares toward the other shaft as she pees: its stone archway, the shifting shadows, the vine rustling softly in the steady draught. Amy binds Mathias at his thighs. She WHISPERS to him: \nAMY You okay? She waits, but he doesn't respond. His eyes remain shut. Stacy rises, buttoning her pants, limps back toward Amy. She's on the edge of tears, is working hard to fight them off. Amy lifts her head, SHOUTS up to Jeff: AMY (cont'd) Pull him up! \nA moment's pause, then the windlass begins to CREAK once more. The backboard slowly rises, swaying gently. They watch it climb away from them. Amy holds out her-hand. ANY (cont'd) Here. Stacy just stares at her, not understanding. Amy nods at the lamp: the oil is gone. AMY (cont'd) It's gonna go out. And it's true: as Stacy reaches for Amy's hand, the light suddenly flickers, dims, drops them into darkness. \nEXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - NIGHT \nThe Mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite. Three of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing, facing the hillside, their backs to the fire. The young Mayan's corpse still lies in the dirt, fifteen feet in front of them. The firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT' \nThe windlass CREAKS loudly as Eric and Jeff work to wind in the rope. Stacy has already been pulled up from the hole. She's sitting beside Mathias, who's lying on the backboard, on the edge of the clearing, by the orange tent. Amy emerges from the shaft, dangling beneath the sawhorse. Jeff holds the rope taut while Eric steps to the hole, pulls Amy toward him. Stacy watches from beside the backboard. Mathias's eyes are shut, his breathing ROUGH with phlegm. No one speaks. Once Amy is free of the sling, they all move to the backboard. Eric takes Stacy's-hand; Jeff crouches, starts to undo the belts. \nERIC Shouldn't we carry him into the tent first? Jeff pulls free the first belt, shifts to the second one. \nJEFF We can't. \nERIC Because? \nJEFF He's gonna keep leaking urine. \nAMY But we can't just leave him out in the open. \nJEFF We'll rig a shelter. With what's left of the blue tent. Jeff pulls the second belt free. Mathias's eyes remain shut. JEFF (cont'd) One of us should stay on watch while the others sleep. Two hour shifts. He reaches for his knapsack, unzips it. He pulls out a liter bottle of water. JEFF (cont'd) .Once it's light, we'll figure out how much water we have, and how to ration it. Food, too. For now, I think we should each just take a single swig. He uncaps the bottle, hands it to Amy. He watches her drink from it. When she's done, she passes it to Stacy. JEFF (cont'd) Eric and I'll build the shelter,. then I'll take the first shift. You two should try to sleep. Stacy takes her single sip, passes the bottle to Eric. \nINT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT \nStacy and Amy have pushed the camping supplies into a pile along the tent's rear wall. Stacy pulls off her pants, bends to examine her wound in the darkness. Amy is beside her, lying on her side. A beat of silence. Then, WHISPERING: \nSTACY Amy? what? \nSTACY We shouldn't have lifted him, should we? Amy reaches, pats Stacy's hand. \nAMY Shh. \n", "test2_id": 628, "test3_input": "STACY He's never gonna walk again.. He's-- \nAMY Don't, Stacy. Don't talk. It'll only make things worse. Stacy falls silent. AMY (cont'd) Just go to sleep, okay? Let's try to go to sleep. Stacy lies down next to Amy, in her-underwear and T-shirt. They huddle close together in the darkness. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT \nEric is building a tiny lean-to for Mathias, using the duct tape, the leftover nylon and poles from the blue tent. Jeff crouches over the backboard. He starts to cut Mathias's jeans off him with the knife. Mathias's eyes remain shut. \nERIC What're you doing? \nJEFF We have to keep him clean. He slices the jeans, from ankle to hip, first one leg, then the other, struggling not to jostle Mathias's body. JEFF (cont'd) That's how it'll happen, I think. if it does. \nERIC If what does? Jeff slides the soiled strips of-denim out from under Mathias's body, tosses them aside. He LOWERS his voice:. \nJEFF If he dies here. infection. Blood poisoning--something like that. Eric seems startled by this. \nERIC You think he's gonna die? \nJEFF (he shrugs) His back is broken. Who knows what else. Eric is silent, motionless, the tape in his hand. Mathias's BREATHING seems to be getting steadily worse. Jeff bends to cut off his boxers, first one leg, then the other. He tosses the soiled fabric aside. JEFF (cont'd) We should go back down in the morning. \nERIC Down? \nJEFF Into the shaft. Try to find the phone again. \nERIC There's no oil for the lamp. Jeff waves toward the orange tent. \nJEFF There's tequila. We could pour it on some of the clothes, tie them around one of these poles, make a torch. A sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of nylon and aluminum poles. Jeff steps over to pick it up. JEFF (cont'd) Without the phone, he's dead. If we have to wait for someone to come searching... He shakes his head. Then he leans forward and carefully drapes the sleeping bag across Mathias's broken body. \nINT. ORANGE TENT - DAWN \nThe orange nylon is just starting to glow with the sun's arrival. Stacy and Eric lie beneath one of the sleeping bags, Eric's head on her shoulder. Jeff lies curled on his side, a few feet away, still shirtless. Jeff's eyes open. He sits up, stares about, then reaches for one of the backpacks. He quietly digs through it till he finds a T-shirt. He sniffs at it, then pulls it on. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAWN \nMathias lies on his backboard, eyes shut, his breathing still sounding THICK WITH PHLEGM. Amy sits beside him, hunched into herself, half drowsing. She lifts her head as Jeff emerges from the tent, stares at him. \nJEFF How is he? \nAMY The same. \nJEFF And you? \nAMY (she shrugs) Tired. Thirsty. Hungry. \nJEFF Once the others are up, we'll have some water. His face is stubbled, sweat-stained. He looks ragged; they both do. He steps to the opposite side of the clearing, unzips, begins to urinate, with his back to Amy. \nJEFF'S POV - ACROSS THE HILLTOP The vine covers everything, tangled and matted, with those odd, knoll-like growths scattered among it. The nearest-is thirty feet away. its leaves are swaying slightly in a faint breeze, and WE SEE a flash of yellowish white beneath them. \nBACK TO SCENE Jeff finishes, shakes, zips, then steps out into the vine, wading toward the tiny mound. Amy remains beside the backboard; she watches him crouch, part the tendrils, stare. \nANY What is it? Jeff gestures for her to approach. When she reaches him, he leans forward, pulls aside the vines. WE SEE a man's skull, a loose tumble of bones. Amy INHALES sharply, recoiling. \nJEFF Bodies. All of them. He waves across the hilltop, at the other mounds: there are more than a dozen. Amy takes them in. The light is gaining strength, the green leaves seeming to shine in it, the red flowers to glow. Jeff's face assumes a puzzled expression. JEFF (cont'd) Where are the birds? \nAMY Birds? \n", "test3_true": "INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY \nStacy opens her eyes. She lies there, struggling to orient herself, with Eric on her shoulder. She starts to roll onto her side, then stops, looking confused. She reaches under the sleeping bag, toward her leg, her confusion changing to alarm. She site up, jarring Eric awake, and throws back the sleeping bag. \nERIC \n(BEFUDDLED) What...? The vine has grown dramatically during the night, reaching out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to spread across Stacy's right leg, almost to her waist. She sits up, tries to push it off her. \nSTACY Oh my god... The vine is clinging to her; she has to tear it, the sap shining slickly on her hands, visibly beginning to burn the skin. She yanks at the tendrils, tossing them aside. STACY (cont'd) Help me. Eric sits up, still only half-awake. He just stares. STACY (cont'd). It's inside me... It's true: one of the tendrils has pushed its way into the wound on her leg, widening it, thrusting itself a full three inches into her body, like a thick finger. STACY (cont.'d) Oh, Jesus--it's fucking inside me. She tries to pull the tendril out, but she's too panicky, too quick, and the vine breaks, leaving a piece of itself snagged under her skin. Stacy starts to SCREAM: STACY (cont'd) Get the knifes Eric is too shocked to stir. He's staring down at her leg, at the bulge beneath her skin: it looks as if it's moving. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY \nStacy's SCREAMING continues. Jeff and Amy are on their feet, hurrying across the clearing. Mathias has opened his eyes. \nSTACY (O.S.) Get the knife! Jeff bends, scoops up the knife, starts toward the tent. He waves toward Mathias. \nJEFF Stay with him. Then he ducks in through the tent's flap. \nINT. ORANGE TENT - DAY \nEric is beside Stacy, trying to calm her; she's started to CRY. Her hands and wrists have turned a dark red, and the tendril is inside her leg, just to the left of her shin, running parallel to it. Jeff steps. toward them. \nJEFF What is it? \nERIC The vine. It's inside her. Stacy points to her wound, SOBBING now: \nSTACY Cut it out. You gotta cut it out. \nJEFF The blade's dirty. We should-- Stacy starts shaking her head, FRANTIC: \nSTACY It's moving! Can't you see? Jeff stares at the bulge, hesitating. Then it moves, unquestionably: contracting and expanding, like a worm. Stacy SHRIEKS: STACY (cont'd) Jeff! Be gives in, crouching over her leg. \nJEFF It's gonna hurt. \nSTACY Please. Hurry. He leans forward, slices into the skin above the bulge. Stacy CRIES OUT, starts to jerk away, but Jeff presses down on her leg, holding her still. He reaches into her wound with his finger, digs out the piece of vine, tosses it aside. \nJEFF Get me a shirt or something. He gestures toward the backpacks, and Eric unzips one of them, starts to dig through it. \nHe pulls out a T-shirt, hands it to Jeff. Jeff wads it up, uses it to put pressure on the incision, staunching the flow of blood. \nEXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY \nAmy is crouched by the backboard, watching the tent, trying to grasp what's happening. Mathias startles her by speaking: \nMATHIAS Something's... wrong... His voice is thick-sounding, very faint. Amy tries to soothe him; she puts her hand on his shoulder. \nAMY It's okay. It's just-- \nMATHIAS my-legs... \nAMY I know. You're hurt. But we're., gonna get you-- \nMATHIAS Show ...me... He's struggling to rise, straining upward. Amy tries to stop him, pressing down on his shoulder. \nAMY Shh. But he fights her; he won't be quieted: \n", "test3_id": 629}

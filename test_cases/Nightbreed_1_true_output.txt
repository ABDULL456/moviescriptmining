From emergency behind them, a warning buzzer sounds. 
VOICE [thru loudspeaker]: Code blue! Code blue! 
In an emergency room cubicle, a patient is having a seizure. The nurse rushes off, leaving Boone. Interns roll the cardiac cart towards the cubicle and curtains close around the scene. 
The door to Boone's room swings closed, shutting out the sounds. Boone exhales heavily. Closes his eyes. 
NARCISSE [V.O.] [muttering - half mumbled ranting]: Shit! Shit! Take me, why don't you take me? 
Boone opens his eyes. Looks across the room at Narcisse, a wild man, half-derelict, half-punk, bloodied, his hand bandaged, pacing back and forth like a caged cat, staring out of a large picture window at the night. 
51. EXT. HOSPITAL WINDOW NIGHT 
Looking in at the brightly lit window framed in the dark building, as Narcisse restlessly moves across it, peering outside. 
52. INT. SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT 
NARCISSE [low and anxious]: They've gone, they've gone, they were here, they were coming for me, where'd they go? Shit! 
BOONE: Hey... 
NARCISSE [turns on him - viciously]: Shut up, shut up! They saw you, they won't come while you're here, they won't show themselves to the likes of you, don't you see that? 
BOONE [placating - knows the type]: Sure, okay. 
NARCISSE: Shit! I've missed them, I've missed them! You scared them off, you kept them from me! 
Narcisse paces again, starting to sob and sniffle. Boone leans back. 
NARCISSE [cont.] [barely audible - between cries]: ...Midian...Midian... 
Boone's eyes open like a shot. 
BOONE: What did you say? 
NARCISSE: I said shut up, you want to ruin everything? 
Boone leaps to his feet, grabs and easily overpowers the smaller man. 
BOONE: What did you say, just now? 
NARCISSE [suddenly friendly]: What did you say, just now? 
BOONE: You said Midian. 
NARICSSE [coyly]: Did I? Maybe... 
BOONE [hurting him - desperate]: What do you know about it? 
NARCISSE: It's where the monsters go. It takes away the pain... 
Narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets, then comes out with long, silver, razor-sharp artificial nails, curved like hooks, attached to his thumbs. He holds them right at Boone's throat, ready to cut. He smiles. 
NARCISSE [cont.]: ...what do you know about it? 
BOONE [pause; cautiously]: They forgive you there. 
NARCISSE: Uh-huh. Ever kill anybody? 
BOONE: Yes. 
NARCISSE: See, they only take you if you're worthy. You know what they do to those that aren't worthy? 
Boone shakes his head. Narcisse draws one razor-nail lightly across his own throat. A thin trickle of blood runs down his neck. He chuckles. 
BOONE: It's real. Midian's real. [Narcisse nods; carefully] And you know...where it is. Don't you? We could go there... 
NARCISSE: They sent you. They sent you to take me. 
BOONE: That's right. But first I need to know...you have to tell me...where it is. 
NARCISSE: It's a test? [Boone nods; Narcisse leans in to him - whispers] No maps. 
BOONE: But you do know. Don't you? 
NARCISSE [looks around; leans in again]: North of Athabasca. East of Peace River. Near Shere Neck, north of Dwyer. 
Satisfied, Boone releases him, go back to the bed, collects his jacket. 
NARCISSE [cont.] [ exhilarated]: You'll take me with you, I'm worthy, you ask anyone, I knew you'd come, they sent you to take me, I was waiting. I know, I know, first I have to show you, that's how it works. 
Boone is looking out of the window in the door, sizing up his escape. 
BOONE: Show me what? 
NARCISSE: My true face. That's what there are for. [he raises his bladed thumbs] So you can see. I'm not a natural man. Underneath I'm a monster, that's how it works; I show you, then you take me with you... 
He puts the blade to either side of his face. We hear the skin pop. 
BOONE: NO! 
Blood pours from Narcisse's face, as he traces the outline of his face. 
53. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT 
Dr Decker, who's just arrived with Lieutenant Joyce and two policemen, is speaking with the doctor that examined Boone. 
DECKER [urgent - showing Boone's file]: ...he was an abandoned child, raised by the state, first diagnosis of incipient schizophrenia at thirteen, juvenile delinquency, periodically institutionalized through early adulthood...some violent episodes, never criminally charged as an adult, he's been in my care for less than a year... 
A bloodcurdling scream from the semi-private room rivets the attention of the emergency room

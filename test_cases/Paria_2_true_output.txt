ALIKE But I do wanna hang out...I mean...maybe we could do both. 
Bina smiles and shuts the locker door. 
BINA Cool. (beat) You could spend the night if want to. Avoid the whole curfew thing. 
ALIKE Yeah... 
BINA You sure? 
ALIKE Yeah. 
58   INT. FAMILY CAR - DAY                                        58 
Arthur coaches Alike as she navigates the car to a jerky stop in front of Mack's liquor store. 
ARTHUR Easy, easy now. Watch your right hand side. 
ALIKE I am. 
ARTHUR Don't ride the brakes though. Good. 
ALIKE See? I'm getting better!! Can I drive back? 
Arthur rubs his chest in mock heart-attack. 
ARTHUR I don't about that. You're shaky girl, you're shaky. Get us some chips and I'll think about it. 
Arthur hands Alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down out of the car. 
59   EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS                               59 
Arthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops into the store. 
MACK Hey, baby! 
ALIKE Hey Mr. Ferguson! 
MACK I see Alike's been running circles around you again! 
ARTHUR Little bit, little bit. I still got it though. 
Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock whispering to one of the men. 
Arthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t- shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's face. 
Sock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him, when Alike saunters out between them. 
ARTHUR We better get going. 
MACK (CONT'D) Gone already? 
ARTHUR I'll holler at you later. 
Arthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Get in the car. 
ALIKE But you said I could drive-- 
ARTHUR I said get in the car! 
Alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands. 
60   INT. ARTHUR'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                               60 
ARTHUR Look...umm...you know you're daddy's girl, right? 
Alike avoids eye contact, staring out her window. Arthur searches her face a moment longer, then starts the car and pulls away in silence. 
61   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   61 
Audrey reclines on the couch reading a book. The doorknob jiggles and Audrey folds the book against her chest, pretending to be asleep.

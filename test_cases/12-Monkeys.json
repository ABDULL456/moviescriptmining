{"test1_input": "DR. FLETCHER Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out? \nCOLE Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time. \nDR. FLETCHER So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future? \nCOLE No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, \"voice mail\".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present. \nRESIDENT #2 \"From the present.\"  We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole? \nCOLE No, no.  This is the past.  This has already happened.  Listen... \nRESIDENT #3 Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's the present, is that it? \nCOLE No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look... \nDR. FLETCHER These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they doctors like ourselves? \nTwo of the residents exchange quick knowing looks. \nCOLE No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the phone.  One call! \nCOLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers. \nINT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY \nFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER lunges for the phone, answers sharply... \nMOTHER Yes? (listens, frowns, then) Whaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!  I don't know what you're talkin' about. ... Is this a joke?  I don't know any scientists. James who?  Never heard of you! \nThe MOTHER slams down the phone. \nINT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY \nA dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically, RAILLY takes it from him. \nRAILLY It wasn't who you expected? \nCOLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts? \nCOLE It was some lady.  She didn't know anything. \nRAILLY Perhaps it was a wrong number... \nCOLE No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things. \nRAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest. It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly. \nRAILLY James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore? \nCOLE (lost in thought) What? \nRAILLY I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...? \nCOLE Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them? \nRAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE. \nRAILLY James, take these. (watching him step back) Please -- I helped you like I said I would.  Now I want you to trust me. \nINT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM) \nMR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE. \nMR. PONYTAIL WATCH IT! \nWas it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE. \nTRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out... \nWOMAN'S VOICE NOOOOOOOOOO! \nThe TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER! \nJust then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew! \nA sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT. Everything goes white! \nINT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nCOLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight. \nHe's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented. Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING, occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed. \nHis eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit. \nHe turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window. \nWith a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out. \nCOLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses. \nANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed. \nVOICE (o.s.) It won't work. You can't open it. \n", "test1_true": "JEFFREY You think you can remove the grill but you can't.  It's welded. \nCOLE checks the grill anyway. \nJEFFREY See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are locked, too.  They're protecting the people on the outside from us.  But the people outside are as crazy as us. \nCOLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight. \nANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep. \nThe flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close. \nFor a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING, SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off. \nJEFFREY You know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is \"majority rules\".  Take germs for example. \nAlthough COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, \"germs\"! \nCOLE Germs?! \nJEFFREY In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...\"germs\"! \nAs JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to figure out where to put the SPIDER. \nJEFFREY (cont.) So cut to the 20th century!  Last week in fact, right before I got dragged into this hellhole.  I order a burger in this fast food joint.  The waiter drops it on the floor.  He picks it up, wipes it off, hands it to me...like it was all okay. \nNo alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on... \nJEFFREY \"What about the germs?\"  I say.  He goes, \"I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!\" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you? \nCOLE I'm not crazy. \nJEFFREY Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out? \nCOLE If you know how to escape, why don't you...? \nJEFFREY Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word. \nCOLE What's that mean? \nJEFFREY I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS... \nPATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself. \nJEFFREY Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little agitated.  The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING... \nCOLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away. \nJEFFREY You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient! I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you morons find out who I am.  My father's gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES! MY FATHER IS GOD!  I WORSHIP MY FATHER. \nINT.  WARD DAYROOM - MORNING \nANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached to his tiny, restrained body. \nANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen. \nJEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Torture!  Experiments!  We're all monkeys \nCOLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes the seat next to him. \nCOLE They hurt you! \nJEFFREY Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty. \nANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles, eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates. \nTV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.) These video tapes were obtained by animal rights activists who worked underground as laboratory assistants for several months.  Authorities say there is little they can do until... \nThe video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of their experiments passively. \nANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily. \nCOLE Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out! \nJEFFREY (startled, turning) Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. (sudden whisper) I didn't say a word about \"you know what\". \nCOLE What are you talking about??? \nJEFFREY You know -- your plan. \nAs COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine. \nJEFFREY What're you writing?  You a reporter? \nCOLE (shielding the magazine) It's private. \nJEFFREY A lawsuit?  You going to sue them? \nJust then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills. \nBILLINGS Yo, James -- time to take your meds. \nINT.

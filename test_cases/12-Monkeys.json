{"train": "Twelve Monkeys \nTWELVE MONKEYS An original screenplay by \nDavid Peoples Janet Peoples \nInspired by LA JETEE, a Chris Marker Film \nProduction Draft June 27, 1994 \nFADE IN: \nINT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY \nCLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt. \nA BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering to his wound. \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of view, as they steer him away. \nFATHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Come on, Son --this is no place for us. \nYOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A. SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone... \nP.A. SYSTEM Flight 784 for San Francisco is now ready for boarding at inmate number 66578, Greely. \nINT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT \nPRISON P.A. SYSTEM --number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole... \nCOLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented. \nThen, as he \"recovers\" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS \"REALITY\" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE \"DREAMLIKE\" THAN HIS DREAM. \nFlashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures, GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages. \nCOLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE... \nCOLE Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on? \nJOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! \nJOSE \"Volunteers\" again. \nJOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it. \nSCARFACE \"Volunteer duty\". \nThe PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes. \nCOLE I didn't volunteer. \nSCARFACE You causing trouble again? \nCOLE (controls his temper) No trouble. \nINT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT \nCOLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes. \nTITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE \nCOLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it. \nOFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.) All openings must be closed. \nCOLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall. \nOFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.) If the integrity of the suit is compromised in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper not closed, readmittance will be denied. \nINT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) \nCOLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor, steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back. \nOn the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock. COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It \nINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) \nCOLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand. \nThe map shows a series of tunnels and ladders. \nINT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT) \nCOLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through \nRATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk. \nThe flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall. \nReaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly. \nMICROBIOLOGIST Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole. \nCOLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down. \nASTROPHYSICIST We want you to tell us about last night. \nCOLE I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. \nThe SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully. \nCOLE (worried) I mashed the spider, didn't I? \nMICROBIOLOGIST We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw. \nINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT) \nCOLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night. \nASTPOPHYSICIST Where you collected sample #4, what street was that? \nCOLE Uh... \nBOTANIST It's important to observe everything. \nCOLE I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street. \nAs the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves, COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another features a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on) and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, \"IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE\". \nASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.) Close your eyes, Cole. \nStartled, COLE closes his eyes obediently. \nBLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES. \nENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.) Tell us in detail what you've seen in this room. \nCOLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Uh, in this room?  Uh... \nMICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.) How many of us are there? \nCOLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Six...seven, if you count me. \nASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.) Tell us about the pictures on the wall... \nCOLE'S VOICE (o.s.) Uh, you mean the newspapers? \nA MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.) Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you hear my voice?  What do I look like? What does he look like, the man who just spoke?  How old were you when you left the surface? \nThe VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A. SYSTEM at the airport. \nINT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY \nTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse leading to the departure gates. \nP.A. SYSTEM (o.s.) Flight 784 now boarding at gate... \nSuddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago Hulls Sports Duffle Bag. \nMR. PONYTAIL WATCH IT! \nYOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates. \nJust then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\" \nYOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks.... TERRIFIED TRAVELER Just exactly why did you volunteer? \nINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT) \nCOLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS. \nASTROPHYSICIST Wake up, Cole. \nCOLE Uh, I didn't hear the... \nMICROBIOLOGIST (tapping a pencil on the table) I asked you, why did you volunteer? \nCOLE Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered. \nThe SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves. \nCOLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the ENGINEER speaks to him. \nENGINEER We appreciate you volunteering.  You're a very good observer, Cole. \nCOLE Uh, thank you. \nENGINEER You'll get a reduction in sentence. \nCOLE keeps his face impassive. \nASTROPHYSICIST To be determined by the proper authorities. \nENGINEER You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away? \nCOLE No, sir! \nCOLE You wouldn't understand. \nRAILLY You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital? \nCOLE I have to go. \nRAILLY A jail?  Prison? \nCOLE Underground. \nRAILLY Hiding? \nCOLE I love this air.  This is wonderful air. \nRAILLY What's wonderful about the air, James? \nCOLE It's so clean.  No germs. \nRAILLY You're afraid of germs? \nCOLE I have to go. \nRAILLY Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James? \nCOLE This is April, right? \nRAILLY July. \nCOLE (sudden panic) July?! \nRAILLY Do you know what year it is? \nCOLE What year is it? \nRAILLY What year do you think it is? \nCOLE \nRAILLY You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future? \nCOLE (slightly confused) No, 1995 is the past. \nRAILLY 1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989. \nCOLE looks stunned. \nINT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING \nCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN. \nCOLE Where are you taking me? \nPOLICEMAN #1 South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel. You're gonna love it. \nCOLE South of France?!  I don't want to go to the South of France.  I want to make a telephone call. \nPOLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door. \nPOLICEMAN #2 Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink with your act, but you don't fool us. \nThen, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light. \nEXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY \nA Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows. \nINT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING) \nFierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants, PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise. \nAs PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and starts inspecting his scalp... \nBILLINGS Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you got any creepy crawlies. \nCOLE I need to make a telephone call. \nBILLINGS (pulling Cole's head) Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo. Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says. \nCOLE It's very important. \nBILLINGS What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it easy, relax into things.  We all gonna get along fine if you just relax. \nCOLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration. \nINT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY) \nCOLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises. \nPATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly. \nBILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON, a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt. \nBILLINGS Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James. Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay? \nJEFFREY (with a sly look) How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd be doing your job. \nDR. FLETCHER Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out? \nCOLE Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time. \nDR. FLETCHER So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future? \nCOLE No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, \"voice mail\".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present. \nRESIDENT #2 \"From the present.\"  We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole? \nCOLE No, no.  This is the past.  This has already happened.  Listen... \nRESIDENT #3 Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's the present, is that it? \nCOLE No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look... \nDR. FLETCHER These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they doctors like ourselves? \nTwo of the residents exchange quick knowing looks. \nCOLE No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the phone.  One call! \nCOLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers. \nINT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY \nFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER lunges for the phone, answers sharply... \nMOTHER Yes? (listens, frowns, then) Whaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!  I don't know what you're talkin' about. ... Is this a joke?  I don't know any scientists. James who?  Never heard of you! \nThe MOTHER slams down the phone. \nINT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY \nA dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically, RAILLY takes it from him. \nRAILLY It wasn't who you expected? \nCOLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts? \nCOLE It was some lady.  She didn't know anything. \nRAILLY Perhaps it was a wrong number... \nCOLE No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things. \nRAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest. It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly. \nRAILLY James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore? \nCOLE (lost in thought) What? \nRAILLY I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...? \nCOLE Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them? \nRAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE. \nRAILLY James, take these. (watching him step back) Please -- I helped you like I said I would.  Now I want you to trust me. \nINT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM) \nMR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE. \nMR. PONYTAIL WATCH IT! \nWas it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE. \nTRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out... \nWOMAN'S VOICE NOOOOOOOOOO! \nThe TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER! \nJust then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew! \nA sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT. Everything goes white! \nINT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nCOLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight. \nHe's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented. Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING, occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed. \nHis eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit. \nHe turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window. \nWith a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out. \nCOLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses. \nANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed. \nVOICE (o.s.) It won't work. You can't open it. \nNARRATOR (v.o.) Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine. Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys! \nANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen. \nANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers. \nTV AWNOUNCER (v.o.) We'll return to the Marx Brothers in \"Monkey Business\" following these messages. \nJEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business. \nCOLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking. JEFFREY Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk! (big grin) Key! \nJEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  A KEY! \nCOLE (groggy) What....??? \nJEFFREY Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part. \nCOLE What...??? \nJEFFREY Not, \"what\", babe!  When! \n\"When???\" \nJEFFREY (pressing the key into Cole's hand) Now! \nVOICE/TV (o.s.) Let us guide you to the stocks and bonds that will enhance your portfolio. \nJEFFREY (leaping to his feet) YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS! NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW. \nANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating. \nVOICE/TV (v.o.) A portfolio tailored to your specific needs and the needs of your loved ones... \nANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily. \nJEFFREY YES, YES.  ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW! \nANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a beeper, calling for help. \nANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room. \nJEFFREY BUY!  SELL!  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY! \nANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces. \nANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just completed the puzzle stares, very upset. \nOther PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield. \nHEAVY WOMAN PATIENT I'M GETTING DIZZY.  MAKE HIM STOP! \nSKINNY MAN PATIENT HERE THEY COME!  THEY'RE COMING! \nOLD MAN PATIENT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I GOT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I'M INSURED! \nJEFFREY OPPORTUNITY!  DEFINITELY!  A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY!  OPENING NOW!  NOW'S THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!  YES! YES!  MASTERCARD!  VISA!  THE KEY TO HAPPINESS! \nANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY is sending a message to him.  COLE looks at the ward door. \nCOLE'S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter. One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit. \nJEFFREY SEIZE THE MOMENT!  GET RICH!  NOW'S THE TIME!  GO FOR IT! \nBILLINGS (missing a tackle) God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool. \nANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  He locks at the door...blurring in and out of focus.  He looks down at the key in his hand. \nANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREY resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him. \nJEFFREY LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW! \nANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries to insert the key in the lock. \nANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole. \nANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder. \nCOLE'S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE. \nANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It won't turn. \nA PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear. \nPATIENT Place to go would be...Florida.  The keys are lovely this tine of year. \nCOLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  It turns. \nPATIENT Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead. \nCOLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  Then, he opens the door. \nINT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL \nStepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room facing several elevators. \nRAILLY I have to do this, James.  You're very confused. \nRAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin. \nINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY) \nDR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  DR. CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there. \nDR. FLETCHER Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition. \nRAILLY I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just... \nDR. FLETCHER He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it? \nRAILLY Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and... \nDR. FLETCHER (impatient, not interested) Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull. \nRAILLY I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say? \nDR. FLETCHER You see what I mean?  You're being defensive. (to Dr. Casey) Isn't she being defensive, Bob? \nBut just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door. \nBILLINGS Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another... situation. \nINT.  CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY) \nDR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN, GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him. \nDR. FLETCHER He was in full restraints?  And the door was locked? \nBILLINGS Yes, sir.  Did it myself. \nDR. FLETCHER And he was fully sedated? \nRAILLY He was fully sedated! \nDR. FLETCHER Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now? \nDR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall. \nINT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM) \nSeen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into the sky as the airport P.A. System drones... \nP.A. SYSTEM Flight 784 to San Francisco now boarding at Gate 38... \nYOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION. \nMR. PONYTAIL bumps him. \nThe BLONDE MAN sprints past.  The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out! \nWOMAN'S VOICE NOOOOOOOOOO! \nTRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE running after the BLONDE MAN!  But this time, YOUNG COLE catches just a glimpse of her face.  She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings.  She calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM... \nBRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM The Freedom For Animals Headquarters now boarding on Second Avenue.  The Army of the Twelve Monkeys... \nENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.) Cole, you moron -- wake up! \nINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE \nAs COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE... \nUNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM -- they're the ones who are going to do it... \nCOLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  It's a beat-up old tape recorder. \nUNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER I can't do anything more.  The Police are after me. \nThe tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap... \nASTROPHYSICIST Well? \nCOLE Uh, what? \nENGINEER He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out. \nASTROPHYSICIST Cole, did you or did you not record that message? \nCOLE Uh, that message...me? \nMICROBIOLOGIST It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call? \nCOLE (angrily) I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989. \nSCIENTISTS \nThe SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  Then, \nZOOLOGIST You're certain of that? \nGEOLOGIST (before Cole can answer) What did you do with your time, Cole? Did you waste it on drugs?  Women? \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) Science isn't an exact science with these clowns.  You're lucky you didn't end up in ancient Egypt! \nINT.  LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE \nCOLE is strapped on a gurney.  SCIENTISTS hover near-by, whispering.  The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating. \nGEOLOGIST No mistakes this time, Cole. \nASTROPHYSICIST Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open. \nZOOLOGIST Good thinking about that spider, Cole. Try and do something like that again. \nMICROBIOLOGIST Just relax now -- don't fight it.  We have to know exactly what's there so we can fix it. \nThe gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube... reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital. \nCOLE'S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber door is CLANGED shut. \nEVERYTHING IS BLACK.  A HUM BUILDS.  THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN HUGE EXPLOSION!  THEN... \nEXT.  TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY \nDRIZZLING RAIN.  And SCREAMS.  COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he?  SOLDIERS in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit fifteen yards away.  Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks... in FRENCH.  COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I! Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French. \nSERGEANT (FRENCH, subtitled) Where's your mask?!  And your clothes... and your weapon, you idiot?! \nCOLE What?  What?? \nCOLE looks around desperately.  A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  Machine guns chatter close at hand.  AAK AAK AAK.  A grenade EXPLODES.  Reacting to the foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs... \nSERGEANT (FRENCH, subtitled) Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut! \nCOLE I don't understand.  Where am I? \nThe CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German. \nCAPTAIN (GERMAN, subtitled) How'd you get here, soldier?  What's your rank?  Where are your clothes? \nCOLE I...don't understand. \nCAPTAIN (frowning, GERMAN, subtitled) German!  Speak German!  What are you doing here? \nVOICE (o.s.) (pleading in English) I gotta find 'em.  I gotta find 'em. Please, you gotta help me! \nCOLE turns, sees... \nIt's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in the \"underground\" time.  He's being carried past COLE now on a stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded. \nCOLE JOSE! \nJOSE Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we? \nJOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.  COLE goes down.  Hit in the leg! \nSOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects. \nLooking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead from a chest wound, his gas mask half off. \nCOLE is reaching for the mask when... \nA SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION. \nEXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT \nStunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at the dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.  MOVING IN we FOCUS ON a large poster advertising \"The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995\". WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON... \nDR. KATHRYN RAILLY MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS MAY 17 \nINT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT \nA large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen is a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing. \nRAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.) According to the accounts of local officials at that time, this gentleman, judged to be about forty years of age, appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge in the West of England in April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent, the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence which he predicted would wipe out humanity in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the village, was taken into custody, but then mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again. \nWE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern in a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES. \nRAILLY (cont.) In 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasons of great pestilence, men have often believed the prophecies of crazed fanatics, that the end of the world was come.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling when reality supports it in some form, whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox, or AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\" contagions, there are now technological horrors as well:  besides radiation, consider our lurking fear of germ warfare and its close approximation, chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head in the deadly mustard gas attacks during the First World War. \nON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc.. \nRAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.) During such an attack in the French trenches in October, 1917, we have an account of this soldier... \nON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until the image approximates Munch's famous painting. \nRAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.) -- who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the lines where Doctors discovered he had lost all comprehension of French but spoke English fluently, albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize. The man, although physically unaffected by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed he had come from the future, that he was looking for a pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the earth in the year... 1995! \nThe AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE. \nON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill. \nRAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.) Although seriously injured, the young soldier disappeared from the hospital before more data could be gathered.  No doubt, he was trying to carry on his mission to warn others, substituting for the agony of war...a self-inflicted agony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\". \nAs RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN, RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS. \nRAILLY (cont.) Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall, was condemned to know the future but to be disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence, the agony of foreknowledge combined with impotence to do anything about it. \nHe's lowered the map.  It's COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty. \nRAILLY Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago. \nCOLE 1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here! \nCOLE is indicating a freeway entrance. \nRAILLY turns the wheel sharply. \nEXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT \nThe Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway. \nINT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT \nRAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily against the seat.  She says carefully... \nRAILLY I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me? \nCOLE You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. (sudden pride) I can read, remember? \nRAILLY Yes, I remember. (a beat, then) Why do you want to go to Philadelphia? \nCOLE It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. (pointing suddenly, eagerly) Zs that a radio?  Does it play music? \nRAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL. \nCOMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.) This is a personal message to you. \nCOLE sits up, alert, listening intently. \nCOMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.) Are you at the end of your rope?  Are you dying to get away? \nCOLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message. \nCOMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.} The Florida Keys are waiting for you. \nCOLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills the car.  It's confusing!  He blurts out... \nCOLE I've never seen the ocean! \nObserving his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her professional tone. \nRAILLY It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You do understand that, don't you?  It's not really a special message to you. \nCOLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but she's probably right. \nCOLE You used to call me \"James\". \nRAILLY You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you. \nCOLE (cynical laugh) Everybody's got a gun.  In this city... \nHe breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  FATS DOMINO singing \"BLUEBERRY HILL\"!  COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's. \nCOLE Can you...can you make it louder?  I love hearing twentieth century music! Hearing music and breathing air! \nAs RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the wind, mouth open, \"eating\" the air hungrily. \nEXT.  FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT \n\"BLUEBERRY HILL\" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear window, zips past a sign at 65 mph. \nThe sign says, \"PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES.\" \nINT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT \nRAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his head out the window.  what can she do?  Just then, while she's trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in... \nANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.) This just in from Fresno, California: emergency crews are converging on a cornfield where playmates of nine year old Ricky Neuman say they saw him disappear right before their eyes. \nCOLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now. \nANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.) Young Neuman apparently stepped into an abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive, possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim they heard him cry out faintly but since then there has been no contact with... \nCOLE \"Never cry wolf!\" \nRAILLY What? \nCOLE My father told me that.  \"Never cry wolf.\"  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens. \nRAILLY \"If something really happens\"...like what, James? \nCOLE Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff... \nRAILLY glances at him as she scans stations. \nRAILLY Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...? \nCOLE Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one? \nIt's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, \"SINCE I MET YOU, BABY\". \nIVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.) \"Since I met you, baby, My whole life has changed... \nANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen. \n----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING ----------------------- \nCOLE My notes.  Observations.  Clues. \nRAILLY Clues?  What kind of clues? \nCOLE A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment. \nRAILLY What will you do...when you find this...secret army? \nCOLE I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth. \nRAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back. \nCOLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes. \nCOLE You won't think I'm crazy next month. People are going to start dying.  At first the papers will say it's some weird fever, some virus.  Then they'll begin to catch on.  They'll get it. \nRADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.) We interrupt this program with a special bulletin... \nRAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert. \nRADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.) This report just in from Fresno, California.  Naval sonar specialists who were flown to the site... \nCOLE I thought it was about us.  I thought maybe they'd found us and arrested me or something. \nRAILLY stares at COLE. \nCOLE Just a joke. \nRADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.) -- an hour ago have been unable to determine the location of the boy in the 150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into the narrow tube claims he heard breathing sounds coming from approximately seventy feet down... \nCOLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again. \nRAILLY Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well? \nCOLE When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him. \nRAILLY What do you mean -- when you were a kid? \nCOLE Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left! \nCOLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left. \nEXT.  SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nAn elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES. \nEVANGELIST \"And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.\" \nANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving, COLE, beside her, staring out the window. \nINT.  ACURA/SKID ROW STREET \nCOLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable \"RESIDENTS\". \nCOLE Where I come from we think of this as Eden. If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut know what they have.  They don't see the sky.  They don't feel the air! \nCOLE'S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING! \nCOLE (o.s.) And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug they haven't a clue.  WAIT!  STOP! \nEXT.  ACURA/SKID ROW \nOn foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures. \nClueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE. \nCOLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang insignias.  We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle. \nCOLE The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They're here. (looks around) Somewhere.  Come on! \nHe pulls her along the sidewalk.  No question, he's insane. \nAt the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  Then, still keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert. \nRAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens... \nCOLE Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people! \nRAILLY I'm not going to \"do\" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is. \nANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  He's found another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS! \nBut just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s) You can't hide from them, Bob. \nCOLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future. \nLOUIE No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try. (conspiratorially) They hear everything.  They got that tracking device on you.  They can find you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha! \nRAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction. \nRAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down. \nRAILLY starts opening the door.  Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her. \nCOLE Where are you going? \nShe looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience Store appended to the Gas Station. \nRAILLY You can come with me.  I have to get some things.  Scissors, bandages, some alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look at your leg, James.  I'm a doctor. \nCOLE looks helpless, hesitant.  She's in charge...for the moment. \nEXT.  CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON) \nThe sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  We HEAR the CAR RADIO but not the engine. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.) Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining engineers continue their desperate attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the ant in which nine year old... \nCOLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.  He's staring up at the sun and the sky.  RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh. \nRAILLY You shouldn't put your weight on it. You need stitches and antibiotics. Lucky for you it was near the surface. \nRAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket while COLE continues staring up at the sky. \nCOLE I love seeing the sun. \nA beat.  COLE tries to stand up. \nRAILLY Wait -- let me help you. \nRAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  A beat. They're very close.  They don't move.  RAILLY looks like she can barely breathe. \nCOLE (leans closer, shuts his eyes) You smell so good. \nRAILLY (trying to concentrate) You have to give yourself up, you know. \nA beat.  The spell is broken.  He reaches for his pants, then turns back to her, suddenly grim. \nCOLE I have to do something now.  Something I don't want to do.  I'm so sorry. \nRAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  He looms over her.  He's cold now, steeled. \nCOLE I have a mission.  It's important. \nRAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die. \nEXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT \nA SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  Encountering another AGENT, he pauses. \nFIRST AGENT They find him? \nSECOND AGENT Who?? \nFIRST AGENT That kid.  The one in the pipe. \nSECOND AGENT You believe this?  They're dropping a monkey down there with a miniature infra-red camera strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich wrapped in tinfoil. \nFIRST AGENT You're making that up! \nANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to the receding VOICES of the AGENTS. \nSECOND AGENT (o.s.) I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird! A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who thought that one up. \nFIRST AGENT (o.s.) Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel Prize! \nQuickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  He doesn't see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes. \nINT.  MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA formal dinner for forty.  Desert has been served.  DR. MALCOLM MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS. \nDR. MASON Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself, with no sense of purpose.  But alas, I am \"burdened\" with the sense that with all this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise, there comes great responsibility.  Indeed, I practically feel a soapbox growing under my feet whenever I stand for more than a few seconds. \nWhile GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone. \nDR. MASON (o.s.) The dangers of science are a time worn threat, from Prometheus stealing fire from the Gods to the Cold War era of the Dr. Strangelove Terror. \nAGENT #3 spots who he's looking for.  JEFFREY MASON! \nDR. MASON (cont.) But never before, not even at Los Alamos when the scientists made bets on whether their first atomic bomb test would wipe out New Mexico, has science given us so much reason to fear the power we have at hand. \nANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear. \nJEFFREY What are you talking about?  What friend?  I'm not expecting anyone. \nANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance. \nDR. MASON Current genetic engineering as well as my own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as any... \nANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room, grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience. \nJEFFREY This is ridiculous.  My father is making a major address. \nINT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION \nAGENT #3 Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him. Everything's... \nJEFFREY MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE \"PROCESSED\" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE \"ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS\" BECOMES SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM??? \nSuddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free, shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase. \nINT.  FOYER/MASON MANSION \nCOLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there!  COLE turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way through the crowd of amazed GUESTS. \nINT.  DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION \nSERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS burst into the room. \nAGENT #4 Did a man just come through here...limping? \nINT.  KITCHEN/MASON MANSION \nCOOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen and look about urgently. \nINT.  DEN/MASON MANSION \nA large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES. \nTV REPORTER (v.o.) These pictures we are seeing are coming to us live from deep inside the pipe. You can just make out the metal wall behind those roots and I guess those must be spider webs. \nMRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern... \nMRS. McCANN Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey is going to eat the sandwich himself. \nJust then, two AGENTS burst into the den. \nThe GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it. \nAGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW:  the rows of expensive parked CARS. \nON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears. \nTV ANCHOR (v.o.) This just in:  Police say that the body of a woman found strangled in the Knutson state Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly. \nAs the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned Acura comes up on the TV screen. \nTV ANCHOR (v.o.) Earlier in the day, police located Railly's abandoned car not far from a building where three animal rights activists were found bound and gagged... \nEXT.  MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT) \nPistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles. \nAN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.) COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. \nINT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR \nCOLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat, spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out. \nEXT.  PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION \nAGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars. \nINT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR \nCOLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the shift into \"Drive\", then turns the key.  Nothing happens. \nPanic.  COLE studies the shift again. \nEXT.  PARKED CARS/MANSION \nAGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked. \nINT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR \nCOLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral).  He twists the key again.  The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM! \nEXT.  LAWN/MANSION \nAGENT #5 whirls at the sound. \nSMASH.  The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and accelerates right at him! \nAGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal. \nINT.  MOVING JAGUAR \nCaught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal. \nThe JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH... \nCOLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight.  Steering madly, he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway. \nEXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT \nLights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway. \nAGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life, its rotors whipping around. \nINT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT \nHe slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically. \nRAILLY I could have died in there.  If something had happened to you I would have died. \nCOLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood. \nCOLE I...I...I'm really sorry. \nNoticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him. \nRAILLY What have you done?  Did you...kill someone? \nCOLE (getting to his feet) No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree. \nRAILLY See -- you can drive after all! \nCOLE Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy! \nShe looks at him.  Breakthrough?  Very calm now, the doctor. \nRAILLY What made you think that? \nCOLE Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. (horrified) You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea? \nRAILLY Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face. \nCOLE I'm...\"mentally divergent\".  I would love to believe that. \nRAILLY It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you. \nCOLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING. \nCOLE I need help all right.  They're coming after me. \nRAILLY First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay? \nCOLE (brightening) It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground. \nRAILLY Give me the gun. \nCOLE The gun! ... I lost it \nRAILLY You're sure? \nCOLE (showing her) No gun! (looking up) Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe! \nRAILLY starts around to the front of the car. \nRAILLY I'm going to attract their attention, let them know where we are, okay? \nRAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn. \nRAILLY (calling out) They'll tell you to put your hands on top of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You're going to get better, James -- I know it! \nANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  An insect!  He reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass, stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  The HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky. \nANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars. \nANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face. \nCOLE I love this world! \nANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS from the woods.  The police are almost here.  She gets out of the car, starts around toward COLE. \nRAILLY Remember, I'm going to help you.  I'll stay with you.  I won't let them... \nShe breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned! \nCOLE is gone.  Disappeared. \nINT.  POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING \nRAILLY is being \"debriefed\" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS. \nRAILLY Then I said something to him about cooperating and he said he would do that, so I got in the car and started honking the horn.  When I got out, he was gone. \nLIEUTENANT HALPERIN You lucked out.  For a while we thought you were a body they found down state... mutilated. \nA COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it. \nRAILLY He wouldn't do something like that -- he... \nLIEUTENANT RALPERIN (interrupts, hands her the photo) This the man he attacked? \nRAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped against the alley wall, obviously dead. \nRAILLY I'd like to be clear about this.  That man and the other one were...\"severely\" beating us.  James Cole didn't start it.  In fact -- he saved me! \nLIEUTENANT RALPERIN Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist -- why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were? \nRAILLY (as if reciting) It's a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation. (suddenly animated) He's sick.  He thinks he comes from the future.  He's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate.  He needs help! \nINT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM \nYOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide. \nMICROBIOLOGIST Others will take over now... \nZOOLOGIST We'll be back on the surface in a matter of months.... \nGEOLOGIST We'll retake the planet. \nASTROPHYSICIST We're very close!  Because of you! \nENGINEER (unrolling a document) This is it, James...what you've been working for. \nBOTANIST A full pardon! \nMICROBIOLOGIST You'll be out of here in no time. \nASTROPHYSICIST Women will want to get to know you... \nCOLE I DON'T WANT YOUR \"WOMEN,\" YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL! \nUnseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before. \nASTROPHYSICIST (sympathetically) Of course you want to be well, James. And you will be...soon. \nCOLE bursts into hysterical laughter. \nCOLE YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS! YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE. MADE YOU UP!  YOU CAN'T TRICK ME! YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND YOU'RE MY INSANITY! \nINT.  PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone, \nRAILLY He not only used the word \"prank\" -- he said the boy was hiding in a barn. \nRAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen. \nDR. FLETCHER He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress. \nRAILLY For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die! \nDR. FLETCHER Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not. \nRAILLY And what we believe is what's accepted as \"truth\" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith. \nINT. \"HOSPITAL\" CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT \nAlone in his \"hospital\" room, COLE struggles without success to free himself from his restraints. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) You sure fucked up, Bob! \nStartled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and continues his feverish struggle. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) But I can understand you don't want your mistakes pointed out to you. I can relate to that, old Bob. \nCOLE looks around in spite of himself.  Nothing to see but the walls and the landscape paintings. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) Hey, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking I don't exist except in your head.  I can see that point of view.  But you could still talk to me, couldn't you? Carry on a decent conversation? \nCOLE (blurting) I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world! You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob? They don't like that.  That's a no-no. And when did you say you saw me? In...1872? \nCOLE FUCK YOU! \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) Yelling won't get you what you want.  You have to be smart to get what you want. \nCOLE Oh, yeah?  What do I want? \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) You don't know what you want?  Sure you do, Bob.  You know what you want. \nCOLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  Then... \nCOLE Tell me.  Tell me what I want. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to be topside -- breathe the air -- to be with her. ... Isn't that right?  Isn't that what you want? \nCompletely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  When he speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper. \nCOLE More...than...anything. \nINT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nRAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.  Her eyes snap open.  A beat to orient herself.  RING.  She reaches for the phone. \nINTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN'S OFFICE/RAILLY'S BEDROOM \nCLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone. \nLIEUTENANT HALPERIN Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D.. Sorry to call so early but... \nCLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone, \nRAILLY You found him?  Is he all right? \nCLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows giving an \"I told you so\" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop across his desk, then continuing into the phone, \nLIEUTENANT HALPERIN Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your good friend, the kidnapper.  However, the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic report on my desk that says the bullet you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's thigh is an antique...and all indications are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920. \nWith a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil, \nCOLE San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. \nBOTANIST Meaning...??? \nCOLE That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. \nBOTANIST And your only goal is...??? \nCOLE To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus. \nBOTANIST So that...??? \nCOLE Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth. \nCOLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects... \na magazine photo of wall graffiti:  \"ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!  IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE SOURCE?  3 BILLION DIE?\" \nBOTANIST (o.s.) This is from a magazine printed in late September, 1995.  The writer speculated that this graffiti might be related to the epidemic that by that time had already killed thirty million people world-wide and was getting worse.  He says, certain people, unnamed, were questioned, but what came of that is not known.  But it is a clue you should pursue. \nCOLE stares at the picture. \nEXT.  FAA STOREFRONT - DAY \nLOUD BANGING!  The storefront window, completely covered with posters, quivers violently.  Images of MONKEYS covered with electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  It's RAILLY. \nRAILLY IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU'RE IN THERE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. \nINT.  FAA STORE \nJEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters. \nFALE It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up. \nBEN What's she doing? \nFALE She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit! \nJEFFREY Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies. \nEXT.  FAA STOREFRONT \nFrom littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she, seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door. \nRAILLY I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! \nRASPY VOICE (o.s) Secret experiments! \nRAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict. \nLOUIE That's what they do -- secret weird stuff! \nRAILLY You!  I know you! \nBut LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now. \nLOUIE Not just on them.  Do 'em on people, too -- down at the shelters.  Feed 'em chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em. \nRAILLY Have you seen James Cole?  The man...? \nLOUIE They're watchin' you.  Takin' pictures. \nRAILLY follows his look. \nANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper. \nRAILLY The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to talk to James, but he has to be careful how he contacts me.  He mustn't get caught.  Do you understand me? \nLOUIS Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who's James? \nRAILLY He was with me, he spoke to you. Several weeks ago.  He said you were from the future...watching him. \nLOUIS gives her a look that says, \"I'm outta here!\" \nBut just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously \"tagging\" their way along the street with cans of spray paint. \nRAILLY stares at the PUNKS. \nINT.  FAA STORE \nFALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY, and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening between posters at the front window. \nJEFFREY You get the bolt cutters? \nKWESKIN One dozen.  They're in the van. \nFALE One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters? \nJEFFREY (grins) You really want to know? \nFALE No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything. \nBEN Hey!  Do you know what she's doing? \nFALE He's seriously crazy -- you know that. \nEXT.  SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY \nAn overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley. \nThe unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES COP'S eyes searching everywhere. \nTrash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter. \nHER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing, \nRAILLY James!  Come on. \nA confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster, bits of lettuce in his hair. \nCOLE I don't understand what we're doing. RAILLY (climbing out of the dumpster) We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you. \nCOLE (climbing out after her) You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them. \nBut she's not listening.  She's peeking out the alley entrance. \nRAILLY'S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel, THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY. \nINT.  GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER \nThe DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often, stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE. \nDESK CLERK Twenty five bucks an hour. \nRAILLY An hour?! \nDESK CLERK You want quarter hours, go someplace else. \nRAILLY (catches on, pulls out her last bills) Here's ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal? \nThe DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  Then, he turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her. \nDESK CLERK Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right. Elevator's busted. \nRAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color. \nANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb stairs.  As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone, punches a number, speaks into the phone. \nDESK CLERK Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe. You know if Wallace has a new girl? Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde? \nINT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY) \nCOLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY pace back and forth like a mad woman. \nRAILLY Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what? \nCOLE I thought I was in...prison again. \nRAILLY Just like that?  You were in prison? \nCOLE No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said. \nRAILLY You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods? \nCOLE I don't know -- I don't remember. \nRAILLY The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax? \nCOLE It was?  I didn't...know. \nRAILLY James, you said he was hiding in the barn... \nCOLE I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy... \nRAILLY IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL! \nCOLE looks at her.  She's really upset. \nCOLE Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV show and copied it.  Listen, you were right, it's all in my head.  I'm mentally ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know they're not real, I can trick them, make them do what I want.  I just worked on them in my head and I got back here.  I can get better.  I can stay here. \nRAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE. \nIt's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame, \nRAILLY What does this mean to you? \nCOLE ...I had a dream about...something like that. \nRAILLY You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there? \nCOLE You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything... \nRAILLY Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon. \nCOLE stands, moves close to her. \nCOLE I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown. \nCOLE (moving his head to see the film) I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things. \nRAILLY If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers. \nCOLE Flowers!  What flowers? \nFrom the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound. \nRAILLY (whispering) It's an expression.  Here... \nShe's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing it on COLE'S head, adjusting it... \nCOLE Why are we doing this? \nRAILLY So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry. \nThere are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE. \nCOLE But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy. \nRAILLY In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police. \nSHADOWY MOVIEGOER SHHHHHHH \nCOLE (whispers) Where can we hide for a few weeks? \nANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground, the OCEAN behind them. \nRAILLY You said you'd never seen the ocean... \nEXT.  GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision. \nURGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  Then, METAL ON METAL. Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen with phony rocks.  Stalking back and forth.  Huge.  Upset. \nCLANK.  CLANK.  METAL ON METAL.  GRUNTS of effort, then, DR. MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened. \nDR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.) What are you doing to me?  Where are we?  Jeffrey, please... \nSANDY'S VOICE (o.s.) For God's sake, put the tape back on his mouth! \nThe GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest. \nJEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Forget the tape.  The monkey's louder than he is.  You gonna tape the monkey's mouth? \nEXT.  PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT \nUnder the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS. \nEXT.  LION'S PEN/ZOO \nThe KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  From the darkness, unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response. \nEXT.  AVIARIES/ZOO \nA PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages. \nINT.  MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM \nCLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS continue.  Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie filling his field of vision. \nHIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. \nANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  Empty seats on both sides of him.  He's alone.  He panics. \nCOLE Kathryn?! \nINT.  THEATER LOBBY \nA lobby poster boasts \"Classics 24 Hours A Day\" and \"Hitchcock Festival\".  PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  Turning, she reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses. She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM!  Crossing the lobby toward the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate in the tight dress. \nJust then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  The BLONDE MAN stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE. \nBRUNETTE We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West. \nThe Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional, revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  The Blonde Man is COLE!  He's confused. \nCOLE You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you. \nRAILLY Well, you look pretty different, too. \nCOLE I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone. \nRAILLY (studies him seriously) I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you. \nTheir eyes lock.  Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them. \nINT.  STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER \nRAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  She kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other janitorial items.  COLE responds to her passion as they move deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters. Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats. \nEXT.  SUBURBS - DAWN \nThe red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood. The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than reality.  Did we really see him at all? \nINT.  TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY \nBUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room. \nSeeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it.  Coming to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change. \nINT.  TZCKET COUNTER/TERMINAL \nCLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter, hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN.  The GENTLEMAN walks away. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking nothing like the Railly on the flyer. \nRAILLY Judy Simmons.  I have reservations for Key West. \nINT.  PAY PHONES/TERMINAL \nCOLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense. \nCOLE Listen, I don't know whether you're there or not.  Maybe you just clean carpets.  If you do, you're lucky -- you're gonna live a long, happy life. But if you other guys exist and you're picking this up -- forget about the Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they didn't do it.  It was a mistake' Someone else did it.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids playing revolutionaries.  It was someone else! \nCOLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next phone looking away quickly.  COLE touches his loose moustache as he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper. \nCOLE I've done my job.  I did what you wanted. Good luck.  I'm not coming back! \nCOLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares. Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room. \nINT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY \nThe TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills. \nTICKET AGENT Don't see a lot of this... cash. \nRAILLY It's...a long story. \nTICKET AGENT (smiles, hands over the tickets) They'll begin boarding in about twenty minutes.  Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons. \nTurning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.  As she kneels to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from the waist down.  WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants. we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL! \nINT.  MEN'S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY \nThe P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves. \nQuickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly against his face as he leans close to the mirror. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) Got yourself a prob, Bob? \nCOLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE.  Nothing!  Until he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an occupied stall.  It must be him! \nCOLE Leave me alone!  I made a report.  I didn't have to do that. \nRASPY VOICE (o.s.) Point of fact -- you don't belong here. It's not permitted to let you stay. \nA toilet FLUSHES in the \"occupied\" stall.  COLE'S answer is loud and defiant. \nCOLE This is the present.  This is not the past. This is not the future.  This is right now! \nA PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the \"occupied\" stall, gives COLE a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink. \nCOLE I'm staying here! You got that?  You can't stop me! \nPLUMP MAN (high pitched voice) Anything you say, chief.  It's none of my business. \nCOLE looks dismayed.  This guy couldn't be \"THE VOICE\"!  And there are no feet showing under the other stalls.  Did he imagine it? \nINT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY \nThe Chicago Bulls bag!  It's on the counter in front of the TICKET AGENT who's reviewing a stack of tickets in awe... \nTICKET AGENT Woooo-eeee.  San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking! That's some trip you're taking, sir, All in one week! \nMR. PONYTAIL (o.s.) Business. \nTICKET AGENT (handing over the tickets) Have a good one, sir. \nINT.  TERMINAL LOBBY \nCOLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid.  He glances around nervously.  Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking toward the Gift Shop.  Before he gets more than a few steps, someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind. \nFAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.) You gotta be crazy, man! \nCOLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A. Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses \nCOLE Jo...Jose???? \nJOSE Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this. \nJOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol.  Astonished, COLE resists! \nCOLE What?  What for?  Are you crazy? \nFrustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm. \nJOSE Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow! \nCOLE How did you find me? \n", "test1_input": "COLE Come an.  We're running out of time. You can't help him. \nAs COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly. \nRAILLY Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him! \nCOLE I did him a favor.  Now come on. \nCOLE, pulling her again, sees more \"12 MONKEYS\" on the wall. \nRAILLY You didn't have a gun before, did you? \nCOLE I've got one now. \nEXT.  SECOND AVE - DAY \nThe EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him, points urgently at COLE. \nEVANGELIST You!  You!  You're one of us, aren't you? \nBut COLE has stopped and is staring at... \nA STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.  The sign over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION. \nINT.  FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY) \nEarnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired, and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  Behind them, a large poster proclaims, \"ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO\".  Just then, there's a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see COLE and RAILLY enter. \nCOLE looks startled.  It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in here.  Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour. \nBookshelves line two walls.  The front window is blanked cut with posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings, photos of animal atrocities.  The fourth wall features the counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR. \nFALE Uh, can we help you? \nCOLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets an urgent warning. \nFALE Excuse me.  You looking for something in particular? \nRAILLY It's all right, James -- it's just a tape. \nCOLE'S eyes follow her look.  It's a tape recorder underneath a sign advertising, \"THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD\". \nCOLE I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. \nFALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.  \"We have a problem!\" the look says. MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing. \nTEDDY We don't know anything about any \"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\", so why don't you and your friend disappear, okay? \nCOLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS. \nCOLE I just need some information... \nTEDDY Didn't you hear me?  We're not... \nTEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes. \nCOLE is pointing a pistol at them.  A TIGER SNARLS. \nRAILLY James, no -- don't hurt them. (to the activists) Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do whatever he tells you to do.  He's... upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he's dangerous -- just cooperate. \nMONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up. \nFALE What do you want -- money?  We only have a few bucks. \nCOLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  A BABOON HOWLS with laughter. \nCOLE I told you what I want. (snaps at Railly) Lock the door! \nRAILLY James, why don't we...? \nCOLE Lock it now! \nRAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE, \nBEN I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this. \nFALE Shut up! \nCOLE Mason??? \nRAILLY Jeffrey Mason? \nBEN Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason. \nINT.  FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY) \nThe three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  They're very frightened, eager to cooperate. \nFALE Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big star -- the media latch on to him because he's picketing his own father, a \"famous Nobel Prize winning virologist\". You musta seen all that on TV. \nCOLE No, I don't watch TV. \nCOLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while RAILLY watches helplessly.  Suddenly, COLE finds something he thinks he's seen before.  He holds it up. \nCOLE Is this him -- Dr. Mason? \n", "test1_true": "FALE That's him. \nBEN (very frightened) What are you going to do with us? \nCOLE (stares at the photo, then) Tell me more about Jeffrey. \nFALE (a helpless shrug to his cohorts) Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do...picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff.  He said we were, \"ineffectual liberal jerkoffs\".  He wanted to do guerrilla \"actions\" to \"educate\" the public. \nCOLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor. \nFALE Yeah, that's when he let a hundred snakes loose in the Senate. \nTEDDY But we weren't into that kind of stuff. It's counter productive, we told him. \nFALE So he and eleven others split off and became this underground...\"army\" \nCOLE The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. \nBEN They started planning a \"Human Hunt\". \nTEDDY They bought stun guns and nets and bear traps.  They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers... \nBEN But they didn't do it.  They didn't do any of it. \nTEDDY Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out! \nCOLE What's that mean? \nFALE He goes on TV, gives a news conference, tells the whole world he just realized his daddy's experiments are vital for humanity and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey Mason, from now on, is going to personally supervise the labs to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer. \nCOLE (holding up a rolodex) What's this? \nEXT.  FREEWAY - AFTERNOON \nIn the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with bumper stickers and painted slogans.  \"I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS\"... \"FREE THE ANIMALS\"...\"WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?\" \nRAILLY (v.o.) You can't just barge in on a famous scientist.  They'll have security guards, gates, alarm systems.  It's insane, James. \nINT.  MOVING FORD/FREEWAY \nA ROLODEX CARD with an address on \"Outerbridge Road\" for \"Jeffrey Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason\" rests on a map spread across COLE'S lap.  COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel, maneuvering in heavy traffic. \nRAILLY If those young men don't get loose, they could die in that basement. \nCOLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS. \nCOLE All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more? \nRAILLY (a beat, carefully, a new tack) You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago. \nCOLE is studying the map again. \nCOLE The guy was a total fruitcake. \nRAILLY And he told you then his father was a famous virologist. \nCOLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing \"Outerbridge Road\". \nCOLE No -- he said his father was \"God\"! \nEXT./INT.  FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY) \nThe RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open highway.  COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well.  As the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.  An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE intones over the RADIO... \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.) This just in:  police are widening their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly, prominent psychiatrist and author. Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has been abducted by escaped mental patient, James Cole. The two are believed to be traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura, license plate H-E-A-D-D-R. \nRAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain.  She feels so badly for him.  She wants to help him.  She says, tenderly... \nRAILLY This can't go on, James.  You're not well.  You're burning with fever. \nCOLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge. \nCOLE We need gas. \nRAILLY I thought you didn't know how to drive. \nCOLE I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid. \nRAILLY What's the matter with your leg? \nCOLE I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead. \nRAILLY Shot!  Who shot you? \nCOLE It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here. \nINT.  PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON) \nThe GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY remain in the car.  She's pulling a gas card from her wallet. \nCOLE You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you? \nRAILLY No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you. \nCOLE (sees the credit card) That has your name on it.  Give him cash. \n", "test1_id": 219, "test2_input": "INT.  GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY \nThe PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  The UNIFORMED OFFICERS are backing him up, weapons drawn. \nPLAINCLOTHES COP POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND COME OUTTA THERE! \nNo response. \nINT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 \nThe PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol extended in both hands.  He pans the gun around the empty room. \nHIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor. \nWALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom) HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I'M AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST! \nEXT.  BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON \nA city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the toney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She's hidden her bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody handkerchief to his mouth. \nAs he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling city, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up. \nCOLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building with a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!! \nANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed entrance to a store. \nRAILLY Wait here.  I'm going to try that phone number.  Let's hope it's nothing! \nDazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES looming frighteningly close. \nA BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display window.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away \nRecovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY. \nCOLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into the phone. \nANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him, eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient. \nRAILLY James!  James!  It's okay.  We're insane!  We're crazy! \nCOLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look. \nRAILLY It's a Carpet Cleaning Company... \nCOLE A Carpet Cleaning Company? \nRAILLY (laughing) No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned. \nCOLE You... you left them a message? RAILLY (impishly) I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... \nLooking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!  He starts to recite... \nCOLE \"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys -- they're the ones who are going to do it.  I can't do anything more.  The police are watching me.\" \nNow she's stunned.  She glances back and sees the phone booth twenty yards away. \nRAILLY You... you couldn't have heard me. \nCOLE They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice. \nRAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning. \nANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic. Noticing something, he reaches for his radio. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him into the CROWD. \nRAILLY Come on. \nINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM \nRAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK. \nRAILLY And this. (turning) Anything else? \nBut COLE'S not here.  He's a short distance away...staring. \nCOLE'S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of brand new consumer goods. \nANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and full of moldering merchandise. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK. \nRAILLY I guess that's it. \nCLERK Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am? \nRAILLY (producing Wallace's roll of bills) No -- I'll pay cash. \nThe CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills! \nRAILLY What floor are the wigs on, please? \nEXT.  PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT \nSurrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway. \n", "test2_true": "The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among them, all wearing black.  Some of them have climbing gear, tool belts, all sorts of paraphernalia.  KWESKIN is telling his story. \nKWESKIN So then he goes into this incredible riff about how his shrink, like, replicated his brain while he was in the nut house. Turned it into a computer. \nWELLER And Fale believed it? \nKWESKIN Oh, you know Fale!  He's like, \"If you guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will -- I never saw you before in nay life!\" \nLAUGHTER from all of them.  Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic series of RAPS on the side door, a signal. \nPOPE quickly slides the door open.  It's JEFFREY...grinning. \nThree other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG. \nThe van occupants react with murmurs of \"Awwwwwright\" and \"Far out\", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van. \nThen, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too. \nJEFFREY Let's do it! \nEXT.  VAN/FREEWAY \nThe PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway. \nINT.  PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING \nThe GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a flashlight and goes over \"the plan\" with the other ACTIVISTS. \nJEFFREY Okay, that's Stage One.  In Stage Two, Monkey Four is over here... \nA loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others. \nGOINES What's the harm in opening the bag? His eyes are taped. \nSANDY Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that. \nJEFFREY Ah, but cruelty is his specialty. \nICHIOKA So why should we be like him? \nShrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth. \nJEFFREY Want the full effect? \nGrinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth. \nDR. MASON Jeffrey?  I know it's you, Jeffrey.  I recognize your voice. \nJEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone. \nDR. MASON JEFFREY???  ... Very well.  You're out of your mind, Jeffrey.  I know all about your insane plan.  That woman -- your psychiatrist -- she told me. \nJEFFREY raises his eyebrows.  This he hadn't expected. \nDR. MASON I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy even for you.  But, just in case, I took steps to make sure you couldn't do it.  I took myself out of the loop!  I don't have the code any more.  I don't have access to the virus.  So, go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract anything of use to yourself. \nThe ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks. \nJEFFREY What...virus? \nDR. MASON (spins his head toward Jeffrey) She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this. \nJEFFREY What virus are we talking about, Dad? \nDR. MASON You're insane, Jeffrey. \nJEFFREY You \"develop\" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. (to the others) Have I ever \"developed\" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy! \nDR. MASON Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid. \nJEFFREY THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC? \nINT.  MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT \nSpooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward. It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods.  SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE (KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a redwood tree.  We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO. \nSCOTTY (up on the screen) Here's a cross section of one of the old trees that's been cut down. \nThey look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say, \"BIRTH OF CHRIST\", \"DISCOVERY OF AMERICA\", \"MAGNA CARTA SIGNED\", \"1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS\", and \"1930 TREE CUT DOWN\". \nANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there. \nANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy. \nMADELINE (up on the screen) Somewhere in here I was born.  And here -- I die.  There's only a moment for you.  You don't notice. \nANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the theater.  WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES \nRAILLY Here, let me help you. \nThe theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie. \nCOLE I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV. \nRAILLY (fussing with his upper lip) Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still. \n", "test2_id": 220, "test3_input": "DR. PETERS Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples. I have the appropriate papers. \nINT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT \nRAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security. \nRAILLY Oh, God, we don't have time for this. \nANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of clothes and a Walkman. \nDR. PETERS Biological samples.  I have the paperwork right here. \nDR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands. \nSECURITY OFFICER I'm going to have to ask you to open this, sir. \nDR. PETERS Open it? (blinks stupidly, then) Of course. \nDR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it. \nThere's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE. \nSECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. \nANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the commotion. \nANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed glass tube out of the metal cylinder. \nDR. PETERS Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the papers -- it's all proper.  I have a permit. \nSECURITY OFFICER It's empty! \nIndeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it. \nDR. PETERS Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty! But I assure you, it's not. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. \nRAILLY Please listen to me -- this is very urgent! \nSECOND SECURITY OFFICER You'll have to get in line, ma'am. \nTRAVELER We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so special about you? \nANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers. \nDR. PETERS You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye. \nA beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes, and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose! \nDR. PETERS It doesn't even have an odor. \nThe SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing, and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist. \nSECURITY OFFICER That's not necessary, sir.  Here you go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have a good flight. \nHastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and shoves them back into his gym bag. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her with his finger. \nSECOND SECURITY OFFICER Who are you calling a \"moron\"? \nCOLE Get your hands off her! \nThe SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble. \nANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns. \nFIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE'S moustache is slipping.  COLE senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look. For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away. \nANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away. \nSECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.} HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT. \nDR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen. \nThe SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS. \nDR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants. \nANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he confronts the SECURITY OFFICER. \nCOLE I said, get your hands off her.  She's not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a psychiatrist. \nRAILLY looks alarmed at that. \nANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE has the photos in his hand. \nANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates. \nANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS! \nRAILLY THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS!  STOP HIM! \nANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE MAN FROM HIS DREAM! \n", "test3_true": "RAILLY (o.s.) PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM! \nANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE. \nFIRST DETECTIVE (raising his badge) Police Officers.  Would you step over here, please. \nANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES! \nCOLE'S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a \"businessman\"!  He gives COLE a cold look. \nA beat.  COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it. \nThe ALARM goes off!!!! \nThe FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks him aside like a rag doll. \nANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back. \nANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol. \nANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. \nFIRST SECURITY OFFICER HE'S GOT A GUN! \nANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE. \nFIRST DETECTIVE STOP OR I'LL SHOOT! ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover. \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see. \nIT'S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!!  THE SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH \"NEW\" MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS hurries by.  DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling... \nDR. PETERS WATCH IT! \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching... \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear shot in the crowded passageway. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings, high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS... \nBRUNETTE (RAILLY) N0OOOOO0O!!!!!! \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  CRACK! \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling. \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him. \nMOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.) My God!  They shot that man! \nMesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears. (WE'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE'S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT, UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.) \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN. \nFATHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Come along, son, this is no place for us. \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder, steering him.  YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging helplessly.  It's too late.  The BLONDE MAN is dead. \nYOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears, suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for something.  POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her. Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse. \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS (whose faces remain out of view).  He can't help sneaking another look back. \nYOUNG COLE'S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting RAILLY.  Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically. \nSuddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she's found what she's looking for! \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look. \nANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded concourse. \nANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look. \nFATHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Hurry up, son. \nWith a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  WE MOVE IN...CLOSE... CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS, BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING, BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER! \nMOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.) Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy. \nINT.  747 CABIN - DAY \nDR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  Next to him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says... \nFELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.) It's obscene, all the violence, all the lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now. You might say...we're the next endangered species...human beings! \nCLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor. \nDR. PETERS I think you're right. sir.  I think you've hit the nail on the head. \n", "test3_id": 221}

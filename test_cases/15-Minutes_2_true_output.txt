DAPHNE Shhhh. 
She leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes, trying to find a smile. 
EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY 
It's weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired, frazzled.  She's trying to go through her stand up.  But she's unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie. 
NICOLETTE ...and today with his partner who he blamed for the crimes still at large, Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News has also learned that later this month, Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing in court.  He will be arraigned on charges of violating the civil rights of...Zwangen...Zwagen... 
MIKE Zwangendaba. 
NICOLETTE Goddamn assholes everywhere. Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. I'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again. 
She starts over. 
INT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jordy's on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with his dog, ZACK.  Jordy's eyes are glazed.  He's drunk, his eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or Daphne. His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger seeps through her broadcast. 
NICOLETTE (ON T.V.) Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct descendent of the African King from whom he takes his name... 
Jordy's face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy picks up. 
JORDY Hello? (listens) No comment. 
He hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN. 
JORDY (CONT'D) Hello? (listens) No! 
Jordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert Hawkins' face fills the screen.  He is standing across from someone - in a park - interviewing him. 
HAWKINS (ON T.V.) He robbed you? 
The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a suit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the tree.  He's appearing on "Top Story". 
ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.) That's right, I encountered him right here.  I was just askin' for change an' he whips out his big gun an' pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin' me there all exposed... 
The phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off the table and throws it through the window: 
BACK TO TV 
as the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him is a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. The reporter stands in front of the jail. 
REPORTER ...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak won't have to worry about how he is going to pay for his defense.  He has received movie offers and been in conversations with numerous publishers concerning the rights to his life story. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Oleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy. 
INT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING 
Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see the TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He stares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head. 
EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY 
Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to Rykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster and sticks it in his pocket. 
CLOSE ON METER 
to $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror. 
TAXI DRIVER I can't believe this guy got off. Unbelievable. 
Jordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he crams it into the slot. 
JORDY Whatever's leftover, keep. 
Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on. 
HIGH WIDE SHOT 
Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. All are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE: 
HAWKINS 
and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and frazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she looks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch - anxious - looks at his cameraman. 
HAWKINS He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he comes through the crowd.  Do you hear me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.

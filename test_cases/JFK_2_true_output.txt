They look at each other. 
JIM Bear in mind, each of you, this may affect the rest of your careers, your lives... (pause) ...if any of you pull out, I assure you I will bear no ill feelings towards that person and will reassign you to regular duties. 
No takers. 
JIM There it is then.  Thank you.  It means very much to me.  I'm giving this office $6,000 from my National Guard savings so we can continue.  I will make speeches where I can to pick up additional money.  Some local businessmen are putting together a fund for us and... 
SHARON (coming in) Mr. Garrison, what shall I tell them? They're piling up outside the door. They want a statement, the phones are going crazier than bugs on a cake. 
Everyone waits.  Jim stands, repacks his briefcase with papers and reference books and heads for the back door elevator. 
JIM Neither confirm, deny, nor discuss, Sharon.  Goodbye, ladies, gentlemen, I'm going home where I can get a decent day's work done. 
LOU IVON'S APARMTENT - NEW ORLEANS -(1967) 
Lou drinks a beer in front of the TV news in his small bachelor apartment.  A fan is blowing. 
NEWSMAN 11 (editorial) Mr. Garrison's own silence on the subject has raised some interesting questions.  With taxpayer money has he uncovered some valuable new evidence or is he merely saving the information which will gain for him exposure on a national level?  Mr. Garrison it seems, should have some explanation. 
The phone rings and Ivon picks it up. 
LOU Yeah? 
DAVE FERRIE (V.O.) (very agitated) Did your office plant that garbage in the fucking paper? 
LOU Who is this? 
FERRIE (V.O.) You know damn well who it is. 
LOU Dave? 
FERRIE (V.O.) Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it? 
LOU Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that? 
We see Ferrie in a phone booth on the street outside his apartment house in the French Quarter.  He's a nervous wreck, watching the reporters and TV cameras surrounding his place, waiting for him. 
FERRIE (yelling) Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me? 
LOU Calm down, Dave, what? 
FERRIE I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man. 
LOU What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions. 
FERRIE You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people. 
LOU What did they... 
FERRIE You still questioning any Cubans? 
LOU Dave, you know that's where this road leads. 
FERRIE It leads farther than that. 
LOU Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name. 
FERRIE (unsure) The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes? 
LOU (hopeful) Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you... (there's a long silence as Ferrie, torn, agonizes) Dave? 
FERRIE (dreamy) ...give me protection? 
LOU Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind. 
FERRIE I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes. 
Ferrie hangs up.  Pause.  At his end, Lou Ivon hangs up, excited. 
GARRISON'S HOME - NIGHT(1967) 
The phone rings.  Liz picks it up.  Jim is watching the TV news:  Martin Luther King is delivering a speech against the Vietnam War. 
KING (on TV) President Kennedy said on one occasion, "Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind."  I pray God that America will hear this before it's too late, because today we're fighting a war I'm convinced is one of the most unjust wars that has ever been fought in the history of the world. 
LIZ (on the phone meanwhile, testy) No, he's not here now.  And he would not take calls here if he were!  So please call the office number.  Thank you. (hangs up) Two of them even had the gall to come to the door this afternoon, one all the way from England. 
JIM Did they live? 
LIZ It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared. 
JIM Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing. 
The phone rings again. 
KING (on TV) ...sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they have not found in Southwest Georgia or East Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same school. 
LIZ I haven't, Jim. 
JIM Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it. 
LIZ Leave us ALONE for God's sake! (recognizes the voice) ...Oh, it's Lou. 
FONTAINBLEAU HOTEL SUITE - THAT NIGHT 
Jim and Lou watch as Ferrie paces wildly, speeding.

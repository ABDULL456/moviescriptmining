SUMMER I can't believe you. 
TOM What? 
SUMMER You were so completely uncool in there. 
TOM You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you. 
SUMMER Oh that was for me? You were, what, protecting me? Next time Tommy, don't. I fight my own battles. 
TOM Come on, that guy was an asshole! 
SUMMER You didn't have to hit him. Why didn't you just let me handle it? 
TOM I don't know. He was -- 
SUMMER See. This is why I don't want a serious relationship. 
TOM Whoa. What was that? 
SUMMER Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I like this. What we've been doing. But maybe it's gone too... 
TOM What...? 
SUMMER I told you all along what I don't want and it's... 
Tom waits for more. It doesn't come. 
SUMMER I'm tired. Can we talk about this tomorrow? 
It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think. Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways. 
TOM (calling to her) I just got my ass kicked! 
Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this. 
TOM (to Onlookers) I got one good shot in. 
INT. OFFICE - LATER 
Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose. Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops short. 
TOM (GENUINE) Hi. 
SUMMER (COLD) Hi. 
TOM What's up? 
SUMMER Nothing. 
TOM Ok. 
Nothing else is said. 
TOM Wait, are you still mad at me? 
SUMMER (rolling her eyes) Tom... 
TOM Holy shit you are. I can't believe you! 
SUMMER (re: copies) Are you almost done? 
TOM Yeah. I'm all done. 
He starts to walk out. 
TOM You know what... Sometimes you really don't make any sense. 
Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she looks back at him, he's gone. 
LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk. She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there. 
LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle but he's already gone. 
SPLITSCREEN - INT. BOTH APARTMENTS - THAT NIGHT 
Left: Tom tosses and turns in his sleep. 
Right: Summer lies awake, staring at the ceiling. 
Left: Tom picks up the phone. Is about to dial when he stops himself and hangs up.

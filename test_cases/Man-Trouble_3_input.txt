123A   CONTINUED:                                                        123A A frantic free-for-all takes place on the precarious footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately pulling at one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence of their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline. Harry, quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car. 
Harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into the car. He pushes him against the door and they begin battering each other with a series of punches. 
The SHEPHERD, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps about them, BARKING joyously. Then finding Eddy's sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it vigorously. 
Joan, her hair fretted   with twigs, climbs up over the edge of the hill. In    the b.g. behind her, a HELICOPTER APPROACHES. She looks    toward Harry and Eddy trading blows, then climbs up   the rest of the way, and as she gets to her feet, she   picks up a stone and throws it at them, yelling: 
JOAN You bastards!! The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above: VOICE (from above) What are you people doing down there? 
Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations, starts to move toward Joan: 
HARRY Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running around with a guy like this!! 
She raises her arm, ready to hurl the last stone: 
JOAN You maniacs!!    You liars!!   You shits!! (CONTINUED) 
123A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             123A HARRY What are you yelling at me for?! This son of a bitch is probably the Westside Slasher! 
124    INT. HELICOPTER - VIEW OUT WINDOW - NIGHT                     124 
of the circling HELICOPTER: A man, holding onto a life- less body, seems to be stalking toward a woman in a defensive stance, standing on the edge of the hill with a stone in her hand. MAN It looks like a domestic quarrel. Let's get a car up here quick. 
BACK TO HARRY AND JOAN She is yelling at him: JOAN I'm finished wagging my tail and leaving little puddles on the floor...!! HARRY Wait a minute, honey... JOAN And smiling on command, because I don't give a damn whether any of you like me or not!!! VOICE (from above) Are you alright, ma'am? HARRY (yelling up at the copter) Yeah, she's alright!! I've got him!! (gesturing at Eddy) The Westside Slasher, I got him!! 
JOAN He's not the Westside Slasher!! 
VOICE                            JOAN (from above)                 He's a friend of mine!! Just stand where you are, buddy. 
(CONTINUED) 
124   CONTINUED:                                                       124 HARRY A friend of yours! This guy's a friend of yours?! JOAN None of you are friends of mine, you fucker!! 
VOICE (from above) Ma'am, is this guy bothering you? 
They both yell up into the blinding light of the search beam: 
JOAN                                HARRY Will you shut up!!                  I'm not bothering her, godammit, I love her!! Harry lets go of Eddy and leans down to pick up the knife, gesturing it at the helicopter: HARRY Look, you assholes! The guy was holding a knife at her throat!! VOICE (from above) Okay, put the knife down, fellow. Then to Joan again, taking a step toward her: HARRY What were you doing, kissing this guy!? 
JOAN I wasn't kissing him!! VOICE (from above) Stand where you are, and put down the knife. 
ON JOAN Perceiving the danger to Harry: 
JOAN Put the knife down, Harry! (CONTINUED) 
MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                               128.

VOICE (CONT'D) (from above) We've got a bead on you, so just put it down. Terrified that they are going to shoot him, she moves over to Harry: VOICE (CONT'D) (from above) Stay where you are, don't go near him. HARRY (to the copter) I just saved her life, you son of bitches!! JOAN Give me that thing. She grabs the knife out of his hand, throws it away, then places her arms around him, desperately pantomiming to the helicopter: JOAN See? He's not hurting me! He's my friend!! (then, to Harry) This is just for their benefit. VOICE (from above) Don't touch her, buddy. HARRY But that's what I am, honey, your friend, that's what I wanted to tell you, and then I saw you with this guy... 
VOICE (from above) Don't worry, lady, we've got a car on the way.

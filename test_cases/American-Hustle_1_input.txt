SYDNEY PROSSER Just rest. 
She gets in and closes the door. 
185   INT. IRVING'S CADILLAC - DAY                                   185 
They both slump down on the seat, stare at each other, emotional, humbled. Sydney gently removes Irving's broken glasses. They stare at each other, it is quiet. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (emotional, quiet) Are you ready? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes. 
They stare at each other. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) (whispers) I love you. 
She squeezes his hand, raises it to her lips and kisses it. 
206   INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY                                      206 
TILT UP FROM THE FLOOR OF THE OFFICE TO RICHIE, AMADO, AND STODDARD INTENSELY STARING AT THE DOOR FOR A CONFRONTATION, LIKE IN A WESTERN. THE DOOR OPENS AS IRVING AND SYDNEY ENTER AND STARE BACK AT THEM. 
ANTHONY AMADO Please. Come in. Sit down. 
They all sit. 
ANTHONY AMADO (CONT'D) Do you know where our two million dollars is? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Two million? (Irving pushes his new glasses up the bridge of his nose) It's with Victor Tellegio and Alfonse Simone. 
ANTHONY AMADO No, actually it's not with Victor Tellegio or Alfonse Simone. 
Richie stands by the window, stares angrily at Irving. 
RICHIE DIMASO He fucking knows about it. 
ANTHONY AMADO It's gone missing. Did you know that? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Where's it gone? 
ANTHONY AMADO That's interesting that you said that because while you were on your way over here, we got an anonymous phone call from someone who said that in exchange for immunity for the two of you and a reduced sentence for Carmine Polito we get our two million dollars back. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's interesting. That's very interesting. I have no idea. 
ANTHONY AMADO No idea? 
IRVING ROSENFELD No idea what you're talking about. 
Irving looks at Sydney who looks back at him and shakes her head. She doesn't know either. 
ANTHONY AMADO I got it. I understand how these deals are made. See, someone has leverage. 
RICHIE DIMASO Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We got them for wire fraud, it's over. (to Irving and Sydney) You're done. You're both done. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I don't think so. 
RICHIE DIMASO Oh, you don't think so? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Richard, think about it, YOU requested the two million. And you gave Brenda the account number. We didn't do any of that. None of it. (turns dramatically to face Richie) How do we know that YOU don't have the money? 
RICHIE DIMASO (Richie looks from Irving to Sydney) Am I living in a fucking nightmare right now? 
AMADO AND STODDARD STARE INCRIMINATINGLY AT RICHIE. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I find this a little offensive. Really, I find this a little offensive and I don't see that you got any sort of solid case against-- 
RICHIE DIMASO (to Amado and Stoddard) Don't let him get in your heads. Listen to me, we're dealing with a very clever individual. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Richard, think about it. You got some big arrests. You got U.S. Congressmen. You look good. You're gonna be all over the news. You know what doesn't look good? A story about gross incompetence 
205                                                    SMASH TO:    205 
FLASHBACK -- RICHIE KICKS OPEN THE DOOR OF LAWYER ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE WITH A WARRANT IN HIS HAND AND TWO AGENTS BEHIND HIM. 
RICHIE DIMASO I have a warrant for -- 
Richie looks around disoriented, we cannot see what he sees yet. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I'm sorry, do I have the wrong office?(checks number on the door) Is this 701? Alfonse Simone? 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) This is 701. 
-- WE REVEAL THE VOICE BELONGS TO A BLACK ATTORNEY -- TWO BLACK CLIENTS ACROSS FROM HIM -- SEATED AT WHAT PREVIOUSLY APPEARED TO BE THE DESK OF LAWYER ALFONSE SIMONE. 
BLACK DIVORCE LAWYER My name is Roger Thigpen. I've had this office for 25 years. I'm a divorce attorney. 
RICHIE IS STUNNED. 
INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT 
SYDNEY PROSSER You lost two million dollars of taxpayer money because you were confused about the location and the identity of Victor Tellegio's attorney?

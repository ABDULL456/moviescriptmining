{"test1_input": "CLOSE - MEDALLION round the corpse's neck.   The Locksley crest. ROBIN Noooooo! A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture. Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained, Aslan looks on. ROBIN I should have been here. Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff ... Duncan. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ROBIN (shaking him) Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down? DUNCAN Master Robin, is it you? A miracle. I thought God had abandoned us. ROBIN You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows. \nASLAN Easy... Look at him. Duncan steps into the moonlight.    His face crudely- scarred. ROBIN What has happened? DUNCAN They say they captured him worshipping with the Druids. He signed a confession before the Bishop of Hereford. ROBIN Did they have witnesses? DUNCAN Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall. The Bishop decreed all the Locksley lands forfeit. ROBIN Did you believe the charges? DUNCAN Not even when they took my eyes. ROBIN Who did this to you, Duncan? DUNCAN Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff looking on. Robin holds the old retainer to his chest.    Stares into the night in silent rage. \nEXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT Marked contrast.   A forbidding fortress.   Cliff-like battlements. \nINT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving, stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak door. SENTRY Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to be disturbed. GISBORNE Away, fool. He shoves the Sentry aside. \nEXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis- tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she covers up. NOTTINGHAM Who bade you cover up? He smashes his fist into his chair.   She timidly uncovers. NOTTINGHAM Cousin, I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value. His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black- ness. GISBORNE I met a hooded man today. He bade me warn you not to harm his people. NOTTINGHAM His name? GISBORNE Robin of Locksley. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Ha! The prodigal son returns. He is a whelp. This girl could best him. GISBORNE This whelp bested five of my men in the blink of an eye. NOTTINGHAM Your men were probably drunk.   Yet you survived, cousin? Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW, wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible agility. MORTIANNA. GISBORNE (stunned) You brought her here? NOTTINGHAM Quiet! The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes. Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter. The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con- tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone dice -- Runes. She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every move. A connoisseur. NOTTINGHAM What do you see? MORTIANNA Change the seat of power. NOTTINGHAM London? MORTIANNA Change it. NOTTINGHAM Move the capitol to Nottingham? Excellent. How? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MORTIANNA Ally with royal blood. NOTTINGHAM Put someone on the throne and rule through him? Who? MORTIANNA That is not revealed. The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind.      Mounting intensity. NOTTINGHAM Ally with royal blood. What else do you see? MORTIANNA Armies. NOTTINGHAM Whose? MORTIANNA Yours. Men and weaponry in great numgers. NOTTINGHAM And victory? MORTIANNA Much blood will be spilled. NOTTINGHAM Whose? \nCLOSE SHOT A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol. Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands again. Again the grinning skull. \n", "test1_true": "CONTINUED: GISBORNE (freaked) No one. I have seen no one. MORTIANNA You lie!     A man... A painted man. NOTTINGHAM What is wrong? MORTIANNA I have seen my death. She whimpers.   Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders. \nMORTIANNA The painted man. He haunts my dreams. GISBORNE Locksley has a companion. A dark- skinned foreigner. He had the marked skin of Islam. Mortianna trembles like an epileptic.    Eyes wide with terror. MORTIANNA Kill them!     Kill them! She throws herself at Nottingham for protection.    He caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck. NOTTINGHAM Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your survival was his last mistake. \nMORTIANNA (frantic) And the painted man! Kill him. NOTTINGHAM Kill them both. He continues to stroke her.    Her trembling subsides. NOTTINGHAM You have done well, Mortianna. Exceedingly well. No one shall harm you, I swear it. Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the girl's hand. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams. NOTTINGHAM Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's. (to Mortianna) Take her. You have earned her. Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.   Drags her away. GISBORNE It is madness bringing the hag here. \nNOTTINGHAM Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in madness, there is great power. \nEXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - DAWN Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees. Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave. Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side. ROBIN Our last words in this world were spoken in anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to force other men to our religion. He was right. (looks to Aslan, then back to the grave) Please forgive me, Father. DUNCAN He loved you till the end, young master. He never gave up hope of your return. ROBIN I failed him. I should have been here at his side. DUNCAN You must leave, head north to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge. ROBIN Leave me. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DUNCAN I know what you're thinking. But one man can achieve nothing against so many. You would need an army. ROBIN Leave me. ASLAN Come, friend. He leads the old man away. CUT TO: \nGRAVE SIDE - LATER Pouring rain. Robin stands drenched at the grave side. Aslan watches from the shelter of trees. Duncan heats a stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire. DUNCAN He still stands vigil? ASLAN Like a rock. Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen. DUNCAN A curse on the Saracens! Were it not for their ungodly ways, he would never have left. This would never have happened. \nASLAN It surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long. DUNCAN I do not recognize the style of your voice, friend. Are you Irish? A Cornishman? ASLAN Er... no. DUNCAN What manner of name is Aslan then? ASLAN A fine Saracen name. (CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 2997, "test2_input": "INT. WOODSMAN'S HUT - NIGHT The walls shake with Little John's laughter. LITTLE JOHN Sure changed the color of 'is britches, didn't 'e? ROBIN Thanks to our cannibal friend. Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of venison. LITTLE JOHN Gonna laugh my bloody balls off. BULL Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold north o' the border? ROBIN To hire mercenaries. The Celts are savage tribesmen, trained to kill from birth. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LITTLE JOHN Aye, the Romans built a bleedin' great wall to keep 'em out. BULL What does 'e want wi 'em? ROBIN Since he also has every Smith in the country working in his castle, we can assume he is planning a little war. LITTLE JOHN Agin' who? \nASLAN England. \nINT. CASTLE ARMORY - NIGHT Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon factory. His eyes glint with the reflections of the smithy's fires. A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white- hot. GISBORNE We were ambushed. In Sherwood Forest. Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil. \nNOTTINGHAM Spanish steel, cousin. So much stronger than our native blades. Any losses? GISBORNE All the men are gone. NOTTINGHAM Yet again you are the sole survivor, cousin? Interesting. And the gold? GISBORNE Well, it er... disappeared. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time. NOTTINGHAM Robin Hood? GISBORNE They were woodsmen, dressed in green. NOTTINGHAM Robin Hood. He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder. NOTTINGHAM Cousin, we must be strong. We cannot allow this outlaw to make fools of us. Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's belly. NOTTINGHAM And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me. (turning to the horrified smithy) It is indeed fine steel. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed. Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager. FRIAR God bless you, sir. VILLAGER An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar. They says as 'ow none o' the Sheriff's cronies dare go within miles o' Sherwood for fear o' havin' their pockets pinched. FRIAR Ah, the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away. OLD WOMAN Unless Robin Hood takes it first! (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Laughter. The procession passes two of the Sheriff's mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his jug in greeting. FRIAR Good morrow, brothers. \nEXT. FOREST POOL - DAY Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS. He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye. Marian jumps down. MARIAN (to Robin) How dare you! ROBIN Good morning, Lady Marian. In response, she starts pelting him with stones. MARIAN You send men to drag me from my home in the middle of the night, like some slave girl? Is this the way the famous Robin Hood treats a lady? ROBIN Ah well... er, let me finish this bath you wished me to take. Then I'll explain. MARIAN I demand an explanation right now! ROBIN If you will be patient, I could spare your propriety by... MARIAN I will decide when my propriety is compromised. ROBIN As you wish. (CONTINUED) \n", "test2_true": "EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at his shot. LITTLE JOHN (to Wulf) Right m'lad. Let's see how close you can git to that bugger. Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over. LITTLE JOHN Take a gander at this 'un, mates. Never seen nuthin' like it in my bloomin' life. \nRobin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac- ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses, camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not about to admit it. MARIAN This better be damned important. Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap- tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws back the lid. Marian is speechless. ROBIN Nottingham robs the poor. We rob Nottingham and give back to the poor. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARIAN Do you think he's going to let you get away with all this? The man is without mercy. He will annihilate you. ROBIN Somebody has to take a stand. MARIAN You're taking a stand with the lives of these people. These young ones. A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's. Is there a hint of concern for him also? MARIAN What do you want from me? ROBIN Nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King Richard. MARIAN Nottingham would not dare challenge the King. ROBIN The King is not in England to be challenged, is he? While he is away, he may lose his country. (Marian masks her concern) You are Richard's cousin. You can get word to him. He would believe you. MARIAN Now you want me to participate in your folly? A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering. CUT TO: \nBOUQUET protrudes from Marian's saddle. She is mounted, ready to go. Sarah giggles as she takes her leave of Bull. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ROBIN (to Marian) I am sending Duncan with you. Give him some warm food and a real bed. I grow tired of his bellyaching. DUNCAN Hah! I have endured more hardship in my lifetime than any man here. Robin laughs and speaks to Marian in a stage whisper. ROBIN Don't tell him I told you, but he may be useful to you. There is no one to whom I would rather entrust your safety. MARIAN Duncan, you are most welcome. Taking the lead rein from Duncan's horse, she rides away. ROBIN (calls after her) Will you send word to the King? MARIAN I'll think about it. \nINT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY A globule of red liquid.    A signet ring.   Marian seals a letter. \nINT. BISHOP'S CASTLE - DAY The letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the Bishop of Hereford. A lavish office. MARIAN It is a personal matter, my Lord, but one of vital importance. BISHOP I understand, my dear lady. This is my most trusted emissary. He hands the letter to a solemn courier. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARIAN You will travel to France immediately. You must give this directly into the hands of the King, and him alone. The courier bows in acknowledgement.    Marian indicates Sarah. MARIAN My lady-in-waiting will accompany you. Surprised, the courier glances at the Bishop. \nBISHOP My dear, I could not vouch for her safety. The journey is fraught with danger. MARIAN I appreciate your concern, my Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished rider. I must insist that she goes along. BISHOP (a beat) As you wish. \n", "test2_id": 2998, "test3_input": "CONTINUED: He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into blackness. \nINT. CAVE - DAY Robin's eyes  -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark smoke-filled  recesses of the caves. The walls weave. Eerie WATERY  sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men. He tries to  stand. VOICE (O.S.) Robin!... Robin! \nA figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name. Reaches out his hand. MARIAN Death is not to be feared, Robin. Embrace it. Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover- ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers. MARIAN Drink this. Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup.   Her hand grips his chin, forcing his mouth open. MARIAN Drink. \nThe liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus. Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic. MARIAN Look at me. Listen to me. You belong to me. Your soul is mine. You will obey my every word. Do you understand? Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his subconscious sounding alarms. ROBIN Why, Marian? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARIAN Because you love me. Say it. You love me. (as Robin struggles) Say it! ROBIN (sinking) I love you. MARIAN Kiss me. He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of Mortianna. He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision, we see he is surrounded by masked men. ROBIN (slurred) Where is Marian? MORTIANNA She is with friends. (cackles) Your resistence is strong, but useless. Sign this. (as quill is forced into his hand) You are a Druid like your father. You consort with the devil. Your confession will be witnessed by the Bishop of Hereford. A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be- tween his shoulders. In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan. MORTIANNA (horror) The painted man! Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A    curved scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in   the other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked    guards are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats,    scurry- ing into the depths of the cave. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy. A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark- ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his feet... and lunges. ASLAN Behind you! Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks. Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's. Robin is slumped against a rock. ROBIN (groggy) Marian? Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words. BULL Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian burial. Promise me, boy. WULF I promise. Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be- low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock. For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom, hatred, fear -- then is gone. \nEXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering, glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks the light from his eyes. ASLAN They have poisoned you. There are herbs that can alter a man's brain. I know of only one cure. He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers down his throat. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ASLAN It worked for me this very morning. (as Robin heaves) You will thank me for this later. \nEXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up in front of him. ROBIN You have fulfilled your vow.   Now you can leave. ASLAN Your gratitude warms my heart. ROBIN You ignored my request. ASLAN It is fortunate that I did. ROBIN Because of you, another good man is dead. ASLAN He urged me to bring him. He was a brave man and I grieve for him. Praise be to Allah that I do not grieve for you also. Or for my broken vow. ROBIN To hell with your damn vow. ASLAN I am glad you are feeling better. Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the sky. ROBIN The forest!   Ride! \n", "test3_true": "EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing. Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion. Little John vainly attempts to instill calm. LITTLE JOHN Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke ain't gonna kill ya. Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees. Full retreat. WILL SCARLET (running up) It's burning for miles, John. It's hotter than hades, and them damn screens ain't worth nothing. Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able- bodied men to his side. LITTLE JOHN 'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must make a stand. Most of them keep on running. LITTLE JOHN Damn y'all! Ya're no more use than a load o' wet farts. WILL SCARLET Where's that damn Locksley?   I'll swear he betrayed us. LITTLE JOHN Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody bellyachin'. Hal runs to join them, stuttering. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: HAL C... cccc... LITTLE JOHN C... ccc? What the bloody hell ya sayin'? Cows?... Cowards?... HAL Cccc... elts! WILL SCARLET Celts?   Where? HAL (pointing behind him) Gggg... God help us. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight. Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head- pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up to the Chieftain. NOTTINGHAM I want prisoners. The Chieftain does not turn his head. CHIEFTAIN We came to fight. NOTTINGHAM Nevertheless, I need prisoners. With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits. Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol- diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword. Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors. They charge forward. \nEXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the edge of the clearing. WILL SCARLET What are we gonna do, John? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LITTLE JOHN Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight 'em, that's what. Whadya say, lads? Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including Tack. LITTLE JOHN Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin' wi' the wenches. FRIAR This holy man believes in doing God's work with his hands. \nHe snatches a quarterstaff.    John slaps him on the back. The men are encouraged. LITTLE JOHN Let's give 'em a bloody good wallopin' an' all, lads. \nEXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em- battled woodsmen. ROBIN Wulf, stay here. I need your horse. He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins. \nROBIN What are you doing?    Out of my way! ASLAN I saved your life. I will not let you give it away for no purpose. ROBIN Out of my way, damn you! ASLAN Does the witch still have possession of your senses? If we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help. And do some damage to the enemy. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Robin debates.   Relents.   They urge their horses into a gallop. \n", "test3_id": 2999}

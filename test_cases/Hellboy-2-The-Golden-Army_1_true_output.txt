ABE I find these leather outfits very 
UNCOMFORTABLE- 
MANNING Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip. 
(BEAT) When it comes to dealing with reporters or the public, I set the tone. You all know the old saying: the perception is the reality. 
HELLBOY Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we can ditch the garbage truck, right? 
ABE Wait, Red, the lab's in it- 
HELLBOY Screw the lab. I want new wheels. 
MANNING 
(SMIRKING) You got 'em- The round a corner and enter - 
113 INT. BPRD GARAGE - DAY 113 
Three gleaming Hummers await them. 
HELLBOY 2 76 
MANNING A gift from General Motors. One for each of you. Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an underwater vista. 
HELLBOY This is more like it! 
LIZ I'm not driving that- Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer. 
ABE This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The sheer waste of precious fossil fuels... 
MANNING An American custom, it's called product placement! What's the harm? 
CUT TO: 
-- DAY 114 
114 EXT. NEW YORK STREET 
A mob of SCREAMING FANS outside the TV studio. The frenzy intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up. As the BPRD team exits the cars, autograph seekers break through the POLICE LINE and swarm around the heroes. 
MANNING Every agent on the field is on the case. They will solve it-- Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish. 
HELLBOY There you go, pal. "To Jason, best wishes, Hellboy." 
FAN (squints at the signature) How am I supposed to read that? 
BELLBOY You don't like it? 
HELLBOY 2 77 Irritated, he scowls at the fan. Manning takes him by the elbow and leads him away. 
HELLBOY (to the fan) That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find you, "Jason"... 
115 INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER 
A row of makeup chairs. Manning sits in the first one, looking at himself in the mirror. 
MANNING Can you do anything about this... uh... (lowers his voice) -double chin? 
MAKEUP GIRL No, you're not being made up. 
MANNING Why not?

24   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    24 
Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a bit more thrown together). 
All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so. 
FROM BACKSTAGE 
A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old. But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the character of "Puck". 
"OBERON" (O.S.) ...and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest. Trip away; make no stay; meet me all by break of day. 
And the characters of "Oberon" and "Titania" exit.     Boy Oxford hurries-- 
ON STAGE 
"PUCK" If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended, that you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear... 
Next to Young Elizabeth, JOHN DE VERE, Oxford's father, also watches, his face beaming with pride. 
"PUCK" (CONT'D) ...And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, gentles, do not reprehend; if you pardon, we will mend. 
A STERN LOOKING MAN 
is watching a few seats   away from Young Elizabeth.   He is WILLIAM CECIL (40's,   Robert's father). He is a Puritan, dressed all in   black (with a white lace collar), and has a long   beard. He is frowning, loathing the play.

ON STAGE 
"PUCK" (CONT'D) So, good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends. 
The play now over, Young Elizabeth applauds with delight, as do the small group of courtiers all around her. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Lovely.    Lovely!

25   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - KITCHEN - LATER                        25 
A make-shift "back-stage" where all the young "actors" are removing their costumes and make-up, including Boy Oxford, who sits in front of a make-shift, leaning mirror. 
Much excited talking and commotion, until Boy Oxford notices everyone has gone silent. He turns-- his winged costume still on-- just as-- 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.) Ah!    There he is. 
Young Elizabeth and her senior Court, including William Cecil and John De Vere, have entered. 
Boy Oxford bows deeply. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (to Boy Oxford) Your father tells me you wrote this evening's play yourself. 
Boy Oxford glances at his father-- should he answer directly? His father NODS. 
BOY OXFORD I did indeed, your majesty. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH You sport with me. (smiling) Compose something. 
BOY OXFORD Now? 
pg. 28 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Yes.   Now. 
BOY OXFORD On what subject, your grace? 
She thinks.   Then-- 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (smiles) Truth... 
BOY OXFORD (thinks, then--) For... Truth... is Truth... Though... never so old... and time cannot make that false, which once was true. 
She smiles, claps. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (to John de Vere) My lord of Oxford. It seems you have added a poet to your family's long line of warriors. 
BOY OXFORD Madam, I am as accomplished with the sword and the musket as I am with verse. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (amused) Are you indeed? 
BOY OXFORD (nods seriously) It is my only desire to one day be your majesty's most trusted servant in matters both of war and state, if you will but have me. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (charmed) Why, Lord Cecil, it seems we may very well have found your replacement. 
WILLIAM CECIL We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope not too soon. 
pg. 29 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (teasing) And how liked you our young lord's play, William? 
William Cecil stiffens in discomfort. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (to Boy Oxford, conspiratorially) Our Lord Cecil is our most religious of subjects, and no doubt thinks your little masque will deliver your soul straight into the arms of Lucifer himself. Don't you, William? 
The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil, perplexed by such a thing. 
WILLIAM CECIL That is God's decision, your majesty. Not mine. 
William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting in an uncomfortable silence. 
Elizabeth notices. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Well, if plays are indeed such a sin, I pray I do not find my salvation until very late in life. 
Boy Oxford smiles.   He might very well be in love.

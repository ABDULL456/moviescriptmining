Marc and Rebecca are at a table with Nicki and Sam who are dressed in skimpy outfits and lots of lip gloss. 
Nicki, re-applies lip gloss, as Sam sends a text. 
The music is loud and they shout to speak to each other. 
(Note: There is constant texting and photo taking through out.) 
Marc is feeling in his element, this is where he should be.

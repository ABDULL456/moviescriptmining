James watches Renata and Catherine talking animatedly at the other end of his office. He can't hear what they are saying, but Renata is showing Catherine layouts of ads involving images of private planes flying in formation. They touch each other from time to time without seeming to notice it, but James notices it. 
EXT. VARIOUS LARGE CITY ROADS -- DAY 
James and Catherine set off for home in their own separate cars. At times, they are within sight of each other and James watches her microscopically, as though he didn't know her, as though, perhaps, she isn't human. 
At one point he sees her with her hands resting on the steering wheel, her right index finger picking at an old adhesive label on the windshield. 
And then, abruptly, James is aware of the dented fender of Vaughan's Lincoln only a few feet behind Catherine's sports car. 
Vaughan now surges past James, crowding along the roadway as if waiting for Catherine to make a mistake. Startled, Catherine takes refuge in front of an airline bus in the nearside lane. Vaughan drives alongside the bus, using his horn and lights to force the driver back, and again cuts in behind Catherine. 
James moves ahead along the center lane, shouting to Vaughan as he passes him, but Vaughan is signalling to Catherine, pumping his headlights at her rear fender. 
Without thinking, Catherine pulls into the courtyard of a filling station, forcing Vaughan into a heavy U-turn. Tires screaming, he swings around the ornamental flower-bed with its glazed pottery plants, but James blocks his way with his own car. 
Heart racing, Catherine sits still in her car among the fuel pumps, her eyes flashing at Vaughan. 
James steps from his car and walks across to Vaughan, who watches James approach as if he had never seen him before, scarred mouth working on a piece of gum as he gazes at the aircrafts taking off from the airport. 
JAMES Vaughan, what the hell are you doing? Are you trying to create your own Famous Crash? 
Vaughan hooks his gear lever into reverse. 
VAUGHAN It excited her, Ballard. Your wife, Catherine. She enjoyed it. Ask her. 
Vaughan reverses his car in a wide circle, almost running down a passing pump attendant, and sets off across the early afternoon traffic. 
INT. BALLARD APT. -- NIGHT 
James and Catherine lie naked in bed, she with her back to him, buttocks pressed into his groin. He is inside her. 
CATHERINE He must have fucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen... 
JAMES It does.

DRIVER Don't worry... 
She hesitates, torn, then looks up at him again, needing to confide in someone. 
IRENE Every time he makes that speech about taking me and Benicio away from here he's in some kind of trouble... 
Driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates. 
79 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 79 
Driver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car. 
80 INT. CAR/ UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 80 
Driver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He stares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick, finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual. 
81 EXT. PAWN SHOP/ TARAZANA/ LA - DAY. 81 
The pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside, another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling. Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense. 
DRIVER You don't have to do this. 
STANDARD (Forcing a smile) What are you talking about? 
He tries to make light of it but doesn't sound convincing. Out of his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the pawn shop and looks even more nervous now. 
STANDARD Irene and Benicio think the world of you, you know that, right?... 
Driver glances at him, sensing his anxiety. 
STANDARD Say something happens to me, you think you could find a way to take care of them?... 
Standard's still staring ahead, but Driver can sense his fear. 
(CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: 81 
DRIVER It's not too late... 
Standard considers a moment, then shakes his head. 
STANDARD I gotta do this for them... 
He forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens the door. 
DRIVER You got five minutes... 
STANDARD (GRINNING) I'll see you in four... 
Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away. 
He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of overlooking buildings. 
The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop windows, hiding everything inside. 
The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting. 
He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something. Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out. For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers and racing tires. 
Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment. 
But there's no sign of them. 
The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene. 
Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop, Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand. 
(CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: (2) 81 
He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on his face as he spins around. 
A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The force of the bullets sends Standard flying.

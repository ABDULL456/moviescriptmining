Seymour doesn't answer. He looks away. 
SEYMOUR Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? (pause) She could at least have the decency to call me back. 
JOE Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure. 
Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space. 
JOE Maybe she's got another boyfriend. 
SEYMOUR (bummed out, wants Joe to stop) Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up. 
JOE (deadpan) No problem. 
Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion for him. 
JOE Look at it this way - at least things can't get any worse. 
Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record. 
INT. COOK'S CHICKEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY. 
Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with many doors on both sides. A door opens and a Tony Robbins- ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out. 
EXECUTIVE Seymour! Just the man I want to see. Step in here for a minute. 
Seymour enters. 
EXECUTIVE Have a seat. 
He plunks down the current issue of THE FREE WEEKLY - it's open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh Brother!" and a photo of THE PAINTING being removed. 
EXECUTIVE What can you tell me about this, Seymour? 
INT. ENID & REBECCA'S NEW APT. 
Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment. 
REBECCA So, whaddya think? 
ENID It's fine. 
REBECCA So where's all your stuff? 
Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc. 
ENID There. 
REBECCA That's all you're bringing? 
ENID I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime. 
REBECCA What time? 
ENID I dunno... 
REBECCA Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else! 
She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen. 
REBECCA Isn't this the greatest? 
INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING 
Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange fabric. 
INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY 
Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff. 
She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer. 
REBECCA (as she opens the door) What's wrong with you, retard - it's three-thirty! 
It's Seymour standing there, not Enid. 
SEYMOUR Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here? 
REBECCA She's not at home? 
SEYMOUR No... they said she was here... 
REBECCA What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago! 
SEYMOUR Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.

14	SMALL SQUARE. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 1956. 
It is raining. The water runs along the gulleys of the narrow alleys. The white houses have turned spongy gray. The children of the Casbah are playing and spattering mud. Skinny and half-naked children with bloated bellies and hair cropped because of sores. 
Their mothers call them in vain. They continue to run, play, and wallow in the mud with a despairing gaiety. 
CALLS. VOICES. SHOUTS. 
Petit Omar was then ten years old. He is slender, dressed in long pants and a jacket which is too large for him and torn so that he seems almost clownish. Calm and absorbed, he passes in the midst of the other children, but doesn't notice them or their games. 
A small square on a sloping ascent. 
In the center, a fountain. On the elevated side of the square, on a corner, there is a mosque. 
SOUNDS OF CHURCH MUSIC. 
Standing still at the foot of the steps is an Algerian in white cloak, and hood down to his eyes. Other people pass by. The Algerian is turned to one side so as not to be seen. Petit Omar walks toward him and nears his back. The Algerian turns; it is Ali la Pointe. He tells the boy with a tone of boredom and curtness: 
ALI Go away! 
PETIT OMAR Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ... 
Ali looks at him incredulously and asks: 
ALI And they sent you! 
The child slips a hand under his sweater to his chest. 
PETIT OMAR Sure, something wrong with that? 
Omar takes out a piece of paper folded in four, and hands it to Ali. 
PETIT OMAR Take it. Everything's written here. 
He turns away and begins to run. 
ALI Wait! 
Omar stops running and turns to Ali. 
ALI Come here ... Come. 
Omar retraces his footsteps. Ali goes to meet him. 
ALI (in a brusque manner) Can you read? 
PETIT OMAR Sure ... 
Ali hands back the paper. 
ALI Read it. 
PETIT OMAR Here? 
Ali turns and looks around him. He squats on his heels in order to reach Omar's height. 
ALI Here. 
It is still drizzling. Omar unfolds the paper and begins to read it. 
15 	RUE RANDOM. CAFE MEDJEBRI. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 
The following day at 5 p.m., rue Random. The street is fairly wide for a street in the Arab quarter and at this hour it is crowded with people. There are Algerians in traditional costumes and others in European clothes. Noisy and tumultuous background ... 
VOICES, SOUNDS, WORDS -- ALL MIXED TOGETHER. 
Veiled women with intent glances. Silent women who seem to float through the crowds, untouchable. 
An Arab cafe filled with customers at the tables and bar. Through the large shop window, a smoky, steamy interior is visible. The cafe is located in rue Random, number 40. 
OMAR (off) There is an Arab cafe at rue Random 40. The owner's name is Medjebri. He is a police informer ... 
Medjebri is standing behind the cash register, smiling, very busy. He is wearing a traditional costume. He is very clearly visible through the shop window above the heads of the customers. 
In a doorway near the cafe there is a clock hanging from a signboard in front of a store. It is five o'clock. A French policeman enters the cafe. 
OMAR (off) Every day at 5 p.m., a French policeman goes to see him. He stops for a few minutes to get information with the excuse of drinking a cup of tea. You have to kill the policeman ... 
ALI (off) Not Medjebri?

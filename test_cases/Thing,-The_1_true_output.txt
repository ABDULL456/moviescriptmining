INT. REC ROOM 
The interrogation continues. 
CLARK ...Would I even have told you they were gone if I had anything to hide? 
GARRY But why didn't you kennel that dog right away? 
CLARK I told you I couldn't find... (pushes torch away) ...get that out of my face. 
Childs grabs him by the collar and rips him off his chair. 
CHILDS Don't you be telling me... 
Nauls steps between them. 
NAULS (to Childs) Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around here! 
CHILDS Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them. 
Garry breaks it up, pulling them apart. MacReady enters from the outside. A bundle is tucked under his arm. 
GARRY Hold on, damn it. We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody. 
DR. COPPER And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody. 
MacReady moves over to the table. 
DR. COPPER Theoretically any of us could be whatever the hell this thing is. 
Norris shakes his head, rubbing his chest in slight discomfort. 
NORRIS It's just too damn wild -- I can't believe it. 
MacReady pushes his sombrero back over his head. 
MACREADY Well, you can believe it now. 
He drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between the men. It is the shredded pair of long johns. 
MACREADY Nauls found this yesterday. It's ripped just like the clothing on the Norwegian we brought back. The same thing was happening to Bennings' clothes when it got to him. Seems these Things don't imitate clothes. Just flesh and bone. 
The men look from one another. Silence. MacReady picks it up and examines the label. 
MACREADY Size large. (grins) What do you wear, Clark? 
Clark stews. 
CLARK So what? 
NORRIS I wear a size large, too. 
MACREADY So do I. So do most of us. 
The uneasiness in the room grows. 
MACREADY Doubt if it got to more than one or two of us. But it got to someone. (beat) Somebody in this room ain't what he appears to be. 
A pause as all eyes travel from man to man. 
SANCHEZ (scared) Well, what we going to do? 
Norris turns to Dr. Copper and Fuchs. 
NORRIS Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what? 
DR. COPPER A serum test possibly. 
FUCHS Right. Why not? 
GARRY What's that? 
DR. COPPER It's a simple blood typing test. This Thing's blood chemistry is different than ours. Basically we mix someone's blood with uncontaminated human blood. If we don't get the proper serum reaction -- then that person isn't human. 
CHILDS Whose uncontaminated blood we going to use? 
DR. COPPER We've got blood plasma in storage. 
GARRY How long will it take you to prepare this? 
DR. COPPER A couple of hours. 
GARRY Well, get to it. 
Garry unhinges a key from his belt and hands it to Dr. Copper. Dr. Copper and Fuchs head for the infirmary. 
PALMER How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time. 
MACREADY Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight. 
PALMER And that was enough?

160   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         160 Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW. A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones which he regularly scatters on the floor. 
TV MAN (V.O.) This is good, Tony, the stones are talking to me already... now here's something... travel... movement... Tony, are you planning a move... travel... anything? TONY (V.O.) Yes I am... I've been thinking about a move to California... 
TV MAN (V.O.) The big one, eh, Tony? These stones are really talking here... what are you planning for yourself in California? TONY (V.O.) I'm hoping for an acting career, Mel... TV MAN (V.O.) Tony, these stones really like what you're planning... there is no doubt in my mind about that... now listen... you have to be specific... these stones really want to tell you something, be it love, money or the purpose of your life... but I want a specific question from you... think about it... what do you want to know... love... or your income level next year? Be as specific as you can, Tony... 
Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He stands up and leaves the room. 
161   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         161 Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright. (CONTINUED) 
161   CONTINUED:                                                      161 Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep. 
BETSY Get me the books... all the books... all of the books... no, no, no... not the pancakes... not the pancakes... no... She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully. 
BETSY ... not the pancakes... 
Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened, fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door. TV WOMAN (V.O.) ... find your true cosmic partner first time around... every weekday morning at three here on the Psychic Network... Lucinda's Horoscope Dating Show... remember there is an answer, and there is a special partner out there for you... Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas. THOMAS ... don't let the oil run out... yes you did... watch the oil... why... why? Hector closes the bedroom door.     He is one spooked, moved human being. 
162   INT. HOUSE - MORNING                                          162 
In the morning, they are making breakfast in the kitchen. The kids are having juice and cereal. Hector is scrambling some eggs. 
HECTOR How about some eggs? They shake their heads. 
(CONTINUED) 
162   CONTINUED:                                                 162 HECTOR You don't eat eggs? 
BETSY How many have you got in there? 
HECTOR Three.   Is that all right? BETSY For a week, maybe. 
Hector does a little probing. HECTOR How about pancakes, Betsy... d'you like pancakes? BETSY Not much... why? HECTOR I just wondered. Pancakes don't mean much to you? BETSY They don't mean a thing.     Why? HECTOR Nothing. The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in infinity. Hector changes the subject. 
HECTOR I thought we could walk into town this morning. I saw the Funfair when we came through last night. THOMAS We don't go to Funfairs. 
HECTOR Let's take the walk anyway. 
THOMAS I brought some books.   I want to stay home and read. Hector is determined to make it work. 
HECTOR No.   We're taking a walk. 
163   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                         163 They are preparing to leave the house.   Thomas is still reluctant to go. 
THOMAS It's going to rain... we should stay. 
HECTOR Here's an umbrella... and there must be some old coats in here... and shoes... I only have these I'm wearing... THOMAS Donald has some shoes... 
Thomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs.   He emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes. HECTOR I don't know if I want to wear Donald's shoes. THOMAS Why not? Hector declines to explain the complex   reasons that he might have for not wanting to wear the   shoes of his children's replacement father. He sits    down on the            * stairs to put them on. Then something    on the wall catches his eye. HECTOR Wow.   Look at this. The kids' heights have been marked on the wall on some long-ago holiday. The dates are beside them. 
HECTOR Six years ago. Look at that... What's this? 
He points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall. THOMAS That was the flood. The sea came right up. Donald says it's the icecap melting. It's going to get worse. That's why Mom's selling the place.

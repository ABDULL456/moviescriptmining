They're saying everything to each other in this moment, but their expressions don't change and they don't say a word. MUSIC plays on the RADIO. 
EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
A semi-gas tanker is up ahead on the road.  It looks like the one they saw earlier.  It's got the same mud flaps... 
INT.  CAR - NIGHT 
LOUISE Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here. 
THELMA Just ignore him. 
Louise passes him and, as she does, he HONKS.  They look up and he is wildly pointing to his lap. 
LOUISE Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy. 
THELMA We should have just ignored him. 
EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN (OVER MUSIC) 
The car is flying down the road. 
INT.  CAR - DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN 
They are quiet for a moment, then Thelma starts quietly laughing to herself.  She is trying to stop but cannot. 
LOUISE What? 
THELMA (shaking with laughter) Nothing.  It's not funny. 
LOUISE What?  What's not funny, Thelma! 
Thelma is trying to compose herself but cannot. 
THELMA Okay, but... (she can barely speak) I can't say. 
Thelma isn't making a sound.  She is stuck in a convulsion of laughter. 
LOUISE What?! 
THELMA (gasping for air) Harlan. 
LOUISE What?!  What about him?! 
THELMA Just the look on his face when you... (she is falling apart again) ...it's not funny. 
LOUISE (shocked) Now, Thelma, that is not... 
Thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself. 
THELMA Boy, he wasn't expectin' that! 
LOUISE (scolding) Thelma! 
THELMA (impersonating Harlan) Suck my dick... Boom!! 
Thelma is laughing wildly. 
LOUISE (quietly) Thelma.  It's not funny. 
Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying. 
THELMA (trying to catch her breath) I know! 
They both get quiet. 
Thelma leans back just watching Louise.  She studies her as if she's never really seen her before.  All of a sudden a look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face. 
She jerks upright and startles Louise. 
THELMA (carefully) It happened to you... didn't it? 
Louise knows what she is talking about.  She becomes immediately agitated. 
LOUISE I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even... 
THELMA ...in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God. 
Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee. 
LOUISE (fighting hysteria) I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it! 
THELMA (gently) Okay, Louise... It's okay. 
Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems completely serene. 
EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN 
The car is SCREAMING down the road.  They drive through a little stand of buildings.

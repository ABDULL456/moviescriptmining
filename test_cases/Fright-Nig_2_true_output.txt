JANE Think about what you're saying-- 
CHARLIE I have. I've "processed," believe me. Jane takes this in. Then SMILES. 
JANE Ooooh. This is the gag! For Amy. I can't believe you got Jerry to go along with it! Charlie stops. Fuck. 
EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT 
CLOSE ON JERRY As he starts to DIG UNDERGROUND -- amazingly strong and swift. 
INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Charlie hands Amy and Jane both CROSSES on CHAINS. 
CHARLIE Take these. Put them on. Just do it. 
JANE 
(HUMORING HIM) Okaaaay. Vampire protection! 
AMY I don't think this is funny. But she puts it on. 
EXT. BREWSTER BACKYARD -- NIGHT 
Jerry pulls up the NATURAL GAS LINE that leads to the BREWSTER'S HOUSE. He SAWS IT OPEN AND LIGHTS THE END ON 
FIRE. 
INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM/VARIOUS -- NIGH 
Hisssssssssss. A strange sounds coming from under the floor. 
AMY 
WHAT'S THA-- BOOM!! The GAS FIREPLACE EXPLODES, the STOVE EXPLODES, THE WATER HEATER ALL EXPLODE at once!! WINDOWS BLOW OUT as Charlie JUMPS on Jane and Amy, dragging them to the ground. The room starts to BURN. Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic. They try to put the fire out, but it's no use. Charlie stops. A CHILLING SIGHT: Jerry stands on the other side of the blown-out windows. His expression dark. Through the flames he says-- 
JERRY Don't need an invitation if there's no house. A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the house. 
INT/EXT. BREWSTER GARAGE/STREET - NIGHT 
y, Charlie and Jane race into the garage 
AMY I can drive-- 
JANE I drive! They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener-- 
CHARLIE Gun it Mom! Go!!! Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it. She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk as she takes off. Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!! They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK. 
ON JERRY As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on. Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck. 
INT. JANE'S CAR -- NIGHT 
JANE What did we do!? What does he want!? They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head off. 
AMY 
HOLY-- Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning wildly in the back seat. 
CHARLIE Amy! Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it YANKS part of her hair out. Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear windshield. 
JANE He's coming!

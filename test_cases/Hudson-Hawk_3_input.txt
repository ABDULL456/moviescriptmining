HAWK Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit. 
SNICKERS Too bad. 
Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the silencer time bombs suctions to his head. 
Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of the stairs, holding the strange rifle. 
Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They start to trot off... 
MINERVA I knew it!  I told you it was a fake. 
DARWIN That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million? 
MINERVA Million five, lover... 
HAWK 
boots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb. 
Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch. 
SNICKERS Help me you Democratic Reform lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver! Oh God, I always wanted to know how to play the harp, there just was so little time!  Rosebud! 
The soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears. Nothing happens. 
SNICKERS Maybe it was just a.... 
Snickers blows up gloriously before the M. 
THE STAIRCASE 
Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps. 
ALEX Get 'em.  They went down the hallway. 
HAWK Let's just forget it, I mean... 
ALEX Get em.... 
Hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "What can I do?" glance to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and moves forward. 
THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY 
Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall- way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness. 
THE BALLROOM 
Minera sits down next to the pained Alex. 
MINERVA Alex.  How's it going? 
ALEX Go, go to Hell, to Hell. 
Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open. 
MINERVA Where's your insulin....No?  Well, Bon Appetite. 
Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the candy bar in his mouth. 
THE HALLWAY 
Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk kicks him off... 
HAWK Oh, come on.... 
THE BALLROOM 
Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering. 
MINERVA Very good, Alex, but you re still alive.... 
She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last burst of strength, punches her across the face.

HECTOR ...I say to her, Margarita, we already have four kids, why do we need more? 
Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he eyes the door... HECTOR (CONTD) But she say she want an even number. I say four is an even number! But she say she want six. 
Jack checks his watch... 
HECTOR (CONTD) I tell her, Margarita, I just got my green card, I like to sit back and rest a little bit... 
JACK (interrupting) Hector...do I usually listen to your personal problems? 
HECTOR Sure, Jack, all the time... 
Jack nods, then... 
JACK Look, I have some business that I have to take care of in the city so Im leaving early... (getting up) My advice to you...follow your dreams. 
CUT TO: 
96	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON 
Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls... 
He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads inside... 
96A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes crazy... 
97	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER 
Jack and Lassiter walk together... 
LASSITER ...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see... 
JACK But youre not interested in boutique dollars... (a smile) I get it... 
They walk into... 
98	INT. ALAN MINTZS OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Past the assistants desk... 
MINTZS ASSISTANT (seeing Lassiter) Hes expecting you, Mr. Lassiter... 
Lassiter doesnt even slow down... 
99	INT. ALAN MINTZS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, immediately struck by the difference... 
LASSITER (to Mintz) Alan, this is Jack Campbell...the one I was telling you about... 
Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the desk and goes to shake Jacks hand. 
ALAN Jack, of course. 
They shake hands. 
JACK (appropriately deferential) Mr. Mintz. 
ALAN Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here... 
JACK (re: play pen) I can see that, Alan. 
A chuckle from Mintz. 
ALAN You have kids, Jack? 
JACK (hesitating, then...) Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones. 
Another laugh from Mintz. 
ALAN Thats great... (gesturing to the sofa) Why dont you have a seat? 
Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and Lassiter take the chairs. 
ALAN (CONTD) So, Peter mentioned that you were an avid CNBC watcher but didnt say whether you had any actual Wall Street experience? 
Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not realizing he was walking into an interview... 
He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable. 
JACK I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton. 
ALAN A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business? 
JACK Thats right. And auto supply... 
ALAN Uh huh. The retail end, I understand. 
Jack nods... 
JACK Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service. 
ALAN Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark... 
JACK We did one point seven million in total revenue... 
ALAN Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year? 
Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing questions, the smirk on Mintzs face... 
ALAN (CONTD) Any thoughts at all on that? 
As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent of his handicap... 
ALAN (CONTD) Jack? 
He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter then ...a confident smile. 
JACK Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.

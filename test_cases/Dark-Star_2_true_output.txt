INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM 
The Control Room is EMPTY.  After a moment, there is a repetitive BEEP. 
CLOSE SHOT - TV SCREEN.  On the screen is the message: 
INCOMING COMMUNICATION 
This fades, and MISSION CONTROLLER appears on the screen, against a background of computer terminals.  He is dressed in a snappy tunic, and when he receives the on-camera cue, he smiles ingratiatingly. 
MISSION CONTROLLER Hi, guys.  Glad to get your message. We gather from the ten-year communications lag that you are approximately 18 parsecs away.  Drop us a line more often, won't you?

EVELYN The man on the barge. The one with the hook, he was looking for a key. 
Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back. 
JONATHAN Hey that's mine! 
Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles. 
And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running. 
INT. LABYRINTH - DAY 
The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head. 
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open. 
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves... 
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire. 
EVELYN What do you suppose killed him? 
JONATHAN Did you ever see him eat? 
O'Connell comes up over some rocks. 
O'CONNELL Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed. 
EVELYN How? 
O'CONNELL Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap. 
JONATHAN Maybe this place really is cursed. 
A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp. 
The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous look. Evelyn laughs. 
EVELYN You two! 
O'CONNELL You don't believe in curses, huh? 
EVELYN No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe. 
O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin. 
O'CONNELL I believe in being prepared. 
Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, -- Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump. 
O'CONNELL/EVELYN WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?! 
Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off. 
JONATHAN Seagrams! 
Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it. 
JONATHAN Well, he may have been a stinky fellow,... but he had good taste. 
Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp. 
O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn. 
O'CONNELL Stay here! 
He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her. 
JONATHAN Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man just say -- ! 
EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT 
The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY. 
O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there. 
O'CONNELL Goin' somewhere? 
BENI Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend! 
O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp. 
O'CONNELL C'mon, friend.

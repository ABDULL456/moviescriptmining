Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including the Two Five Year Olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the first mine with an explosion and flies into the air -- 
INT. TRUCK DRIVEN BY TROY 
Flying debris smashes the windshield. Troy instinctively jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides across the sand. 
EXT. MINEFIELD 
The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces. 
Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee. 
SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air, squeaking. 
Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has opened and the gold bars are spilled around. 
Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the dense brown fog descends around them. 
Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down. 
Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts. Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses. 
Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands, blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face. 
DOC Cover your face, Conrad. Cover your mouth, man. 
Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth. Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck. 
He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field SCREAMING. 
TROY Hey. Stop. 
Troy stands watching as the children run farther away, crying. 
TROY Goddamn it. 
He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away, the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs. 
Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand. 
ARCHIE GATES Don't do it, this isn't sarin. We'd be dead by now. 
DOC Is it mustard? 
ARCHIE GATES It's C.S. 
DOC What's that? 
ARCHIE GATES Tear gas times ten, but it's not lethal. Where's Barlow? 
DOC I don't know. 
EXT. DESERT - MINEFIELD 
Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in his left arm and covers her face with her coat. 
TROY'S POV 
as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he lands on his back with the two children in his arms. 
TROY'S POV LOOKING UP 
the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep. 
EXT. DESERT - NEAR ARCHIE AND DOC 
ARCHIE GATES Does anybody see Barlow? 
Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a Vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses. 
DOC I can't even see the truck. 
About five Shiites wander around, confused. 
VIG Look out. 
Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol. 
TWO BLACK ROBED FIGURES pick up Vuitton hat cases. 
ARCHIE GATES Don't move. 
A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side. 
More black cloaked figures appear. There are THIRTY IN ALL. 
Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away. 
VIG What's going on? 
The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 FOOT HIGH TUNNEL ENTRANCE in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it. 
Vig stands and rubs his one good eye. Doc grabs Vig by the arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel. 
DOC Get in the tunnel. 
Vig jerks his arm away. 
VIG Troy. 
Doc grabs Vig.

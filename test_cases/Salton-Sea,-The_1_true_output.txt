UNDER THE TABLE - Danny still can't get the gun loose. 
ON THE REFLECTION - Big Bill right behind Danny.  He raises the flintlock. 
Danny bugging.  He rips at the gun. Too late. 
Big Bill goes to fire.  Using the reflection, Danny ducks at the last instant. 
Big Bill FIRES. 
The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest. 
ALL IN AN INSTANT - Danny extricates the gun.  Turns on Big Bill, who sees the gun and holds his hands up. 
Danny SHOOTS TWICE, the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and thumping into his chest.  Big Bill crumples. 
When Pooh-Bear goes to pull his gun from his waist-band, it discharges, shooting him in the thigh. 
The muzzle flash ignites his pants leg.  POOH-BEAR HITS THE FLOOR, SCREAMING, slapping at the fire on his leg. 
Danny wheels on the other two guys at the table, who are going for their guns.  Danny opens up on them with the Glock, flooring them before they can get a shot off. 
OUTSIDE - still descending the bluff, Tanner and Garcetti hear the gunfire. 
INSIDE - Danny turns on Pooh-Bear, who sits there staring at his injured leg. 
Danny puts the gun to Pooh-Bear's head, closes his eyes and starts to pull the trigger. 
Pooh-Bear lifts his gun and SHOOTS DANNY IN THE TORSO THREE TIMES. Danny collapses. 
Pooh-Bear gets to his feet. 
POOH-BEAR Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy.  Pooh- Bear done shot himself. 
He's in shock.  He grabs the duffle bag from the table and staggers down the hallway, into the living room. 
OUTSIDE - Tanner and Garcetti at the front door, listening. They pull their ski-masks on, take out their guns, then silently enter. 
INSIDE - gunsmoke abounds.  One of the guys MOANS on the floor. 
Tanner and Garcetti enter the kitchen, guns drawn and ready.  They survey the scene. 
Bodies everywhere. 
Big Bill lays there dying, staring with confusion at the stigmata in his hands. 
Danny lying in a heap, next to Big Bill. 
Suddenly, they hear POOH-BEAR MUMBLING from somewhere in the house. 
Tanner signals for Garcetti to take point.  They head down the long hallway, slowly and silently.  When they are gone ... 
... Danny stirs on the floor. His eyes open. He opens his shirt and checks his torso REVEALING THAT HE IS WEARING HIS BULLET-PROOF VEST. 
He struggles to a sitting position, in great pain from the impact bruises left by the bullets. 
He picks up his gun, gets up on wobbly legs and follows Tanner and Garcetti down the hall. 
ON DANNY as he creeps down the hall. 
INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT 
Exiting the bathroom and creeping towards the front room. 
DANNY Anybody there? 
ONLY THE SPLATTERING LIQUID SOUND. 
Danny continues. 
He stops at the end of the hall.  His eyes go wide with fear and revulsion. 
THE LIQUID SOUND BECOMES LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT IS ALL THAT CAN BE HEARD. 
Liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch.  Her head is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch.  She looks fine.  There is even a slight smile on her lips. 
DANNY (cont'd) Liz? 
Then he notices it ... 
... a widening pool of BLOOD seeps from under the couch like some living thing.  More blood patters down from some UNSEEN WOUND on the side of her head. 
Danny staggers towards her. 
Her eyes flutter slightly. 
Danny sits next to her. Holds her hand.  There is nothing he can do. 
Liz tries to speak.  Can't. 
DANNY I'm here, Liz. I'm here. 
She squeezes his hand.  Then goes limp. 
INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Danny continues down the hall, remembering. 
INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

FORESIGHT) Yes. They have to take turns. If they all could see at once, they would be invincible, which one cannot risk in beings so grotesque. 
EXT. CAMP                                                   (SKOLOTHIA)                           - NIGHT 
The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle. WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus. OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a strike. 
SPYROS Stay away from my boy! Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!" Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge. Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood; eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the 
WHISPERING. 
PERSEUS Spyros, he means me no harm. The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt. The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels before Perseus, head bowed. 
PERSEUS I hear you and I understand you. But I don't know how. 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Moi ne epos ae'prositi, mene daeva. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PERSEUS You are praying to me? There must be a mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade, honoring Zeus. 
PERSEUS An offering'? I thank you and take it humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering. He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the Shaikh. 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr. 
PERSEUS You honor my father? You honor Spyros? 
SHAIKH SULEIMAN Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus... Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger. 
EXT. MOIRAI PILLAR - NIGHT 
The Expedition ascends the sheer pinnacle via rain-slick stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES. 
EXT. SUMMIT OF MOIRAI PILLAR - SUNRISE 
In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE- STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around: regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby bones. A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human- sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix). Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and pop it in to study the arrivals. 
URD (low, hoot-owl) Amoun... So sorry to see you again. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AMOUN Likewise, Urd. I seek your counsel. 
VERDANDI 
(SHRIEKING) You want us to tell you about Leviathan. 
AMOUN You know already... of course. 
VERDANDI We know this -- the Kraken cannot be defeated. 
SKULD 
(PIERCING) You've wasted a journey. I trust it was not a taxing one. The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing irritation. 
AMOUN Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness. You owe me this answer at least. 
URD The Sisters owe nothing to you or any Man! She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention on Perseus. 
VERDANDI There's something wrong with that one. I don't like having him here. 
SKULD Let me take a look. Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH. Perseus goes to the precipice. 
PERSEUS Tell us what we want to know or your Eye has seen its last. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers.

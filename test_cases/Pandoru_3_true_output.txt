BOWER (CONT'D) Payton? Lieutenant... Payton? He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar. 
BOWER (CONT'D) Bower? Bower...? The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal. Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick layer of dust. Under the smear is... Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D. He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes a fist with concern. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition. 
BOWER Bower. He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar. He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005Â»015. He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool belt with a high powered pen-lamp. On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises, labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures. 
BOWER (CONT'D) (reading to himself) .in the event of mild memory loss... resulting from extended- He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a pocket and exits. 
DISSOLVE THRU BLACK: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER 
BOWER waves his hand over a sensor... no power. He steps in front of a heavy set of steel doors, flipping several switches and... nothing. 
CUT TO: BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets and a cup, taking a seat at the control desk. With Evalon's photograph leaned against the console, he becomes lost in a gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant coffee as we... 
PUSH IN There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return. 
FLASH CUT An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to her, gripping her hands. BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the cup and... winces with disgust. 
BOWER Faa-uck! Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the hatch bursting open. Out climbs... PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock. 
BOWER (CONT'D) Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're- Sir... whoa! PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once over with a frown and a sobering tone. 
PAYTON Who are you? 
BOWER Bower. Corporal... Bower, sir. I'm the-

BOWER Yes. That's right, I'm- 
PAYTON Wanna get that fucking light out of my eyes, pal? 
BOWER Sorry... sir. PAYTON rubs his face with a frown. 
PAYTON Where... are we? 
BOWER We're aboard the Elysium. From what I've 
GATHERED- 
PAYTON 
(NOT FAMILIAR) Elysium...? Where are we? 
BOWER I don't... really know. There's no power in the com and I can't even- 
PAYTON Where's the... rest of the crew? It's our shift? Our rotation- 
BOWER I believe so.

MICK Butch, I told you man, you can't get no shit on lay-away any more. Your credit's all used up. 
Butch pulls a wad of money out of the paper bag. 
BUTCH You accept cash? 
Mick smiles. 
MICK My man! Come on in. 
CUT TO: 
65.INT. LIVING ROOM 足 APARTMENT 足 A LITTLE LATER 
Butch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin. On his right arm is a belt. He then loads the heroin into a syringe. Butch tightens the belt and taps his arm. He sinks the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into his blood stream. His eyes sink and he lies back onto the crusty carpet of the apartment, staring up at the ceiling. From a bird's eye view we slowly move down towards Butch. Suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears. 
VOICE #1 (O.S) It's kill or be killed. 
VOICE #2 (O.S) Why haven't you killed that pig? 
VOICE #3 (O.S) They are plotting against you. We have decided that you must take action. 
VOICE #4 (O.S) Kill them. Kill them all. 
CUT TO: 
66.INT. HALLWAY 足 112 OCEAN AVENUE 足 DAY Butch puts his jacket on and prepares to open the front door. Suddenly a large hand GRABS the back of his jacket. Butch swipes the hand away and spins around to see his father red with rage. 
RONALD SENIOR Nineteen thousand dollars boy! Nineteen thousand!!

RONALD SENIOR You stole that fuckin' money from the auto dealership!! 
BUTCH What the fuck you talking about?? I was robbed!! Didn't Brigante tell you huh? Some fuckers car jacked me Pop. I told the police about it! 
RONALD SENIOR You expect me to believe that, boy? You think I'm fuckin' stupid??

Ronald Senior grabs Butch by the scruff of the neck and SLAMS him against the door. LOUISE DEFEO rushes in. 
LOUISE What the hell's going on?? 
RONALD SENIOR Our son's a fuckin' junkie thief, that's what's going on!! He robbed the fucking dealership!! 
BUTCH Don't listen to him Ma, I ain't done nothing!! 
Ronald Senior and Butch fall to the floor and start grappling. 
LOUISE Stop it!! Stop it now!! Louise attempts to pull Ronald Senior off Butch. Her nails dig into her husband's neck and draw blood. An enraged Ronald Senior grabs his wife's arms as she starts to slap him. Butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the hallway. Ronald Senior remonstrates with Louise who is still trying to slap him. 
RONALD SENIOR Why do you always have to get involved huh?? You've always been too soft on that boy!!

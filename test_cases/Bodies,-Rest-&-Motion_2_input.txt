Nick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising in the distance. 
NICK So what does the wind mean? Like as an omen or something, you know -- (making his voice mystical) -- a change is coming to the people. -- the spirit of freedom is walking the land. (flatly) That kind of meaning... 
NAVAJO TEEN (handing him money) Fourteen, fifteen and five makes twenty. 
He opens Nick's car door for him. 
NAVAJO TEEN The wind is. It's the wind like I'm a Navajo. 
NICK That's it? 
The Navajo teen nods. 
NICK Shit. 
He gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door shut with a slam. 
NICK (out the window) It would be better if meant something. 
The Navajo teen shrugs. Nick starts the engine. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A BAR IN ENFIELD - NIGHT 
A dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of neon beer signs. Waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of brew to the thirsty throng. At the far end a band plays a foot-stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to see his woman. 
THE CAMERA MOVES through the crowd and discovers Carol and Beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of beer between them. 
They speak loudly to be heard over the din. 
CAROL He said he needs to be alone again. Learn about himself. Make a fresh start in a new town. 
Beth shakes her head then takes a sip of her beer -- it tastes bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust. 
CAROL (after a beat) He's sorry. 
Beth stares at her beer. Carol puts a hand comfortingly on Beth's arm. 
CAROL He said he would have called you, but your phone's disconnected. 'Cause you're moving. (after a beat) He's always been an asshole. (after a beat) You'll be all right. 
BETH Yeah... 
CAROL (gently) I'm here. 
BETH I know that. 
A big-haired WAITRESS approaches the table. 
WAITRESS You ready for another? 
Carol looks to Beth. 
BETH Oh... uh, no... 
CAROL We're fine. 
WAITRESS Is Nick coming in? 
Carol throws the waitress a look that could kill. Beth takes a deep breath. 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Nick stares at the road ahead. He takes rapid drags on a cigarette. The RADIO is barely audible over the ROAR of the WIND through the open windows. 
PREACHER'S VOICE (covered by static) "And he arose and came to his father, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and..." 
Nick turns the radio off. 
He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray. 
He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it back on the seat. 
He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map. The wind catches the map. 
The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the car, Nick slaps it down.

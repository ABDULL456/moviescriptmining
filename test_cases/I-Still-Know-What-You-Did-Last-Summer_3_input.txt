THE HOOK 
goes straight into Will's chest. 
The fisherman has hooked his own son. 
Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank. 
Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud. 
Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired. 
THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving up... 
Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his eye. 
BEN Gonna blind you first. 
The hook is touching the eyelid -- 
A GUNSHOT 
rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away from Ray. 
JULIE 
stands behind him holding the gun. 
JULIE Just...Die. 
BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward into Julie's grave. 
As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave... 
A MUDDY LANDSLIDE 
slowly covers Ben up. 
Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt -- 
BEN You can't kill me. 
His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving. 
BEN (cont'd) I'll always be with you. 
The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the 
GLEAMING METAL HOOK 
waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling. 
Julie goes to Ray. 
CUT TO: 
105	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. They are moving past some shrubbery when 
A DARK FIGURE 
jumps out. Julie yells. She and Ray jump back. 
KARLA 
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out. 
KARLA Oh, god, it's you -- 
JULIE You're okay. Thank god. 
KARLA Is he? 
They nod. They go to her -- jubilant group hug time. They compose themselves. 
KARLA (cont'd) You know, it's true what they say about package vacations...You get what you pay for. (beat) Now, how about we get off this piece of crap island. 
The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie as the beautific light catches her face. 
Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a beautiful orange sunrise. 
JULIE (smiling) We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret. 
The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and they start walking for the beach as... 
A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER 
rises into view.

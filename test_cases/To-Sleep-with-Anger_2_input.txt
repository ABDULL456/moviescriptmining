GIDEON What can I do for you, Officer? 
Suzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor. Officer Scott keeps her in view. 
DAVIS You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock. 
GIDEON I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots. 
DAVIS Not anymore, not in the city. 
GIDEON We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have. 
DAVIS Well, you just have to move further out. 
GIDEON Now how far would further out be? 
DAVIS I'm not here to argue, sir. 
SCOTT You guys don't make anything illegal, do you? 
GIDEON Like what may I ask? 
SCOTT You might have a distillery pumping out barrels of moonshine. 
Suzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen. Gideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the confrontation. 
DAVIS Look, just get rid of the chickens and you all have a nice day. 
Gideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the steps. 
GIDEON I'll be damned if I get rid of my chickens. I ought to get some hogs and put them out there. 
INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT 
There is soft knocking on the door. Suzie enter frame wearing a robe. 
SUZIE Who is it? 
BABE BROTHER (V.O.) Babe Brother. 
Suzie opens the door. BABE BROTHER, Gideon's youngest son, about 31, handsome, wearing an expensive suit, comes in, beating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands. 
BABE BROTHER I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night. 
SUZIE This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air. 
BABE BROTHER He will be alright. 
The camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room where Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly. 
INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Suzie and Babe Brother enter the bedroom where Sunny is sleeping. Suzie gives Babe Brother a blanket to wrap Sunny up in. 
BABE BROTHER Thanks for taking care of him. I will try not to be so long next time. 
Babe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes to the door. 
GIDEON What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one. 
BABE BROTHER I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late. 
GIDEON That's a lie. 
SUZIE Let us settle this tomorrow.

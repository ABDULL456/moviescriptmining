CONTINUED: MAX Guerilla theater, folks. 'All the world's a stage.'  Don't know if that word reached you here yet. If you'd care to show your appreciation by a small donation... Many smiles... and several instant offers of rupees.      A beat, then... MAX Aw, what the hell. ... Swallowing his incredible embarrassment, Max takes the money. 
EXT. SQUARE - DAY (EARLY MORNING) The line is long. At this moment, Joan is checking a child's throat with a tongue-depressor. Aloka is walking beside her with a fistful of depressors and a bag for disposal. Hasari and Ram are getting ready to leave. Anouar appears at Joan's waist. ANOUAR Good morning, Joan Di. Dr. Loeb said many of us could be helped; that all it would take is money for medication. Anouar hands Joan some newspaper in which something is wrapped. Joan opens the paper. Inside is a good deal of money. ANOUAR Please buy the medication for us. If we cannot come here to receive it, perhaps Dr. Loeb would come to us. JOAN I'll be happy to buy the medication, but Dr. Loeb is not part of this endeavor, Anouar; there is only his cherished memory. ANOUAR Then perhaps I am having visions. Anouar's focus is up the lane.   Joan follows his focus to: 
THEIR POV Max approaches. A buzz    about Max's heroics; hands coming together. Max raises a    hand in benediction, makes the sign of the cross. Max    claps Hasari on the shoulder; Hasari brings his hands   together and gives Max a genuinely pleased smile.    Children circle and touch him, Manooj and Shambu among   them. 
BACK TO SCENE MAX Good morning! Good morning! Heckuva morning! Getting ready to practice medicine without a license, Sister Joan? You don't see me soliciting conversions, do you? JOAN Well, well, well, I do so love to be surprised. MAX Okay, for starters, pick me out someone with something easy I can heal, make me look good. (to Aloka) Aloka, you're my assistant, let's go. Aloka smiles, she nods, she accepts. JOAN Max, knock it off, give us a bit of hush. (as he does) What happened? MAX I changed my mind. JOAN And I'm a bloody bathing beauty. MAX Okay, so I got left. JOAN Smart girl... So how long am I stuck with you? MAX Two weeks -- or until Mom sends me a ticket. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JOAN Not worth the aggravation of your prattle every day. Six months -- and not a day less. MAX No way. Six weeks -- and that's my best offer. JOAN Two months -- and that's my final offer. MAX (a beat) Done. JOAN Jesus and Mary. The Lone Ranger rides again. And now smiles creep onto all their faces as Max goes inside, followed by Joan... and then Aloka -- after she looks at Hasari, gets his nod of encouragement. Too late, Joan says... JOAN Watch your -- Thud! MAX Thanks -- got it. The children titter. The teacher, Margareta, admonishes them to pay attention and be polite... as we -- 
FADE OUT. FADE IN: EXT. SCHOOL GIRL'S HOUSE - HASARI'S WHEELS - DAY (TWO WEEKS LATER) The wheels spinning furiously and then stopping abruptly. Hasari, dripping with sweat, panting. The School Girl comes running toward him. After her, in the b.g., her MOTHER. SCHOOL GIRL Hasari, where have you been? I've been waiting almost five minutes. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HASARI I'm sorry, forgive me.   It won't happen again. SCHOOL GIRL We're not going to school today. You're taking my mother and me to the Bara Bazar. I'm getting married! HASARI Oh, I am so pleased for you! Panting helplessly, Hasari smiles... as he helps the School Girl's Mother into the rickshaw. 
MOTHER Good morning, Hasari. HASARI Good morning, missus. Briskly, he takes up the shafts and sets off. MOTHER Turn right at that corner, Hasari. HASARI It's farther that way, missus. MOTHER No, not really. Turn there, please. Obediently, Hasari turns (as Ramatullah, heading the other way, passes; they wave) and Hasari pulls AWAY FROM us. 
EXT. SECOND WEDDING SHOP - DAY He helps them out of the rickshaw in front of an expensive-looking bridal shop. SCHOOL GIRL You must remember this shop, Hasari, when it's your daughter's time. This is the nicest in the city. The Mother gives the School Girl a withering look and hustles her into the shop. Hasari can just barely hear... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MOTHER (O.S.) Don't say things like that. He's never going to be able to buy anything here. 
ON HASARI He watches from outside, a look of determination coming over his face. Suddenly a pair of fingers takes hold of his ear, twisting his face painfully.

Bernard: We..., we'll never make it!! 
Wilbur:  (as he bounces along roof)  Hot!  Oooh!  Ow!  Passengers please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop.  Thank you. 
(Jake and Sparky continue to extend the runway; Wilbur lands on an umbrella and spins around.) 
Jake:    Quick Sparky, we need to make a drag line! 
(an elaborate clothesline/hangar/brassiere drag line is constructed; Wilbur is catapulted into the drag line; when he stops, he is "wearing" the bra.) 
Wilbur:  (cocky) Don't try and tell ME the runway's too short.  Ha!  (to Jake) Hold this for me will ya pal?  (Wilbur "hands" him the bra which launches Jake backwards.) 
Jake:    Bloke oughtta have his wings clipped. 
Wilbur:  You captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines..... 
Jake:    (aside to Sparky) Crazy Yanks.  They think they can do any fool thing, without regard for..... 
(he sees Bianca; becomes starry-eyed; Sparky wonders what happened; looks at Jake; Sparky buzzes in dismay) 
(being suave) Welcome to Australia ma'am.  My name's Jake and if there's any way I can make your stay more pleasant, don't hesitate to ask. 
Bianca:  Oh, how kind. 
Jake:    Allow me to get that bag for ya. 
Bernard: (struggling)  I've a.... I've got a lot of... luggage here... 
Wilbur:  Here let me give you a hand with those bags pal, all part of the friendly service here at Albatross Air (Wilbur picks up two of the bags; a crunch is heard)  Ow!  Oh!  Big time hurt!  Ah back!!  Oh it's out!

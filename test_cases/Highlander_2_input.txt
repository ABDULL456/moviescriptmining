Watches the funeral quietly at a distance. 
THE OLD WOMAN 
As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief. 
Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor. Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony. 
CONOR 
Watches the woman approach but decides against moving. She stops a few paces away and looks over him. 
OLD WOMAN You. 
CONOR Katherine. 
OLD WOMAN What are you doing here? 
CONOR I owe him this. 
OLD WOMAN He never knew you. 
The two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons old enough to be his father. 
SON #1 Is something wrong, Mother? 
OLD WOMAN Howard.  James.  This is your father...

108  INT. BEDROOM                                                  108 
Taupin and Brenna lie together. 
Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds. 
Taupin strokes her softly. 
TAUPIN "Brenna".  In Celtic is means "woman with raven hair".  Only chieftan's daughters were allowed it. 
Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars. 
BRENNA What is it like?  Being you? 
TAUPIN Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both. 
BRENNA But you're known so much. History I'll only read about. 
TAUPIN It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away. 
BRENNA What is it you want? 
TAUPIN All of it finished. 
109  EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING                                      109 
Taupin and Brenna stand beside her car.  She has an armload of documents. 
TAUPIN Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall. 
BRENNA Will I see you again? 
TAUPIN Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to. 
Pause.  Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly into the car. 
TAUPIN Good luck. 
110  EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY                      110 
Detective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars. 
MORAN Are you sure? 
INSPECTOR Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory. 
MORAN Round up who you can and put them on standby. 
INSPECTOR Think we should call the local P.D. out there first? 
MORAN No.  I want this to be all ours. 
111  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                    111 
Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack. 
CLERK O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's all I need.

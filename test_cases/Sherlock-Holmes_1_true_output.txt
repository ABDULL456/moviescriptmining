77   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                      77 
Sir Thomas sinks into his bath.   Relaxing. 
The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip. 
The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic, as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of wind. 
Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up. Can't. Not all the way.

77    CONTINUED:                                                   77 BLACKWOOD (O.S.) Hello, Father... 
Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion. 
Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly. 
BLACKWOOD You can't fight it. It comes from a power greater than yours. You can only surrender. 
The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger. 
BLACKWOOD I've been imagining this moment for a long time... 
The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely. 
BLACKWOOD ... I must admit, it's better than I thought it would be. 
INT. THE GRAND HOTEL - CORRIDOR - DAY Carrying an armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key into a lock and opens the door... 
... to be confronted by the snoring form of Holmes, still handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her shriek wakes him. He looks down at himself and reacts with shock, then grim recognition sets in. 
HOLMES Don't take this the wrong way, but might I borrow your hand? 
78A   INT. POLICE CARRIAGE                                         78A 
Holmes sits beside a COP, and opposite CONSTABLE CLARK. 
HOLMES Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
78A   CONTINUED:                                                  78A HOLMES (CONT'D) This is why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling, there is no latitude for misunderstanding. 
He looks out the carriage window and sees signs of a spiritualist gathering. 
HOLMES Faith runs riot over reason. 
CONSTABLE CLARK Well, it's a good thing she was offended or we'd never have found you. The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning. 
The coach stops. 
78B                                                                78B EXT. SIR THOMAS' HOUSE - DAY Holmes steps out of the coach, and is escorted inside by Constable Clark. 
78C   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                    78C 
Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away -- 
CONSTABLE CLARK We've checked everything. No sign of a break-in. The Butler didn't hear anything. The body was in the tub, eyes wide open -- -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air. 
CONSTABLE CLARK (realizing Holmes isn't there) -- only his ring was missing. 
He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode. Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best -- this is, in fact, why he exists. 
Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket). 
The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing. (CONTINUED) 
65A. 78C   CONTINUED:                                                78C HOLMES Why did you drain the water? 
POLICE OFFICER Out of common decency. 
HOLMES (incensed) Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse. 
Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up, opens it, sniffs it. 
HOLMES Hmm... 
Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose. 
HOLMES What is that? 
POLICE OFFICER (smelling) Uhhhh... jasmine? 
HOLMES Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own. 
Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss. 
HOLMES Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay! 
The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's- eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill. Sometimes he hums or sings to himself. 
Holmes is happy. 
He glances around the room, sees the chair where Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself. (CONTINUED) 
65B. 78C   CONTINUED: (2)                                              78C His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust. The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open. 
Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing: 
(CONTINUED) 
78C   CONTINUED: (3)                                              78C FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels. 
He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters -- 
78D   OMITTED                                                       78D

WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                64 Deacon and his biology class are getting on a school bus. Nearby, Naomi is crossing the parking lot when she trips and spills her latt√© on her shirt. People start laughing, but Deacon instinctively rushes over to pick up her books. DEACON Are you okay? NAOMI Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed. She pats at the stain. DEACON (genuine) Really? I didn't think you got embarrassed about anything. She smiles at Deacon, cheered up by the inadvertent compliment. The Bus HONKS for Deacon. DEACON (CONT'D) Well, I guess I should go.

NAOMI Cool. You can turn around now. He turns and sees her new shirt is not yet 100% on. NAOMI (CONT'D) Listen. Mark and J.T. are having a party tonight. You want to meet me there? DEACON Really? NAOMI Why not? DEACON Okay. Cool. The bus HONKS for Deacon again. 65    EXT.

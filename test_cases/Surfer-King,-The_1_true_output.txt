Pipeman? 
ALEX He's a myth. 
AOKEE Oh, no. Pipeman very real. Works here in park. Low profile. You must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the Thunder Bay wave. This not the ocean, surf boy. 
ALEX (thinking) Pipeman. The Banzai Pipeline. I get it. Some kind of legendary surf champ. Where do we find him? 
AOKEE I only see him once, maybe twice. Stay behind scenes. But here he is and find him you must. (to ROBBIE) So. You do this? 
Robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment. 
CUT TO: 
33        INT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                33 
WE SEE quarters going ding ding ding into the pay phone on AOKEE'S wall. The shot widens to reveal AOKEE is dumping quarters and ROBBIE is holding the phone. He puts it up to his ear. 
ROBBIE (into phone) Hello, Grandma? No, I'm fine. Listen, Grandma...I need you to send me a few of my things... 
AOKEE and ALEX are huddled around smiling. 
34        INT - DAY - BIG MIKE'S OFFICE                                  34 
BIG MIKE is standing, walking around as he speaks, TIFFANY is sitting. Clearly she is being scolded. 
BIG MIKE (angry) ....why you wouldn't believe the things I've heard. Just stupid things. Cutting in line. Demanding special treatment. Oh, and how about this one: (mimicking her) Princesses don't carry trash. (back to his voice) I've often thought it was a mistake to have you work here. Maybe I was right.

TIFFANY (trying to dance out of it) Oh, daddy. You know how jealous people get. 
BIG MIKE I'd almost believe that. But I was behind the First Aid station when you said the "princess" line. This park exists because the kids here work hard. They need to be treated fairly. They need to see you are just another lifeguard. 
TIFFANY (protesting) But I'm not just another lifeguard. 
BIG MIKE (mad again) You won't even be that if this continues. If you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours, I need to see real, concrete changes in your attitude. 
TIFFANY All right.     What do you expect me to do? 
BIG MIKE For one thing, start mingling with "the commoners". You'd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are. Make some friends outside that little group of yours. It's the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table. Show some gratitude. 
TIFFANY (thinking a moment) Fine. I'll work it. 
BIG MIKE (softening, but firm) Good. Work on it. Please? 
TIFFANY (nodding, but we don't believe her) Oh, Daddy. Don't worry about a thing. 
35        EXT MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - TIME SHACK                        35 
ROBBIE and ALEX hook up and grab their time cards. There is a banner hanging that says, "Employee Luau Tonight", and SKEETER and SNITCH have taken a 5 gallon bucket and are using it as a stepladder to attach something. 
SKEETER is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand. SNITCH hands up the hand-lettered magic marker addition, which

SKEETER staples on to the bottom of the banner while SNITCH keeps a lookout. 
The addition says, "COME GET LEI'D".     They scamper off, laughing. 
ALEX (looking up at the sign) This will be good. Aokee throws a great Luau. 
ROBBIE I don't how much fun it will be.     With Aokee hosting, we'll be working.

FELDSPAR It's the xenosaurus -- stand back, men -- it's a vicious killer -- Ready -- Aim -- FRED (with desperate poignancy) High ham noght a zenosore! High ham hay hooman beeng -- ! BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface. 286   CLOSE - FRED                                                 286 Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire! 287   DINO                                                         287 
Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has the wits to act! 
"YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING -- and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's monster suit and -- de-pants him! Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now revealed striped undershorts. 
288   WIDER                                                        288 Pause. (CONTINUED) 
288   CONTINUED:                                                     288 Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end. 
GRAVEL Hey, those are the biggest shorts I've ever seen... (realizing) ... It... it must be Mister Flintstone! Cease fire! (to Feldspar) Gee, Sarge, now you don't have to shoot him -- ! 
Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns. (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles it away from his superior.) 289   THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN                           289 Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava is chasing the car.) POINDEXTER (distant) Dad! Dad! Can I use the Porscherock while you're in the slammer? Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug. SLATE Flintstone. Rubble. I... I don't know what to say. I... I treated you horribly... I ignored you, abused you... and then you come here and risk your necks like this... well, there's no price you can put on something like that, so I won't even try. But let me give you... (with great poignancy) ... a hearty handshake. 
MRS. SLATE Dear, don't you think a little more than that is in order? 
SLATE Honey, you're being hysterical, go lie down, okay? 
(CONTINUED) 
289   CONTINUED:                                                      289 MRS. SLATE I am not being hysterical, I am being fair -- now the Flintsteins and Rabbles saved all of our lives, not to mention your reputation. 
SLATE (sighing) Okay, okay. (to Fred and Barney) Boys, I'm feeling guilty about how you've been taken advantage of, so I'll tell you what... I'm going to give you back all world-wide rights to Fibrerock, free and clear. He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it. SLATE Your only obligation will be to cover oh, whatever legal expenses might surface at some later time... BARNEY You think there's gonna be some? Slate looks around at -- 290   HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION                           290 Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see. As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City collapse, crushing a police car. 291   BACK TO SCENE                                                 291 
SLATE (casually) Oh, you never know... 
292   RESCUE DINOS                                                    292 Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of Fibrerock crumbs. 
293   FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS                                293 All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT. 
(CONTINUED) 
293   CONTINUED:                                                        293 Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the pile, munching like crazy. 
Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some pieces, he nibbles on it a little. 
FRED Barn...?    What's going on? BARNEY (sniffing it) Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... (realizing) ... Fred, this... this is Dino kibble! FRED Dino kibble...? Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen... FRED (mouth full) Dhinough khibble!! He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract Slate wrote on. 
FRED Barney, we -- we're rich! Yabba dabba do -- !

INSPECTOR No, Sir.

156A   CONTINUED:                                                156A 
The Commissioner dumps a copy of the Times of India down on the desk. Then the Hindustan Times, the Amar Ujala and the Afternoon Dispatch thump down after them. All have photos of Jamal on Who Wants to be a Millionaire on the front page. 
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE And if that isn't enough for you... 
He motions the Inspector to come over to the window. 
Lifts the blind. The Inspector hurries over. Looks alarmed. 
INSPECTOR That's-? 
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE - yes, yes! The boy's a bloody hero with every beggar and thief in the city. We're in danger of looking very stupid, here, Inspector. 
INSPECTOR Whilst I'm not convinced he actually cheated, I have got- 
The Inspector brandishes the file. 
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE - Prem Kumar himself- a man of great standing and integrity- said the kid was a liar and a cheat. What more do you need? 
The Inspector pauses. 
INSPECTOR A liar. 
Then he puts the file behind his back. Srinivas frowns. 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Indeed, sir. 
Srinivas coughs pointedly. Gets a steely look from the Inspector. The Commissioner has been staring out of the window at the crowds. Turns back to them. 
COMMISIONER OF POLICE He's in for fraud, so you charge him for fraud. Fast. Or you'll find yourself on traffic duty at the Gateway of India. Understand? 
(CONTINUED) 
156A   CONTINUED: (2)                                       156A 
INSPECTOR Yes, sir. 
The Commissioner walks out. 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Sir-? 
INSPECTOR Not a word, Srinivas. 
157    INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.            157 
A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a music channel. Latika hurries out. 
JAVED What about my bloody whisky, woman? 
But she has already gone. He growls after her. 
JAVED (CONT'D) Hey, Salim. 
He motions Salim to get him a drink. Javed's mobile rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a bottle to the back. 
SALIM We're out. I'll just get- Syed. 
Salim smiles faintly at the image of Jamal and hurries out. 
158    INT . JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. NIGHT.           158 
A drawer opens. Inside is Salim's pistol. And a phone- the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares at both for a long time. Finally, picks up the gun and phone. 
SALIM (to himself) Final answer? 
He finds this faintly amusing. 
159   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                 159 
Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door behind him. Stares at the tv. 
SALIM That boy. He will never give up. Never. 
He shakes his head. 
SALIM (CONT'D) Crazy chutiy√©. 
Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her. 
SALIM (CONT'D) Ja. Go. 
LATIKA But- 
SALIM - just drive. There won't be another chance. Go. 
Latika takes the keys. Hesitates. 
LATIKA He'll kill you. 
Salim smiles, shakes his head. 
SALIM It is not written. 
JAVED O/S Salim!

Billy moves to stop Mohawk --- ï¿½ ï¿½ .}}}}} -- but now the Gremlin w hrftd isappeared into the electric outlet EMERGES FROM ANOTHER SOC , across the room. He is different 40 now -- seemingly made of e, crackling ELECTRICITY. He flies close to Billy, forcing to back away, so that Mohawk can grab the vial attached to the spider and escape from the lab. Finished with Billy, the ELECTRIC GREMLIN wafts himself onto a table full of scientific MACHINERY. He touches his glowing claw to a cyclotron. It spins crazily, then SHORTS OUT in a shower of SPARKS and SMOKE... .while, on the floor below, the Gremlin mob finishes off Dr. Catheter.

In his other claw, George holds a PENDULUM rigged up from a T-square, a protractor, rubber bands...

Pacing back and forth on the floor below, Mohawk CACKLES at Gizmo's dilemma. Like a villain swilling whiskey, he gulps from the vial he stole in the genetics lab, the one with the spider logo on it. The blade moves closer-grazing Gizmo's fur...but as it SLICES the topmost fibers of the twine that holds him down -- -- a CHANGE comes over Gizmo's expression. This is one Mogwai who's had enough. He sets his jaw in angry determination, and BURSTS the frayed twine, freeing one arm -- then another -- George grabs the T-square like a scythe, and tries to hack at Gizmo with the knife blade -- -- but Gizmo GRABS the pendulum and PULLS down hard, so that George TUMBLES from his shelf --

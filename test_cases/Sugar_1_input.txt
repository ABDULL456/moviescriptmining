As the players and fans   head for the exits, Miguel remains on the bullpen mound for a   beat. He nods to himself, oddly at peace with the moment.    Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN with him, as he crosses   frame, and makes the long walk to the dugout. Hold.

Earl drops off Miguel near the team bus, as players and coaches load their gear in, and get on. 
Miguel cautiously approaches the bus, sees Salvador, hesitates... 
MIGUEL I forgot something in the clubhouse. I'll be right back. 
As Miguel turns, Salvador grabs his bag, which is still on his shoulder. 
SALVADOR Here, I'll load your bag. 
Miguel grips his bag tighter and the two of them lock eyes. Salvador senses his intensity, releases the bag. Miguel backs away with Salvador looking on. 
ED Where's he going? 
SALVADOR Bathroom. 
AT THE CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE Miguel turns back to the bus, sees... 
...Salvador eyeing him from the open bus window.   Sal raises his hand, very subtly waves goodbye. 
Miguel continues on his way.

Miguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him. 
He shoots her a cautious smile.

Kate sits on Max's bed, reading and showing her the pictures: 
KATE "People send us flowers and cards, but we still miss our baby. If this just happened to you, I'm sorry you got an angel instead of a'baby. I.think a baby would have been more fun." The last picture is a FAMILY WITH A BABY ANGEL watching over them. 
MAX 
IS BABY JESSIE AN ANGEL? 
KATE Yes, she is. She's with us every day. Kate gives Max a gentle kiss on the forehead. 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kate opens a medicine chest 'and shakes a PILL from a prescription bottle. She swallows the pill-with a Dixie cup of water. 
INT. XATB AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
John watches TV in bed. Kate enters from the bathroom in a nightshirt and sits on the bed. She.rubs lotion on her feet. John watches her, then reaches out, runs his fingers uup and down her back. Kate freezes. He can't see the-nervous look that crosses her face. He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing hex-. neck. Kate responds stiffly, trying to get. in the mood. He slides a hand around her waist, moves it up to her breast... 
KATE I'm sorry. I can't. Shit... She moves away, tears suddenly in.her eyes. He gives a concerned look, lets her have her space. A beat. 
KATE I'm so sick of feeling like this. Christ, the kids must thing I'm crazy. 
JOHN Will you stop worrying about what everybody else thinks? 
KATE How can I? I saw a pregnant woman today on the way home and I almost lost it. Just burst into tears with Max sitting right there. Daniel barely talks to me. You and I haven't had sex in over a year now. What if I.never get better? I don't want to lose you. 
JOHN You're never going to lose us. I promise you. I just wish... (off her look) Have you thought any more about adopting? 
KATE I can't even be a mother to the children we already have. 
JOHN That's not true. The kids understand. They just know you're not happy. 
KATE But I should be. 
JOHN - Do you want another child? 
B. 
KATE You Snow I do. More than anything. 
JOHN Even if it can-'t be'biologically ours. 
KATE- 
YES 
JOHN Then what are we talking about this -for? Let's do it. 
KATE You-don't just adopt a child because you're lonely and depressed. 
JOHN That's not why we'd be doing..it. We wanted a child a year ago and we still want one, now.. 
KATE We can't replace our baby. 
JOHN No, 'we can't. But we can take the' place we made for her in our hearts and our home and give it to a child who needs a family. 
(BEAT) Kate, we love being parents. We're good at it and'it makes. us happy. What better reason-do you want? Kate looks at him for a beat, then smiles and lets her tears fall. 
INT.-LAWYER'S OFFICE -- DAY

LAWYER - Are you both employed? 
JOHN I'm-an architect at a firm in the city. The Lawyer turns to Kate. Kate hesitates. 
KATE I used to teach music at Yale. I haven't worked for about a year.

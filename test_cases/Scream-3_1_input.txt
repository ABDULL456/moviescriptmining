VOICE She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together. 
SIDNEY WHERE? 
VOICE I'll call you, when you're on your way. 
Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying. 
SIDNEY Fuck! 
Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls up a fully loaded handgun. 
That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings. 
SIDNEY (into phone) Yeah? 
VOICE You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there. 
Click. The killer hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT 
Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT 
Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. Again, she answers it. 
SIDNEY (into phone) Alright, I'm here. Now what? 
VOICE You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro. 
SIDNEY I thought you wanted me here? 
Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT 
Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it. 
SIDNEY (into phone) Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this. 
VOICE It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later. 
The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on. 
INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his bloody hand. 
CREDIT SEQUENCE EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY 
The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing in the sun with a thumb in the air. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The truck    passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is carrying    a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the other. He    is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera pans to a    sign that reads "ACUÑA 18 miles". 
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 
Mariachi is walking around downtown Acuña. He notices a bar across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on the building that says "MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY". He prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside. 
INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY 
Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS    as ge makes his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him    back. He sits on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying    his guitar case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks    around the place, as if sizing it up. 
BARTENDER What do you want to drink? 
MARIACHI Refresco. 
The other drinkers stare at him. 
Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table- shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room. 
Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes. Mariachi is served his drink. 
MARIACHI (CONT'D) No hay musica? 
BARTENDER (cleaning a glass) Why? 
MARIACHI I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar. 
BARTENDER So what? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARIACHI I could add a little class to this place. I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work, and I can guarantee bringing in more customers.

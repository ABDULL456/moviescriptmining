{"train": "MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE MOVIE REVISIONS BY ARNE OLSEN DIRECTED BY BRYAN SPICER REVISED DRAFT OCTOBER 31 1994 \nFADE IN: \nBLACK SCREEN \nWords SCRAWL UP ON SCREEN and we hear a RESOUNDING VOICE. \nVOICE In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil.  with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force.  In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as \"Zords\".  while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title...  The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. \nWe hear PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC as the POWER RANGER'S LOGO BURST'S ONTO THE SCREEN.  Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing \n1   EXT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             1 \nA prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky. \nROCKY YeeeoowwWWWWW!!! \n2   INT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             2 \nThe six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and helmets.  Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard. \nROCKY We're OUTTA here!! \nKIMBERLY Easy, Rock. \nTOMMY Once we hit the target zone we've got fifteen seconds to make the drop. \nBULK  (0 . S .) Step aside, pinheads. \nBULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II leather caps and aviator goggles. \nBULK The Stealth Eagle is about to fly. \nSKULL Ditto for the Swooping Swallow. \nThe Rangers exchange amused looks.  Aisha gestures to them \nAISHA Lead on, flyboys. \nBulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground is a dizzying distance below.  They swallow hard. \nSKULL Bulk... where'd the earth go? \nBILLY Five seconds to the target zone! \nTOMMY Aisha  you' re  on ! \nBulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself. \nThe others follow through the opening with flair. \nROCKY Stylin! \nADAM On your tail! \nBILLY All systems \nTommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly a hand, indicating Tommy should go first. \nTOMMY Surf's up! \nHe's gone.  Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway. \nKIMBERLY Catch you on the flipside. \nBulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS out of the plane. \n3   EXT. SKY  -  DAY \nROCK AND ROLL fills the track as the Rangers plunge towards earth, executing a series of MIND-BOGGLING MANEUVERS: SPINS, FISHTAILS, POWER DIVES, BACK FLIPS, you name it. \n4   INT. PROP PLANE  -  DAY                          4 \nBulk and Skull psyche themselves up. \nBULK Be the eagle.  Be the eagle. \nALPHA 5 To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices. \nZORDON Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension. \n16   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT \nBarricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his coffee. \nBZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature named MORDANT appear. \nRITA Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel.  Why didn't I listen to her?! \nZedd grumbles to himself. \nZEDD That's a good question. \nThe stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy. \nFIRST SECURITY GUARD Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna take a look at this. \nKurt looks up groggily. \nZEDD No need to wake him.  In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself. \nZedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are knocked out. \nGoldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg. \nMORDANT Hey bonehead, get off my hoof! \nGoldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the glowing egg shape. \nZEDD After two thousand years of searching...  I have finally found you. \nMordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again. \nMORDANT Yo, earth to Bigfoot! \nGoldar SWATS Mordant. \nGOLDAR Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball! \nZEDD SILENCE! \nRITA (to  Goldar) Where did you FIND this rabid little rodent, anyway?! \nGOLDAR Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side.  He`s just visiting for the summer. \nRITA Well put a muzzle on him! \nMordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE. \nWhen the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o the sticky substance. \nRITA What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of SNOT! \nAs if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita are too busy arguing to notice this. \nZEDD Don't you ever have anything nice to say?! \nRITA Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you! \nWe hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd. \nMORDANT Boss. \nZEDD For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot ! \nRITA You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?! \nMORDANT Boss. \nZEDD WHAT! \nZedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of GLISTENING SILVER. \nHe stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts his hands on his head, CRACKS it. \nSECURITY GUARD You had me scared there. \nAISHA Makes two of us. \nKIMBERLY You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around? \nSECURITY GUARD The only thing I've seen is you teenagers. (beat) And you know... if there's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate.... \nCLOSE ON HIS FACE as it SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO THE+ HIDEOUS VISAGE OF IVAN OOZE. \nIVAN It's TEENAGERS \nKIMBERLY GroSS! \nIVAN You're too kind.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, IVAN OOZE! \nROCKY Well, pack your bags cause we're sending you back where you came from! \nIVAN Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years. \nKIMBERLY we're not just teenagers, raisin- head. \nTOMMY We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! \nIvan puts his hands to his face in mock fear. \nIVAN Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?. \nHe looks them over reproachfully. \nIVAN Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work.  And speaking of rats... \nIvan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS. \nNow, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN SIZED RAT-BEASTS. \nIVAN From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO EXIST! \nIvan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SKY. \nIVAN WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE! \nAn EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN. \nROCKY He's  gone. \nThe RATS ATTACK! \nADAM Let's take these beasts!! \nTommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE HANDSWORD.  Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants. \n19   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT \nSMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control panels VIBRATE. \nZORDON Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here! \nALPHA 5 Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin! \nThere's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through the hairline cracks in the door. \nALPHA 5 Well...  ALMOST nobody. \nThe ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings. \nIVAN Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice. \nAlpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES then LUNGES. \nALPHA 5 HI ,  YAH ! \nIvan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge Alpha starts spinning. \nALPHA  5 Welcome to Wiener World.  May I take your order, please? \nZORDON You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself. \nAISHA SABER TOOTH TIGER! \nTOMMY WHITE TIGER! \nRANGERS MORPHENOMENAL! \nThey JUMP INTO THE AIR and they're ENGULFED IN A DAZZLING GOLDEN LIGHT as we do a 3D MOVIE VERSION OF THEIR TRANSFORMATION INTO COSTUME. \nThey all LAND and there's a WHIRRING SOUND as all six of the face pieces POLARIZE so we can see their faces.  The rats immediately scurry off. \nTOMMY Let's teach these vermin a few manners. \nAISHA Activating Power Beam! \nA YELLOW BEAM SLICES THROUGH THE DARKNESS.  Aisha leads the group through the site. \nKIMBERLY Everybody stay alert. \n(CONTINUED) - NEXT FILE PAGES 21 ONWARDS \n20   CONTINUED:  (2)                                           20 \nThey pass a bulldozer, some scaffolding \nADAM Hold it... \nThey come to a stop. \nADAM (pointing) I heard something over there. \nBILLY Activating Audio Enhancer! \nAN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE. \nSOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL. \nBILLY They're on the other side of that wall. \nThe Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM. \nTOMMY Anybody see them? \nROCKY Activating Power Scope! \nA SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye. \nP.O.V.  - THROUGH POWER TRACKER \nWe see HEAT SENSOR OUTLINES, PULSATING WITH COLOR.  COMMAND GRAPHIC:  SEARCH MODE. \nLines VECTOR and SCAN as Rocky searches the area.  Eventually he looks up and the lines LOCK ON TO THE PULSATING FORMS  OF THE RATS. \nROCKY THEY'RE ABOVE US!! \nThe creatures LEAP DOWN and we see the Rangers pull off KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it. \nOne of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt \nAISHA Hey, handsome! \nA beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes. \nAISHA My mistake. \nShe follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW -- the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT. \nRocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes after him. \nTOMMY SABA SABER? \nThe talking Saber appears in Tommy's hand. \nSABA (yawning) What a DREAM I was having! \nTOMMY We've got company. \nSaba sees the rats. \nAdam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble. \nADAM Guys! \nThe kids quickly uncover the battered robot. \nBILLY Alpha, are you okay?! \nALPHA 5 I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!! \nBILLY He must've blown an anitromic demodulator! \nKIMBERLY (stunned) Oh, no... \nEverybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions coming over them. \nLaying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty years. \nThe kids stand over him, forlorn. \nAISHA ... What's happening to him?' \nBILLY Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate! \nKIMBERLY We have to help him! \nZordon opens his eyes. \nZORDON ...  Rangers... thank goodness you're safe. \nThe kids drop down beside him. \nTOMMY We have to get you back inside your time warp. \nZORDON I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons...  all of it. (beat) The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more. \nThe kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand. \nKIMBERLY Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to  us  all.- \nZORDON ... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once...  and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through. \nZordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha. \nBILLY what're we going to do? \nALPHA 5 I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am! \nBilly opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment. Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze. \nALPHA 5 Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!! \nSPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.  He SNIFFS. \nALPHA 5 Thanks, Billy. \nRocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area. \nADAM There has to be something we can do. \nTOMMY Come on, guys, think! \nAisha turns to Alpha. \nAISHA Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all? \nALPHA 5 ... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power. \nADAM What?! \nALPHA 5 ... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension. \nTOMMY How can we get to it? \nALPHA 5 As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain. \nROCKY We have to try, Alpha.  It's our only hope. \nRITA Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! \nZEDD How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! \nIVAN Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. (arms out in trademark stance) The \"booger man\" is taking over. \nIvan drops regally into Zedd's chair. \nZEDD Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives! \nMordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield. \nMORDANT Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week! \nZedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS. \nIVAN Ooooh, that tickles! \nIvan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR. \nIVAN My turn. \nHe ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE. \nMordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!! \nRita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE. \nRITA This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened. \nIvan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant. \nIVAN Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs. \nMordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan. \nGOLDAR We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place. \nMORDANT Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention... \nGoldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him. \nGOLDAR (apologetic) He's just visiting for the summer. (beat) Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one? \nIVAN Ah yes, the RANGERS!!! \nHe makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR, \nMORDANT Gasunteidt. \nNow the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS. \nTHEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until... \nIVAN SHUT YOUR BEAKS !! \nThe Tengu fall dead silent. \nIVAN Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART! \nThe creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS. \nIVAN Mordant, go with them and report back to me! \nMORDANT You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave-- \nOne of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF LIKE COLOSSAL BATS. \nMORDANT IIIIIII!!! \nANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE \nZedd waves his arms around in outrage. \nZEDD Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! \nRITA From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! \nIVAN Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer. \nGOLDAR You want me to place a few calls? \nIvan shakes his head. \nIVAN No need.   I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove. \nGOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose. \nGOLDAR No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. \nIVAN Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. (beat) Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?! \nIvan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out. \nGOLDAR But boss, what about their parents? \nIVAN Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire. \nBulk and Skull enter waving a \"help wanted\" flier.  Both them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses. \nSKULL I understand you're looking for a few new assistants. \nBulk does a G.Q. stance. \nBULK Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best. \nIvan doesn't look too pleased. \nIVAN What is this?!  I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants! \nSkull extends his hand. \nSKULL Hi, I'm brilliant. \nBULK (hand extended) And I'm good looking. \nIvan steps forward. \nIVAN And I'm Little-Bo-Peep. \nBulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard. \nSKULL Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over? \nBULK A stellar idea, Skull. \nThey start to back away. \nIVAN Not so fast, greaseballs. \nGoldar blocks their way. \nIVAN You'll have to do. \n34   thru   38   OMITTED \n39   EXT.  PHAEDOS JUNGLE - DAY                          39 \nThe Rangers move through foreboding jungle terrain, their ears alert to all the UNEARTHLY SOUNDS around them.  Tommy watches Kimberly, who seems to be lost in thought. \nTOMMY Hey. \nKimberly glances up. \nTOMMY You okay? \nKimberly takes a moment to answer. \nKIMBERLY I was just thinking about Zordon...  everything we've been through together. \nAISHA You know, meeting Zordon... teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. \nROCKY It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us. \nADAM ... He's gonna make it, guys. \nSuddenly a CRACKLING ELECTRICAL CURRENT RUNS OVER HIS ENTIRE BODY.  His face goes blank and his eyes momentarily GLOWS PURPLE.  Now he strides purposefully out the door. \n43C   thru   47   OMITTED \n48   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                   48 \nDulcea and the Rangers are gathered around a bird-bath stand with FLAMES leaping out of it. \nDULCEA In the language of the Nathadians, \"Nin\" stands for \"man\", \"jetti\" stands for \"animal\".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one. (beat) Now, put your hands inside the flame. \nAISHA Yeah, right. \nDULCEA It will not harm you. \nThe kids hesitate a moment, then reluctantly put their hands inside the flame.  Aisha makes a horrific expression... \nAISHA Just kidding. \nThey remove their hands -- they're filled with sand. \nAISHA Wow.  Sand. \nDULCEA Now tell me... what do you see? \nAisha studies the sand for a moment -- it MAGICALLY TAKE ON THE SHAPE OF A BEAR. \nAISHA (bedazzled) I see... a bear \nDULCEA Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold. \nAISHA Stylin'! \nDulcea turns to Rocky.  His sand MAGICALLY TAKES ON THE SHAPE OF AN APE. \nROCKY I see... an Ape. \nDULCEA Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape. \nWe see each of them DISCOVER THEIR ANIMAL. \nBILLY I see... a fox \nDULCEA Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift. \nAnd now Kimberly.  She studies hers for a moment.  It looks like a bird. \nKIMBERLY I think its some kind of bird. \nDULCEA Kimberly, you are the Crane, agile and sublime. \nNow Adam. \nADAM That's gotta be a frog. \nDULCEA Adam, you are the Frog, quick as lightning. \nAnd finally, Tommy. \nTOMMY It's... an eagle? \nDULCEA Look closer. \nTOMMY ... A falcon? \nDULCEA Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky. \nKimberly regards Dulcea with true admiration. \nKIMBERLY \nHow do you know so much about the Ninjetti? \nDulcea stands tall and proud. \nDULCEA I... am the sole living descendant of the \"Nathadians\". (beat) Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal. \n48A   INT.  KELMAN HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  -  DAY   (OLD SC 44)    48A \nDulcea and Billy circle one another, fighting with spinning WHISTLING sticks. \nDulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't. \nDULCEA The wolf relies on it's enhanced senses to guide it...  He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell. \nBilly takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every blow. \nNow Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER. \n54B   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                    54B \nDulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING INSECTS. \nDULCEA The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye. \nWe hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect dart around her. \nTHWAP!  The TRILLING SOUND is gone.  Dulcea has literally caught the insect in the blink of an eye.  Adam shakes his head in disbelief. \nHe waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a insect zip around him.  He lashes out numerous times, missing the insect completely. \nTHWUMP!  With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his snout.  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH. \nAdam speaks under his breath. \nADAM Show off. \n54C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 52)    54C \nAisha watches as Dulcea goes into a bear stance. \nDULCEA The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. \nSnoggle CHARGES Dulcea, SLAMS INTO HER.  She remains as rooted as a tree.  Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily damage. \nAISHA Girl, you've got to be kidding me. \nSnoggle recovers and faces Aisha.  Aisha shrugs, goes into a bear stance.  Snoggle charges, SLAMS INTO HER and sends HER FLYING! \n54D   thru   54E   OMITTED \n54F   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                  54F \nDulcea and Tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of a dark lake. \nDULCEA The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it. \nNow Dulcea does the impossible.  She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding rock.  Tommy is stunned. \nDULCEA (calling out) JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE! \nTommy psyches himself up. \nTOMMY You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this... \nHe spreads his arms out, LEAPS... and DROPS LIKE A ROCK exploding into THE BLACK WATER. \n54G   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT      (OLD SC 54E)     54G \nAlpha fusses over Zordon, who is looking a good ten years older. \nZORDON ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers... \nALPHA 5 I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen. \nZORDON ... We must try to communicate with them. \nAlpha looks out over the decimated Command Center. \nALPHA 5 Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink. \nZordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.  Alpha watches over his mentor, shakes his head in anguish. \nALPHA Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi . \n55   OMITTED \n55C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT             55C \nThe Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the trees, causing the branches to shiver. \nAfter a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly, amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the \nmoonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE. \nHe surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze. Billy stirs slightly. \nThe embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame. \nThere's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy with its piercing eyes. \nWe hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS: \nNow a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING \nNow we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER. \nNow, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT. \n55D    EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT  (PART OLD SC 55B)     55D \nIvan and Goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging. \nIVAN Let's pick it up here!  I've got a schedule to keep.  In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan! \nGoldar suddenly point to the sky. \nGOLDAR Hey, boss! \nTHE TENGU DROPS INTO THE SCENE, SQUEALING \nMORDANT What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky \nIVAN How did you fare? \nMordant waves Ivan off. \nMORDANT Oh, it couldn't've gone better. The Power Rangers didn't know what hit them . \nThe Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures. \nMORDANT That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! \nIVAN So they've been destroyed? \nThe Tengu SQUAWKS some more. \nMORDANT \"Basically\". \nIVAN What do you mean \"basically\"? \nMORDANT Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere! \nMORDANT Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. But you should've seen the size of his STICKS \nA pensive look comes over Ivan... \nIVAN Did these sticks make a whistling sound? \nMORDANT How'd you know? \nIVAN Dulcea! (beat) That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!! \nTo help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground. \nIVAN How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED! \nOne of the Tengu SCREECHES again. \nMORDANT What're you talking about?!  It wasn't my fault!  You're the featherbrains that let them get away! \nIvan looks up to the sky. \nIVAN I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold! \nThe kids are thrown by this. \nKIMBERLY You're leaving us?! \nDULCEA I have taught you all that I know.   Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own. \nThe kids share glances, not quite knowing what to say. \nDULCEA It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it. \nBILLY What's a Triac? \nDULCEA About twenty seconds in your time. \nTOMMY And how do we release the power? \nDULCEA The legend goes that you release the power with the power. \nADAM What does that mean! \nDULCEA That is a question that even I cannot answer. (beat) Remember, ten triacs.  After that something bad will happen. \nKIMBERLY Like...how bad? \nDulcea gives them a grim look. \nDULCEA They say the power will throw off a super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone. \nAisha nods. \nAISHA That's pretty bad. \nTOMMY Thank you, Dulcea.

Our thermionic-sensors have been hit by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil! \nZORDON Rangers, you must act swiftly. The planet is in GRAVE danger! \nKIMBERLY Danger from what? \nZORDON Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. Finally, a rebel factor known as the \"Order of the Meledon\" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground. \nALPHA 5 In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove. \nZORDON The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released! \n", "test1_id": 3111, "test2_input": "KIMBERLY The lady asked you a question. \nTOMMY Huh ...

We are all in mortal danger! \nShe moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each other. \nDULCEA Let' s go. \nThe Rangers quickly follow her through the brush Aisha turns to Kimberly, speaks under her breath. \nAISHA Kind of bossy, isn't she? \n39A..

It's an ooze free-for-all. \nIVAN Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes. This ain't sludge and this ain't guck... this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy.  But best of all it's FREE! \nBulk and Skull run a booth.   A banner screams \"OOZE RULES\". Kids crowd around. \nBULK Here you go!  No pushing! \nSKULL There's enough for everybody! \nFred approaches. \nFRED So where'd this guy come from? \nBulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks. \nSKULL Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information. \nBULK If we told you -- we'd have to kill you. \nFred looks at the container in his hand but he doesn't open it.

Not bad. \nTOMMY Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time. \nDulcea looks to Tommy. \nDULCEA What do you know of the Great Power? \nKIMBERLY Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze. \nDulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger. \nDULCEA It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible. \nBILLY Where did it originate? \nDULCEA In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the \"Nathadians\", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. (ominous) For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished. \nDulcea's words hang heavily in the air. \nAISHA So how can we get to it? \nDULCEA The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being... \nTOMMY And how do we do that? \nDULCEA By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. (beat) It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit. \nROCKY Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live.  And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack.  We don't have TIME for this. \nAs Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way over Kimberly's shoulder.  She hasn't noticed it yet. \nDULCEA You don't understand.  If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy  you. (beat) To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle.  We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow. \nThe snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she SCREAMS FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH. \nINCLUDE - A TERRIFIED SNOGGLE. \nThis is Dulcea's ant-eater like assistant.

Aisha stares at the cube a moment. \nAISHA Ah... thanks. \nThe other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squibs above his mouth and drops it in.

Where are everybody's parents? \nBulk and Skull exchange a look. \nSKULL Like we said before, that's classified, top secret... \nFred decides to be tricky. \nFRED Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them. \nBULK Well, why didn't you say so?! \nSKULL They're at the World Center Construction Site. \nFred nods. \nFRED Uh.

All of them start eating the berries. \nTOMMY Dulcea... how do you and Zordon know each other? \nDulcea reminisces. \nDULCEA We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the \"Order of the Meledan\". (beat) Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today. \nThe kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing. \nROCKY So...  what happened? \nDULCEA Over time our enemies were defeated...  I returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere. (beat) Until you kids showed up, I hadn't heard from him for centuries. \nThe Rangers are silent for a moment. \nDULCEA He was always an inspiration... \nDulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity. \nDULCEA This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith.  That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti. (beat) If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow. \nThese words strike deep in the kids. \n59   EXT.

Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat.  The injured workman was quoted as saying... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL A CAFE. \nThe Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts moves. \nTOMMY It's one smooth move and then you've gotta explode off the top. \nTommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Fred is wowed.  He drops into position. \nTOMMY Nice and easy. \nALPHA 5 To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices. \nZORDON Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension. \n16   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT \nBarricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his coffee. \nBZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature named MORDANT appear. \nRITA Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel.  Why didn't I listen to her?! \nZedd grumbles to himself. \nZEDD That's a good question. \nThe stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy. \nFIRST SECURITY GUARD Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna take a look at this. \nKurt looks up groggily. \nZEDD No need to wake him.  In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself. \nZedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are knocked out. \nGoldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg. \nMORDANT Hey bonehead, get off my hoof! \nGoldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the glowing egg shape. \nZEDD After two thousand years of searching...  I have finally found you. \nMordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again. \nMORDANT Yo, earth to Bigfoot! \nGoldar SWATS Mordant. \nGOLDAR Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball! \nZEDD SILENCE! \nRITA (to  Goldar) Where did you FIND this rabid little rodent, anyway?! \nGOLDAR Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side.  He`s just visiting for the summer. \nRITA Well put a muzzle on him! \nMordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE. \nWhen the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o the sticky substance. \nRITA What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of SNOT! \nAs if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita are too busy arguing to notice this. \nZEDD Don't you ever have anything nice to say?! \nRITA Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you! \nWe hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd. \nMORDANT Boss. \nZEDD For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot ! \nRITA You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?! \nMORDANT Boss. \nZEDD WHAT! \nZedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of GLISTENING SILVER. \nHe stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts his hands on his head, CRACKS it. \nSECURITY GUARD You had me scared there. \nAISHA Makes two of us. \nKIMBERLY You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around? \nSECURITY GUARD The only thing I've seen is you teenagers.

Not much has changed in six thousand years. \nKIMBERLY we're not just teenagers, raisin- head. \nTOMMY We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! \nIvan puts his hands to his face in mock fear. \nIVAN Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?. \nHe looks them over reproachfully. \nIVAN Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work.  And speaking of rats... \nIvan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS. \nNow, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN SIZED RAT-BEASTS. \nIVAN From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO EXIST! \nIvan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SKY. \nIVAN WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE! \nAn EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN. \nROCKY He's  gone. \nThe RATS ATTACK! \nADAM Let's take these beasts!! \nTommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE HANDSWORD.

Ivan is on his way here! \nALPHA 5 Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin! \nThere's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through the hairline cracks in the door. \nALPHA 5 Well...  ALMOST nobody. \nThe ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings. \nIVAN Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice. \nAlpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES then LUNGES. \nALPHA 5 HI ,  YAH ! \nIvan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge Alpha starts spinning. \nALPHA  5 Welcome to Wiener World.  May I take your order, please? \nZORDON You haven't changed, Ooze.

The rats immediately scurry off. \nTOMMY Let's teach these vermin a few manners. \nAISHA Activating Power Beam! \nA YELLOW BEAM SLICES THROUGH THE DARKNESS.  Aisha leads the group through the site. \nKIMBERLY Everybody stay alert. \n(CONTINUED) - NEXT FILE PAGES 21 ONWARDS \n20   CONTINUED:  (2)                                           20 \nThey pass a bulldozer, some scaffolding \nADAM Hold it... \nThey come to a stop. \nADAM (pointing) I heard something over there. \nBILLY Activating Audio Enhancer! \nAN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE. \nSOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL. \nBILLY They're on the other side of that wall. \nThe Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM. \nTOMMY Anybody see them? \nROCKY Activating Power Scope! \nA SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye. \nP.O.V.  - THROUGH POWER TRACKER \nWe see HEAT SENSOR OUTLINES, PULSATING WITH COLOR.  COMMAND GRAPHIC:  SEARCH MODE. \nLines VECTOR and SCAN as Rocky searches the area.  Eventually he looks up and the lines LOCK ON TO THE PULSATING FORMS  OF THE RATS. \nROCKY THEY'RE ABOVE US!! \nThe creatures LEAP DOWN and we see the Rangers pull off KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it. \nOne of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt \nAISHA Hey, handsome! \nA beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes. \nAISHA My mistake. \nShe follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW -- the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT. \nRocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes after him. \nTOMMY SABA SABER? \nThe talking Saber appears in Tommy's hand. \nSABA (yawning) What a DREAM I was having! \nTOMMY We've got company. \nSaba sees the rats. \nAdam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble. \nADAM Guys! \nThe kids quickly uncover the battered robot. \nBILLY Alpha, are you okay?! \nALPHA 5 I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!! \nBILLY He must've blown an anitromic demodulator! \nKIMBERLY (stunned) Oh, no... \nEverybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions coming over them. \nLaying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty years. \nThe kids stand over him, forlorn. \nAISHA ... What's happening to him?' \nBILLY Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate! \nKIMBERLY We have to help him! \nZordon opens his eyes. \nZORDON ...  Rangers... thank goodness you're safe. \nThe kids drop down beside him. \nTOMMY We have to get you back inside your time warp. \nZORDON I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons...  all of it. (beat) The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more. \nThe kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand. \nKIMBERLY Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to  us  all.- \nZORDON ... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once...  and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through. \nZordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha. \nBILLY what're we going to do? \nALPHA 5 I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am! \nBilly opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment. Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze. \nALPHA 5 Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!! \nSPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.  He SNIFFS. \nALPHA 5 Thanks, Billy. \nRocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area. \nADAM There has to be something we can do. \nTOMMY Come on, guys, think! \nAisha turns to Alpha. \nAISHA Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all? \nALPHA 5 ... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power. \nADAM What?! \nALPHA 5 ... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension. \nTOMMY How can we get to it? \nALPHA 5 As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain. \nROCKY We have to try, Alpha.  It's our only hope. \nRITA Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! \nZEDD How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! \nIVAN Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. (arms out in trademark stance) The \"booger man\" is taking over. \nIvan drops regally into Zedd's chair. \nZEDD Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives! \nMordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield. \nMORDANT Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week! \nZedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS. \nIVAN Ooooh, that tickles! \nIvan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR. \nIVAN My turn. \nHe ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE. \nMordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!! \nRita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE. \nRITA This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened. \nIvan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant. \nIVAN Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs. \nMordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan. \nGOLDAR We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place. \nMORDANT Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention... \nGoldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him. \nGOLDAR (apologetic) He's just visiting for the summer. (beat) Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one? \nIVAN Ah yes, the RANGERS!!! \nHe makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR, \nMORDANT Gasunteidt. \nNow the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS. \nTHEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until... \nIVAN SHUT YOUR BEAKS !! \nThe Tengu fall dead silent. \nIVAN Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART! \nThe creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS. \nIVAN Mordant, go with them and report back to me! \nMORDANT You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave-- \nOne of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF LIKE COLOSSAL BATS. \nMORDANT IIIIIII!!! \nANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE \nZedd waves his arms around in outrage. \nZEDD Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! \nRITA From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! \nIVAN Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer. \nGOLDAR You want me to place a few calls? \nIvan shakes his head. \nIVAN No need.   I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove. \nGOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose. \nGOLDAR No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. \nIVAN Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. (beat) Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?! \nIvan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out. \nGOLDAR But boss, what about their parents? \nIVAN Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire. \nBulk and Skull enter waving a \"help wanted\" flier.  Both them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses. \nSKULL I understand you're looking for a few new assistants. \nBulk does a G.Q. stance. \nBULK Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best. \nIvan doesn't look too pleased. \nIVAN What is this?!  I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants! \nSkull extends his hand. \nSKULL Hi, I'm brilliant. \nBULK (hand extended) And I'm good looking. \nIvan steps forward. \nIVAN And I'm Little-Bo-Peep. \nBulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard. \nSKULL Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over? \nBULK A stellar idea, Skull. \nThey start to back away. \nIVAN Not so fast, greaseballs. \nGoldar blocks their way. \nIVAN You'll have to do. \n34   thru   38   OMITTED \n39   EXT.

We are all in mortal danger! \nShe moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each other. \nDULCEA Let' s go. \nThe Rangers quickly follow her through the brush Aisha turns to Kimberly, speaks under her breath. \nAISHA Kind of bossy, isn't she? \n39A..

He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell. \nBilly takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every blow. \nNow Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER. \n54B   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                    54B \nDulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING INSECTS. \nDULCEA The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye. \nWe hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect dart around her. \nTHWAP!  The TRILLING SOUND is gone.  Dulcea has literally caught the insect in the blink of an eye.  Adam shakes his head in disbelief. \nHe waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a insect zip around him.  He lashes out numerous times, missing the insect completely. \nTHWUMP!  With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his snout.  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH. \nAdam speaks under his breath. \nADAM Show off. \n54C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 52)    54C \nAisha watches as Dulcea goes into a bear stance. \nDULCEA The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. \nSnoggle CHARGES Dulcea, SLAMS INTO HER.  She remains as rooted as a tree.  Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily damage. \nAISHA Girl, you've got to be kidding me. \nSnoggle recovers and faces Aisha.  Aisha shrugs, goes into a bear stance.

She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding rock.  Tommy is stunned. \nDULCEA (calling out) JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE! \nTommy psyches himself up. \nTOMMY You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this... \nHe spreads his arms out, LEAPS... and DROPS LIKE A ROCK exploding into THE BLACK WATER. \n54G   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT      (OLD SC 54E)     54G \nAlpha fusses over Zordon, who is looking a good ten years older. \nZORDON ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers... \nALPHA 5 I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen. \nZORDON ... We must try to communicate with them. \nAlpha looks out over the decimated Command Center. \nALPHA 5 Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink. \nZordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.  Alpha watches over his mentor, shakes his head in anguish. \nALPHA Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi . \n55   OMITTED \n55C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT             55C \nThe Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the trees, causing the branches to shiver. \nAfter a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly, amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the \nmoonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE. \nHe surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze. Billy stirs slightly. \nThe embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame. \nThere's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy with its piercing eyes. \nWe hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS: \nNow a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING \nNow we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER. \nNow, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT. \n55D    EXT.

These clowns are a menace to the sky \nIVAN How did you fare? \nMordant waves Ivan off. \nMORDANT Oh, it couldn't've gone better. The Power Rangers didn't know what hit them . \nThe Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures. \nMORDANT That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! \nIVAN So they've been destroyed? \nThe Tengu SQUAWKS some more. \nMORDANT \"Basically\". \nIVAN What do you mean \"basically\"? \nMORDANT Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere! \nMORDANT Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. But you should've seen the size of his STICKS \nA pensive look comes over Ivan... \nIVAN Did these sticks make a whistling sound? \nMORDANT How'd you know? \nIVAN Dulcea! (beat) That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!! \nTo help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground. \nIVAN How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED! \nOne of the Tengu SCREECHES again. \nMORDANT What're you talking about?!  It wasn't my fault!  You're the featherbrains that let them get away! \nIvan looks up to the sky. \nIVAN I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold! \nVOICE We love you Ivan! \nIVAN Right back at ya!- (he smiles) Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?! \nCROWD NOT US! \nIVAN AND WHO MISSES RULES?! \nCROWD NOT US! \nIVAN AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN RAISING HELL ACROSS  THE UNIVERSE?! \nCROWD \nWE DO! \nAt the edge, Fred discreetly approaches Bulk and Skull. \nFRED Can I have a word with you guys?

Where are everybody's parents? \nBulk and Skull exchange a look. \nSKULL Like we said before, that's classified, top secret... \nFred decides to be tricky. \nFRED Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them. \nBULK Well, why didn't you say so?! \nSKULL They're at the World Center Construction Site. \nFred nods. \nFRED Uh.

All of them start eating the berries. \nTOMMY Dulcea... how do you and Zordon know each other? \nDulcea reminisces. \nDULCEA We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the \"Order of the Meledan\". (beat) Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today. \nThe kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing. \nROCKY So...  what happened? \nDULCEA Over time our enemies were defeated...  I returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere. (beat) Until you kids showed up, I hadn't heard from him for centuries. \nThe Rangers are silent for a moment. \nDULCEA He was always an inspiration... \nDulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity. \nDULCEA This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith.  That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti. (beat) If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow. \nThese words strike deep in the kids. \n59   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY                    59 \nThe bulldozers and earth movers have dug out a twenty foot pit. IVAN leads Goldar and Mordant through the site, passing dozens of laboring parents. \nMORDANT As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?! \nGOLDAR How about Major Moron? \nThe Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST. \nROCKY LOOK OUT! \nRocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt. \nAdam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily. \nADAM The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out... \nSuddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move. \nADAM ... in the blink of an eye. \nTommy steps up behind a Tengu. \nTOMMY Yo, Tweety! \nThe Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING- HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear stance. \nAISHA The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. \nThe Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS. \nAISHA Bye, bye birdy. \nKimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe. \nShe finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE. \nIn a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly back on the swinging bridge. \nKIMBERLY Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird! \nBilly swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak -- the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS! \nBILLY AIM FOR THEIR BEAKS! \nTommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making a KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.  TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS AS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER. \nRocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature is OBLITERATED. \nTommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  They BOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS. \nThe Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES, SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky. \nAISHA It's up to you. \nRocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position. Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye. \nROCKY Polly wanna cracker? \nWith that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION. \nKIMBERLY ALL RIGHT, ROCKY! \nInstantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in rage.

I'm afraid you're too late. \nAISHA What?! \nALPHA 5 Zordon...  he's gone. \nThe Rangers are too stunned to speak.  They approach Zordon's lifeless form looking absolutely devastated. \nKIMBERLY ... This can't be... \nThey stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.  They're utterly defeated. \nEventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent voice. \nTOMMY \"To those who possess the Great Power...   all things are possible.\" \nThe kids gradually exchange zealous looks.  They form a circle around Zordon and interlock hands. \nThey close their eyes, bow their heads... \nAfter a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN FROM THE RANGERS, INTO ZORDON'S ASTRAL FORM. \nZordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING, STROBOSCOPIC EXPLOSION. \nWhen the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS ORIGINAL, PRISTINE FORM. \nZordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride. \nRANGERS ZORDON!! \nZORDON Welcome back, kids. \nADAM It's good to be back. \nAlpha jumps up and down like a child. \nALPHA 5 HE'S ALIVE!

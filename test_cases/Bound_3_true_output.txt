They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing arm until -- 
He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up. 
Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun when -- 
Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer. 
VIOLET Stop! 
Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun still out of reach. 
VIOLET It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey. He's on his way. 
Violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on him as he rises from the floor. 
Panting, Caesar watches her like a mad dog. 
VIOLET Get out of here, Caesar.  If you want to live you had better start running. 
He smiles. 
CAESAR All these years and you still don't know me, Violet. 
She glances down and sees the paint-covered gun. 
CAESAR But I know you. 
He turns to the gun. 
VIOLET Caesar, don't. 
CAESAR What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't. 
VIOLET Caesar, you don't know shit. 
Violet fires -- 
The bullet hits Caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off balance.  Another doubles him over as blood speckles the pool of paint. 
She empties the gun into him.  His body arcs back, falling, splashing into the paint. 
Caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening white. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY 
It is empty and clean.  In the bedroom, only a few hangers are left dangling in the open closet. 
EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY 
Mickey is standing with Violet, next to his Lincoln Town Car. 
VIOLET I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police. 
MICKEY I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will. 
VIOLET I know you will. 
MICKEY Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands. 
VIOLET Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this. 
Mickey nods. 
VIOLET But thanks.  Thanks for everything. 
She hugs him and he kisses her.  Then he gets in his car. Violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free. 
EXT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT 
Corky sitting on stoop, patient, like a rock. 
She looks up as she hears high heels, and smiles at -- 
Violet standing there, new outfit. 
Corky stands in front of her. 
CORKY Hey. 
VIOLET Hey. 
CORKY How'd it go? 
VIOLET I'm here, aren't I? 
Corky nods. 
CORKY I guess we should get out of here. 
Violet nods.

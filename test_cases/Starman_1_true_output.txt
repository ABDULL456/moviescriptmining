LYMAN This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns. 
SHERMIN Give it a rest, Lyman. 
MAJOR BELL (after a pause) I've never once heard of anybody being hurt by an extraterrestrial... 
Shermin goes hand over hand along the overhead straps to the radio operator. He begins to flip through a stack of telex messages. 
LYMAN That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you. 
SHERMIN (to technician, after a look at Lyman) Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that? 
TECHNICIAN No, but there sure were a lot of people who saw lights in the sky last night. Reports are still coming in. 
MAJOR BELL (under above) I've heard of blood being drawn, sometimes they were taken for a ride in the ship, a lot of times they said they had sex... But nobody was ever hurt... 
LYMAN But you decided those weren't real. This one is. 
There is a buzz and a red dot appears in the center of one of the screens. 
LYMAN (over his shoulder to Shermin) Fox. 
He taps a three digit code and Fox comes into view. 
FOX I've got something for you. 
A photograph of a very thin slab of yellow plastic pops up on a second screen next to Fox. Above lines of glowing colored dots are symbols of a hydrogen atom, pulsars, a nude man and a woman and Earth's position in our solar system. 
FOX Recognize this? 
MAJOR BELL It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes. 
FOX Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit. 
MAJOR BELL They must have picked it up in space. 
SHERMIN Then it's not an accident that they found us. 
FOX We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact. 
SHERMIN Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming? 
FOX We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for. 
SHERMIN That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us. 
FOX We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time. 
SHERMIN Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone. 
FOX You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck. 
The television screen is reduced to static. Lyman shuts it off. 
RADAR TECHNICIAN You get the feeling we're expendable? 
SHERMIN We always were. 
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
We are looking through the living room window at Jenny watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the light-fall in the back yard watching her. 
A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have financing...' ... 
We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate. 
STAR MAN (practicing the human sound) Wehave... (more precise) Wehave... (well-formed) Wehave... 
Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads upstairs. Half way up she stops. 
JENNY (faint through the glass) Damn! 
She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer in the shadows. 
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches in Jenny's throat. 
STAR MAN (precise) Wehave... 
Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the chain holds. 
The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the panel on his chest and the identification light comes on inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a mittened hand over her mouth. 
STAR MAN Wehave... 
Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN takes his hand away from her mouth. 
JENNY Please don't hurt me... please... please.

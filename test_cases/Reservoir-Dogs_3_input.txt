FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY 
We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN. 
FREDDY (O.S.) Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me.  He says I should just hang around my apartment and wait for a phone call.  Well after waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin phone, he calls me last night and says Joe's ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen minutes. 
The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed and says: 
HOLDAWAY Woo all picked you up? 
From here to end we cut back and forth. 
FREDDY Nice Guy.  When we got to the bar... 
HOLDAWAY ...What bar? 
FREDDY The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony name.  My name's Mr. Orange. 
HOLDAWAY You ever seen this motherfucker before? 
FREDDY Who, Mr. White? 
HOLDAWAY Yeah. 
FREDDY No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well. 
HOLDAWAY How can you tell? 
FREDDY The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies. 
HOLDAWAY Did the two of you talk? 
FREDDY Me and Mr. White? 
HOLDAWAY Yeah. 
FREDDY A little. 
HOLDAWAY What about? 
FREDDY The Brewers. 
HOLDAWAY The Milwaukee Brewers? 
FREDDY Yeah.  They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em. 
HOLDAWAY Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face. 
Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger. 
HOLDAWAY (with his mouth full) What kinds questions did Cabot ask? 
FREDDY Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that. 
Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He motions for Freddy to elaborate.

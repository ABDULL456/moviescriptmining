"ERIN" You remember the house rules? 
JOE With Gracie here? Who can forget? They hold hands. 
"ERIN" Joe. 
JOE Yeah. 
"ERIN" You ever think about what would've happened...(if you and I had...) 
JOE Yeah. 
"ERIN" What do you think? Beat. 
JOE I think Gracie is truly a great kid, and any path that doesn't include her doesn't make any sense. "Erin" nods. Beat. 
"ERIN" Ginny told me about that weekend. 
JOE Of your wedding? She nods. 
JOE She tell you how terrible I was? 
"ERIN" Joe. This routine? It might work on other people, but you forget: I've actually had you - 
JOE I didn't forget - 
"ERIN" (like a compliment's coming) - and I'm telling you, from memory... 
(DRY TEASE) you are not that bad... They both laugh. It subsides into affection... 
"ERIN" You really go tomorrow...? He nods. 
"ERIN" (CONT.) Couldn't you quit your job, and stay here and play the horses or something and become independently wealthy? 
Beat. 
JOE Please kiss me, Slim. I know we're not supposed to, it's against house rules and all, but for me to come all this way and feel the way I do and for us to not even - She kisses him - And he kisses back. And they stop. Incredible self control. Lie next to each other-hold hands again... 
JOE You're a great person, Slim. You're a great person just like your daughter. She squeezes his hand. THE CAMERA LINGERS FOR A MOMENT ON THIS SWEET IMAGE... clasped hands...THEN PULLS SUDDENLY BACK, so we're seeing their hands from outside, through a crack in the window. Hold. 
CUT TO: YOU CAN RUNs s s 
EXT. PRESCHOOL. DAY. 
From an odd distance across the street, we watch "Erin" dropping off "Queen E." Extend the mundane details of this transaction... THREE DAYS LATER 
INT. DOUBLE "A" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. 
T.T. sticks her head in, to "Erin": 
T.T. I know you have a "back room" gig, but with Sher out, four customers: I need help here; I'm on meltdown. 
EXT. DOUBLE "A" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. 
We look. past a tree, through the windows...as "Erin" comes warily out to the counter, looks over the customers... 
INT. DOUBLE A RENT-A-CAR. COUNTER. LATER. DAY. 
"Erin" working a calculator, muttering in frustration... 
T.T. Here, lemme do that. As T.T. wrestles with the calculation, "Erin" looks up. Frowns slightly, her eyes shift... She senses something. This strange sensation, as if she's being watched, or... She looks out the window, doesn't see anyone... Glances into the back office - and notices the clock: 4:15. 
"ERIN" (runs for door) Oh my Godl, the Queen is out of dance class! I'll be back in 20 -

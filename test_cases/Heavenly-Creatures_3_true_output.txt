The outside light flicks on. Sound of footsteps stomping down the path. 
THE DOOR OPENS! 
PAULINE Bloody hell! 
John desperately tries to conceal himself beneath the bedcovers as . . . 
The light flicks on . . . HERBERT stands in the doorway. He surveys the situation with a grim expression. 
John rolls out of bed and staggers toward the door fumbling with his pyjama cord. 
HERBERT Go to the house. 
John scuttles out of the sleepout. Pauline lies still in bed, peering at her father. 
HERBERT (Upset) You have broken my heart, Yvonne. 
HERBERT turns and leaves the room. Pauline stares at the ceiling. 
PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I lay there mesmerised. It was just too frightful to believe . . . 
CUT TO: 
INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/DINING ROOM - MORNING BREAKFAST . . .A plate of Weetbix bangs down on the table in front of Pauline. Milk sloshes over the side of the bowl. HONORA looks thunderous and stomps off. 
PAULINE (Diary V.O.) When I got up I found Father had told Mother . . . 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal STEVE , Ross, a new boarder, LAURIE, and HERBERT seated around the table. The boarders are clearly oblivious to the tense family vibes. 
LAURIE Coming to Lancaster Park on Saturday, Mr. Rieper? 
HERBERT shakes his head, sullenly. 
Wendy hurries into the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat. 
WENDY Where's John? He said he'd walk with me. 
HONORA stands in the doorway. 
HONORA John's no longer staying here. 
Wendy looks surprised. 
LAURIE Shot through, this morning . . . said his old Mum had taken sick. 
INT. RIEPFRS' HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNINGPauline is washing dishes, up to her elbows in soapy water. Behind her HONORA tidies up, glowering at her daughter. 
PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture. 
HONORA (Angry) From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you. 
Pauline bangs a dish into the rack. 
HONORA (Angry) If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect? 
HONORA sighs. 
PAULINE Can I go now? 
HONORA grabs Pauline by the shoulders. 
HONORA You think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night! 
Pauline flinches. 
HONORA My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart! 
PAULINE Well, I guess I take after you then! 
HONORA whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek. 
PAULINE You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me! 
HONORA steps back. 
HONORA (Softly) You're going to be late. 
Pauline triumphantly walks past her mother. HONORA barely reacts as Pauline hurries out.

{"train": "EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES \nWritten by \nGus Van Sant \nBased on a novel by \nTom Robbins \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nINT. CAVE NIGHT \nThere is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one. It sits in a pool of water. In the water swim EYELESS CATFISH in geometric patterns. An underground stream feeds the pool of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse that on occasion emits a LOW RUMBLE. \nINDIANS with torches surround the hourglass, which now we can see is in a cave. And as soon as the acorns have finished passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on its opposite end. One of the Indians appears to be JAPANESE. \nONE INDIAN stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the CREVASSE. \nTHE CREVASSE RUMBLES once more, loosening a few chunks of rock from the cave. \nThe earth begins to shake. \nTHE CHART KEEPER She is restless tonight. \nANOTHER INDIAN She dreams of loving. \nSTILL ANOTHER She has the blues. \nView of the chartkeeper's drawings. One is of a crane with a very long neck. Another is a primitive drawing of a naked girl, who has long flowing hair. She also has, pointed out from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human proportions. A MUSICAL CHORUS sounds at the sight of this drawing of a girl with the thumbs. The chartkeeper puts the finishing touches on the drawing. \nAnd the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" strikes up on country and western guitar and polka-like accordion. title \nBIG THUMBS \nINT. RICHMOND VIRGINIA SUBURBAN HOME DAY \nWe see CANDLES burning on a cake. It is somebody's birthday. And there are six candles on the cake. \nSISSY HANKSHAW is six years old. \nHer DADDY and a visiting UNCLE, finishing their rendition of Happy Birthday, are staring down at Sissy and looking at her young THUMBS, WHICH ARE UNUSUALLY LARGE and twitch with a mind of their own. \nShe manages to blow out all six candles. \nUNCLE Well, you're lucky that you don't suck 'em. \nDirectly under the wrist where the watch band would be is written MADAME ZOE. \nMadam Zoe in kimono and wig lets Sissy and her mother in the door. \nMADAME ZOE I am the enlightened Madame Zoe. \nInside. Madame Zoe begins stubbing a cigarette in one of those enlightened little ceramic ashtrays that are shaped like bedpans and inscribed BUTTS. The trailer is cluttered, but not one knick-knack, chintz curtain or chenille-covered armchair seems to have come from the Beyond. \nMADAME ZOE There is nothing about your past, present or future that your hands do not know, and there is nothing about your hands that Madame Zoe does not know. There is no hocus-pocus involved. I am a scientist, not a magician. I, Madame Zoe, chiromancer, lifelong student of the moldings and markings of the human hand. I, Madame Zoe, to whom no facet of your character or destiny is not readily revealed. I am prepared to... \nThen she notices the thumbs. \nMADAME ZOE Jesus fucking Christ! \nMrs. Hankshaw and the fortune-teller turn pale and uncertain, while Sissy recognizes with a faint smile that she is in command. \nSissy extends the thumbs as an ailing aborigine might extend his swollen parts to a medical missionary. Sissy's mama draws a neatly folded five-dollar bill from her change purse and extends it alongside her smiling daughter's extremities. \nMadame Zoe returns to her senses, and takes Sissy by the elbow to sit at a For mica-topped table of undistinguished design. \nMadam Zoe holds Sissy's hands while she appears to go into a trance. \nShe opens her eyes momentarily. \nMADAME ZOE You have a strong will. Will power and determination are indicated by the first phalanx. The second phalanx indicates reason and logic. You obviously have both in large supply. What's your name, dearie? \nSISSY Sissy. \nMADAME ZOE Hmmm. I'd say that you have an intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic nature. However, Sissy, however, there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx- the phalanx of logic -- that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior, a refusal to accept responsibility or to take things seriously and bent to be disrespectful of those who do. Your mama tells me that you're pretty well behaved and shy, but I'd watch out for signs of irrationality. All right? \nShe pulls her thumb to her breast. \nMADAME ZOE I guess the most important aspect of your thumbs is the, ahem, over all size. Uh, what was it, do you know, that caused...? \nMom speaks out from the couch she is sitting on \nMRS HANKSHAW Don't know; the doctors don't know... \nSISSY Just lucky I guess. \nMADAME ZOE Do you study history in school? Galileo, Descartes, Newton? Lebinitz had very large thumbs; Voltaire's were enormous, but, heh heh, just pickles compared with yours. \nSISSY What about Crazy Horse? \nMADAME ZOE Crazy Horse? You mean the Indian? Nobody that I've ever heard of ever troubled to study the paws of savages. Well, I guess that about covers the three-fifty charge... \nMadame Zoe lets go of Sissy's thumbs and wipes her hands on her kimono. \nSISSY Right off, I don't remember how old I was when I found out I was part Indian. My mamma's family, a lot of them, had lived out West, in the Dakotas, and one of them had married a squaw. Siwash tribe. My pleasure in Indianhood and my passion for car travel might be incongruous if not mutually exclusive........ After all, the first car that ever stopped for me had been named in honor of the great chief of the Ottawa: Pontiac...... \nIn the distance, Sissy spies her destination. NEW YORK CITY. \nSISSY NEW YORK CITY. It's still a helluva town.... \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING DAY \nSissy gets out of the truck and looks up at a large building. \nINT. COUNTESS'S OFFICE DAY \nTHE COUNTESS Sit down dear, do sit down. \nSissy Hankshaw takes a seat. The Countess lifts a dusty decanter. \nTHE COUNTESS Take a load off those lovely tootsies. Yes, sit right down. Would you fancy some sherry? \nThe decanter is empty, a stiff fly lies feet up on it's lip. \nTHE COUNTESS Shit O goodness, I'm all out of sherry; how about some Red Ripple? \nHe reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk and pulls out some pop wine. \nTHE COUNTESS You know what Red Ripple is don't you? It's Kool-Aid with a hard on. Tee Hee. \nSissy manages a polite smile. She looks at a heavily finger printed glass. \nTHE COUNTESS (he toasts) To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you? \nSISSY Tired... \nTHE COUNTESS That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling. \nSISSY A born freak can only go uphill. \nTHE COUNTESS Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean. \nSISSY I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be. \nTHE COUNTESS Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever. \nSISSY Does that mean you might have an assignment for me? \nThe Countess taps his monocle with his cigarette holder. He looks on his wall, and on a poster advertising a feminine hygene product, Yoni Yum Dew Spray, stands Sissy Hankshaw, her thumbs neatly hidden, chopped off by the borders of the photograph. \nTHE COUNTESS You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see, (peruses the ad layouts on the wall) from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink. \nTHE COUNTESS Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman. \nSuddenly the Countess swivels in his desk chair and leans forward. Lowering his wine glass, he focuses directly, intensely into Sissy's blue eyes. His smile widens. \nTHE COUNTESS By the way, Sissy... he's a full blooded Indian. \nA title: \nCOWGIRL INTERLUDE \nINT. RUBBER ROSE OUTHOUSE DAY \nThe Outhouse Radio is playing \"The Starving Armenians Polka\" and Bonanza Jellybean and Delores del Ruby are in the privy, caught in the rain. \nJELLY Well, I'm not scared of a little rain. \nDELORES Me neither. \nJELLY Might as well brave it. \nDELORES Right. I don't know about you but I'm sure not sweet enough to melt. \nDelores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge in the privy and hits the photograph of Dale Evans upon which it has lit. \nJelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other cowgirls. \nThere is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip. Way off horse lips flutter. \nBonanza spies a picture of Sissy Hankshaw, an advertisement for Yoni Yum Dew Spray mist, on the privy wall. \nJELLY (musing) Someday...... if that Sissy Hankshaw ever shows up here, I'm gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken. Chickens are the easiest critters on Earth to hypnotize. If you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds, it's yours forever. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE DAY \nA meeting is in progression in the bunkhouse that morning. Mary is addressing the group. \nMARY I want to complain that some of the cowgirls have been sleeping two to a bunk again, in violation of the agreement that \"crimes against nature\" are to be confined to the hayloft. \nDEBBIE I don't care who lay with whom or where or how, but the moaners, groaners and screamers ought to turn down their volume when others are trying to sleep or meditate. \nSome of the younger cowgirls blush. \nBIG RED I want to complain about the food around here! It's rotten to the core. \nA round of support from the other cowgirls in the form of cattle calls. \nINT. OUTHOUSE DAY \nINT. CAB NIGHT \nCarla starts to pat Sissy's hand, then decides to leave the thumbs to themselves. \nThe six of them are squeezed into the taxi. Sissy looks out the window of the taxi: \nSISSY'S VIEW as the taxi stops at a light, she can see a newsstand headline on the front page of the New York Daily News: \nTHE CHINK SUMS IT UP, SAYS LIFE IS HARD IF YOU THINK IT'S HARD. \nEXT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT \nTHE TAXI stops in front of Julian's building. It discharges its passengers. \nINT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT \nINSIDE Howard mixes Scotch and sodas, Rupert fills a syringe from a vial of aminophylline he has taken from its place behind a gelatin salad mold in the refrigerator. He gives Julian an injection. \nRUPERT There, that ought to beat them bronchial buggers into submission. \nHe turns to Sissy. \nRUPERT I was a medic in the Army. I really should have become a doctor. Sometimes, though, I feel that pushing books is a whole lot like pushing medicine. Think of books as pills. I have pills that cure ignorance and pills that cure boredom. I have pills to elevate moods and pills to open people's eyes to the awful truth... \nCARLA Too bad you don't have a pill for bullshit. \nCarla smiles as if she were joking, but she'd said it tartly. Rupert glares and takes a big bite of Scotch. \nHOWARD (changing the subject) Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw? \nSISSY I'm staying with the Countess. \nHOWARD I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York? \nSISSY I don't. \nHOWARD You don't? \nSISSY Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving. \nEveryone looks a bit astonished including the recumbent Julian. \nHOWARD A traveler, eh? \nSISSY You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling. \nCARLA How do you think of it? \nMarie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom close to Sissy's. \nMARIE Mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly shaped. \nHOWARD Highly debatable. I'll wager they're the exact same size. \nHoward cups his left hand about a Marie breast and his right about one of Sissy's. He weighs them in his palms, squeezes them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a lettuce, and spreads his fingers to sample their circumference. \nHOWARD Hmm. Yours are larger, Marie, but Miss Hankshaw's -- Sissy's -- are more firm. You'd think they would have started to droop; I mean, from not wearing a bra. \nMARIE Howard! Watch your manners. You've made her blush. Here, Sissy, let me compare. \nMarie seizes Sissy's free breast, quickly, like a monkey picking a fruit, rolling it about in her hungry little finger, rubbing it against her chin and cheeks... \n...and... \n...it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker.... nostalgic..... tropical plums. \nSISSY (in ecstasy) This place is finer than the place I live! \nLike a disc jockey from Paradise, Howard flips Marie over and plays her B side. Every now and then she reaches for Sissy to include her, but the laws of physics insist on being obeyed. \nOver and over Marie calls Sissy's name with half-closed eyes. \nThe Barths are really going at it, Marie yowling like a cat. \nThe POODLE in the kitchen begins to growl. \nSISSY So this is what it's like... so this is what it's really like. \nINT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT \nSissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the living room and crawls under the cover with Julian. Julian stirs awake. \nJULIAN Oh, Sissy. I am sorry about all the fuss. \nJulian and Sissy embrace and go at it under the covers But suddenly: Julian stops after a brief climax. \nJULIAN (with downcast eyes) I apologize. \nSissy cradles Julian and comforts him. \nJULIAN It is the measure of Western Civilization that it can encompass in harmony, balance off, as it were, such divergent masterworks as A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and THE AMERICAN DREAM, as the dome of the Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of the Paris opera. \nSissy sits up, her eyes moping about the apartment, looking but not seeing the macrame wallhangings, the volumes of Robert Frost. \nJULIAN What's the matter? \nTHE COUNTESS It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language. \nJULIAN Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head. \nTHE COUNTESS Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you? \nJULIAN I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town. \nTHE COUNTESS She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed? \nJulian pauses for a very long moment. \nJULIAN How does she like what in bed? \nTHE COUNTESS Like what? \nThe Countess' teeth chatter in his mouth. \nTHE COUNTESS What do you think? \nJULIAN Well.... er... \nTHE COUNTESS Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on? \nJULIAN Oh, we didn't get it all the way on. \nTHE COUNTESS Whose fault was that? \nJULIAN I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault. \nTHE COUNTESS What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie. \nJULIAN If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.' \nTHE COUNTESS Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake. \nJULIAN What guy? \nTHE COUNTESS Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road. \nEXT. ROAD DAY \nSissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks. \nFrom the direction of the ranch a VW Microbus is approaching. It is painted with mandalas, lamaistic dorjes and symbols representing \"the clear light of the void.\" \nWhen the Microbus draws alongside Sissy it stops. Inside are two men and a woman. They are approximately twenty-four years old. \nMISS ADRIAN I'll tell you why, it's that plague of cowgirls. They've gradually infiltrated every sector of our program. The one named Debbie considers herself an expert on exercising and diet. With Bonanza Jellybean's permission and against my explicit orders, she's been coercing the guests into trying something called kundalini yoga. Do you know what that is? It's trying to mentally force a serpent of fire to crawl up your spinal column. Miss Hankshaw, our guests can't comprehend kundalini yoga, let alone do it. Yesterday, she ordered a new cookbook by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third Eye in the Kitchen: Himalayan Soul Food. God knows what that will be like. The little barbarians are destroying everything that I've built, mocking all that the company stands for. And there's a new one, one they call del Ruby. She has the good will of a scorpion. I've considered it prudent to avoid a confrontation that might further upset the guests. But now that the season is practically over -- we operate April through September -- and the Countess is finally coming... \nEXT. RUBBER ROSE DAY \nThe limousine pulls up in the drive. \nMISS ADRIAN'S VOICE Our Ranch has all the latest in modern facilities... \nINT. BEAUTY RANCH DAY \nWe see women having facials. \nMISS ADRIAN'S VOICE We have a facial wing, and next to that is the Hair Barn... \nINT. HAIR BARN DAY \nSissy is being given a tour by Miss Adrian. A variety of hairdos are witnessed. \nMISS ADRIAN We have a team of fifteen hair experts from all over the world. \nINT. EXERCISE ROOM DAY \nMISS ADRIAN And fanny flab flies off in this room at the rate of six hundred and seventy-five pounds a day... that's a lot of salted ham, Sissy.... \nINT. MAIN LODGE DAY \nSissy and Miss Adrian walk through the lodge lobby, guests and cowgirls are conducting a variety of activities: \nA BIRD EXPERT projects slides of whooping cranes on the wall and is giving a lecture about the habits of the birds. \nIn the center of the room COWGIRL DEBBIE is leading a mixture of cowgirls and guests in a meditative chant as they reach high above their heads in a yoga exercise. \nMiss Adrian stops in front of the registration desk and Sissy catches glimpses of the chaotic lobby. \nMISS ADRIAN Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw is with us. \nThe receptionist hands Miss Adrian a key to Sissy's room. \nA COWGIRL makes a face at Sissy as she walks by carrying a tray of herbal teas. \nA representative of the film crew is being intimidated by a Cowgirl who is looking though his camera lenses and shaking them and listening to them like you would put a shell up to your ear to hear the ocean. \nCOWGIRL Cool! We're going to make a movie!... \nAnother cowgirl, BIG RED, is lifting a piece of furniture and passes it to her accomplice. \nBIG RED Get rid of the furniture.... it's too masculine... Get rid of all the furniture and use it for kindling!!! Break away from these pig-like chauvinist masculine influences.... \nGloria cuts in on Debbie and gives the beast a hug. \nHEATHER Look at those playfully wise eyes. \nGLORIA Ooo! It licked me! \nJELLY More and more people are discovering that cow's milk isn't fit for human consumption. Billy West says if we can produce enough goat's milk on the ranch to make it worth his while, he'll run it into Fargo regularly. \nShe pauses and looks around the group in the circle. \nDELORES I'm aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs until her ninth month, but I don't think pregnant cowgirls are going to be any asset on this ranch. I hope you itchy clits who are sneaking down to the lake every night are taking precautions. It's bad enough we've got cranes coming; we don't need storks. I feel that those film makers should be removed from the Rubber Rose as soon as possible. Men can cause nothing but trouble here. I also feel that our guest (she nods at Sissy) should be excused while we discuss this matter further. \nHurt, Sissy leaves the group. \nEXT. RANCH DAY \nViews of Sissy in her Whooping crane outfit dancing to Debussy in front of the Disney film crew. The documentary being directed by an effusive Frenchman. \nView of the camera crew training their long telephoto lenses on Siwash Lake. They all seem to be wearing the same trademark satin baseball jackets with one logo or another on their backs. \nAnother view of the lake, from above, from the Chink's point of view and our first view of THE CHINK. The Chink spies Sissy and Jelly coming over a ridge. \nWe cannot hear them at first, but Sissy and Jelly are talking. \nJELLY ......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet\u00fckame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag. \nSISSY What is Debbie's position? \nJELLY Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear. \nSISSY You don't agree with Debbie, then? \nJELLY I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet. \nJelly takes Sissy's hand, carefully avoiding the thumbs and helps her feel the depression in her belly. The depression is a dimple, like another navel. \nAFTER A HUNGRY STILLNESS, like intermission at a wolf dance, rhythms are established. Jelly and Sissy are socked into one another now, and they arch and push and corkscrew and jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence. \nEverything becomes scrambled. They rock each other in cradles of sweat and saliva, until we can see nothing. \nNoisy breaths buck out of Sissy: \"Jelly, Jelly\" but she can't hear Sissy because she is screaming. Hysterical from the scalding hot softness of girl-love. \nEXT. HILLTOP DAY \nThe Chink looks on from the hilltop above indifferently. \nEXT. FIELD DAY \nShe hears the screen door screech open and a chaos of footsteps in the hall. She goes to her window. And she can see, partially cut off by the corner of the building, Miss Adrian screaming. \nMISS ADRIAN You will all be rounded up and sent to prison if you take this any farther! This is not your ranch!!!! \nEXT. THE FRONT YARD OF THE RUBBER ROSE \nThe Countess seems to be taking it slowly, and calmly smoking a French cigarette. He observes the fighting among them with amusement. \nTHE COUNTESS You pathetic little cutesy-poos. Do you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing the cause of freedom? \nJELLY You owe us this here ranch, as a token payment for your disgusting exploitations \nTHE COUNTESS (tranquilly) Then take it. \nJELLY Go for it, girls! \nThe hands, who carry axes, picks, pitchforks and shovels, retreat. The Countess, still grinning, reaches for an hors d'oeuvre and subjects his cigarette to a measured, self- assured puff. \nMISS ADRIAN (shaking her fist) Go to your bunkhouse and remain there! \nINT. ROOMS \nThe guests are hurriedly packing their things. \nINT. SISSY'S ROOM \nShe looks on. \nEXT. FRONT YARD \nWhen the revolutionaries have retreated about thirty yards, they stop. With astonishing rapidity, they unbuckle unbutton and unzip and step out of their jeans and underpants. Then, nude from the waist down, thatched pubises thrust forward, up front and leading the way, they begin to advance. \nThe Countess's grin goes down his throat like bathwater down a drain. \nGLORIA Better reach for your spray cans! \nJELLY Not one of these pussies has been washed in a week! \nRather pale, his nose twitching, the Countess drops the caviar canap\u00e9 he has been holding. \nON COME THE COWGIRLS, pelvises pumping, laying down what the trembling Countess believes to be a devastating barrage of musk. \nMiss Adrian, lost in her own hysteria, charges. A barbeque fork she hurls draws blood from Heather's eyebrow. \nQuick as a frog's tongue, Delores's whip cracks. It's lash curls around the ranch manager's ankles, pulling her feet from under her. She hits the sod in a jangle of jewelry and expulsion of breath. \nA Molotov cocktail thrown by Big Red says hello to the sexual reconditioning building. Within seconds, the structure is blazing. \nSISSY Wait! \nWarily he stops and turns, poised to flee again. \nSissy smiles. \nSHE RAISES her ripe right thumb. And jerking it and swooshing it, she hitchhikes the Chink and his mountain. \nTHERE HE STANDS where Sissy's thumbs have stopped him. The Chink wears the wary look of a wild animal. He's not going to stay stopped long. It is Sissy's move. \nSISSY Well, aren't you going to shake your whanger at me? \nThe Chink pauses for a moment, then he slaps his thighs and giggles hysterically. Ha has, ho hos and hee hees squirt out of his nose and through the gaps in his teeth. \nCHINK (laughter dies a nervous chipmunk death) Follow me. I'll fix you supper. \nTHE TWO doggedly walk up the steep trail. \nSISSY I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's. \nCHINK I know who you are. \nSISSY Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help... \nCHINK (voice that wears no pants) Save your breath for the climb. \nSISSY takes another look at the Rubber Rose, which is now quiet. We can hear faintly a distant popping of washcloths and girlish laughter. \nTHEY make their way into a depression at the top of the mountain down a ladder of sticks. \nTHE CHINK lights a large fire in the middle of the depression. \nHE puts a kettle of stew over the fire, and begins to roast yams. \nTHE CHINK'S FACE as the fire dances off it. \nA CAN OF CHUNG KING water chestnuts is opened. \nCUT TO: Sissy and the Chink eating supper on a rough wooden bench. \nAND AS THEY FINISH, the Chink goes into a cave and returns with a tiny peppermint-stripped plastic transistor radio. He switches it on and the silence is broken by \"The Happy Hour Polka.\" \nStill clutching the radio in one hand, the Chink hops into the wheel of firelight and begins to dance. \nSissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer heel and toe, skip and hop. He flings his bones; he flings his beard. \nCHINK Yip! Yip! Ha ha ho ho and hee hee. \nCHINK During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains. \nSISSY Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink? \nCHINK The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled \"Indians\" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that \"Indians\" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906. \nINT. THE GREAT BURROW \nA gathering of the Clock People. A woman is giving birth near the Giant timekeeping hourglass. \nCHINK The pivotal function of the Clock People is the keeping and observing of the clockworks. It is a real thing, and is kept at the center, at the soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar as it is possible, all Clock People deaths and births occur in the presence of the clockworks. Aside from birthing or dying, the reason for the daily visits to the clockworks is to check the time. \nINT. SIWASH CAVE NIGHT \nSissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the Chink's clockworks. \nCHINK These people have no other ritual than this one. Likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a continuum they call the Eternity of Joy. It is into the Eternity of Joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed. The destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means, must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call \"earthquakes.\" \nThe Chink holds Sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly. \nCHINK The Earth is alive. She burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing. She longs to be with her husband again. She moans. She turns softly in her sleep. In the Eternity of Joy, pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will smile and sigh when the Earth begins to shake. I loved those loony redskins, but I couldn't be a party to their utopian dreaming. After a while it occurred to me that the Clock People waiting for the Eternity of Joy was virtually identical to the Christians waiting for the Second Coming. Or the Communists waiting for the worldwide revolution. Or the Debbies waiting for the flying saucers. All the same. Just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery on a happy ending to history. Well, history is ending every second - happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second, unhappily the next. History is always ending and always not ending... ha ha ho ho and hee hee. \nSissy interrupts the Chink for a second while he is worshipping her thumbs. \nSISSY What do you believe in then? \nCHINK Ha ha ho ho and hee hee. \nThen he says nothing. And his silence makes Sissy weep. They sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside the cave. \nThen the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. He squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, telling them how beautiful they are. \nSissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved almost to tears. \nSissy bends her head back and whispers. \nSISSY If this be adultery, make the most of it. \nAnd as the Chink plunges into Sissy, she arches her spread bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway. \nTheir bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of ANCIENT BEINGS, anthropomorphs making love through the night under the moon. \nINT. CAVE DAY \nSUNBEAMS awaken Sissy. When she looks around she sees an inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall. \nI BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING; NOTHING IS SACRED. \nAn anesthesiologist sticks needles into a long, graceful neck. \nA nurse scrubs an arm. \nA body and table are draped with sheets to create a sterile field. \nA tourniquet is placed on a slender right arm. \nAn elastic rubber bandage is applied so tightly it squeezes most of the blood out of an arm. \nA tourniquet is inflated. \nA surgeon outlines in iodine an incision around the base of a thumb. \nPale smooth skin is incised along a premarked line and dissected down to the bone. \nWoman flesh is sewn shut with four-ought nylon suture. \nA tourniquet is deflated, a bloody arm bathed. \nA young woman is rolled into a recovery room. \nA nurse and two surgeons, their attention directed by an intensifying pinkish glow, turn to stare into a metal pan, where a huge human thumb, disarticulated from the hand it has been severed from, is now flopping about like a trout, or rather, arching and thrusting itself in a calculated and endlessly repeated gesture, the gesture of the hitchhike. \nEXT. SKY DAY \nTwo representatives of the Fish and Wildlife Service are flying over Siwash Lake in a U.S. Forestry Service Helicopter. \nTHEY CAN SEE the whooping cranes by the side of the lake. And as they are recording this, shots from a band of young women on horseback drive them away. \nEXT. RUBBER ROSE RANCH DAY \nthe same two agents are driving in a truck approaching the Rubber Rose Ranch. Two bullet ricochets spin off the hood and roof of their truck and they stop to see a lone teenaged cowgirl with a rifle. \nEXT. RUBBER ROSE GATES DAY \nAn entourage of Forest Service Rangers, a county sheriff, four deputy shriffs, a state game warden and Mottburg's town marshall and several of his deputies, the editor of the Mottburg Gazette and a couple of bird watchers or two are met by... \nAT LEAST FIFTEEN ARMED FEMALES at the gate of the Ranch. Through a bullhorn, Jelly speaks out at the entourage of law enforcement officers. \nJELLY Yep, the whooping cranes are here all right. They're in fine shape, and as you musta saw from your fucking whirly machine, unrestrained, free to go as they please. But this is private property and you aren't laying a foot on it. None of you. \nSHERIFF We'll be back with a court order and a fistful of search warrants. \nJELLY Just come back with a couple of people who know what they're doing and we'll let'em in for a nice close look at the birds. \nDELORES And make sure at least one of them is female, and you better do as we say or there may be trouble. \nNEWS REPORTER The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a communiqu\u00e9 that was sent to the federal judge and copies of a recording to the press, today. \nWe can hear the voice of Bonanza Jellybean: \nJELLY (over the radio) THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION BY AN AGGRESSIVE, BRUTAL PATERNALISTIC SYSTEM INTENT ON SUBDUING THE EARTH AND ESTABLISHING ITS DOMINION OVER ALL THINGS -- IN THE NAME OF GOD THE FATHER, LAW, ORDER AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS. \nSissy recognizes the voice. \nSISSY That's Jellybean! \nJELLY (V.O.) FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT. \nINT. RANCH OFFICE \nJelly is on the telephone. \nJELLY OBVIOUSLY, A PATERNALISTIC SOCIETY DOES NOT DESERVE ANYTHING AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND WILD AND FREE AS THE WHOOPING CRANE. YOU MEN HAVE FAILED IN YOUR DUTY TO THE CRANE. NOW IT IS WOMEN'S TURN. THE CRANES ARE IN OUR CHARGE NOW. WE WILL PROTECT THEM AS LONG AS THEY STILL REQUIRE PROTECTION -- \nINT. HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM DAY \nSissy listens to the radio. \nJELLY'S VOICE WHILE WORKING TOWARD A DAY WHEN THE CREATURES OF THE WORLD NO LONGER HAVE TO SUFFER MAN'S EGOISM, INSENSITIVITY AND GREED. WE REFUSE YOUR ORDER. WE SAY TAKE YOUR ORDER AND SHOVE IT. THIS FLOCK OF BIRDS IS STAYING WITH US. GET LOST, MAC. \nEXT. ROAD DAY \nSissy is hitchhiking with her new thumb. But cars pass one after another without stopping. Until Sissy finally tries her left thumb, which has been spared the knife. \nWith this thumb there are new maneuvers to try out. And as soon as the does, a car stops. \nMOSAIC of hitchhiking brilliance with Sissy's use of her left thumb. A CLOCK IS TICKING past twelve then on to six and past eight.... she dances wildly around traffic, stopping the hardest of drivers, THE CLOCK TICKS AWAY and within thirty hours she is approaching Mottburg again. \nEXT. RUBBER ROSE DAY \nThe Ranch is now surrounded by two hundred federal marshalls reinforced by a dozen FBI agents with loaded guns taking position outside the ranch. \nSissy gets out of her car and walks past the posse and through the gates. \nKym carries a radio which is playing \"The Day-Old Apple Strudel Polka\" across the corral. She carries the radio as if it is a suitcase full of skunk lice. \nKYM Man, this is the stupidest music I've ever heard. This radio should have stayed in the privy where it belongs. \nKym ropes the radio to her saddle horn and prepares to give it a ride across the Dakota hills. She gets on her horse and rides by the Ranch bungalows and spies Sissy sitting in the outhouse. \nSISSY Howdy. \nKym gets off her horse and hugs Sissy. \nDEBBIE AND JELLY TOGETHER PEYOTE! \nSISSY They're drugged. \nJELLY Aw, come off it, Sissy. What do you mean, 'drugged'? Every living thing is a chemical composition and anything that is added to it changes that composition. When you eat a cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers bar, it changes your body chemistry. The kind of food you eat, the kind of air you breathe, can change your mental state. Does that mean you're 'drugged'? \nSissy frames the flock with the hole in the center of her cheese sandwich. \nSISSY No, I guess not. \nJELLY 'Drugged' is a stupid word. \nSISSY But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years. \nDEBBIE The way I see it, is that the peyote mellowed them out. Made them less uptight. They were afraid of bad weather and humans. That's why they migrated and kept to themselves. But the peyote has enlightened them. It's taught them there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Now they're digging life and letting the bad vibes slide on. Don't worry, be happy. Be here now. \nSISSY Fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people. In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural and necessary. It's merely a mechanism for maintaining life. If the cranes hadn't had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long ago and you'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards. \nJELLY This here discussion is destined to become academic. Because we've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and Delores's run ended up in the Mottburg jail. So any day now we'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not. But in the meantime, I want to say this about fear..... \nThen Sissy and Jelly hear a news broadcast on the radio. \nANNOUNCER Judge Greenfield, at the request of the ACLU, has granted a forty-eight- hour extension of the deadline by which the Rubber Rose cowgirls must comply with his order. Negotiations between the cowgirls and the government are expected to follow. Another item in, the forewoman of the Rubber Rose Ranch, a Delores del Ruby is now free on bond after having been arrested in Mottburg with more than fifty pounds of peyote buttons. Her bail has been paid by the owner of the besieged ranch, Countess Products, Inc. Miss del Ruby's bail having come from the tycoon's personal advisor, a certain Dr. Robbins of New York City. \nSISSY Dr. Robbins? \nEXT. PRAIRIE NIGHT \nSissy and Jelly lie under the same stars, under the same blankets. Under the same spell. \nJELLY Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem. \nSISSY If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts.... \nEXT. CAMPFIRE NIGHT \nDelores and some of the other cowgirls are talking. A sharp wind is beginning to gust. \nDELORES It isn't for ourselves that we take this stand. It isn't for cowgirls. It's for all the daughters everywhere. This is an extremely important confrontation. This is womankind's chance to prove to her enemy that she's willing to fight and die. If we women don't show here and now that we aren't afraid to fight and die, then our enemy will never take us seriously. Men will always know that, no matter how strong our words and determined our deeds, there's a point where we'll back down and give them their way. \nDelores cracks her whip then parades around the campfire. \nDELORES I'm prepared to win! Victory for every female, living or dead, who's suffered the temporary defeats of masculine insensitivity to their inner lives! \nA few of the cowgirls cheer. \nDONNA I'll fight the bastards. \nThe posse surrounding the ranch, can see Jelly coming over the hill on her horse at a full gallop. \nEXT. HILL DAY \nJelly stops her horse, looks down at her waist, and sees her sixguns. \nJELLY Better get rid of these. Might give those greenhorn dudes a fright. \nTHROUGH the scope of an FBI rifle, Jelly is drawing her gun out of her holster. \nAGENT She's going to fire.... \nHe squeezes the trigger, and Jelly is caught in the stomach with a bullet. She falls off her horse to the ground. \nTHE CHINK sees Bonanza Jellybean cut down from a vantage point on the hill, and makes a beeline for the government barricades, SHOUTING. \nTHE COWGIRLS scream and cry, and grab their weapons. A couple of them leap from the barricade and are immediately riddled. \nEXT. HILL DAY \nThe six-gun slips from her fingers. \nTwenty or thirty more sweaty triggers are squeezed on the hilltop firing at Bonanza Jellybean. \nTHE CHINK RUNNING AND SHOUTING. \nEXT. COWGIRL CAMP DAY \nA VOICE OVER THE BULLHORN directed at the cowgirls echoes: \nVOICE You've got two minutes to come out with you hands over your heads! \nRANDOM G-MEN are sniping at the cowgirls, making it impossible to surrender. \nA stray bullet SENDS THE CHINK back down the hillside, beard, robe and sandals flying. \nIN THE HUSH that follows, in the echoes of the explosive fire, the whooping crane flock rises in one grand assault of beating feathers - a lily white storm of life, a gush of albino Gabriels -- swarm into the waiting sky, and circle the pond one time before flapping south toward Texas... \n...they cast shadows over a dead Jellybean who is literally biting the dust. \nSissy lifts Jelly out of the dust and holds her. Sissy lifts Jelly's satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her skirt. Bright red blood is running out of her scar. \nJELLY Right in the scar where I fell on a wooden horse when I was twelve. Haw, I wasn't really shot with a silver bullet. \nConfessing to Sissy. \nJELLY Or was I? \nVOICE As words such as sweetheart\" and \"honey britches\" and \"forever\" and \"always\" burned away, the cowgirl squirted a few tears. Her eyes were so misty she forgot to burn the bag. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE NIGHT \nSissy is sobbing. \nBig Red offers a piece of homemade fudge and shows no surprise when Sissy refuses it. \nKym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent Cowgirl, and the bunkhouse lights go out. \nDelores plunks a carefree song on an old Gibson, looks up at the moon. \nDELORES You know, podner, you can tune a guitar but you can't tuna fish. \nShe plunks a few notes. \nDELORES God, but it's good to be a cowgirl. \nAnd the bunkhouse lights are turned off. There are some giggles from the cowgirls. \nINT. MAIN BEDROOM RANCH DAY \nTHE CHINK wakes up and is being cared for by Sissy. He is in pain, but winking. \nSISSY Is everything getting worse? \nCHINK Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better. \nSISSY The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture! \nSissy shows a picture of the Countess recovering in a hospital bed, posing next to Doctor Robbins. \nCHINK I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly? \nSISSY She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City. \nCHINK You mean she's dead? \nThe Chink mourns a bit. \nSISSY But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte. \nCHINK Easy come, easy go. \nDELORES Wow, you sure have a way with words. \nThe Chink looks over and sees that Delores is standing in the doorway. \n", "test1_input": "Delores catches it..... The card is the Queen of Spades. \nEXT. ROAD DAY \nSissy is thirty years old now wearing a trademark colored jumpsuit. She is saying these words still: \"Greater freedom of movement.\" \nSissy sticks out her thumb, even though there is no traffic. \nA plane is flying overhead. Sissy hitches it; and the plane's flight path curves with in response to her gesture. A squirrel running by stops to look. The bus on the other side of the road skids to a stop and two cars coming her way stop as well. \nINT. CAR DAY \nThe man driving looks over the back seat to the hitchiker behind him. \nINT. BUS DAY \nThe bus driver does the same. \nEXT. ROAD \nFrom the look of her Sissy is a very seasoned hitchhiker, and she turns around relatively unimpressed with the fact that a car has stopped for her. \nSISSY'S VIEW. The man driving is black-skinned, beret-topped and he has four smiling gold teeth and six shiny brass saxaphones in the back seat. He wears a gardenia in his lapel and tokes on a short joint. \nSISSY Going north? \nMAN You bet your raggedy white ass I am. \nSissy gets in. \nHe turns up the volume of his radio and rockets north. \nINT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL DAY \nSissy ventures into her pocket and pulls out a slice of cheese and offers it to him. He now gets a better look at her unusual thumbs. They are elegant, but large boned, and disproportionate. They are banana shaped boats that makes it a little awkward to hold onto the cheese. \nMAN (taking an alarming interest in her thumbs) Thanks. \nSISSY American Cheese. The king of road food. \nHe eats the cheese, and worries about the thumbs. He tokes on the joint between his fingers. \nMAN Are you in show business? \nSISSY I was a successful model once. \nMAN For magazines? \n", "test1_true": "MAN So now you're bummin' around? \nSISSY Yep. \nMAN Hitchhiking? \nSISSY I'm the best. \nMAN You're the best? \nSISSY When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways. \nMAN Whooee! \nSISSY As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace. \nThe man listening to her takes another toke on his joint. \nEXT. ROAD DAY \nA view down the road of the Lincoln Continental going swiftly in its direction. \nCREDIT INTERLUDE featuring the song \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" as sung by (an undetermined country or pop star like k.d. lang or Bob Dylan) in an old television Kine-scope piece of film like you might see on early 1950's television sets. \nBetween Sissy watching this image on old motel televisions, there are also IMAGES of roads, cars, trucks, highways, thumbs, gas stations and deserts gliding by in a flow of natural hitchhiking beauty. \nEXT. POST OFFICE DAY \nSissy gets out of a large eighteen wheel truck and walks into a United States Post Office. \nINT. POST OFFICE DAY \nSissy at the window picking up some mail, and opening a lavender colored letter that reeks of perfume, she is surprised to read this: \nSissy, Precious Being, How are you, my extraordinary one? I worry so. Next time you are near Manhattan, do ring me up. There is a man to whom I simply must introduce you. Thrill!! -The Countess \nSissy looks at the envelope and return address. Elaborately embossed is the Countess' logo... \nINT. COUNTESS'S OFFICE DAY \nThe elaborately embossed envelope is now being sealed.. The Countess gives it a licking... Beside him is a young watercolorist named Julian. \nTHE COUNTESS I will send this out to Sissy, she should get it in a week, and you will be able to meet her. When I send a letter to Sissy, duplicates must be sent to U.S. Post Office Boxes in LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge, Cherokee and that other place, for her to pick up... Why she's probably out there right now in Hibbing, Minnesota, or Deluth, Montana... hitching her way across the country. \nINT. TRUCKERS CAB NIGHT \nSissy is talking to a trucker as they pass down the road. \n", "test1_id": 1446, "test2_input": "The Maid puts the tray down, and the cloth that covers the food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of grease and calories. \nA vase of prairie asters stands over a double-meat cheeseburger, a package of Hostess Twinkies, a cold can of Dr. Pepper and a Three Musketeers bar. \nSissy is delighted. \nSISSY Road food. How did you know? \nMAID Well it is a change of our usual grapefruit and melba toast, I'm sure. \nSissy notices a card. It reads: \nCompliments of Bonanza Jellybean \nSISSY Bonanza Jellybean.... \nMAID She will be up to see you directly. \nSissy devours her meal. Out her window she can see women on exercycles, women doing jumping jacks and women in beauty parlors. \nA FIST pounds on Sissy's door. \nIN SAILS Jelly, a cowgirl so cute she makes Sissy blush just to look at her. She wears a tan Stetson with an aster pinned to it, a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing stallions snorting orange fire from their nostrils. \nHer breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten loaded on helium and, between red tinged cheeks, where more baby fat is taking its time maturing, she has a little smile that can cause minerals and plastics to remember their ancient animate connections. \nJelly grasps Sissy's elbow and sits on the side of the bed. \nJELLY Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do. \nSISSY Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast. \nJELLY Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend... \nSissy sets her tray on the bedside table. \nSISSY No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone. \nJELLY Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich\u00e9s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl. \nThe guests are huffing and puffing in between the pauses in conversation, in the background through the window in Sissy's room. \nSISSY Tell me about it. \nJELLY About... \nSISSY About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl. \n", "test2_true": "Jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound Sissy's thumb makes under the covers. \nSISSY You're political, then? \nJELLY No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. \"Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it.\" \nThere is a moment when the two girls feel something between each other. \nJELLY Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink. \nSISSY Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink? \nJELLY Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy. \nJelly pauses. \nJELLY Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the Chink taught me something about cowgirls. Did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries? Long before America. In ancient India the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis. Being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully horny, just like we do here. Every gopi was in love with Krishna, a good-looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style When the moon was full, this Krishna would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him. Then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times -- one for each gopi -- and make love to each one the way she most desired. There they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite a picture, huh? \nSissy's thumb twitches. Jelly swallows hard. They gaze into each other's eyes. \nA WHISTLE pierces the sunlight outside the window. \nJELLY That couldn't be Krishna, could it? A bit shrill for a flute. Just our rotten luck. \nJelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals with someone outside. \nJELLY Gotta run now. Delores says I'm needed. Somebody's here. Maybe it's the Countess. \nJelly spins her six-shooter in her kewpie fingers. \nJELLY Sissy, cowgirl history is about to be made. I'm damn glad you're here to witness it. \nShe holsters her gun and blows Sissy a kiss, then is gone out the door. \nSissy hops out of bed and from the window she can see cowgirls gathering in a circle. Someone or something is in the center of the circle. \nSissy zips herself into a red jumpsuit and hurries outside. \nEXT. CORRAL DAY \nWhat was in the center of the circle was a goat. Debbie was scratching the animal's ears. She was hugging it. \nKYM It's cute. Way cuter than a cow. \nDEBBIE Goats are always testing you. They're like Zen masters. They can tell instantly if you're faking your feelings. So they play games with you to keep you true. People should go to goats instead of psychiatrists. \nGLORIA It's so loving. \n", "test2_id": 1447, "test3_input": "SISSY Brain damage? You mean he's going to be a vegetable? \nSURGEON Vegetable? Vegetable? I wouldn't say that, no. We won't ascertain the extent of the injury for some days. But there is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects. I wouldn't classify it in the vegetable category, however. \nEXT. STREET DAY \nSISSY IS HITCHING OUT OF TOWN. \nA conservative blue Econoline van out of the throngs of traffic draws itself to Sissy as if on a string. \nSISSY HOPS IN. \nINT. VAN DAY \nThe DRIVER stomps on the gas. With a sense of disgust at her own failure Sissy scrutinizes his sweaty brow, his smug hot leer, his starving eyes. \nHer heart sinks when she sees his gun and his knife. He is also unzipping his pants. \nDRIVER I'm going to give it to you like you've never had it before. Oh, you didn't know it could be this good. You're gonna like it. You're gonna like it. You're gonna like it so good. You're gonna love it so much you're gonna cry. You're gonna cry. You're gonna cry and cry. Do you like to cry? Do you like it when it hurts a little bit? Whatever happens to you, it'll be worth it. The way I'm gonna give it to you, it'll be worth anything. Everything. Go ahead and cry if you want to. I like it when women cry. It means they appreciate me. \nEXT. STREET DAY \nThe van pulls over down a dead end alley between warehouses. \nINT. VAN DAY \nSissy looks into the back at a soiled mattress. \nThe driver is taking his dick out of his pants. But with a swift swoosh, Sissy's left thumb comes down hard on the penis top, making the driver howl. \nHis finger fumbles for the gun trigger, but before he gets to it, Sissy's thumb splats between his eyes. Twice. Three times. He loses control of the van. \nEXT. VAN DAY \nIt lumbers into a street lamp. Sissy leaps from the vehicle and runs. \nINT. WORKING MAN'S LUNCHEONETTE DAY \nSissy goes in and begins to cry at the counter as she looks at her thumbs. \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE DAY \nInto a sunset hitches Sissy. \nEXT.

Without Sissy's asking he speaks. \nDR. DREYFUS I'm afraid I can't help you. \nSISSY But Doctor. \nDREYFUS Please, child, don't be dismayed. We all have problems these days. But as the painter Van Gogh said, 'Mysteries remain, sorrow or melancholy remains, but the everlasting negative is balanced by the positive work which thus is achieved, after all.' I don't suppose that means very much to you. I have retired. A victim of a malpractice suit. \nSISSY (embracing him) Oh, Doctor! You've got to do it. You and nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift. \nIn her embrace, the Doctor is presented with her thumbs. \nDR. DREYFUS Ah, the thumb. \nLATER sitting inside his study, Dreyfus muses. \nDR. DREYFUS The thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb. One of evolution's most ingenious inventions; a built-in tool sensitive to texture, contour and temperature: an alchemical lever; the secret key to technology; the link between the mind and art; a humanizing device. The marmoset and the lemur are thumbless; none of the New World monkeys has opposable thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle; the thumbs of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to the other digits. \nPause. \nDR. DREYFUS And so you are demanding at last the privileges of thumb that nature has perversely denied you? \nSISSY I just want to be normal, give me that old-fashioned normality. It was good enough for Crazy Horse and it's good enough for me. \nDR. DREYFUS Ah, yes. Very well, my dear. Here is what we can do. \nVIEWS OF Sissy admitted to a hospital Blood analyzed in a laboratory. \nPowerful lamps turn on in an operating room. \nIV tubes are inserted in veins. \nSissy is wheeled into surgery. \nAn anesthesiologist sticks a needle into a curved and creamy ass. \n", "test3_id": 1448}

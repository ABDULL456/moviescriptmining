{"test1_input": "CHINK During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains. \nSISSY Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink? \nCHINK The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled \"Indians\" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that \"Indians\" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906. \nINT. THE GREAT BURROW \nA gathering of the Clock People. A woman is giving birth near the Giant timekeeping hourglass. \nCHINK The pivotal function of the Clock People is the keeping and observing of the clockworks. It is a real thing, and is kept at the center, at the soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar as it is possible, all Clock People deaths and births occur in the presence of the clockworks. Aside from birthing or dying, the reason for the daily visits to the clockworks is to check the time. \nINT. SIWASH CAVE NIGHT \nSissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the Chink's clockworks. \nCHINK These people have no other ritual than this one. Likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a continuum they call the Eternity of Joy. It is into the Eternity of Joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed. The destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means, must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call \"earthquakes.\" \nThe Chink holds Sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly. \nCHINK The Earth is alive. She burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing. She longs to be with her husband again. She moans. She turns softly in her sleep. In the Eternity of Joy, pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will smile and sigh when the Earth begins to shake. I loved those loony redskins, but I couldn't be a party to their utopian dreaming. After a while it occurred to me that the Clock People waiting for the Eternity of Joy was virtually identical to the Christians waiting for the Second Coming. Or the Communists waiting for the worldwide revolution. Or the Debbies waiting for the flying saucers. All the same. Just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery on a happy ending to history. Well, history is ending every second - happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second, unhappily the next. History is always ending and always not ending... ha ha ho ho and hee hee. \nSissy interrupts the Chink for a second while he is worshipping her thumbs. \nSISSY What do you believe in then? \nCHINK Ha ha ho ho and hee hee. \nThen he says nothing. And his silence makes Sissy weep. They sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside the cave. \nThen the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. He squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, telling them how beautiful they are. \nSissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved almost to tears. \nSissy bends her head back and whispers. \nSISSY If this be adultery, make the most of it. \nAnd as the Chink plunges into Sissy, she arches her spread bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway. \nTheir bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of ANCIENT BEINGS, anthropomorphs making love through the night under the moon. \nINT. CAVE DAY \nSUNBEAMS awaken Sissy. When she looks around she sees an inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall. \nI BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING; NOTHING IS SACRED. \n", "test1_true": "I BELIEVE IN NOTHING; EVERYTHING IS SACRED. \nSissy hears and then sees A HELICOPTER in the sky above the ranch. Sissy gets up and walks out of the cave. \nEXT. TRAIL MORN \nSissy walks. \nEXT. RUBBER ROSE \nSissy hitches a ride out of town. \nEXT. FRONT DOORSTEPS MORNING \nCountless NEWSPAPERS on countless porches, and the headline of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reads: \nOUR WHOOPING CRANES ARE MISSING. \nINT. THE COUNTESS' OFFICE DAY \nThe countess is in a snit. \nTHE COUNTESS Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows? \nSISSY I don't know anything about it. \nTHE COUNTESS Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer... \nSissy strikes the Countess with her right thumb -- with astonishing force. \nImmediately the thumb strikes again, this time shattering the Countess's monocle against his eye. \nTHE COUNTESS (gasping) Shit O dear. \nHIS DENTURES fall onto the shag rug. \nThe left thumb strikes. Sissy is swinging her thumbs like ballbats socking flaming homers over the left-field fence. \nThe countess is out on his feet. His eyes are closed. His legs wobble. He does a pathetic dance, like a drunken old fool trying to boogie with a chorus girl. \nHe topples forward and meets Sissy's onrushing thumb of thunder which straightens him up, sends him over backward. Motionless, he lies on the floor, a crimson part in his thinning hair, a bright ooze at each nostril. \nINT. HOSPITAL DAY \nSeated on a spotless wooden bench is Sissy, staring at a clock. A surgeon emerges. \nSURGEON Well, he's not out of danger, but I think we can safely say he's going to make it. I'd be pretty surprised if he didn't. However, there is evidence of injury to the frontal lobe, and I have reason to fear that this injury may be permanent. The patient may never again function as a normal human being. \n", "test1_id": 1446, "test2_input": "SISSY Brain damage? You mean he's going to be a vegetable? \nSURGEON Vegetable? Vegetable? I wouldn't say that, no. We won't ascertain the extent of the injury for some days. But there is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects. I wouldn't classify it in the vegetable category, however. \nEXT. STREET DAY \nSISSY IS HITCHING OUT OF TOWN. \nA conservative blue Econoline van out of the throngs of traffic draws itself to Sissy as if on a string. \nSISSY HOPS IN. \nINT. VAN DAY \nThe DRIVER stomps on the gas. With a sense of disgust at her own failure Sissy scrutinizes his sweaty brow, his smug hot leer, his starving eyes. \nHer heart sinks when she sees his gun and his knife. He is also unzipping his pants. \nDRIVER I'm going to give it to you like you've never had it before. Oh, you didn't know it could be this good. You're gonna like it. You're gonna like it. You're gonna like it so good. You're gonna love it so much you're gonna cry. You're gonna cry. You're gonna cry and cry. Do you like to cry? Do you like it when it hurts a little bit? Whatever happens to you, it'll be worth it. The way I'm gonna give it to you, it'll be worth anything. Everything. Go ahead and cry if you want to. I like it when women cry. It means they appreciate me. \nEXT. STREET DAY \nThe van pulls over down a dead end alley between warehouses. \nINT. VAN DAY \nSissy looks into the back at a soiled mattress. \nThe driver is taking his dick out of his pants. But with a swift swoosh, Sissy's left thumb comes down hard on the penis top, making the driver howl. \nHis finger fumbles for the gun trigger, but before he gets to it, Sissy's thumb splats between his eyes. Twice. Three times. He loses control of the van. \nEXT. VAN DAY \nIt lumbers into a street lamp. Sissy leaps from the vehicle and runs. \nINT. WORKING MAN'S LUNCHEONETTE DAY \nSissy goes in and begins to cry at the counter as she looks at her thumbs. \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE DAY \nInto a sunset hitches Sissy. \nEXT. ROAD NIGHT \nSISSY hops into a semi. \n", "test2_true": "TRENTON N.J. \nBALTIMORE MD \nWASHINGTON D.C. \nThen \nRICHMOND, VA \nEXT. DR. DREYFUS'S HOUSE DAY \nAn older Dr. Dreyfus answers the door. Without Sissy's asking he speaks. \nDR. DREYFUS I'm afraid I can't help you. \nSISSY But Doctor. \nDREYFUS Please, child, don't be dismayed. We all have problems these days. But as the painter Van Gogh said, 'Mysteries remain, sorrow or melancholy remains, but the everlasting negative is balanced by the positive work which thus is achieved, after all.' I don't suppose that means very much to you. I have retired. A victim of a malpractice suit. \nSISSY (embracing him) Oh, Doctor! You've got to do it. You and nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift. \nIn her embrace, the Doctor is presented with her thumbs. \nDR. DREYFUS Ah, the thumb. \nLATER sitting inside his study, Dreyfus muses. \nDR. DREYFUS The thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb. One of evolution's most ingenious inventions; a built-in tool sensitive to texture, contour and temperature: an alchemical lever; the secret key to technology; the link between the mind and art; a humanizing device. The marmoset and the lemur are thumbless; none of the New World monkeys has opposable thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle; the thumbs of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to the other digits. \nPause. \nDR. DREYFUS And so you are demanding at last the privileges of thumb that nature has perversely denied you? \nSISSY I just want to be normal, give me that old-fashioned normality. It was good enough for Crazy Horse and it's good enough for me. \nDR. DREYFUS Ah, yes. Very well, my dear. Here is what we can do. \nVIEWS OF Sissy admitted to a hospital Blood analyzed in a laboratory. \nPowerful lamps turn on in an operating room. \nIV tubes are inserted in veins. \nSissy is wheeled into surgery. \nAn anesthesiologist sticks a needle into a curved and creamy ass. \n", "test2_id": 1447, "test3_input": "The posse surrounding the ranch, can see Jelly coming over the hill on her horse at a full gallop. \nEXT. HILL DAY \nJelly stops her horse, looks down at her waist, and sees her sixguns. \nJELLY Better get rid of these. Might give those greenhorn dudes a fright. \nTHROUGH the scope of an FBI rifle, Jelly is drawing her gun out of her holster. \nAGENT She's going to fire.... \nHe squeezes the trigger, and Jelly is caught in the stomach with a bullet. She falls off her horse to the ground. \nTHE CHINK sees Bonanza Jellybean cut down from a vantage point on the hill, and makes a beeline for the government barricades, SHOUTING. \nTHE COWGIRLS scream and cry, and grab their weapons. A couple of them leap from the barricade and are immediately riddled. \nEXT.

Sissy lifts Jelly's satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her skirt. Bright red blood is running out of her scar. \nJELLY Right in the scar where I fell on a wooden horse when I was twelve.

Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles, like the fossilized brain of a dryad; its kinship to tree (to knot and nest) unobscured by the cruel crush of industry; absorbing the elements like any other organic entity; blending with rock and vegetation as if it were a burrowing owl's door mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a No. 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of Dakota and appeared to live where it lay. Once long ago, it had borne a package of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette rendezvous with a fried hamburger. More recently, the bag had held........ love letters. \nView of a bunkhouse trunk. \nVOICE As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel's family jewels, the bag had hidden love letters in the bottom of a bunkhouse trunk. \nHands lift the contents of the trunk away, rope, spurs, and blanket and find the hidden sack of letters. \nVOICE Then one day after work, the button- nosed little cowgirl to whom the letters were addressed gathered bag and contents under her arm, slipped out to the corral... \nWe see the Cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day. \nVOICE ...past ranch hands pitching horseshoes and ranch hands flying Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted into the hills. \nWe see the Cowgirl riding along a ridge. \nVOICE A mile or so from the bunkhouse, she dismounted and built a small fire; she fed the fire letters. \nAnd this we see also, the lonely Cowgirl feeding the letters to a fire in the dusky early night.

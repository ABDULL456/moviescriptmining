{"train": "The Ice Storm by James Schamus. Based on the novel by Rick Moody. First Draft Revised January 5, 1996 \nEXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN \nSuburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The still after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from the track. \nINT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN \nVarious passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep. \nOn Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign. \nSuddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns. \nThe conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal voice. \nCONDUCTOR Good morning ladies and gentlemen -- \nHe sounds like a baseball announcer. \nPASSENGERS (mumbling, ad lib) What ladies? \nCONDUCTOR -- this train originating at New York's Grand Central Station is back in service - next stop will be New Canaan, Connecticut. New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop! \nHe moves on to the next car. \nThe train begins to move. \nPaul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the still-dark early morning. \nHe looks back down at his comic book. \nOn the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him. \nThe Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look on, stunned. \"THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A VEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON.\" \"DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WQRLD!\" \nPaul looks up again, thinking. \nPAUL (V.O.) In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four, published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb. His son is the result of Richards' coupling with the earthling Sue Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter. \nEXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN \nThe train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape. \nPAUL (V.O.) And that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely. Each of them is negative matter for the other ones. And that's what dying is -- dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge -- it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space... \nINT. TRAIN. CONT'D. \nOn Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows warmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic book. \nPAUL (V.O.) So it's a paradox -- the closer you're drawn back in, the further into the void you're thrown. \nEXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING \nThe train slowly pulls in. \nThe train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night, emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen suburban Lolita. \nHe pauses, regarding them. \nThey stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him. \nEXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING \nTo establish. A typical New England prep school. \nINT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING \nCramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money. \nPaul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail untucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong. \nFRANCIS Arise and shine, young Hood. \nPAUL I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night. \nFRANCIS (finishing a hit) The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick. \nPaul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs, spewing uninhaled smoke. \nLATER: \nINT. SCHOOL PARTY. CONT'D \nPaul wanders, stoned, through the party. He sees Libbets from across the room. She seems to be surrounded by friends. \nINT. PARTY. CONT'D \nPaul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music. There are just a few people left, most of them making out with each other. \nPAUL (stoned) -- because I've been reading Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and sleeping wherever, and, of course, with all kinds of people, but when you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives, and, uh, these guys didn't bathe much, I mean they were really filthy, with like genital crabs, lice, exceptionally strong body odor... \nLibbets smiles through her yawn. \nEXT. SCHOOL BENCH. NIGHT \nPaul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut. Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him. \nINT. DORM ROOM. EVENING. \nPaul is at his desk. Francis enters, wrapped in a towel, fresh from the shower. \nPAUL How can you do that man? \nFRANCIS Do what? \nPAUL Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up. \nFRANCIS (beat) Um, Libbets Casey. \nPAUL What? \nFRANCIS Aha! I could sense the vibe. \nPAUL What do you mean? \nFRANCIS Am I right or am I right? \nPAUL Shit. You're not planning -- \nFRANCIS My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that -- \nA knock at the door. \nSTUDENT  (O.S.) Hood, telephone. \nPaul rolls off his bed, opens the door. \nPAUL Don't mess with Libbets. I mean it! \nINT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT \nPaul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall. \nPAUL Hello? \nINTERCUT - HOOD HOUSEHOLD. NIGHT \nIt's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper, etc.) suburban house. \nBen Hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand. \nBEN Paul? \nIn the background, we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon on TV. \nPAUL Hi dad. \nBEN Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right? \nPAUL I'm fine dad. \nBEN Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon. \nPAUL Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments -- \nBEN Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should... \nIN THE BACKGROUND: \nDOROTHY Ted took me to see it. \nJANEY Ted, how romantic. \nDOROTHY I have to say, the movie didn't do much for me. But being in that theater, surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts, there was something in the air that -- \nJUMP CUT: \nThe boys are pouring wine. \nJIM -- pulls right up to the pump, jumps out like there's no gas shortage, oblivious, and by this point everybody in line's piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy, when they notice it's that Reverend Edwards -- \nBEN The Unitarian? The new one? \nJIM Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek Road and didn't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile. \nBEN He's either got his head in the clouds or up his -- \nDOROTHY I hear he's slept with half the women in his congregation -- \nTED Lucky bastard! \nAs this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben. \nBEN Hell! -- I mean, no problemo there Mikey. Here, I -- \nJaney leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe of Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is, Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice. \nCUT TO: \nThe boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out coffee and dessert. The adults eye Mikey's handling of the coffee pot with some nervousness. \nDOROTHY (unconvincing) So fascinating. Do you get free tickets to the movies, that kind of thing? \nBEN No, my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their money. It's -- \nELENA Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- \nBEN (with a bit too much conviction) And as usual no one believed me... \nSilence. \nCUT TO: \nThe dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the table. She stacks a plate on top of another. \nJANEY Please don't. \nELENA It's not a bother. \nJANEY I insist. (beat) Don't touch them. \nElena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice. \nELENA Oh. \nJANEY (realizing she's gone too far) It's really quite all right. \nELENA Of course. \nINT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nThe party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight. \nDOROTHY And to think -- they met at a key party of all things. \nELENA A key party? \nDOROTHY You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic. \nJANEY Ironic? \nDOROTHY (caught out) Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is Rod. \nINT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT \nThe guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss, and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks. \nELENA Thank you Janey. \nBen ponders, as the food arrives. \nBEN (weakly) But... \nHAROLD But what? \nBEN But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena. \nHis father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork. \nHAROLD Christ Ben! Make up your mind and eat your lunch. \nINT. BOOK STORE. DAY \nElena browses the self-help section. A longish-haired, slightly gone-to-seed, but still handsome clergyman pauses next to her. He's wearing an ecclesiastical collar and bell bottoms. \nHe pulls out a copy of Me, Myself and I, glancing again at Elena. \nPHILIP Elena. Elena Hood, am I right? \nELENA Yes. \nPHILIP Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year. \nELENA Yes, it was -- I ended up -- \nPHILIP (smiling) No need to make excuses -- \nEXT. NEW CANAAN HIGH SCHOOL FIELD. DAY \nA cool gray afternoon. A group of boys are playing flag football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking c1garettes. \nWendy, Beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one group. \nBETH (referring to one of the girls gathered in the other group) She said you licked Dave Brewster's weenie in the third floor bathroom. \nWENDY She's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me. It's probably crawling with v.d. after he put it in her, which he did. \nThe conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar. \nWendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the field where the boys are playing. \nA group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them. \nThe quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass. As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard before. \nThe quarterback spots him and throws a long one. \nHe runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound. \nThe ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his own, to run. \nSuddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to see all the other kids just standing there looking at him. One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the explanation. \nMIKEY (as he returns to the group, ball in hand) Did anybody hear that? \nThe other kids snicker. Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's eye for a fleeting moment. \nWENDY I gotta go. \nShe takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY \nElena and Philip are seated at a booth. \nPHILIP It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers -- \nELENA I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person -- \nPHILIP Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples -- \nElena looks outside the window, and sees Wendy speed past on her bicycle. \nELENA (cutting him off) My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years. (still not really looking at him) When was the last time you rode a bike? \nPHILIP (a bit taken aback by the abrupt topic change) They say you never forget. \nELENA (jarred back to his presence) Forget what? \nEXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAY \nTo establish. \nINT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY \nA couple are in the final throes of lovemaking. We see Janey Williams's face, more or less enjoying the proceedings. The man gives a final heave and groan, and rolls off to reveal himself to be -- Ben Hood. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nJaney smokes a cigarette. Ben is babbling. \nBEN We were golfing, and you know, golfing to me is something I'm supposed to enjoy, and I was on the goddam golf team in college, so it's something one would assume I do well -- I used to do well -- but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing, or plowing. \nJaney smiles briefly at this. \nBEN (CONT'D) It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department -- \nJANEY Ben-- \nBEN Yeah? \nJANEY (gently) You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another. \nBEN You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right. \nJANEY You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon. \nBEN Gotcha. \nShe wraps a blanket around herself and gets up. \nEXT. BACK OF WILLIAMS HOUSE. EVENING \nBen cautiously walks out he back door and heads for the side gate. \nINT. HOOD KITCHEN. EVENING \nWendy enters the house as Elena is finishing supper preparations. \nWENDY Hi mom. \nELENA Hi Wendy. \nWithout waiting for instructions, Wendy starts pulling out plates and silverware and setting the table. \nELENA (CONT'D) I saw you on your bike today. \nWENDY With Mikey? \nELENA Who? \nWENDY Nobody. \nELENA Mikey Williams? \nWENDY We were just riding around. \nElena takes this in. \nELENA Well, you looked very -- free -- when I saw you. \nWendy continues setting the table. \nELENA (CONT'D) Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it. \nWENDY Mom. Are you ok? \nELENA Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows. \nWENDY You're not a psycho! \nELENA The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos. \nWENDY I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and -- \nELENA We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston. \nWENDY Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me -- \nSANDY Yeah. But I just need some help with my homework. \nA knock at the door. Jim stands in the doorway with a suitcase in his hand. \nJIM Hey guys, I'm back. \nMIKEY (honestly confused) You were gone? \nSandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause. \nJIM (a look of disappointment) Yeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston, working on some great new ideas about silicon, which comes from sand, very conductive. How you guys doing? How's school? \nMikey's still flustered. \nMIKEY Uh, I dunno. OK I guess. \nJIM Hmm. Alright! \nHe walks off. \nSANDY You really didn't notice? Man, he's been gone for three days. \nINT. WILLIAMS BEDROOM. NIGHT \nJaney is reading, still dressed, on the bed. She nods to Jim as he enters with his suitcase. \nJANEY Good trip? \nHe nods and puts his suitcase down, then sits heavily on the side of the bed. \nJIM (as he sits) You bet. \nIt turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a wave that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed. \nJANEY Jesus, Jim! \nJIM (jumping up, which only creates another wave) Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed. \nJANEY Just be careful. \nJIM (as he begins to unpack) You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh? \nJANEY Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born. \nJIM Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh? \nHe laughs to himself. \nShe gives him a look. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY \nElena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again. \nPHILIP In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology. \nELENA You're saying that Christ is the child, and -- \nPHILIP -- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self. \nELENA All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in? \nPHILIP You ask what the point is? \nELENA That's right. \nPHILIP Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization? \nELENA I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed. \nPHILIP If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean... (flustered) My, I sound a bit -- \nELENA I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude. \nPHILIP You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself. \nELENA But not too ashamed. \nPHILIP (smiling) Now you are being rude. \nINT. HOOD GARAGE. DAY \nElena enters the garage from the kitchen and turns the light on. \nShe finds an old bicycle and pulls it out. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREETS. DAY \nElena rides her bike into town, infused with the girlish sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter. \nSuddenly, there's a pop -- a tire is blown out. She slows down and gets off the bike. As she bends to look at the wheel, a station wagon slows near her. The driver's side window rolls open. It's Janey Williams. \nJANEY Need a lift? \nINT. JANEY'S CAR. DAY \nElena sits in the passenger seat. The two women are obviously uncomfortable with each other. \nSilence. \nELENA Thanks again. For the dinner. \nJANEY Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook. \nELENA I used to know how to cook. \nJANEY It's not like we're too busy. \nThey smile, barely. \nELENA I'm thinking of going back to school. \nJANEY Social work? \nELENA How'd you know? \nJANEY Educated guess. \nELENA I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown -- \nJANEY You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me. \nShe pulls the car over. \nEXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY \nJaney's car pulls to the curb. \nINT. CAR. CONT'D \nJANEY Here you are. \nELENA (opening her door) Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother-- \nJANEY None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving. \nEXT. FIVE AND DIME. CONT'D \nElena watches the car pull away. She turns and walks into the store. \nINT. FIVE AND DIME. DAY \nElena moves through the aisles, putting various sundries into a basket. \nShe pauses in front of the lipsticks. \nShe picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it in her pocket. \nWe see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle, as she quickly exits the store. \nThe middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave. \nEXT. FIVE AND DIME. DAY \nIn a wide shot, from across the street, we see Elena leave the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and taps her on the shoulder. They converse for a minute, and Elena is accompanied back into the store. \nThrough the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of her purse. She's obviously distraught -- offering to pay, talking quickly, etc. The shopkeeper is holding a telephone, not yet decided on whether to call her in. \nPAUL (V.O.) To find yourself in the Negative Zone, as the Fantastic Four often do, means that all everyday assumptions are inverted -- even the invisible girl herself becomes visible, and so she loses the last semblance of her power. \nLater, still mentally devolving in front of the TV, but with various junk food detritus surrounding them and a different show, a rerun of the original Highway Patrol. \nSandy wanders off. \nCUT TO: \nLater. \nWendy gets up, goes upstairs, and wanders down the hall to the bathroom. \nShe gets to the door just as Sandy gets there from the opposite direction. \nWENDY After you. \nSandy hesitantly opens the door, as Wendy still hovers by it. \nSANDY Well, you can... \nWENDY Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d. \nSANDY All my model planes. \nWENDY The ones you built? \nSANDY They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up. \nWENDY I have to go to the bathroom. \nSANDY Yeah. \nBut he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the doorway. \nWendy looks around -- no one in sight. \nWENDY I'll show you mine if you show me yours. \nSandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into the bathroom like a feather. \nINT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY \nMikey looks up from the TV, wondering where Wendy is. He eats another Pringle. \nINT. WILLIAMS BATHROOM. DAY \nWendy flips up her dress for Sandy. \nHe slowly unzips, his hand unsteady. We can tell from the look on Wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the little guy. \nSuddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears. \nSANDY What do you want?! What do you want? Get out! Get out of here! \nThe door flips open -- and Janey Williams appears. \nJANEY (sizing up the situation) Shit. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM. DAY \nJaney is giving Wendy a lecture \nJANEY A person's body is his temple, Wendy. This body is your first and last possession. Now as your own parents have probably told you, in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us. That's why, in Samoa and in other developing nations, adolescents are sent out into the woods, unarmed, and they don't come back until they've learned a thing or two. \nINT. WILLIAMS HOUSE DOORWAY. DAY \nWendy is led to the door by Mrs. Williams. \nWendy trades a glance with a sullen Mikey, who sits in the living room pretending to ignore her. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nWendy walks her bike with the wind in her face. \nFrom behind her, Mikey rides up on his bike and rides alongside her. \nShe doesn't look at him. \nTrying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles, nearly falling off. \nMIKEY I don't ever want to see you. \nELENA Leave it -- I'll wash it for you. \nHe looks at her ruefully. \nEXT. HOOD STREET. DAY \nWendy walks and Mikey rides along. \nWENDY You have to follow me? \nMIKEY I dunno. I -- \nThey're now in front of the Hood's house. \nEXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY \nBen exits the house in a rush, and sees Wendy and Mikey on the street in front. \nBEN Hey there Mikey, how's business? \nCONTINUED: 85 \nMIKEY (tripping off of his bike) Business? Uh, I dunno. \nBen grimaces, fiddles for his car keys. \nAs Mikey remounts and rides off, Wendy passes her father on the driveway. \nBEN I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come? \nWENDY Nah. \nBEN What you been up to? \nWENDY Nothing. \nINT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. DAY \nWendy enters the house and climbs the stairs. \nShe sees the crumpled bed sheets in her parents' room and hears Elena in the shower. \nEXT. NEW CANAAN STATION. DAY \nPaul walks to the parking lot with his father, who carries his duffel bag. \nEXT. STREETS. DAY \nBen's car heading back to the house with Paul. \nINT. HOOD CAR. DAY \nBEN So how's school treating you? \nPAUL All right. \nBEN Classes? \nPAUL Good. \nBEN Grades? \nPAUL Fine. \nBEN Anyone special? You know... \nPAUL Hnnn. \nBEN Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh? \nPAUL Yeah. \nBEN You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well -- \nHe makes a sharp turn. Paul puts his arms up on the dashboard to steady himself. \nPAUL (nervous) About? \nBEN Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well... (pause) For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother -- \nThe shower is running, but Paul is standing by the open window, puffing on a joint and trying to blow the smoke outside. \nPAUL I'll be out in a second. \nBen walks back to the bedroom, smirking. \nBEN Sure you will. \nINT. HOOD DINING ROOM. DAY \nOne by one, each member of the Hood carried in a final item to place on the overstuffed Thanksgiving table. Then, one by one, they each silently take their seats. \nThey look over the table. No one moves. \nBEN Well, it's great we can all be together. And this Thanksgiving, no hysteria, no yelling, especially with grandpa not here, although we miss him. So let's do it right and actually, Wendy, why don't you say grace. You used to love to say grace, remember. \nWendy grimaces, as they all bow their heads slightly. \nWENDY Dear Lord, thank you for Thanksgiving, and for letting us white people kill all the Indians... \nEveryone looks up. \nWENDY (CONT'D) ... and steal their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs \nMutterings and groans: \"Wendy!\" \"For Christ's sake\" etc. \nWENDY (CONT'D) ... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and -- \nBEN Jesus all right enough! \nThey all unceremoniously start to dig in. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY \nJaney Williams is pouring Benjamin Hood a drink from a bottle of vodka. Benjamin is already unbuttoned and shoeless; Janey still fully dressed. \nJANEY Here. \nBEN After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one? \nJANEY In a bit. \nShe sits next to him, he kisses the back of her neck. \nBEN You know, I think Elena might suspect something. \nJaney gives him a rather contemptuous look. \nBEN (CONT'D) (thinking aloud) Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything? \nJANEY (almost ironic) Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her. \nBEN Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge. \nJaney gets up. \nJANEY I'll be back. \nBenjamin looks at her quizzically. \nBEN Huh? \nJANEY Birth control. \nBEN Right. Gotcha. \nShe leaves the room. \nHe leans back onto the bed. Sits back up. Takes a sip of vodka. Puts the glass down. Takes his socks off. He's now in just his jockey shorts and shirt. \nFaintly, he hears a door close. The front door? \nHe takes another sip. \nHe hears another sound. \nBEN (CONT'D) Janey? \nMIKEY Wendy! \nShe puts the mask on. \nWENDY (from behind the mask) I won't take my pants off. But I'll touch it. That's as far as it goes. \nMikey looks totally confused. \nRemaining fully clothed, Wendy loosens Mike's belt, showing no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top of her for a dry hump. \nJust then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down. \nMikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together, grabbing a TV Guide as Wendy stands up, the mask still on. \nAs Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his pants, pretends to flip through the TV Guide. \nMIKEY (muttering) When worlds collide. \nWENDY Huh? \nMIKEY 4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide. \nBen arrives, folds his arms. \nBEN What the hell are you kids doing down here? \nWENDY What do you think we're doing, dad? \nBEN What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood -- \nMIKEY Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood -- \nBEN Don't you direct a single word at me, Mikey. I don't want to hear it. I'll be speaking with your parents about this situation very soon. Bet your ass on that, son. Young lady? \nWENDY Talking to me, dad? \nBEN Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off! \nWENDY (pulling off the mask) Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff. \nBEN I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home. \nShe stands next to Mikey for a moment, both on the verge of tears. \nEXT. STREET. EVENING \nHood and Wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain. \nHe looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm. \nBEN Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all. \nWENDY Huh? \nBEN I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess... \nShe looks at him. They keep walking. She walks through a puddle. \nBEN (CONT'D) Your toes cold? \nWENDY Yeah. \nHe stops and lifts her in his arms. \nBEN I'll carry you up the drive. \nShe puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up. \nOn her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real intimacy. \nINT. HOOD FRONT HALL. EVENING \nHood and Wendy enter, wet and cold, muttering hellos. \nELENA (O.S.) (from the kitchen) Dinner in ten minutes. \nBEN You go dry off now. \nWendy heads for the stairs, Hood following. \nLIBBETS Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay? \nPaul and Francis exchange a look. \nShe puts an Allman Brothers tape on the 8-track and turns the TV down. \nINT. HOOD BATHROOM. DAY \nWendy enters the bathroom. \nShe fills the sink with water, then turns off the tap. She takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly, determinedly, holds it to her wrist. \nShe presses it into her skin, drawing a small drop of blood. \nWENDY Ouch! \nShe drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist, grabbing some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound. \nWENDY Stupid. \nShe hears the phone ring and walks downstairs. \nINT. HOOD DEN. NIGHT \nWendy picks up the phone. \nWENDY Hood residence. \nINT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. NIGHT \nMikey is on the other end of the line. \nMIKEY You're parents at that party? \nINTERCUT: \nWENDY Yeah. Yours? \nMIKEY You get in trouble? \nWENDY Maybe. Can't really tell yet. \nMIKEY I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to. \nWENDY Yeah. \nMIKE I'm going to Silver Meadow, check out the ice storm... You wanna come. \nWENDY Maybe. \nMIKE Yeah. OK. \nINT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT \nMikey, bundled up in a huge orange ski parka and cap, heads for the door. \nSANDY Where you going? \nMIKEY Out. \nSANDY It's freezing. \nMIKEY (pausing) Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean. \nSandy just looks at him. He walks out into the night. \nINT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT \nElena sits on a couch, talking to no one, barely looking up, when someone stands in front of her. \nELENA Reverend Edwards. \nPHILIP Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip? \nHe sits beside her. \nELENA You're here... I'm a bit surprised. \nPHILIP Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep. \nBOLAND Benjie, feeling no pain. \nBEN As the Indian saying goes, pain is merely an opinion. \nBOLAND (nodding across the room) Hey -- check it out. Maria Conrad's brought her son. (walking off) I wish some of the gang had brought their daughters! \nBen feels a wave of distaste at the joke. \nHe looks across the room as Maria and her son Neil (stringy hair, acne, tie-dyed turtleneck, patched jeans) are engaging Janey and Philip Edwards in conversation. \nINT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT \nPaul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the music blasting at full strength. \nLibbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of unconsciousness. Paul regards them with a look of apprehension on his face. \nINT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT \nNeil has now cornered Janey. \nNEIL As Werner says, there is nothing to get. That's It. When you get that there's nothing to get. That's the training, when you ask yourself, the question, \"What is is?\" \nJANEY Wait, this is the training, where they don't let you go to the bathroom? \nNEIL That was the hardest part. But I did it. And you get into some far out shit. \nINT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT \nLibbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed out on the floor in a corner. Francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings. \nFRANCIS The foot... the foot... toeclipper man... \nPaul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits at his feet, facing up to him. \nPAUL I guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff. \nLibbets is herself somewhat in dreamland. \nLIBBETS Yeah. \nPAUL You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you -- \nLIBBETS Yeah but you don't even know me really. \nPAUL Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off. \nLIBBETS My what? \nPAUL It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really -- \nLIBBETS And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special. \nPAUL You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you -- \nLIBBETS And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like -- \nPAUL AND LIBBETS (simultaneously) -- like a brother. \nPAUL Yeah, you're not alone with that line. \nLIBBETS I do. \nPAUL Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together? \nLIBBETS (consciousness fading fast) Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted. \nHer head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack dab between Paul's legs. \nShe begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch. \nPaul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. Then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body. \nHe looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy. \nINT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT \nThe crowd's a bit thinner than before. \nAs Dot Halford begins calling out for everyone's attention, a few couples make their last-minute way to the door. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nHelen Worthington approaches the bowl. Helen Worthington has the size and shape of a sumo wrestler. \nThere is a nervous shifting of weight on the male side of the room. \nHelen delicately reaches into the bowl. Her hands emerge with a key chain. \nGeorge Clair steps forward, obviously depressed, as a collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him. Ben looks on, momentarily triumphant. \nElena smiles to herself. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nThe Gadds choose each other. \nMRS. GADD Oh, my own husband. Isn't that against the rules? \nDOT Try again? \nMRS. GADD (relieved) Oh, I think not. \nMr. Gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go. \nFinally, only Mark Boland, Neil Conrad, Janey and Jim Williams, Rob and Dot Halford, Sari Steele, Benjamin and Elena. \nDOT Getting down to the wire! \nElena steps forward. Benjamin is obviously agitated. \nClose on Janey's hands selecting -- away from Ben's equine key ring. \nShe lifts up another key ring -- Neil Conrad, the teenager. \nShe hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they turn to go. \nJim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself. \nBen suddenly lurches forward, semi-drunkenly, trying to separate Neil from Janey. \nTHE GROUP (ad lib) Hey hey Ben, hang on there a sec. \nHe backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips over the coffee table. \nMark Boland helps lift him up. \nBEN Sorry... maybe I should... the bathroom? \nDOT Right down the hall, Ben. \nBEN (muttering) Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll be back. \nDot follows Mark Boland down the hall behind Ben. \nSuddenly, it's just Elena and Jim Williams, and Sari Steele and Rob Halford. \nROB HALFORD (taking Sari's arm) Actually, we didn't put our keys in at all. But you won't spread it around? It's my party, and Dot isn't... hey, we're just going to slip upstairs for a while. You folks like a cup of coffee or something before we go? \nElena and Jim look at each other. \nELENA Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves. You two go and get acquainted. We'll let ourselves out the front door. \nJim and Elena stand there alone. \nJIM Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around? \nELENA Let me. \nShe takes the bowl and dips her hand in. Two sets are left. One, her own, she avoids. She takes out Jim's keys and walks across the room, handing them to him. \nJIM Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening. \nELENA You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk. \nJIM Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really. \nThey sit down on the sofa. \nJIM You want coffee or something? \nShe sits on the toilet next to him, stroking his hair. \nELENA (CONT'D) You're in no condition to drive. We'll talk in the morning, OK? \nHe sits, accepting and quiet. \nELENA (CONT'D) You'll get some sleep on the couch out there? \nBEN (looking up at her, with gratitude) Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning? \nELENA We'll talk in the morning. \nEXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT \nWendy walks up the drive in the rain, pauses, then goes to the front door and knocks lightly. The door swings ajar. She pushes on it, and lets herself in. \nINT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT \nWENDY Anyone home? Hello. \nWendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps. The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her. \nShe goes into Mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster zone than usual. \nShe sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual) positions of the zodiac. \nShe notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out of the room. \nShe walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving the garter belt on the counter. \nShe opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and scoops some up in her finger. As she puts her finger in her mouth -- \nSANDY Wendy. \nShe gives out a little yelp. \nWENDY Sandy, you scared the shit out of me. \nSANDY What are you doing? \nWENDY Just thought I'd stop by. \nSANDY Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there. \nWENDY Yeah. \nSANDY (pause) Are you his girlfriend? \nWENDY No. \nINT. JIM'S CADILLAC. NIGHT \nElena gets in. They drive off silently. \nEXT. STREETS. NIGHT \nThe car moves haltingly through the sleet and ice, inches up a hill, then falters and slides back silently, circling a couple of times before crashing into an embankment. \nINT. CAR. NIGHT \nAs the car slides and crashes amid Jim's and Elena's screams. \nSilence. \nJIM You okay? \nELENA Yeah. You? \nJIM Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here. \nEXT. CAR. NIGHT \nJim and Elena get out, shaky, from the car. \nThey pause for a moment. \nThe street lamp above them sizzles, but stays on. \nThey start to walk. \nSANDY Communist Viet Cong. \nWENDY They left it in the jungle. \nThey speak with high seriousness. \nWendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits, a pillow on his lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels. \nWENDY Can I get into your bed? (pause) With you? \nSandy begins to shake. \nSANDY We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents? \nWENDY Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff. \nSandy begins to cry. \nSANDY It's just -- it's just -- \nShe takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down the hall, into the guest room. \nINT. GUEST ROOM. NIGHT \nWendy and Sandy enter. She sees the vodka bottle on the dresser. \nWENDY Want a drink? \nSANDY Vodka? \nWENDY You never tasted the stuff? \nShe fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to Sandy. \nThey clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the entire glass. \nSandy coughs and gags, but swallows. \nWENDY Try again. \nHe does. \nSANDY It feels warm. \nWENDY One more shot? \nSANDY Okay. \nThey drink. \nWENDY Under the covers. \nUnder they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges. \nWENDY (feeling her way) Get 'em off. \nSandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him. \nThey roll around on top of each other for a while. \nWENDY Have you ever had a nocturnal emission? \nSANDY Huh? \nWENDY That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream. \nSandy shakes his head. \nWENDY They didn't tell you this stuff yet? What planet do you live on? \nSandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and kisses her neck. \nSANDY I love you. \nWENDY That's nice. Are you drunk? \nSANDY I don't know. How do I know? \nWENDY I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down. \nThey look almost angelic. \nWendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes, slowly coming out of sleep. \nELENA (heartbroken, softly) Get dressed. \nElena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen. \nWendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping peacefully. \nShe looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up around him. \nINT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN \nElena and Jim are drinking coffee. \nELENA You should let him sleep. \nWendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults. \nWENDY Where's dad? \nINT. HOOD CAR. DAWN \nBen continues to drive slowly. He looks out his side window, and sees something. He puts on his brakes. \nEXT. STREET. DAWN \nBen gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy embankment. In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka. \nHe walks hesitantly toward it. Mike's body lies face down in the wet ice. \nBen leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock. \nHe stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up, carrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's house. \nHe bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from time to time, then gets back up. \nINT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN \nVarious passengers asleep. \nPaul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light, cold. He reads his comic book by the light of the emergency exit. \"DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WORLD!\" \nSuddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns. \nThe conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal train conductor voice. \nCONDUCTOR Good morning ladies and gentlemen -- \nOn Paul, squinting in the harsh light. \nEXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN \nThe train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape. On the street below the bridge, an emergency highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in flashing yellow lights. \nINT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN \nElena pours Wendy a cup of coffee. They're both in their coats. \nWENDY I don't like coffee. \nELENA It'll warm you up. \nElena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and sip the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements. \nINT. GUEST ROOM. DAWN \nJim watches the sleeping Sandy, picks up the half-empty bottle of vodka, pours himself a drink. The noise wakes Sandy up. Jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip. \nSANDY Dad? \nJim looks at him. \nINT. KITCHEN. DAWN \nElena and Wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see what it is. \nEXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAWN \n", "test1_input": "BEN Hey! \nWendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up over her head. He stands over her, looking down at the crumpled pile of sheet and blanket. \nBEN (CONT'D) (softening) Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh. \nHe places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses the sheet. \nWENDY (without pulling the sheet down, but nicely) Good-night dad. \nBEN Good night kiddo. \nBen turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face. \nINT. HOOD BEDROOM. NIGHT \nElena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of the bed. We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and see Ben emerge in his boxers. He pauses in front of the bed, looking at Elena. \nELENA (without opening her eyes) You're staring at me. \nBEN I wasn't star-- \nELENA I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens. \nBEN That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him. \nELENA I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok? \nBEN Why shouldn't she be? \nElena just gives him a look, more sad than angry. \nBEN (CONT'D) (pause) Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our... \nELENA So maybe you'll come too? \nBEN Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them. \nELENA It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you. \nBEN Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that \"I'm OK. You're OK\" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and -- \nELENA -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision -- \nBEN Elena. \nSilence. \nELENA (sighing) Sleep in the study? Please. \nBen picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at the door. \nBEN Good night. \nELENA Good night. \nINT. WENDY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nWendy hears her parents' door close and sees a strip of light illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on, then off. \nEXT. MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING. DAY \nA nondescript, cleanly \"modern\" building. Engraved on the doors: \"Shackley and Schwimmer, Securities Brokerage - Established 1964\" \nINT. SHACKLEY AND SCHWIMMER CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY \nBen, seated, is finishing a brief presentation to a small group of men, which includes George Clair, mid-thirties, unctuously handsome. \nBEN But what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it? Well -- and I hope I'm not out of bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ, continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more. As the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues, the money-organ may seem to be in demand, but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted. This is why I suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital appreciation. \nThe aging boss nods agreement. \nSHACKLEY (more or less mumbling) Brilliant, brilliant. \nGeorge Clair just grins. \nINT. BEN HOOD'S OFFICE. DAY \nBen is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to see George Clair in his doorway. \n", "test1_true": "INTERCUT HALL IN FRONT OF BEN HOOD'S OFFICE \nAs we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the moment from Ben's view. \nBen comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some sense of what's transpiring between them. \nBEN George, I'm just trying to get a global view of things -- can't just look at the small picture. \nThere's an obvious rivalry between the two of them. \nGEORGE And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about? \nBEN Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself? \nGEORGE Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist? \nBEN Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top. \nGEORGE Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today? \nBEN Got a meeting uptown. \nGEORGE (already moving off) Right o'. \nBEN Up the organization!

DAY \nA stuffy, Ivy League atmosphere. A decades-old tradition of serving overcooked American food. Ben is seated across from his father, Harold Hood, a retired curmudgeon. There is a walker parked by Harold's chair. \nHAROLD (waylaying a passing waiter) I'd asked for that double martini about three hours ago! \nWAITER Coming right up, sir. \nHAROLD So asking me out for lunch -- what prompted this exceptional event? -- Of course I'm paying. \nBEN We don't have to always go to your club, dad. \nHAROLD And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and -- \nBEN -- Well what am I supposed to call you? \nHAROLD That's besides the point. \nThe martini arrives, along with Ben's beer. \nBEN I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know -- \nHAROLD Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you? \nBEN You know, dah-- \nHe looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not paying attention. \nBEN (CONT'D) Actually it's not about work, it's advice about -- \nHAROLD Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- \nBEN Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but -- \nHAROLD -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought -- \nBEN But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each -- \nHAROLD -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad? (back to Ben) You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice -- \nBEN -- What advice? You never -- \nHAROLD That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 -- \nBEN \nHAROLD -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance. \n", "test2_input": "ELENA It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup. \nBEN What do you mean? \nELENA Don't be dim. \nBEN Elena, what are you're talking about? \nELENA I'm not surprised. \nBEN Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again -- \nELENA Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it. \nBEN (quieter) Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say? \nELENA It's a starting place. \nBEN Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after? \nELENA If you're going to insult me -- \nBEN What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here. \nSilence. \nBEN (CONT'D) It's the law of the land... the government, the world, those two guys on the Yankees...

And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like. \nBEN (whispering) Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean. \nELENA Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it? \nSeemingly tired, he stands before her. Silence. Elena sighs, then walks into the den. \nINT. DEN. NIGHT \nELENA We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around \nWENDY (eyes still glued to the TV) Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party? \nELENA I suppose. Why? \nWENDY Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt. \nELENA What sort of problems are you planning exactly? \nElena kisses the top of her head. \nWENDY (still watching the TV) Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know. \nELENA Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning. \nEXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT \nElena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a darkening, foreboding sky. A light rain falls. They jog toward their car. \nINT/EXT. HOOD CAR.

A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already? \nELENA Well? \nBEN I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home. \nELENA Damn it, Ben -- \nBEN I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that -- \nELENA You're not going to -- \nBEN I'm not. \nELENA You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch -- \nBEN Elena. \nShe rubs her eyes. \nBEN (CONT'D) Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know -- \nELENA Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession. \nBEN Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up. \nELENA Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you. \nShe pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car, and slams the door. He follows her. \nINT. HALFORD FOYER. NIGHT \nELENA Oh, Dot! \nElena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot Halford, who looks surprised. \nHood slides in behind his wife. \nDot drops the keys into the bowl. \nSlow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall in with a THUNDEROUS CRASH. \nINT. HALFORD LIVING ROOM. CONT'D \nThe room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and various groupings. \nElena slips into a side room. \nBenjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none other than George Clair. \nGEORGE Benjie! \nBEN Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan? \n", "test3_input": "GEORGE Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that! \nBEN Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh? \nGEORGE Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work? \nBEN Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey. \nGEORGE Yeah, good. \nBenjamin catches a glimpse of Janey, voluptuously attired, across the room. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy. \nBEN Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. (beat) Say, where's the wife? \nGEORGE (winking as he goes) In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight. \nAt this, they both notice Elena slowly gliding across the other side of the room. Clair gives Ben a sideways glance, then moves on. \nBen makes straight for Janey, who pretends to be preoccupied with a plant. \nJANEY Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are. \nBEN Damn right, but where the hell were you? \nJANEY (looking around) What are you talking about? \nBEN (whispering, but too loudly) Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened? \nJaney takes a sip of her drink. \nJANEY A prior engagement overcame me. \nBEN What? \nJANEY Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy. \nBEN Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband -- \nJANEY How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry -- \nBEN I just can't believe you could be so -- \nStalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and wander off. \nThe air is filled with talk of Watergate, Billie Jean King, the Oil Crisis, the Mets. \nBenjamin goes over to the couch, where Dave Gorman is chatting up an attractive younger woman. \nGORMAN (lighting up a joint) Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions. \nBEN (waving it away) Thanks for the advice Dave. \nBut then, Benjamin changes his mind. \nBEN (CONT'D) Uh, well, what the hey... \nTaking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his lungs. \nBEN (CONT'D) (coughing) Good shit. \nGORMAN Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other -- \nBEN It's what? \nGORMAN Don't fret, Benjie, it's -- \nBEN Darn it, Dave. \nHe rises unsteadily, weaving through the room's conversations. \nJACK MOELLERING Take California. They've got their own airline in-state that's not subject to the fare controls. Compare Sacramento to L.A. on the controlled airlines and you'll see what Friedman is saying -- supply and demand, less restriction. \nBenjamin walks over to a window. The outdoor lamps illuminate a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet. \nINT. CONRAIL TRAIN. NIGHT \nPaul is seated, reading the latest number of The Fantastic Four comic book. The cover displays a lurid, atomically glowing baby. \n", "test3_true": "CONDUCTOR Approaching our final stop, Grand Central Station. \nPaul looks out the window at the tenements of Harlem, barely visible through the walls of sleet. Soon the train enters the tunnel toward the station. \nEXT. PARK AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING. NIGHT \nPaul gets out of a cab and heads inside. He's met by the doorman. \nPAUL Libbets Casey, please. \nDOORMAN Your name? \nPAUL Paul Hood. \nDOORMAN (a smirk) Elevator on the right. Eighth floor -- she's waiting for you. \nINT. HALL IN FRONT OF LIBBETS' APARTMENT DOOR. NIGHT \nPaul rings the bell. \nLIBBETS (O.S.) (from the other side of the door) Open it Paul! \nPaul opens the door, and enters the apartment. \nINT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT \nIt's half dark, has an air of old wealth. \nLibbets skids across the parquet floor to him. \nLIBBETS Excellent. We were waiting! \nShe turns and runs into the den. \nPAUL (under his breath) We? \nAnd there, in the den, cleaning an ounce of dope on an open copy of Nixon's Six Crises, is -- Francis. \nFRANCIS (lifting the book up) You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff. \nPAUL (all hope drained from him) Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that? \nFRANCIS All will be revealed, baby. \nThe television is turned on to a weather report about the coming ice storm. \nFRANCIS (CONT'D) Awesome sleet and rain. \nLIBBETS Major. \nFRANCIS Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead? \nPAUL Huh? \nFRANCIS (nasal voice, impersonating a TV character) Moisture! Moisture! \nLIBBETS (pointing) Beer. In the pantry. \nPaul trudges disconsolately out of the room. \nINT. LIBBETS KITCHEN. NIGHT \nPaul, after wandering a maze of halls, enters the kitchen, where he takes a six-pack out of the fridge and returns to the living room. \nINT. LIBBETS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nHe enters the room with the beer. \nLIBBETS Frankie opens them with his teeth. \nPAUL (handing him a beer) Hey, it's a sellable skill. \nFrancis licks closed a second joint, then takes the beer and opens it with his rear molars. \nFRANCIS Hell on the fillings. \nPaul opens the other two beers and hands one to Libbets. They light up a joint. \nFRANCIS Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze. \n"}

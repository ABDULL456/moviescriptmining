But being in that theater, surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts, there was something in the air that -- \nJUMP CUT: \nThe boys are pouring wine. \nJIM -- pulls right up to the pump, jumps out like there's no gas shortage, oblivious, and by this point everybody in line's piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy, when they notice it's that Reverend Edwards -- \nBEN The Unitarian? The new one? \nJIM Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek Road and didn't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile. \nBEN He's either got his head in the clouds or up his -- \nDOROTHY I hear he's slept with half the women in his congregation -- \nTED Lucky bastard! \nAs this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben. \nBEN Hell! -- I mean, no problemo there Mikey. Here, I -- \nJaney leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe of Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is, Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice. \nCUT TO: \nThe boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out coffee and dessert. The adults eye Mikey's handling of the coffee pot with some nervousness. \nDOROTHY (unconvincing) So fascinating. Do you get free tickets to the movies, that kind of thing? \nBEN No, my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their money. It's -- \nELENA Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- \nBEN (with a bit too much conviction) And as usual no one believed me... \nSilence. \nCUT TO: \nThe dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the table. She stacks a plate on top of another. \nJANEY Please don't. \nELENA It's not a bother. \nJANEY I insist. (beat) Don't touch them. \nElena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice. \nELENA Oh. \nJANEY (realizing she's gone too far) It's really quite all right. \nELENA Of course. \nINT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nThe party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight. \nDOROTHY And to think -- they met at a key party of all things. \nELENA A key party? \nDOROTHY You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic. \nJANEY Ironic? \nDOROTHY (caught out) Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is Rod. \nINT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT \nThe guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss, and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks. \nELENA Thank you Janey. \n", "test1_true": "BEN Hey Jim, next time you've got to fill me in on whatever it is you're up to these days. \nJIM Will do. \nINT. STAIRWAY. NIGHT \nAt the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey finish spying on the leave-takings below. Mikey nudges Sandy, and they silently head back the upstairs hall. \nINT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT \nThey enter Mike's room -- the door has a \"nuclear waste positively no admittance\" sign on it. \nAs Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and starts to make retching noises. He then throws himself onto the bed, his head leaning over the far side. \nSandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed. Taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks it up -- it's fake plastic vomit. He throws it on top of Mike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice. \nSANDY Stupid! (pause, looking sullenly at Mike's back) Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend? \nMIKEY (not looking up, but alarmed) Who said so? \nSANDY No one. \nMIKEY I don't have a girlfriend. \nMikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman, obviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose. As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING SOUND begins to fill his ears. He frowns and pauses to listen to it. \nSandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane, obviously doesn't hear it. \nMikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air. Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars through the sky... \nINT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nThere is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon \"Tricky Dick\" -- on her wall. Wendy is on the phone to her friend Beth. \nWENDY -- he knows that when the March 24th tape -- you know with Dean, where Dean tells him that there's a cancer growing on the presidency -- \nShe pauses as Beth asks a question. \nWENDY (CONT'D) Who? No way. He's like a big infected whitehead wearing jeans. I wouldn't -- \nShe hears the downstairs door open. \nWENDY (CONT'D) (whispering) -- shit, it's my parents. \nShe turns her light out. \nINT. HOOD UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT \nBen and Elena walking past Wendy's room to their bedroom. \nBEN You'd think she'd learn how to cook a chicken, eh? My drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there. I'm probably going to get whatever that disease -- and Jim, how that guy ever became a millionaire -- \nHe pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the telephone cord under Wendy's room. \nBEN (CONT'D) Hmm. I knew she'd still be up. Watch this -- \nBut Elena simply continues into the master bedroom. \nHe starts to pull gently on the cord. And continues pulling. No response for a few seconds. Then: \nCONTINUED: 25 \nWENDY (O.S.) (yelling behind her door) Dad stop it! \nBEN Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it. \nWendy opens the door to her room. \nWENDY Fascist! \nBEN If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed. \nShe slams the door. \nHe opens it. \nINT. WENDY'S BEDROOM.

Your mom was pretty p.o.'d. \nSANDY All my model planes. \nWENDY The ones you built? \nSANDY They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up. \nWENDY I have to go to the bathroom. \nSANDY Yeah. \nBut he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the doorway. \nWendy looks around -- no one in sight. \nWENDY I'll show you mine if you show me yours. \nSandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into the bathroom like a feather. \nINT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY \nMikey looks up from the TV, wondering where Wendy is. He eats another Pringle. \nINT. WILLIAMS BATHROOM. DAY \nWendy flips up her dress for Sandy. \nHe slowly unzips, his hand unsteady. We can tell from the look on Wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the little guy. \nSuddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears. \nSANDY What do you want?! What do you want? Get out! Get out of here! \nThe door flips open -- and Janey Williams appears. \nJANEY (sizing up the situation) Shit. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM. DAY \nJaney is giving Wendy a lecture \nJANEY A person's body is his temple, Wendy. This body is your first and last possession. Now as your own parents have probably told you, in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us. That's why, in Samoa and in other developing nations, adolescents are sent out into the woods, unarmed, and they don't come back until they've learned a thing or two. \nINT. WILLIAMS HOUSE DOORWAY. DAY \nWendy is led to the door by Mrs. Williams. \nWendy trades a glance with a sullen Mikey, who sits in the living room pretending to ignore her. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nWendy walks her bike with the wind in her face. \nFrom behind her, Mikey rides up on his bike and rides alongside her. \nShe doesn't look at him. \nTrying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles, nearly falling off. \nMIKEY I don't ever want to see you. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY \nThe taxi pulls up. Elena gets out and pays the driver. \nINT. HOOD KITCHEN. DAY \nBen is in front of the open freezer, trying to get something out. He hears Elena come in the front door. \nBEN Elena. I need some help here if this thing's gonna defrost by tomorrow. \nShe comes up and together they tug and pull until they succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey. As they pull it out, it slips from their hands and, after a dull thump, slides along the floor. \nThey smile. \nElena bends over to pick it up. Ben observes her. She notices his look. \nBEN (CONT'D) Here. \nHe goes over and picks up the turkey, placing it in the sink. He looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look. \nBEN (CONT'D) You all right there? \nELENA Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce? \nBEN Um, yes. \nThey stand together, his concern and her vulnerability forming an awkward attraction between them. \nELENA Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches. \nBEN I do. I'm -- are you...? \nELENA I... I think I am... \nBEN (pause) You know Elena, I've been thinking-- \nELENA Ben, maybe no talking right now?

HOOD BEDROOM. DAY \nBen and Elena undress shyly. \nThey make love. Elena's face is almost fearful. \nCUT TO: \nElena and Ben lie in bed side by side in the pale afternoon light. Neither speaks. Ben turns on his side, and notices a small tear forming in Elena's eyes. \nBEN You crying? \nELENA I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know... \nBEN (gently making light) Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was -- \nELENA No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben. (beat) What is going to happen with us? Have you -- \nBEN You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did? \nELENA I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children. \nBEN (pause, sitting up) Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got -- (looks at watch) Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot. \nHe gets up and starts to get dressed. \nELENA You were saying? \nHe smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on. \nBEN Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday. \nELENA That shirt? \nBEN What? \n", "test2_id": 2869, "test3_input": "BOLAND Benjie, feeling no pain. \nBEN As the Indian saying goes, pain is merely an opinion. \nBOLAND (nodding across the room) Hey -- check it out.

LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT \nPaul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the music blasting at full strength. \nLibbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of unconsciousness. Paul regards them with a look of apprehension on his face. \nINT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT \nNeil has now cornered Janey. \nNEIL As Werner says, there is nothing to get. That's It. When you get that there's nothing to get. That's the training, when you ask yourself, the question, \"What is is?\" \nJANEY Wait, this is the training, where they don't let you go to the bathroom? \nNEIL That was the hardest part. But I did it. And you get into some far out shit. \nINT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT \nLibbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed out on the floor in a corner. Francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings. \nFRANCIS The foot... the foot... toeclipper man... \nPaul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits at his feet, facing up to him. \nPAUL I guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff. \nLibbets is herself somewhat in dreamland. \nLIBBETS Yeah. \nPAUL You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you -- \nLIBBETS Yeah but you don't even know me really. \nPAUL Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off. \nLIBBETS My what? \nPAUL It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really -- \nLIBBETS And I have a special feeling too, because I do.

Cool. So, how about we take a bath together? \nLIBBETS (consciousness fading fast) Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted. \nHer head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack dab between Paul's legs. \nShe begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch. \nPaul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. Then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body. \nHe looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy. \nINT. HALFORD'S.

Where are you? \nPAUL I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and -- \nWENDY And? \nPAUL Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train. \nWENDY Right. \nPAUL What are you doing at home on a Friday night? \nWENDY I have plans. \nPaul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets. \nLibbets' Allman Brothers tape has run out. The machine makes a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to circle. The only other sound is the noise of the wind and rain lashing against the apartment's windows. \nEXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT \nWendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the ice makes it too slippery. The storm is now in full swing. She gets off and walks. \nEXT. STREET.

Lowest handicap does the honors. \nNervous laughter. \nDOT Golf handicap? Ladies, isn't it up to you? \nMARIA CONRAD Oh I'll go first, damn it.

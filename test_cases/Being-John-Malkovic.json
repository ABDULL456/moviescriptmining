{"train": "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman \nBEING JOHN MALKOVICH \nA Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman \nINT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY \nThe room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled \"Sit.\" Craig opens the book. It reads: \"sit sit sit sit sit...\" over and over, page after page. Craig closes the book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs. He looks at the book again. It is now entitled \"Die.\"  He opens it up.  \"die die die die die...\"  A rooster crows. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nCraig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest, crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest. \nLOTTE Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his pen. Good morning. \nLotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead. \nCRAIG Morning. \nLOTTE Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing. \nCRAIG Enjoy. \nLOTTE Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something. \nCRAIG We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate. \nLOTTE Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. \nCRAIG (bitterly) The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job. \nLOTTE (sighs) Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. (beat) Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor? \nCRAIG What? \nLOTTE Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning. \nCRAIG Which one is Elijah again? \nLOTTE The monkey. \nCRAIG Yeah. Okay. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING \nThe place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet version of Craig. The \"Craig\" puppet paces back and forth, wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig, above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet. His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on the real Craig\u0092s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower. The assembled crowd is enthralled. \nTV ANNOUNCER The crowd is enthralled as Derek Mantini, arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world, performs \"The Belle of Amherst\" with his 60 foot Emily Dickinson puppet, directed by the inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly. \nCharles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon. \nCHARLES NELSON REILLY Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong. \nCRAIG Gimmicky bastard. \nCraig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs his chin in thought, then stands with great determination. \nMUSIC IN: TRIUMPHANT \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCraig searches through Lotte's closet, looking for the right dress. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BATHROOM - DAY \nLESTER (crafty) You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph? \nCRAIG Glooph is not a letter, sir. \nLESTER Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order. \nLester hands Craig a bunch of index cards. Craig orders them with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches, eyes wide. \nLESTER (CONT'D) (flips intercom switch) Floris, get Guinness on the phone. \nFLORIS (O.S.) Gehginnis ondah foam? \nLESTER Forget it. \nFLORIS (CONT'D) Fork ah did? \nLESTER (flips off switch) Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine. \nCRAIG You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester. \nLESTER Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, \"I can't understand a word any of you are saying.\" \nCRAIG No. \nLESTER Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. (beat) I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz. \nCRAIG No. I understand perfectly. \nLESTER (choking up) Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions? \nCRAIG Just one. Why is this floor so short? \nLESTER Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. (laughs heartily) But seriously, that's all covered in orientation. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY \nIt's a small screening room with red velvet seats. There are a few people scattered about the squat theater. Craig is among them. He looks around the room and his eyes rest momentarily on Maxine. She is in her late 20's with close cropped black hair. Her eyes are opaque, her face expressionless, her countenance trance-like. She glances over at Craig, then turns back to the screen. The lights dim. A projector whirs and the screen is illuminated. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nWe tilt up the building. \nMUSIC:\tPerky Industrial Film Music. \nTITLE:\tThe 7 1/2 Floor \nNARRATOR (0.S.) Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin-Flemmer building. As you will now be spending your work day here, it is important that you learn a bit about the history of this famous floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY \nDon and Wendy, two office workers, crouch in the hall and chat. Both hold cups of coffee. \nWENDY Hello, Don. \nDON Hello. Wendy. \nWENDY Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings? \nDON It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building. \nCUT TO: \nOLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING. \nDON (CONT'D) (V.0.) He would call this building the Mertin-Flemmer Building, after himself and someone else, who, local legend has it, was named Flemmer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. 19TH CENTURY OFFICE - DAY \nAn actor playing Mertin sits at a desk and writes with aquill. He appears very stern and has mutton chop sideburns. \nDON (CONT'D) (V.0.) One day. Captain Mertin received an unexpected visitor. \nLotte grabs the parrot off her head and leaves the room. \nPARROT (0.S.) Help! She's locking me in a cage! \nLotte reenters. \nLOTTE Isn't that cute? I just taught her that. \nCRAIG Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here? \nLOTTE Seven-ish \nCRAIG We have to make it an early night. \nLOTTE They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach. \nCRAIG (not paying attention) Hmmm. \nLOTTE Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh? \nCRAIG Hmmm. \nThe doorbell rings. The dog barks. The parrot screams. The neighbor pounds on the wall. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe dining room table is set up. Craig and Lotte and their friends Peter and Gloria are seated and eating dinner. There is an obvious lull in the conversation. \nPETER Good food, Lotte. \nLOTTE Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the way. \nPETER Vegetarian, right? \nLOTTE Yes. All vegetable. all the time. \nPETER Amazing. \nThere is another lull. Everyone eats. \nPETER (CONT'D) No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor. Craig? \nCRAIG No kidding, Peter. \nGLORIA That's great. It almost sounds like make-believe. (beat) Like a storybook. (beat) like a fairy tale. (beat) It's really great. (beat) So Lotte, when you say all vegetable, do you mean all vegetable entire1y? \nCUT TO: \nINT. PETER AND GLORIA'S CAR - NIGHT \nGloria and Peter drive in silence. \nGLORIA Lotte told me that Eskimos have a lot of words for snow. \nPETER How many? \nGLORIA Ten, I think. \nPETER I wonder why so many. \nGLORIA Because they have a lot of snow. Isn't that interesting? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCraig washes the dishes. Lotte dries them. They don\u0092t look at each other. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTERCORP FILE ROOM - MORNING \nCraig in a cream colored suit, pours over the file cabinets. Floris watches from the doorway. \nFLORIS You're good. \nCraig turns. \nCRAIG Hi. \nLOTTE Hi. \nCRAIG (nervous, talking too much) Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We\u0092re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is. \nThere is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah. Finally: \nLOTTE Did you eat? \nCRAIG Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away. \nLOTTE I was worried. \nCRAIG I'm sorry. How was your evening? \nLOTTE Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected. \nCRAIG The ferret? \nLOTTE The iguana. \nCRAIG Right. \nLOTTE I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed. \nCRAIG Yeah. You want a beer? \nLOTTE No thanks. I'm going to turn in. \nCRAIG All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. (beat) I'll be in soon. A little while. \nLOTTE 'kay. \nLotte exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nCraig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice. \nCRAIG (as Maxine, fascinated) Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering? (as Craig) Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. (as Maxine) Interesting. Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel what I feel? (as Craig) More than anything. Maxine. (as Maxine) It's good in here, Craig. Better than your wildest dreams. \nThe puppets kiss. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY \nCraig waits at the coffee machine. Checks his watch. Finally Maxine approaches. \nCRAIG Hi. \nMAXINE You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls. \nCRAIG (rehearsed) Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see... \nMAXINE Yikes. \nCRAIG Please, let me explain. \nCraig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty office. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMPTY OFFICE - DAY \nCraig pulls Maxine in closes the door. \nCRAIG It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine. \nMAXINE You might want to check those tarot cards one more time. \nMaxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across it. \nCRAIG Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor. \nCraig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a dark and wet membranous tunnel inside. \nCraig opens the little door and climbs into the membranous hallway. The door slams shut behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nIt's dark and wet. The walls are soft and membranous. There is a dripping sound. Craig crawls along. Soon something starts to pull Craig as if he is being sucked through a straw. There is a flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FANCY DINING ROOM - MORNING \nThe POV of someone reading a newspaper. The person lifts a cup of coffee to his mouth. There is a slurping sound. The person puts down the coffee cup and the newspaper, and stands up. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.) (losing his balance) Whoa! What the hell? Where am I? \nWe're still in POV. The person walks across the room, picks up his wallet from a coffee table. looks in a mirror and checks his teeth for food. It's John Malkovich. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) (V.0.) Holy shit! It's that actor guy. Shit! What's his name? That actor guy! What's happening? Am I inside him? Am I in his brain? Am I him? Is he me? Does he know I'm here? My brain is reeling! Is his brain reeling? \nMalkovich walks to the front door, opens it, exits his apartment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMaxine sits at her desk, eats a sandwich. looks at a fashion magazine, and chats on the phone. \nMAXINE The puppeteer told me he loves me today. (laughs) I know. I can't think of anything more pathetic. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS \nJohn Malkovich's POV from the back seat of the cab. The cab pulls away from the curb. \nMALKOVICH (V.0.) (resonant throughout) The Broadhurst Theater, please. \nThe cabbie studies Malkovich in his rearview mirror as he drives. \nCABBIE Say, aren't you that actor guy? \nMALKOVICH Yeah. \nCABBIE John Makel... \nCRAIG (V.0.) John Malkovich! Of course! \nCABBIE Mapplethorpe? \nMALKOVICH (V.0.) Malkovich. \nCABBIE Malkovich! \nCRAIG (V.0.) John fucking Malkovich! \nCABBIE Yeah. I liked you in that one movie. \nMALKOVICH (V.0.) Thank you. \nCABBIE The one where you're that jewel thief. \nMALKOVICH I never played a jewel thief. \nCABBIE Who am I thinking of? \nMALKOVICH I don't know. \nCABBIE I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan! \nMALKOVICH Yeah, okay. \nThe cabbie hands a pad back over the seat. Malkovich reaches for it. There is a slurping sound. \nCRAIG (V.0.) (panicky) Ahhhh! \nThe image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black. \nCUT TO: \nCRAIG (nervously) Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. \nLOTTE Now? \nCRAIG Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nCraig holds open the small door as Lotte climbs in. \nCRAIG I'll meet you on the turnpike. \nLOTTE I'm scared. \nThe door slams shut. \nCRAIG Me too, babe. \nCraig hurries out the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMalkovich is in the shower. We watch from his POV as he soaps himself. He does this in a sensual manner. \nLOTTE (V.0.) Holy cow! \nMalkovich steps out of the shower, slowly towels himself dry. \nLOTTE (V.0.) Oh, yes. Yes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - NIGHT \nLotte lands in the ditch. She is wet and ragged. Traffic whizzes by. Craig turns on the headlights in his parked car. They shine on Lotte. Craig steps out of the car. \nLOTTE I have to go back. \nCRAIG Okay. Maybe tomorrow. \nLOTTE I have to go back now. \nCRAIG We'll talk about it in the car. \nCraig helps Lotte up and toward the car. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT \nCraig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window. \nLOTTE I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was. \nCRAIG You weren't you. You were John Malkovich. \nLOTTE (tickled) I was, wasn't I? (yelling out the window) I was John fucking Malkovich! (laughs, then intensely) Take me back, Craig. \nCRAIG Tomorrow. We're late for Lester. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras. Lester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed table with all different sorts of juices in front of them. Lotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her. \nLESTER Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying? \nLOTTE Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. \nLESTER Oh, be still my heart. \nLOTTE Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom? \nLESTER With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know. \nCRAIG (cont'd) (beat) It's just the thrill of seeing through someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll pass. \nLOTTE Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig. \nMAXINE (hanging up the phone) Let her go, Craig. I mean \u0093him.\" \nCRAIG (anything for Maxine) Yeah, okay. (opens the portal door) I'll pick you up. \nLotte enters. Craig closes the door. stands there. \nMAXINE You better hurry. Traffic. \nMaxine tosses Craig his car keys. He heads out the door.

JOHN MALKOVICH'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMalkovich's POV. He sits on the couch. drinks coffee, and reads a copy of Awake and Sing. Bach plays on the stereo in the background. \nMALKOVICH (reading aloud) So you believe in God... you got something for it? You worked for all the capitalists. You harvested the fruit from your labor? You got God! \nLOTTE (V.0.) What raw, animal power! \nMALKOVICH But the past comforts you? The present smiles on you, yes? \nThe phone rings. Malkovich puts down the script, and picks up the phone. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) (into phone) Yeah? \nMAXINE (0.S.) (telephone voice) Mr. Malkovich? \nMALKOVICH Who's calling? \nMAXINE (0.S.) You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours. \nMALKOVICH How'd you get this number? \nMAXINE (0.S.) It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and... \nLOTTE (0.S.) (turned on) Oh, I like this. \nMALKOVICH Listen, this is not amusing. Please don't call here any... \nMAXINE (0.S.) (giggling) Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are at attention, General Malkovich, sir. So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at eight. Please, please meet me there. I just adored you in that jewel thief movie... \nMalkovich hangs up the phone. \nLOTTE (V.O.) My God! (attempting thought control) Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there... \nMalkovich goes back to his script. \nLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her there... \nMalkovich picks up a pen and writes: Bernardo's 8:00. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - MORNING \nCraig waits. Lotte pops into the ditch.

CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING \nIt is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks. The wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every once in a while looking up and discreetly checking out Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door. \nCRAIG (a little too urgently) Come in! \nErroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly. \nERROLL Hello, I'm here about the ad. \nCRAIG Please, have a seat. \nErroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He glances nervously over at Maxine. \nERROLL When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly? \nCRAIG Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes. \nERROLL Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no! \nMAXINE No. \nERROLL Long term psychic or physiological repercussions? \nMAXINE No. Don't be an ass. \nERROLL Can I be anyone I want? \nMAXINE You can be John Malkovich. \nERROLL Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant!

Thousand times, thank you! \nCRAIG (gasping for air) Tell your friends. \nERROLL Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous.

We're gonna be rich! \nMAXINE So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein. \nCraig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door behind him, locks it. \nLESTER You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. (nods to Maxine) Ma'am \nCRAIG Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about. \nLESTER There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly. \nCRAIG You're insane. \nThey look at each other and laugh, them fall back into the embrace. They both get faraway looks in their eyes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nThe clock reads 3:00 AM. Craig, in his pajamas, is working the Craig and Maxine puppets. They make love on the bare puppet stage.

CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT \nLotte drives. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - A BIT LATER \nThe doorbell rings. Maxine, in a sheer black nightgown, answers it. John Malkovich stands there. \nMAXINE Thanks so much for coming over. \nMALKOVICH Oh, I'm really glad you called. \nMaxine gestures for him to enter. As Malkovich passes by her, she checks the wall clock. The time is 3:50. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nLotte sits on the floor in the dark.

It's very rewarding... \nThe digital clock on the VCR clicks over to 4:11 AM. Maxine's look softens, and she kisses Malkovich hard on the lips. He seems surprised, but quickly warms to it. We shift top Malkovich's POV as Maxine begins to unbutton Malkovich's shirt. \nLOTTE (V.O.) Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. \nMAXINE I love you, Lotte. \nLOTTE (V.O.) Maxine... \nMALKOVICH (stopping) I'm sorry, did you just call me \"Lotte\"? \nMAXINE Do you mind? \nMALKOVICH (thinking) No, I guess not. I'm an actor. \nThey get back to it. \nMAXINE Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte. \nMALKOVICH (thinks he's playing along) Yes, Maxine, yes. \nLOTTE (V.O.) This is too good to be true. \nLESTER Thank you, Floris. \nFLORIS (O.S.) (intercom voice) Think, Jew florist? \nLESTER (pressing line 2) Good morning, Lotte! \nLOTTE (O.S.)

JUICY-JUICE JUICE BAR - MORNING \nLester and Lotte sit at a table. They both have really large glasses of carrot juice in front of them. \nLOTTE I blew it, Dr. Lester. \nLESTER You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. \nLOTTE But now we've lost access to Craig. \nLESTER (laughs) My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCraig stands still and tense, with gun in hand. We hear the front door unlock. Lotte enters. She does not see Craig. He grabs her from behind as she passes. Lotte screams. Craig holds the gun to her head. \nLOTTE I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head? \nCRAIG Yeah, well welcome to the nineties. \nLOTTE Suck my dick! \nCRAIG (slapping her) Shut up! \nLotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead. She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his ear to the receiver also. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) Tell her you need to see her. \nLOTTE (to Craig) You bastard. \nCraig cocks the pistol. \nMAXINE (V.O.) J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be. \nLOTTE (looking at Craig) I have to see you. \nMAXINE (V.O.) Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers. \nCRAIG (sotto) Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously. \nLOTTE What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously. \nMAXINE (V.O.) Oooh, doll. I love this new devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty, I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll see both of you in one hour. Exactamundo. \nMaxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed, and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter. \nLOTTE (screaming) Help! He's locking me in a cage! \nCraig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly. \nNEIGHBOR Shut up! \nPARROT Shut up! \nCRAIG Lesson number one:  Be careful what you teach your parrot. \nCraig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah watches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and holds his stomach. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - NIGHT \nThere is a pop and Craig lands in the ditch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes. \nMALKOVICH Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here. \nMAXINE Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold. \nMALKOVICH No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go. \nHe leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs contentedly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound and gagged. \nCRAIG I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm across your girlfriend's glorious tit. I made him talk. And, oh, there was the beginning of sensation in the fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a matter of practice before Malkovich becomes nothing more than another puppet hanging next to my worktable. Coffee? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMalkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand. Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's Cube. \nMALKOVICH It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy. \nKEVIN BACON I'm sure you're not going crazy. \nMALKOVICH Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've... \nKEVIN BACON Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned? \nMALKOVICH Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth. \nKEVIN BACON You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe? \nMALKOVICH I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte. \nKEVIN BACON Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick. \nMALKOVICH I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out. \nKEVIN BACON You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend. \nMALKOVICH I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something? \nKEVIN BACON All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha. \nMALKOVICH I gotta know the truth, Kevin. \nKEVIN BACON The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nMalkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against the wall. After a moment, Maxine emerges from the building and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe distance. \nCUT TO: \nINT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING \nThe elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor. He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door. Maxine sees \"J.M. Inc.\" stenciled on the office door. He turns to the first fat man and line. \nMALKOVICH Excuse me, what type of service does this company provide? \nFAT MAN You get to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams. \nMALKOVICH (quietly flipped) I see. \nFAT MAN No cutting, by the way. \nThe waiter jots it down on his pad. \nWAITER MALKOVICH Malkovich. \nMalkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a '40's style big band of Malkoviches. \nSINGING MALKOVICH Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich... \nMalkovich flies through the back door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - DAY \nMalkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting there with his van. On its side is painted \"See The World in Malk-O-Vision\" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet. \nCRAIG So how was it? \nMALKOVICH That... was... no... simulation. \nCRAIG I know. I'm sorry... \nMALKOVICH I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see. \nCRAIG Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... \nMALKOVICH This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. \nCRAIG With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood. \nMALKOVICH It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court! \nMalkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike. \nCRAIG (calling after him) And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court? \nCars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car. \nMOTORIST Hey, Malkovich! Think fast! \nMalkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car and hits him on the head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCraig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She looks haggard. \nLOTTE Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. \nCRAIG Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine. \nLOTTE You fell in love with her first. \nCRAIG Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage. \nLOTTE You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway. \nCRAIG (beat) That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. \nLOTTE Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before. \nCRAIG Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole. \nLOTTE I need a shower. \nCRAIG I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, \"he's some kind of monster.\" \nLOTTE You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man. \nCRAIG I love you so much. \nShe dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny. \nMAXINE (O.S.) J.M. Inc. Be all that someone... \nLOTTE We have to meet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nLester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and hollow-eyed. \nLESTER You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear. \nLOTTE Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester. \nLESTER Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing. \nLOTTE No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine... \nLESTER (slaps Lotte furiously) What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself! \nLOTTE No, I didn't know that. \nLESTER Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video? \nLOTTE No. \nLESTER Oh, sorry. Right this way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT \nLotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium. The projector whirs. The screen lights up. \nTITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH \nA much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's. \nLESTER ON FILM Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. As you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world. \nWe see a shot of a newborn. \nLESTER ON FILM (CONT'D) His name is John Horatio Hannibal Malkovich. And we are the keepers of the door to his soul. One day, when his brain is big enough, we will all journey into his head and live there for all eternity. Following the teachings of our leader Karl Marx, we will build the ultimate communist community, one body and hundreds, maybe thousands, of brains inside working together to form a super human intellect capable of curing disease, stopping all war, and ruling the world with a benevolent fist. We will take a wife, a woman of uncommon beauty and intellect, who is, as yet, still an infant herself. \nWe see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in her hair. \nLESTER ON FILM (CONT'D) Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella DeMent. \nLOTTE Does Floris know that she's the chosen? \nLESTER Well, I tried to explain it to her, but... \nLester points to his ear and shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMalkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite relaxed. \nMAXINE You still there, sweets? \nMALKOVICH Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists. \nMAXINE Wow. (little girl pout) Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey. \nMALKOVICH You mean with Malkovich? \nMAXINE I'd love to see your work. \nMALKOVICH (pleased) Really? Yeah. Okay. \nMalkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) I'll do something I call \"Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment.\" \nMalkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same, complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow. He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping. \nMAXINE (moved) That was incredible. You're brilliant! \nMALKOVICH You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls. \nMAXINE You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people! \nAGENT (CONT'D) John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception. \nMALKOVICH This is my fiancee Maxine. \nThe agent shakes Maxine's hand. \nAGENT Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about the cunt at reception. Please have a seat. \nMalkovich and Maxine sit. \nAGENT (CONT'D) Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water? \nMAXINE No thanks. \nAGENT (into phone) Teresa, get me a chicken soup. (to Malkovich and Maxine) Chicken soup? \nMaxine and Malkovich shake their heads \"no.\" \nMALKOVICH I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now... \nAGENT Okay. \nMALKOVICH I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz... \nAGENT (no clue) Oh yeah, he's good. \nMALKOVICH ... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno. \nMAXINE Vegas. \nMALKOVICH Vegas. Can you arrange that? \nAGENT Sure, sure. Just let me make a couple of calls. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe cult members are still there, now with picks shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2 emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist. \nMAN #2 That's the last of it, boss. \nLester peers through the door. \nLESTER Well, let's see what we've got here. \nLester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS \nLester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BUNKER - DAY \nThe scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping. There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester views the scene through somebody's POV. \nLESTER (V.O.) My God, where am I? This seems so familiar. \nThe person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler. \nLESTER (V.O.) My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker! Aaaahhhh! Aaaah! \nDIRECTOR Cut! \nWe look over to see a director and camera crew. \nLESTER (V.O.) Oh, I'm just the actor in that Twilight Zone episode. \nThere is a popping sound. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - DAY \nLester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly shakes his head \"no.\" \nLESTER But of course. \nWOMAN #1 Count me in. \nLESTER Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle. \nFLIP TO: \nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER \nMr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch him. \nFLEMMER Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this. \nLESTER And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. \nFLEMMER Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy. \nLESTER Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir. \nFLEMMER Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? (to cultists) Nice to meet you all. \nThe cult members ad-lib \"same here, sir.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly sobbing. The caged animals watch her. \nLOTTE Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're not human. People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I've lost my heart to two of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I'm no better. Look at the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I've been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I set you free. \nLotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until she is alone. \nLOTTE (CONT'D) Good-bye, friends. \nA hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still there and holding her hand. She smiles. \nLOTTE (CONT'D) Hello, friend \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nWe see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and Lotte's building. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nLotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps. The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump. \nLOTTE They've come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know too much. I should get the door. It's impolite to keep death waiting. \nElijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes. Then he leads her by the hand out the window. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe marquee reads:  World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nMalkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number, reclines on the couch. \nMAXINE This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. \nMALKOVICH I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. \nMalkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control. \nMAXINE Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us? \nMALKOVICH He's a selfish bastard. \nCUT TO: \nMALKOVICH They love me, darling! \"Craig Schwartz is fantastic!\"  The New York Times. \"If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!\"  Women's Wear Daily. \"Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!\"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio. \nMAXINE Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top. \nMALKOVICH Sleepy suddenly. \nMAXINE Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just... \nBut Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HELL - NIGHT \nCraig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened. He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister grin. \nCRAIG Who are you? \nFLEMMER I am the Devil. \nCRAIG Oh. \nFLEMMER Leave Malkovich. He is mine. \nCRAIG Okay. Sorry. I didn't know. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nMalkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him. \nMAXINE Bad dream, darling? \nMALKOVICH I've got to leave Malkovich. \nMAXINE You've got to be kidding. \nMALKOVICH I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it. \nFlemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased with himself. \nMAXINE Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream. \nFLEMMER (to himself) Shit. \nMALKOVICH Honey, we can be happy and poor together. \nMAXINE (laughs derisively) Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again. \nThere is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry. \nMAXINE (CONT'D) Yeah what?! \nMALKOVICH Derek Mantini! \nMantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and Maxine give each other the once over. \nMANTINI (still eyeing Maxine) Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show. \nMALKOVICH Did you see the reviews? \nMANTINI Yeah, I saw them \nMALKOVICH Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. \nMAXINE I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich. \nMANTINI Very impressive. I could use a producer with your vision. And other outstanding attributes. \nMALKOVICH She's not available. \nMANTINI We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. \nMAXINE Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. \nMANTINI I won't waste your time Schwartz, or more importantly, mine. Here's my proposal: There's only room in this world for one \"World's Greatest Puppeteer.\"  Correct? So let's allow the puppet-going public to crown their king. \nMALKOVICH How do we do that? \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nLester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, while shrieking a war cry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMaxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground. Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war cry and runs out onto the stage. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks. Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the audience. \nMALKOVICH (now sounding like fifty voices) I am your earthly king! Kneel before me! \nThe audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to their knees. \nCROWD (like automatons) Hail Malkovich, king of the damned. \nMalkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back. \nLotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the theater. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMaxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for the exit. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT \nA dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually merges with the landscape. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY \nCHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK \nSomething is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets, the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets, carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky. There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the street looks up. \nMALKOVICH (fifty voices) Greetings, my lowly subjects. \nFLORIS Great things, my lonely subtext? \nMALKOVICH (rolls his eyes) Boy, be careful what you wish for. (to Floris) Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, will you? \nFloris shrugs, picks at her finger nails. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) (to the people on the street) I am bored. You will dance for your king now. \nWithout pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is void of expression. Malkovich laughs. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) Faster! Faster, my little trained monkeys! \nThe crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over, exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to help, nobody dares. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nBird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves in, through some gray trees and gray brush to: \nA LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT \nThis place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards, cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs. \nELIJAH (SUBTITLES) Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love? \nLOTTE Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who? \nELIJAH (SUBTITLES) If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and... \n", "test1_input": "LOTTE Why'd you do it, Craig? \nCRAIG I'm a puppeteer. \nThey drive in silence. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nCraig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the want ads.

He comes across an ad: \"Female puppeteer wanted for nudist colony marionette staging of 'Oh, Calcutta!'\"  Craig rubs his chin. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nCraig sits in the passenger seat. He is made up as a woman and wears a full-body rubber \"naked woman\" suit. Lotte drives. \nLOTTE (finally) You know, maybe you should speak to someone about this. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCraig sees a personal ad: \"Male puppeteer looking for attractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and much much more.\"  Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better of it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a \"short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and dexterous fingers needed for speed filing.\"  Craig writes down the address. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY \nCraig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings board. He finds LesterCorp, and sees that it is located on floor 7 1/2. Craig presses the elevator button and waits. Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open, and Craig and the other man get in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe other man presses \"9.\" Craig studies the buttons. There is no \"7 1/2.\" \nWOMAN #1 Seven and a half, right? \nCRAIG Uh. yeah. \nWOMAN #1 I'll take you through it. \n", "test1_true": "WOMAN #1 Seven and a half. \nCRAIG Thank you. \nCraig climbs out onto the 7 1/2 floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Craig finds a door marked \"LesterCorp - Meeting America's Filing Needs Since 1922.\"  He enters. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTERCORP RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS \nAll furniture is scaled down to fit into this low-ceilinged space. A few other short men sit reading tiny magazines. Craig approaches Floris, the receptionist. \nFLORIS Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs? \nCRAIG No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester. \nFLORIS Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez... \nCRAIG Schwartz. \nFLORIS Pardon? \nCRAIG Schwartz. \nFLORIS I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now. \nCRAIG My name is Schwartz. \nFLORIS Money, Miss Warts? \nCRAIG Forget it. \nCraig takes a seat next to the other applicants. \nFLORIS (calling across the room) Fork ah did? \nThe intercom buzzes. Floris picks it up. \nFLORIS (to Craig) Mr. Juarez? \nCRAIG Yes? \nFLORIS Yex? \nCRAIG I said \"yes.\" \nFLORIS You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said. \nCraig stands, opens Lester's door, and enters. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nCraig enters. Lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched behind his tiny desk. \nLESTER Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know. \nCRAIG (extending his hand) Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester. \nLester flips an intercom switch. \nLESTER Security. \nCRAIG No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary. \nLESTER She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you\u0092re implying. \nCRAIG Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke. \nLESTER Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp? \nCRAIG Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer. \n", "test1_id": 1455, "test2_input": "LESTER Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears. \nCRAIG I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you? \nLESTER One hundred and five. Carrot juice. (beat) Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz. \nCRAIG I'll keep that in mind, sir. \nLESTER No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me. \nCRAIG The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history. \nLESTER I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz. \nCRAIG Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion. \nLESTER All right.

Maxine? \nMAXINE Who told you? \nCRAIG I'm right? \nMAXINE Who told you? \nCRAIG That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops! \nMAXINE Somebody told you. \nCRAIG Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine! \nMAXINE I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated. \nCRAIG (in heaven) Maxine. \nCraig walks down the hall. A tiny smile flits across Maxine's face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JUICY JUICE BAR - EVENING \nLester and Craig sit at a table. There are several emptied glasses of carrot juice in front of Lester. Craig nurses one glass, and keeps checking his watch. \nLESTER Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. \u0093Ladies,\u0094 I begin. \u0093I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven... \nCRAIG (standing) Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. \nLESTER Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig. \nCRAIG Yessir. \n", "test2_true": "CRAIG (checking watch) That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run. \nCraig hurries to the door. Lester downs Craig's juice, signals the waiter for more. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STUCK PIG - NIGHT \nMaxine sits at the bar, watching her watch. Craig rushes into the room, frantic, out of breath. He spots Maxine and plops himself next to her. \nCRAIG Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine. \nMAXINE Just. \nCRAIG Buy you a drink, Maxine? \nMAXINE You married? \nCRAIG Yeah. But enough about me. \nMaxine laughs. The bartender approaches. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) What'll you have? \nMAXINE (to bartender) The usual, Barry. \nCRAIG (to bartender) I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something. \nThe bartender walks away. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) I like you. I don't know what it is exactly. \nMAXINE My tits? \nCRAIG No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or... \nMAXINE Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time. \nThe drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of a glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows swimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an plastic monkeys hang from the rim. \nCRAIG That's the usual? \nMAXINE Don\u0092t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off. \nMaxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the empty glass to the bartender. \nMAXINE (CONT'D) Set me up again, Barry. \nThe bartender walks away with the empty glass. \nCRAIG I\u0092m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male. \nMAXINE You're a fag or a liar. \nCRAIG (backpedaling) I mean, I am really attracted to you. \nMAXINE (mocking) I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene. \nMaxine gets up. \nCRAIG (at a loss) No, wait! I like your tits. (beat) I love your tits. I want to fuck you. \nMAXINE (sitting) Good. Now we're getting somewhere. (beat) Not a chance. \nMaxine's second drink comes. She downs it, pushes the glass toward the bartender. \nMAXINE (CONT\u0092D) So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy. \nCRAIG Well, I'm a puppeteer... \nThe bartender comes back with Maxine's drink. \nMAXINE (to bartender) Check. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLotte is combing Elijah. Craig enters. \n", "test2_id": 1456, "test3_input": "Lotte turns away, shaken. A tear rolls down her face. \nLOTTE What have I become? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT \nThe Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S. Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT \nThe house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S. Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Do you dream often? \nMALKOVICH Do you? \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them. \nMALKOVICH Says who? \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Says me. Do you dream often? \nMALKOVICH Do you? \nWe see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine. \nMAXINE (without turning around) Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER \nIt's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation. Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple: \nTHEATERGOER #1 That Truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist. \nTHEATERGOER #2 It's a wooden performance, really. Get it? Wooden? \nSecond couple: \nTHEATERGOER #3 What's with the Malkovich puppet? He was much better in Vegas when he played the piano with his feet. \nTHEATERGOER #4 I hate it when they try to stretch. It's like Woody Allen. \nThird couple: \nTHEATERGOER #5 They both stink! I'm going across the street to second act Miss Saigon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nMalkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror. Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights up a cigarette. \nMAXINE You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, lover, 'cause right now you're running neck and neck with the dead president. And you're both in last place. \nMalkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones. \nCHARLES NELSON REILLY You're doing beautifully, my boy. I wept at the speech about your wife. \nFlemmer materializes behind Mantini \nCHARLES NELSON REILLY What the hell? Nyong-nyong! \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT \nWe watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET I can hear the creature's voice. It's calling me out of the black cave of the Psyche. I shove in my dim little torch, and there he stands -- waiting for me. He raises his matted head. He opens his great, square teeth and says (mocking) 'Why? ... Why me? ... Why -- ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really imagine you can account for Me? Totally, infallibly, inevitably account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!' \nMalkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and sees a silent, rapt crowd. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER \nMalkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm. During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising his ten foot eyebrows in surprise... \nMALKOVICH Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed! Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming! ... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS \nA man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the street. She is dirty but determined. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL \nMalkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking it. Truman speaks. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ... Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back! Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ... Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ... In. Out .. In ... Out ... \nMalkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich. \nAUDIENCE MEMBER (to his wife) That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine actor. \nFLEMMER (blood boiling) Bastard is stealing my thunder. \nMalkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing, swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he talks. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET All right! I'll take it away! He'll be delivered from madness. What then? He'll feel himself acceptable! What then? \nMalkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog. Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when he talks, fire comes out of his mouth. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D) I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll erase the welts cut into his body by flying manes. \nThe audience \"ooohs\" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from \"Swan Lake.\" The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech, now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and flying around the auditorium as he speaks. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D) You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses will be quite safe. You'll save your pennies every week, till you can change that scooter into a car... \nThe audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned, in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings \"Mr. Bojangles\", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S. Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just raised from the dead. \nACTUAL TRUMAN Where am I? Aren't I dead? (possessed) Vote for Mantini! \nTruman grows and grows until he is again just a giant puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMalkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him. Thunderous applause is heard in the background. \nMALKOVICH Good-bye, Maxine. \nMAXINE Whatever. \nMalkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head. \nMALKOVICH (weak but relieved) I'm back! My nightmare is over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS \nFlemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a walkie-talkie. \nFLEMMER (into walkie-talkie) Okay, now! \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 1457}

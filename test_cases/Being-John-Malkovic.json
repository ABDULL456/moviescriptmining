Eventually there is a knock at the door. \nCRAIG (a little too urgently) Come in! \nErroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly. \nERROLL Hello, I'm here about the ad. \nCRAIG Please, have a seat. \nErroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He glances nervously over at Maxine. \nERROLL When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly? \nCRAIG Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes. \nERROLL Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no!

Thousand times, thank you! \nCRAIG (gasping for air) Tell your friends. \nERROLL Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous.

(nods to Maxine) Ma'am \nCRAIG Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about. \nLESTER There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy.

Maxine... \nMALKOVICH (stopping) I'm sorry, did you just call me \"Lotte\"? \nMAXINE Do you mind? \nMALKOVICH (thinking) No, I guess not.

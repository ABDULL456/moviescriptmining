But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me. \nCRAIG The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history. \nLESTER I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz. \nCRAIG Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion. \nLESTER All right.

It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine! \nMAXINE I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk.

My spunk is to you manna from heaven... \nCRAIG (standing) Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. \nLESTER Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig. \nCRAIG Yessir. \nCRAIG Hi. \nLOTTE Hi. \nCRAIG (nervous, talking too much) Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We\u0092re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is. \nThere is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah. Finally: \nLOTTE Did you eat? \nCRAIG Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away. \nLOTTE I was worried. \nCRAIG I'm sorry. How was your evening? \nLOTTE Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected. \nCRAIG The ferret? \nLOTTE The iguana. \nCRAIG Right. \nLOTTE I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed. \nCRAIG Yeah. You want a beer? \nLOTTE No thanks. I'm going to turn in. \nCRAIG All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while.

GARAGE - NIGHT \nCraig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice. \nCRAIG (as Maxine, fascinated) Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering? (as Craig) Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. (as Maxine) Interesting. Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel what I feel? (as Craig) More than anything. Maxine. (as Maxine) It's good in here, Craig.

Craig sits on a box. He puts his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across it. \nCRAIG Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor. \nCraig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a dark and wet membranous tunnel inside. \nCraig opens the little door and climbs into the membranous hallway. The door slams shut behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nIt's dark and wet. The walls are soft and membranous. There is a dripping sound. Craig crawls along. Soon something starts to pull Craig as if he is being sucked through a straw.

She is backed by a '40's style big band of Malkoviches. \nSINGING MALKOVICH Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich... \nMalkovich flies through the back door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - DAY \nMalkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting there with his van. On its side is painted \"See The World in Malk-O-Vision\" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet. \nCRAIG So how was it? \nMALKOVICH That... was... no... simulation. \nCRAIG I know. I'm sorry... \nMALKOVICH I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see. \nCRAIG Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... \nMALKOVICH This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. \nCRAIG With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood. \nMALKOVICH It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court! \nMalkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike. \nCRAIG (calling after him) And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court? \nCars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car. \nMOTORIST Hey, Malkovich! Think fast! \nMalkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car and hits him on the head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCraig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She looks haggard. \nLOTTE Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. \nCRAIG Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine. \nLOTTE You fell in love with her first. \nCRAIG Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage. \nLOTTE You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway. \nCRAIG (beat) That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. \nLOTTE Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before. \nCRAIG Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole. \nLOTTE I need a shower. \nCRAIG I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, \"he's some kind of monster.\" \nLOTTE You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man. \nCRAIG I love you so much. \nShe dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny. \nMAXINE (O.S.) J.M. Inc. Be all that someone... \nLOTTE We have to meet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nLester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and hollow-eyed. \nLESTER You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear. \nLOTTE Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester. \nLESTER Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing. \nLOTTE No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine... \nLESTER (slaps Lotte furiously) What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself! \nLOTTE No, I didn't know that. \nLESTER Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video? \nLOTTE No. \nLESTER Oh, sorry. Right this way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT \nLotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium. The projector whirs. The screen lights up. \nTITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH \nA much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's. \nLESTER ON FILM Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. As you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world. \nWe see a shot of a newborn. \nLESTER ON FILM (CONT'D) His name is John Horatio Hannibal Malkovich. And we are the keepers of the door to his soul. One day, when his brain is big enough, we will all journey into his head and live there for all eternity. Following the teachings of our leader Karl Marx, we will build the ultimate communist community, one body and hundreds, maybe thousands, of brains inside working together to form a super human intellect capable of curing disease, stopping all war, and ruling the world with a benevolent fist. We will take a wife, a woman of uncommon beauty and intellect, who is, as yet, still an infant herself. \nWe see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in her hair. \nLESTER ON FILM (CONT'D) Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella DeMent. \nLOTTE Does Floris know that she's the chosen? \nLESTER Well, I tried to explain it to her, but... \nLester points to his ear and shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMalkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite relaxed. \nMAXINE You still there, sweets? \nMALKOVICH Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists. \nMAXINE Wow. (little girl pout) Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey. \nMALKOVICH You mean with Malkovich? \nMAXINE I'd love to see your work. \nMALKOVICH (pleased) Really? Yeah. Okay. \nMalkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) I'll do something I call \"Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment.\" \nMalkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same, complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow. He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping. \nMAXINE (moved) That was incredible. You're brilliant! \nMALKOVICH You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls. \nMAXINE You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people! \nAGENT (CONT'D) John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception. \nMALKOVICH This is my fiancee Maxine. \nThe agent shakes Maxine's hand. \nAGENT Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about the cunt at reception. Please have a seat. \nMalkovich and Maxine sit. \nAGENT (CONT'D) Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water? \nMAXINE No thanks. \nAGENT (into phone) Teresa, get me a chicken soup. (to Malkovich and Maxine) Chicken soup? \nMaxine and Malkovich shake their heads \"no.\" \nMALKOVICH I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now... \nAGENT Okay. \nMALKOVICH I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz... \nAGENT (no clue) Oh yeah, he's good. \nMALKOVICH ... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno. \nMAXINE Vegas. \nMALKOVICH Vegas. Can you arrange that? \nAGENT Sure, sure. Just let me make a couple of calls. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe cult members are still there, now with picks shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2 emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist. \nMAN #2 That's the last of it, boss. \nLester peers through the door. \nLESTER Well, let's see what we've got here. \nLester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS \nLester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BUNKER - DAY \nThe scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping. There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester views the scene through somebody's POV. \nLESTER (V.O.) My God, where am I? This seems so familiar. \nThe person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler. \nLESTER (V.O.) My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker! Aaaahhhh! Aaaah! \nDIRECTOR Cut! \nWe look over to see a director and camera crew. \nLESTER (V.O.) Oh, I'm just the actor in that Twilight Zone episode. \nThere is a popping sound. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - DAY \nLester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly shakes his head \"no.\" \nLESTER But of course. \nWOMAN #1 Count me in. \nLESTER Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle. \nFLIP TO: \nINT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER \nMr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch him. \nFLEMMER Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this. \nLESTER And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. \nFLEMMER Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy. \nLESTER Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir. \nFLEMMER Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? (to cultists) Nice to meet you all. \nThe cult members ad-lib \"same here, sir.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly sobbing. The caged animals watch her. \nLOTTE Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're not human. People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I've lost my heart to two of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I'm no better. Look at the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I've been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I set you free. \nLotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until she is alone. \nLOTTE (CONT'D) Good-bye, friends. \nA hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still there and holding her hand. She smiles. \nLOTTE (CONT'D) Hello, friend \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nWe see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and Lotte's building. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nLotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps. The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump. \nLOTTE They've come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know too much. I should get the door. It's impolite to keep death waiting. \nElijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes. Then he leads her by the hand out the window. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe marquee reads:  World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nMalkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number, reclines on the couch. \nMAXINE This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. \nMALKOVICH I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. \nMalkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control. \nMAXINE Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us? \nMALKOVICH He's a selfish bastard. \nCUT TO: \nMALKOVICH They love me, darling! \"Craig Schwartz is fantastic!\"  The New York Times. \"If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!\"  Women's Wear Daily. \"Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!\"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio. \nMAXINE Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top. \nMALKOVICH Sleepy suddenly. \nMAXINE Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just... \nBut Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HELL - NIGHT \nCraig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened. He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister grin. \nCRAIG Who are you? \nFLEMMER I am the Devil. \nCRAIG Oh. \nFLEMMER Leave Malkovich. He is mine. \nCRAIG Okay. Sorry. I didn't know. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nMalkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him. \nMAXINE Bad dream, darling? \nMALKOVICH I've got to leave Malkovich. \nMAXINE You've got to be kidding. \nMALKOVICH I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it. \nFlemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased with himself. \nMAXINE Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream. \nFLEMMER (to himself) Shit. \nMALKOVICH Honey, we can be happy and poor together. \nMAXINE (laughs derisively) Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again. \nThere is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry. \nMAXINE (CONT'D) Yeah what?! \nMALKOVICH Derek Mantini! \nMantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and Maxine give each other the once over. \nMANTINI (still eyeing Maxine) Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show. \nMALKOVICH Did you see the reviews? \nMANTINI Yeah, I saw them \nMALKOVICH Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. \nMAXINE I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich. \nMANTINI Very impressive. I could use a producer with your vision. And other outstanding attributes. \nMALKOVICH She's not available. \nMANTINI We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. \nMAXINE Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. \nMANTINI I won't waste your time Schwartz, or more importantly, mine. Here's my proposal: There's only room in this world for one \"World's Greatest Puppeteer.\"  Correct? So let's allow the puppet-going public to crown their king. \nMALKOVICH How do we do that? \nLotte turns away, shaken. A tear rolls down her face. \nLOTTE What have I become? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT \nThe Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S. Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT \nThe house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S. Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents. \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Do you dream often? \nMALKOVICH Do you? \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them. \nMALKOVICH Says who? \nHARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET Says me. Do you dream often? \nMALKOVICH Do you? \nWe see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine. \nMAXINE (without turning around) Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER \nIt's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation. Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple: \nTHEATERGOER #1 That Truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist. \nTHEATERGOER #2 It's a wooden performance, really. Get it? Wooden? \nSecond couple: \nTHEATERGOER #3 What's with the Malkovich puppet? He was much better in Vegas when he played the piano with his feet. \nTHEATERGOER #4 I hate it when they try to stretch. It's like Woody Allen. \nThird couple: \nTHEATERGOER #5 They both stink! I'm going across the street to second act Miss Saigon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nMalkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror. Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights up a cigarette. \nMAXINE You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, lover, 'cause right now you're running neck and neck with the dead president. And you're both in last place. \nMalkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones. \nCHARLES NELSON REILLY You're doing beautifully, my boy. I wept at the speech about your wife. \nFlemmer materializes behind Mantini \nCHARLES NELSON REILLY What the hell? Nyong-nyong! \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nLester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, while shrieking a war cry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMaxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground. Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war cry and runs out onto the stage. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks. Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the audience. \nMALKOVICH (now sounding like fifty voices) I am your earthly king! Kneel before me! \nThe audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to their knees. \nCROWD (like automatons) Hail Malkovich, king of the damned. \nMalkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back. \nLotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the theater. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nMaxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for the exit. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TUNPIKE - NIGHT \nA dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually merges with the landscape. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY \nCHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK \nSomething is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets, the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets, carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky. There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the street looks up. \nMALKOVICH (fifty voices) Greetings, my lowly subjects. \nFLORIS Great things, my lonely subtext? \nMALKOVICH (rolls his eyes) Boy, be careful what you wish for. (to Floris) Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, will you? \nFloris shrugs, picks at her finger nails. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) (to the people on the street) I am bored. You will dance for your king now. \nWithout pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is void of expression. Malkovich laughs. \nMALKOVICH (CONT'D) Faster! Faster, my little trained monkeys! \nThe crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over, exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to help, nobody dares. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nBird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves in, through some gray trees and gray brush to: \nA LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT \nThis place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards, cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs. \nELIJAH (SUBTITLES) Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love? \nLOTTE Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who? \nELIJAH (SUBTITLES) If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and... \n", "test1_input": "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman \nBEING JOHN MALKOVICH \nA Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman \nINT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY \nThe room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled \"Sit.\" Craig opens the book. It reads: \"sit sit sit sit sit...\" over and over, page after page. Craig closes the book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs. He looks at the book again. It is now entitled \"Die.\"  He opens it up.  \"die die die die die...\"  A rooster crows. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nCraig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest, crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest. \nLOTTE Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his pen. Good morning. \nLotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead. \nCRAIG Morning. \nLOTTE Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing. \nCRAIG Enjoy. \nLOTTE Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something. \nCRAIG We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate. \nLOTTE Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. \nCRAIG (bitterly) The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job. \nLOTTE (sighs) Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. (beat) Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor? \nCRAIG What? \nLOTTE Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning. \nCRAIG Which one is Elijah again? \nLOTTE The monkey. \nCRAIG Yeah. Okay. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING \nThe place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet version of Craig. The \"Craig\" puppet paces back and forth, wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig, above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet. His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on the real Craig\u0092s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower. The assembled crowd is enthralled. \nTV ANNOUNCER The crowd is enthralled as Derek Mantini, arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world, performs \"The Belle of Amherst\" with his 60 foot Emily Dickinson puppet, directed by the inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly. \nCharles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon. \nCHARLES NELSON REILLY Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong. \nCRAIG Gimmicky bastard. \nCraig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs his chin in thought, then stands with great determination. \nMUSIC IN: TRIUMPHANT \nCUT TO: \nINT.

The admiring headmistress smiles and nods her head in approval. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nCraig instructs a class of uniformed girls. He draws complex diagrams of puppets on the blackboard. The students are transfixed, except for one troubled girl who eyes Craig sullenly from the back of the room as she plays with a switchblade. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THEATER - DAY \nCraig guides the hands of the troubled teenage girl, who is trying to manipulate a marionette. The girl looks up at Craig. Her tough facade crumbles and she smiles.

He is still in the dress, but the wig is in his lap and the make-up is smeared off. Lotte appears with a cop outside Craig's cell. The door is opened, and Craig, Lotte, and the cop head down the hall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nLotte drives. Craig looks out the window.

Craig orders them with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches, eyes wide. \nLESTER (CONT'D) (flips intercom switch) Floris, get Guinness on the phone. \nFLORIS (O.S.) Gehginnis ondah foam? \nLESTER Forget it. \nFLORIS (CONT'D) Fork ah did? \nLESTER (flips off switch) Fine woman, Floris.

But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, \"I can't understand a word any of you are saying.\" \nCRAIG No. \nLESTER Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.

We pass the savings on to you. (laughs heartily) But seriously, that's all covered in orientation. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY \nIt's a small screening room with red velvet seats. There are a few people scattered about the squat theater. Craig is among them. He looks around the room and his eyes rest momentarily on Maxine. She is in her late 20's with close cropped black hair. Her eyes are opaque, her face expressionless, her countenance trance-like. She glances over at Craig, then turns back to the screen. The lights dim. A projector whirs and the screen is illuminated. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nWe tilt up the building. \nMUSIC:\tPerky Industrial Film Music. \nTITLE:\tThe 7 1/2 Floor \nNARRATOR (0.S.) Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin-Flemmer building. As you will now be spending your work day here, it is important that you learn a bit about the history of this famous floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY \nDon and Wendy, two office workers, crouch in the hall and chat. Both hold cups of coffee. \nWENDY Hello, Don. \nDON Hello. Wendy. \nWENDY Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings? \nDON It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building. \nCUT TO: \nOLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING. \nDON (CONT'D) (V.0.) He would call this building the Mertin-Flemmer Building, after himself and someone else, who, local legend has it, was named Flemmer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. 19TH CENTURY OFFICE - DAY \nAn actor playing Mertin sits at a desk and writes with aquill. He appears very stern and has mutton chop sideburns. \nDON (CONT'D) (V.0.) One day. Captain Mertin received an unexpected visitor. \n", "test2_true": "MERTIN Enter ye, if ye dare enter. \nA tiny woman enters. \nTINY WOMAN Captain Mertin? \nMERTIN What want ye, girl child? \nTINY WOMAN I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions. \nMERTIN (taken aback) I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon. \nTINY WOMAN I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart. \nMERTIN (sighs) Aye. Speak then if ye must. \nTINY WOMAN Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable? \nMertin wipes a tear from his eye. \nMERTIN Woman, your story moves me like n other. Me own sister was tiny and then died. Therefore, I shall make ye me wife. And I shall build a floor in my building, between the 7th and 8th, which will be scaled down, so from now on there shall be at least one place on God's green Earth that you and your accursed kind can live in peace... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY \nDon And Wendy crouch and talk. \nDON So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha! \nWENDY Ha ha ha! \nTITLE:\tThe End \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY \nThe screen goes dark. The lights go up. Craig looks over at Maxine. She stands and walks past him. \nCRAIG Moving story. \nMAXINE Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors. \nCRAIG Is that true? \nMAXINE Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?. \nCRAIG Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp. \nMAXINE How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog! \nCRAIG (proudly) Emily Dickinson. \nMAXINE I wouldn't know. \nMaxine walks away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLotte chops onions. A parrot sits on her head. Craig stirs a pot on the stove. A monkey leaps from the top of the cabinet to the top of the refrigerator to the kitchen table. A dog watches the monkey and barks at it. \nPARROT Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! \nCRAIG Shut up! \nLOTTE (to Craig) Sorry, honey. \nThe dog continues to bark. \nPARROT Sorry honey. Sorry honey. \nAn offscreen neighbor pounds the wall. \nNEIGHBOR (0.S.) Shut up! \nLOTTE (yelling) Sorry! \n", "test3_input": "CRAIG (nervously) Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. \nLOTTE Now? \nCRAIG Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nCraig holds open the small door as Lotte climbs in. \nCRAIG I'll meet you on the turnpike. \nLOTTE I'm scared. \nThe door slams shut. \nCRAIG Me too, babe. \nCraig hurries out the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMalkovich is in the shower. We watch from his POV as he soaps himself. He does this in a sensual manner. \nLOTTE (V.0.) Holy cow! \nMalkovich steps out of the shower, slowly towels himself dry. \nLOTTE (V.0.) Oh, yes. Yes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DITCH - NIGHT \nLotte lands in the ditch. She is wet and ragged. Traffic whizzes by. Craig turns on the headlights in his parked car. They shine on Lotte. Craig steps out of the car. \nLOTTE I have to go back. \nCRAIG Okay. Maybe tomorrow. \nLOTTE I have to go back now. \nCRAIG We'll talk about it in the car. \nCraig helps Lotte up and toward the car. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT \nCraig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window. \nLOTTE I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was. \nCRAIG You weren't you. You were John Malkovich. \nLOTTE (tickled) I was, wasn't I? (yelling out the window) I was John fucking Malkovich! (laughs, then intensely) Take me back, Craig. \nCRAIG Tomorrow. We're late for Lester. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras. Lester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed table with all different sorts of juices in front of them. Lotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her. \nLESTER Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying? \nLOTTE Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. \nLESTER Oh, be still my heart. \nLOTTE Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom? \nLESTER With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know. \n", "test3_true": "CRAIG Dr. Lester... \nLESTER More beet-spinach juice, my friend? \nCRAIG No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately. \nLESTER I see. Are you unhappy at our little company? \nCRAIG No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and... \nLESTER And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking. \nCRAIG Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. (beat) In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other. \nLESTER The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain \u0093doors\u0094 which should never be opened. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLotte walks down the ritzy hallway. She is counting closed doors in search of the bathroom. She opens a door, looks inside, gasps, then enters the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LESTER' S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLotte enters the room. It is dark. At the far end there is what amounts to a candle-lit shrine to John Malkovich. The centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph of Malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers. Lotte stares at it for a moment, then drops to her knees in front of it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLotte has just taken a shower. She towels herself dry in much the same way as Malkovich. Her eyes are closed. She opens them slowly and sees herself in the mirror. Disappointedly, she drops the towel and heads out of the bathroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nCraig sits at his work table. He is pulling the heads off of the Craig and the Maxine puppets. He puts the Maxine head on the Craig puppet. He sighs. \nCRAIG My kingdom for your portal, Maxine. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - MORNING \nMaxine sits at her desk composing an ad. Craig stands behind her, ostensibly looking over her shoulder, but actually studying the back of her head. He sighs. \nMAXINE Okay. Here it is. (reading) Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc. \nCRAIG Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in. \nMaxine dials the phone. Lotte enters. \nCRAIG Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop? \nLOTTE Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her? \nMAXINE (into phone) Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. (to Lotte) Hi, are you Craig's wife? \nLOTTE Yes, Hi. \nCRAIG Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte. \nLotte and Maxine shake hands. \nLOTTE Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet? \nMAXINE Hi, uh. (into phone) Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. \"Ever want to be someone else?\" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. \"Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding...\" \nCRAIG (to Lotte) Why aren't you at work? \nLOTTE I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. (beat) I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing? \nCRAIG What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking. \nLOTTE Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery. \nCRAIG This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right. \n"}

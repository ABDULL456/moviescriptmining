Burbank, California 91522                    All Rights Reserved \nBLACK \nA young man's V.O.: \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) I was born in Beaufort, North Carolina. A place where the air always smells of pine and salt and sea. \nThe voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A young doctor's soothing manner. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT) \nA vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers, sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) For many, days and nights are spent fishing Pamlico Sound or crabbing the Neuse River. \nThe CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor on which fishermen toil. \nEXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER) \nThe CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses decked with plastic rooftop Santas... \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) While the ocean may be the focus of daily labor, churches have always tried to be the focus of life. \nAnd MOVES UPHILL TO... \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nWhere fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful Christmas garlands. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) When I lived here, there were eighteen churches within town limits alone. \nEXT. FOUR-WAY STOP \nFrom each corner, four churches face each other. The Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All Saints Church. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) They sponsored pancake breakfasts, rummage sales, car washes, and softball games. \nEXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING \nThe CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a softball game. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) You'd think that all the people here were friendly, welcoming, open-hearted... \nDr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck. \nINT. CAR - TRAVELING \nLandon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) ... and that money or family background or education or luck didn't matter. \nLandon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a simple gold wedding band on his left hand. \nEXT. STREET - TRAVELING \nLandon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the huge Southern Baptist church. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) But they did matter. They mattered to everyone. Except Jamie Sullivan... \nLandon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the buildings, a cemetery. \nEXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a different color than he remembers. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) ... Astronomer. Actress. Believer in God... \nLandon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck. \nEXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nLandon heads up the walk and onto the front porch. Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy, unsettled. \nADULT LANDON (V.O.) ... Believer in me. \nA nurse opens the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985) \nROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as \"Born in the U.S.A.\" Students hang. Brains, preps, richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks. Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted. A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX. \nMissing are the criminals... \nA shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING. VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied, feared. \nINT. CAMARO \nEMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror. Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray. \nERIC (to Belinda) I'm just wondering -- \nBELINDA Don't wonder. \nLandon's looking out at the night. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON Jamie Sullivan. \nEveryone looks up.     Derisive laughter. \nTHEIR POV \nA pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She lives in her mind, not her body. \nBACK TO SCENE \nBELINDA Brain. \nERIC Bible freak. \nLANDON Cherry. \nEXT. CAMARO \nJAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her chest. \nJAMIE (to Landon, tentative) Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any chance you could... turn them off -- \nBELINDA (leaning over Landon) God give you this road? \nJAMIE No -- \nBELINDA Then we'll be keeping the lights on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON (to Jamie, seeming nice) If you want the lights off, I'll turn them off. \nAnd he does.    Darkness. \nJAMIE Thank you.   Thank you so very much. \nShe backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car: \nBELINDA (O.S.) I can't see a friggin' thing. \nINT. CAMARO \nLandon switches on the dome lights for Belinda. \nBELINDA (imitating Jamie) 'Thank you. Thank you so very much.' \nBut Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the seconds... \nHIS POV \nJamie scaling the fence, practiced at it. \nBACK TO SCENE \nLandon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and Clay snicker and snort as they see -- \nEXT. CEMETERY GATE \nJamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even. A moment later, she jumps down on the far side. Disappears. \nINT. CAMARO \nBelinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nERIC Ten years. Where're you gonna be? (to Belinda, mocking) Hypothetically? \nBELINDA Paris. \nCLAY Dead. \nLaughter. \nLANDON Right here.   With you. \nHe clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where he'd really like to be. \nCLAY 'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark Side.' \nERIC 'Twilight Zone,' dipshit. \nLANDON Don't call him a dipshit. \nERIC You do -- \nLANDON And you don't. (beat, re: Jamie) What's she doing in there? \nBELINDA Nothing I'd be doing. \nLaughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue. \nLANDON (grumbling) I'd work backstage or something? \nMR. KELLY Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays. \nLANDON When do I get time for me? \nMR. KELLY You don't.   That's the point. \nLandon's not happy, but he'll work with this.     As he heads for the door: \nMR. KELLY (softer, trying to reach him) Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself. (beat) Some of us remember how your father -- \nLANDON Then you remember more than I do. \nCLOSE ON BROOM \npushing gum wrappers under a radiator. \nINT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL \nLandon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students wander in, listen, look. \nJAMIE (answering question) -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the right of red Antares and much brighter. \nTo her small audience, she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger. \nJAMIE This is a very simple device made from a coat hanger, plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid. Does anyone know what it is? \nNo one does. \nLANDON (barely audible) A star frame. \nBut Jamie hears.   She regards him a moment, then keeps going. \nJAMIE This is a star frame. \nClay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at Jamie. \nJAMIE A star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye -- \nCLAY (scoffing, setting her up) -- Did God create the sun? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE (taking him seriously) Yes, God created the universe and all its physical laws. Even Einstein said it's a miracle that our world is comprehensible -- \nERIC -- If God can do all that, why can't he get you a new sweater? \nLandon laughs loudly.    Members of the club look at him. \nLANDON That was a joke. Laugh. \nJamie smiles.    She can laugh at herself.     And she finds Landon funny. \nINT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING \nLandon washes up while his mother sets the table.      The MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g. \nCYNTHIA Your father dropped off an extra check. \nLANDON I don't want his money. \nCYNTHIA It could help with a new car -- \nLANDON -- I like the car I have. \nHe picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy. \nINT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING \nEnthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing \"Karma Chameleon.\" Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading, not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a Sony Walkman, glum. \nHIS POV \nTo Z.Z. TOP'S \"Sleeping Bag.\" Out the window -- Jefferson High School coming into view. Bars on every window, chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass. \nINT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER \nA big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry text between them. \nLANDON (reading) -- 'So what is the measure of angle x if A and B are similar triangles?' \nLuis is lost, intimidated. \nLANDON Know what 'similar' means? \nLuis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student, ISABEL. \nINT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON \nThe DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard. He's late and heads for the rear bench seat. \nLANDON'S POV \nJamie sitting there.   And no vacant seats save next to her. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe bus begins to roll.   Landon lurches forward. \nTRAVELING - LATER \nThe bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His body turned away. She's reading her book. \nLANDON (as Starbuck) 'It's got to be inside you. Then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you. You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty. You'll be beautiful.' \nMs. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going. \nLANDON (as Starbuck) 'Look at me. Tell me what you see!' \nAs Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes. \nJAMIE (as Lizzie) 'Is it really me?' \nLANDON (as Starbuck, hamming) 'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.' \nHoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated. \nMS. GARBER Quiet! (announcing) Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck. \nGroans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon. \nLANDON (to Garber) No way. No thanks. I can't do it -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. KELLY (O.S.) (offstage) -- You can and you will, Mr. Carter. \nKelly's been standing in the wings. \nMR. KELLY (warning) With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster. \nEveryone stares at Landon.     He's trapped. \nEXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING \nRaining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind. \nLANDON (rude) You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere -- \nJAMIE -- This play means a lot to me. \nLANDON (snorting) This play -- ? \nJAMIE -- I know you don't suck at acting. \nLandon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night. \nJAMIE But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater -- \nLANDON -- What are you going on about? \nPause. \nJAMIE I can judge too. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe exhales, eyeing her, daring her. \nJAMIE You don't care about classes or graduating. But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again. \nLANDON That's deep -- \nJAMIE -- Your act only works with an audience. \nLANDON My act?! \nShe walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last car in the parking lot. \nFire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER \nLandon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past. \nLANDON A ride?!   Please! \nINT. PONTIAC \nJamie turns to look at him. \nJAMIE'S POV \nLandon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading. \nLANDON (insincere) We can talk about your helping me with my lines. \nINT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER \nJamie's at the wheel. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE I know you don't want help. \nLANDON Then we both know. (beat) I'll point. You drive.    Faster. \nHe points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks. The wet road glistens. \nJAMIE We're following fire trucks? \nLANDON Yeah. \nHe likes the frivolity of these. \nLANDON What's... Number one? \nShe looks away, embarrassed. \nJAMIE (changing subject) If you want help with your lines, I have two conditions. (smiling) You have to promise not to fall in love with me. \nHe's certain she's joking. \nLANDON No problem -- \nJAMIE And you have to meet my father. \nHe looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this. \nLANDON Fathers love me. \nCLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR \nswinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall.   Ichabod Crane in a collar. \nEXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING \nLandon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.   His bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g. \nLANDON Hey.   Landon Carter. \nLandon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans, dirty t-shirt, aloof manner. \nREV. SULLIVAN (surprised) You're in the play? \nLANDON Lead man. \nJamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps. \nLANDON (explaining bike) They took my license for 30 days. But nobody's pressing charges. \nThe Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush. Not the best place. \nJAMIE I'll get something for us to drink -- \nLANDON Don't bother! \nBut she's already gone.   The Reverend gestures toward the open front door. \nINT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nDark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is studying him closely. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off. But if ants disappeared, that would be catastrophic. \nThe Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence. \nLANDON (confidence flagging) Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so -- \nREV. SULLIVAN Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about. (beat) Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie. \nHis eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all cheerful. \nJAMIE I miss anything? \nINT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER \nJamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.      Her father comes in. \nREV. SULLIVAN The Carter boy. Tell me about him. \nJAMIE He wants help with his lines -- \nREV. SULLIVAN He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene -- \nJAMIE By accident -- \nREV. SULLIVAN Jamie, he's careless. Reckless. (beat) Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE I'm supposed to always be alone? \nREV. SULLIVAN I don't want you to see him outside school activities. \nJAMIE Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life. \nPause. \nREV. SULLIVAN (gentler) I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman. \nJAMIE Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one. \nINT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM \nJamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt. \nINT. HALLWAY \nJamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.     She tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out. \nEXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER \nJAMIE I hope so. (beat) I think maybe she sees me now. \nTheir eyes meet.     She looks away.    Changes the subject. \nJAMIE (re: telescope) I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet -- \nLANDON The dirty snowball at its core. \nJAMIE Yeah. (beat) I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON In 76 years, me neither. \nShe likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars. \nLANDON You're really into God, right? \nJAMIE In ten words or less? \nLANDON Yeah. \nJAMIE My relationship with God is my own. \nLANDON But you think about Him -- It -- Her. \nJAMIE Don't you? \nLANDON Not really. \nPause. \nJAMIE When you do, how do you? \nLandon could joke or he could reveal something. \nLANDON Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something. \nJAMIE Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do? \nLANDON No. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is. \nLANDON There is no point. You live.     You die. The end. \nJAMIE Maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture. \nLANDON You have to believe to have faith. \nJAMIE You don't believe in anything? \nLANDON The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles. \nJAMIE Interpreted by another guy like my father. \nLANDON Your father doesn't like me. \nPause. \nJAMIE He doesn't trust you. \nLANDON Sometimes I don't even trust me. \nHe sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She takes it. \nJAMIE I'm not afraid of you. \nLANDON Likewise. \nINT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door. A light glows under the door, then goes out. \nINT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM \nHe opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet. \nINT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nDreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS, past \"Square Pegs,\" \"Miami Vice,\" MTV, to a British nature documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and paper. Titles it \"Life List.\" Pause. He doesn't know what to write. \nEXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL) \nLandon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's \"Rock and Roll Girls.\" \nERIC Women are definitely evolving into men. \nCLAY The moustaches on some girls. Unbelievable. \nBELINDA Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at us? \nThey look.    Jamie's watching them.   They laugh. \nERIC She wants to jump Landon's bones. \nBELINDA That is so pitiful. \nLANDON She's very confused. \nREVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW \nLandon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie would reject his generous offer of friendship. \nEXT. FRONT YARD \nLandon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage. \nLANDON Why do you have to be so weird?! \nThe front door opens, startling Landon. It's the Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed. \nINT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER \nJamie sits on the sofa.   Her father doesn't look up from his reading. \nREV. SULLIVAN The first time I met him I knew. I'm proud of how you're handling yourself. \nTears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her distress. \nINT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nLandon lies in bed watching another British nature DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's photo. \nCLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO \nShe's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama. Ambition: To Witness a Miracle. \nINT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING \nLandon and Luis sit over the geometry text. Landon has just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly. Landon's eyes wander out the window. \nLANDON'S POV - BASKETBALL HOOP \nBACK TO SCENE \nLANDON Let's get outta here. \nEXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - BASKETBALL BLACKTOP - MINUTES LATER \nLandon and Luis face each other across the half-court. Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket. \nLANDON You, me, and the basket. We're the three corners of a triangle. Take one step in. \nLandon and Luis both step forward. \nLANDON Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before? \nLUIS Yeah. \nLANDON Are you? \nLUIS Yeah. \nLANDON So what did we just make? \nLUIS A similar triangle? \nLANDON What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths. \nLUIS Scalene? \nLANDON Okay.   Make me an isosceles. \nLuis steps outward, directly opposite Landon. \nLANDON Yes!    Two sides the same. \nLandon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student, Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring. \nINT. BOOK STORE - EVENING \nLandon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe picks out a book, then sits in a corner. \nBut before he opens the text, he looks around him, suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all the knowledge that could be his. \nEXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - WEEK LATER \nOn the marquee: The Rainmaker. Under this, \"All Invited.\" Under this, a full parking lot. \nINT. AUDITORIUM \nA full house. Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers, booster club and rotary members. \nON STAGE \nThe set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s. Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters. The play's underway... \nSTAGE LEFT \nLandon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely fitted suit. Waiting for his entrance. \nLANDON'S POV - STAGE \nBOY #1 (as H.C., the father) 'Then why don't you talk to her?' \nEDDIE (as Jim) 'Because if we do, she'll think we're trying to get rid of her.' \nBOY #1 (as H.C., the father) 'She'll sure think the same if I do it. You're her father and comes a time when a father's gotta mention.' \nBACK TO SCENE \nDR. CARTER Ed Kelly.    I thought we might get a bite -- \nLANDON Not hungry. \nLandon moves toward his Camaro. \nDR. CARTER Landon! Please. Don't walk away from me. \nLANDON Like you walked away from us? \nLandon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving. \nINT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING \nLandon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No Jamie. \nINT. CAFETERIA - NOON \nLandon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie. \nINT. LIBRARY - LATER \nMany many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie. Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon and turns away. He doesn't pursue it. \nEXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK \nEric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro. They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over. \nERIC (contemptuous) She's like some Puritan. \nLANDON She's not.    She's got her own ideas. \nCLAY Mutant ideas. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON Maybe to you. \nEric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her? \nERIC Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real. \nLANDON It was. \nEric and Clay smirk in disbelief. \nERIC And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan. \nLANDON (not denying it) Scamming's a strong word. \nINT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING \nLandon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way. \nLANDON You weren't in school yesterday. \nJAMIE I went to the doctor with my father. \nLANDON He okay? \nJAMIE Healthy as can be. \nPause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets what she needs. \nLANDON You were great the other night. \nJAMIE Thank you.   So were you. \nPause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks. \nLANDON I haven't been nice to you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE You're hardly nice to anyone. \nLANDON (sincere) I'm sorry. \nJAMIE (walking away) I wish I could believe you. \nINT. CAFETERIA - LATER \nJamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater. Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table. \nERIC Landon! \nLANDON Later. \nPuts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a public statement. \nJAMIE People can see. \nLANDON And that would ruin your reputation how? \nShe goes back to her book.    Ignoring him. \nLANDON (re: her book) What's that? \nShe doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet Letter. \nJAMIE I'm reading all the novels on Mr. Rothberg's best American authors list. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to? \nLandon doesn't answer. \nCYNTHIA (angry) You do that. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCIENCE LAB - NEXT AFTERNOON \nThe door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in. Inside, Jamie ignores him. \nMr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.      Almost approving. \nMR. KELLY Mr. Carter. Don't wear a hole in that one spot there. \nLandon grins and moves on. Behind Landon's back, Mr. Kelly peeks into the science lab. Sees Jamie. Looks back at Landon. Wonders. \nEXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - SATURDAY (DECEMBER) \nLandon parks his Camaro.       It's shiny and buffed and perfect again. \nINT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER \nA Christmas party for the tutors and tutored. A ROCK 'N' ROLL CHRISTMAS CD plays. A raffle ticket box by the door. A sign reads: \"Win Movie Tickets.\" \nLandon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather jacket. Underneath, a nice shirt and tie. \nLANDON'S POV \nAcross the room -- Jamie, looking pretty in a dress, laughing with her student, Isabel. Mr. Kelly talking with MR. REGINALD ADAMS, principal of Jefferson High. \nLuis runs over, diverts Landon's attention. \nFRONT OF ROOM \nMr. Adams goes to a microphone.      Taps it. \nMR. ADAMS Everyone? Quiet please. As you all know, we're here to celebrate the holidays and to raise money to buy books for our library. The book drive is being led by Beaufort High's Jamie Sullivan. \nApplause. This is new. Landon looks at Jamie, who's smiling. She steps to the microphone. \nJAMIE Thank you for buying tickets. We've raised two hundred and eighty-five dollars. \nMore applause.    She steps down. \nLANDON AND LUIS \nOff to one side. \nLANDON (to Luis) About enough to buy maybe five volumes in a set of encyclopedias. \nLuis smiles.    Jamie overhears. \nJAMIE It's a start. \nLANDON Yeah, with a finish in about a decade. \nShe smiles.    He looks at her. \nLANDON So you're talking to me? \nJAMIE When I have something to say. \nHe smiles. \nLANDON What's number one on your list? \nShe shakes her head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON My number one would be getting out of Beaufort. \nJAMIE Getting out won't be your problem. It'll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere. \nShe walks away. \nLANDON What does that mean?! \nJAMIE (turning back) It means you can do anything. \nLandon smiles, not sure why she believes in him. \nEXT.

Landon?! \nLandon comes down the stairs. Sits on the sofa.       Wearing another good shirt. She tries to reach out. \nCYNTHIA You look nice.     I should have dressed. \nLANDON You're fine like that, Mom. \nCYNTHIA There's hot cider in the kitchen. \nLANDON (incredulous) You came here to give me my report card? \nMR. KELLY I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college. \nLandon understands what Kelly is implying. \nMR.

YUGO \nLandon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little League diamond. A family entertainment center. \nINT.

BATTING CAGE - NIGHT \nJamie's in the cage with a helmet on.    A machine tosses balls. Landon coaches from outside. \nLANDON Swing! Keep your bat parallel to the ground. Follow through. Follow through! \nJamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd be embracing if the fence weren't there. \nIn the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling, whispering. \nLandon looks over at them. \nLANDON (gently) Now's when you say something. \nJAMIE (overwhelmed) I can't. (beat) I can't -- explain. \nShe turns back to him, her eyes shining.     She touches his face and they kiss again, deeply. \nBut after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof, staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever she's been. \nJAMIE You make me feel... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON (hopeful) Loved? \nJAMIE (smiling) That.    And less strange. \nTears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with his thumbs, attributing them to happiness. \nEXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER \nLandon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her father taking down the Christmas tree. \nJAMIE Be very quiet. \nHe pulls her to him.      Kisses her.     The front door opens. \nREV. SULLIVAN (embarrassed) Hello, Landon. \nLandon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over her shoulder. \nLANDON Hey, Reverend. \nReverend Sullivan studies the two young people. \nLANDON (whispers to Jamie) Happy New Year. \nAnd he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he allowed? \nEXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY \nLandon and Jamie head into school.        Landon nods to Belinda, others. They glare back. \nLANDON (to Belinda and others) What's your damage? \nINT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nLandon and Jamie arrive at his locker.    It's been kicked in. \nLANDON Assholes.     This happen to you? \nJAMIE Twice a year. \nBang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins. \nLANDON Now they all match. \nINT. CAFETERIA - NOON \nLandon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful. \nShe hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face. \nLANDON What's wr--? \nJAMIE (choked up) The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement. \nThe PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.

My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job. \nThey look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets sky. \nLANDON From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat. (beat) On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds. \nJAMIE What would you do up here? \nLANDON Look.   Talk.   Not talk. \nHe pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the deck. Shuffles like a card shark. \nEXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER) \nJamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.       He gets out, walks to her, they kiss. \nLANDON What'd you tell your father? \nJAMIE The truth.   I just left you out of it. \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power. \nLANDON That what you do? \nJAMIE Yes.   I try to keep my power. \nHe's impressed with how she manages. \nLANDON One of your secrets. \nJAMIE (serious) Yes, one of many. \nHe doesn't notice her tone. \nINT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT \nWHITNEY HOUSTON's \"How Will I Know?\" ON the RADIO. Jamie flips the RADIO OFF. She's got something on her mind. Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote. \nLANDON You're worried about your college applications. \nJAMIE I'm not applying to college. \nLANDON (stunned) But you said -- \nJAMIE No, you assumed. \nHe looks at her, questioning.       She's looking out her window. \nLANDON You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ? \nJAMIE No. \nLANDON What are you going to -- ? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE Pull over. \nLANDON Where?   Why? \nJAMIE Pull over.   Now.

Landon quickly follows. \nLANDON Jamie -- \nJAMIE I'm sick. \nLANDON Then I'll take you home.      You'll feel better tomorrow. \nHe tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps back. Wanting to be heard and understood. \nJAMIE Landon. I'm sick -- with leukemia. \nLandon tries to say something.         Nothing comes out.   His soul numb. \nJAMIE I found out last winter. I'm not responding to treatment anymore. \nHis face crumples with pain and anguish. \nLANDON Why didn't you tell me? \nJAMIE The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. (pause) I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me. \nLANDON Including me?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE Especially you. (long beat) God gives me an illness, then you.

SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT \nThe Reverend and Landon drink coffee. \nREV. SULLIVAN It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now. \nLANDON How -- how long does she have? \nREV. SULLIVAN Two, three months. Maybe less. Maybe more. \nLANDON So you've given up. \nReverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice. \nREV. SULLIVAN Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle. \nINT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM \nJamie looks out the window. \nJAMIE'S POV \nLandon pacing, talking to himself. \nBACK TO SCENE \nShe starts to raise the window, to say something, to help him, but then lets the curtain drop.

LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nLandon lies on his bed in the dark. The PHONE RINGS. Landon stares at his extension. The RINGING STOPS. A voice from downstairs. \nCYNTHIA (O.S.)

You're mad at Landon -- \nJAMIE (furious) I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! (quieter) I don't even know where to put all my anger. \nREV. SULLIVAN That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you. \nJAMIE By making me ill, he is punishing me!

CARTER KITCHEN - FEW MINUTES LATER \nLandon sits at the kitchen table.     Cynthia pours him a cup of coffee. \nCYNTHIA You and I may not be communicating very well right now. But let me be clear. Don't make this about you. It's about her. \nPause.   Her words sink in. \nLANDON I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing? \nCYNTHIA (gently) Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. (beat) Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs. \nLANDON There.   You gave me a chocolate. \nLANDON'S POV (THROUGH JAMIE'S TELESCOPE) - VAST STAR FIELD \nPULL BACK to reveal... \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nJamie and Landon are looking at stars.

He walks over. \nON LADDER \nThe Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.       A long beat, then: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON (calling up) Sir. Being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed. \nThe Reverend looks down. \nLANDON I'll be honest. I don't know if I can pray, but I can do just about anything else. \nNeither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the house and walk over. \nON GROUND \nLandon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend better. \nLANDON Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here. (beat) I could start by driving her to school -- \nJAMIE I'm not going back to school. \nLandon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They understand what she is saying. \nJAMIE You can tell anyone you want.   I don't care. \nShe goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't sound like her. \nINT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING \nLandon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out Jamie's locker. \nStudents stare as he carefully places her things, including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag.

SULLIVAN Jamie, God is not punishing you. No God I know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer. \nPause. \nJAMIE When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more -- \nREV. SULLIVAN I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God. \nHe lets this sink in. \nREV. SULLIVAN God loaned you to me, entrusted you to my care. I'm failing you. \nShe looks away, agreeing without saying so. \nREV. SULLIVAN Jamie. I make you the same promise that God does. (beat) I will always be with you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never wanting to let him go.

Landon goes to the window, looks out. \nISABEL (shy) Hi. \nIsabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling but reading.

I can't even do for myself. \nLANDON But if you could, you would? \nJAMIE Yes. \nHis throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear, sadness, and love. \nLANDON Will you marry me? \nHER FACE \nIllness, happiness, disbelief. \nEXT.

CAMARO - MINUTES LATER \nLandon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath, the body, the paint. A discouraging mess. \nINT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER \nLandon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door. \nLANDON Mom.   I need a ride. \nINT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM \nDark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform hangs over a chair. \nCYNTHIA (sleepy, annoyed) I'm not getting up to drive you somewhere. (beat) What're you doing home? \nEXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nLandon lifts the garage DOOR. \nLANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE \nA murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike. \nEXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER \nLandon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop. A bus approaching. \n", "test1_true": "BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' \"Alive and Kicking.\" \nLANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS \nand worn terry slippers appear. \nCYNTHIA (O.S.) I want to talk to you. \nHe pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out. \nEXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY \nThe mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much. \nCYNTHIA You're not hanging round here all day. \nLANDON I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car -- \nCYNTHIA You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin. \nLANDON 'Bout what? \nCYNTHIA About a job. \nLandon ignores her.    Slides back under his car. \nEXT. UNDER CAMARO \nCYNTHIA (O.S.) He's going to try you as assistant manager. (beat) You could be manager someday. \nLandon can't believe this. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY \nLandon slides back out. \nLANDON I'm not working there. \nCynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look. \nINT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR \nLandon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's making some headway; only two more to wash. \nMARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair. Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's sink. Landon glimpses his future. \nINT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON \nLandon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX, quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer. \nLANDON Who's he in with? \nMISS TARBOX He'll be with you when he's available. \nThe door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN. Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by. \nLANDON (joking) You expelled, too? \nNobody laughs or even smiles. \nINT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nMr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file. \nMR. KELLY Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter? \nLANDON I want to come back. \nMR. KELLY (looking up, surprised) Back?   Were you ever really here? \nThey both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back in his chair, relishing it. \nLANDON (mumbling) I want to graduate. \nKelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own way. \nMR. KELLY (thinking aloud) You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community -- \nLANDON (relieved) I'd do that -- \nMR. KELLY How would you do that, Mr. Carter? \nLandon shrugs, clueless. \nMR. KELLY (smiling) Shall I give you a few ideas? \nLANDON (smiling, too) Please. \nMR. KELLY Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON For pay? \nMR. KELLY For the inner satisfaction it will bring. (beat) Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school -- \nLANDON (joking) I'm as underprivileged as they are -- \nMR. KELLY The fact that you attend this school makes you privileged. \nHis tone quiets Landon. \nMR. KELLY Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings. \n", "test2_input": "LANDON (honest) I don't know that I am -- a man. Yet. I'm working on it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPause. \nHAROLD I've worked on it my whole life. \nHarold reaches under his pillow.         Pulls out a small bottle of liquor. Tops off his cider. \nHAROLD Get yourself a glass. \nLANDON No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home. \nHarold nods, liking Landon. \nHAROLD You'll sit a while. \nLANDON I will. \nEXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT \nLandon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to a stop. \nINT. CAMARO \nLandon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling plastic skeleton and pockets it. \nEXT. USED CAR LOT - NEXT MORNING \nColorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.        Landon talks with a used car SALESMAN. \nSALESMAN Eight hundred. \nLANDON It's got a new V-6 and transmission. Alloy wheels. (beat) Twelve hundred. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSALESMAN Nine-fifty. \nLANDON New paint. Extra chrome.     Not a scratch anywhere. \nSALESMAN The interior is -- \nLANDON Reconditioned. Completely. Be a collector's someday. Twelve hundred. \nThey look at the Camaro.    Shining in the sun. \nSALESMAN You can't expect me to pay you for your -- attachment to that car. \nLandon gazes at another dealership across the street, then adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old. \nLANDON I don't. I expect you to pay me for yours. \nThe Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills. Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then walks away. \nEXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - FRONT LAWN - NEXT MORNING \nThe marquee reads, \"HAPPY HOLIDAYS!\" \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME \nOne car. An old station wagon.        At the parking space, a sign: \"School Principal Only.\" \nINT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE \nKelly looks up from paperwork. \nMR. KELLY Landon? \nLandon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON For Jefferson High. For books. \nMR. KELLY (suspicious) Where did you get -- ? \nLANDON (angry) It's mine to give. I didn't steal it. \nMR. KELLY I didn't say you did. \nBut his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees Landon pedal away on the old bike. \nEXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY \nLandon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk. \nEXT. FOOT OF DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nLandon faces Jamie. \nLANDON Hey. \nJAMIE I heard what you did.   Thank you. \nHe nods, but quickly changes the subject. \nLANDON (re: the Yugo) She great or what? \n", "test2_true": "LANDON No. (beat) But are you -- impressed? \nShe smiles. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE Like fire. \nLANDON What? \nJAMIE You. \nShe heads for her father's old Pontiac. \nLANDON New Year's Eve. Would you go out with me?! \nShe stops.    Turns around.    Surprised. \nJAMIE Yes.    But not as a date date. \nLANDON Why not? \nJAMIE I'm not allowed to date. \nShe smiles and gets in the car. \nEXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - NEXT AFTERNOON \nLandon follows signs for the church office. \nINT. HALLWAY BY REVEREND SULLIVAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nLandon looks into the Reverend's office. \nLANDON'S POV \nReverend Sullivan is sitting behind his desk, examining legal-looking documents and records. He takes his glasses off, rubs his eyes. \nBACK TO SCENE \nLandon knocks.       The Reverend looks up, furrows his brow. \nLANDON Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREV. SULLIVAN Does it have to do with Jamie? \nLANDON Yes, sir. \nThe Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters. \nINT. REVEREND'S OFFICE \nLandon doesn't sit. \nLANDON I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve. \nREV. SULLIVAN That won't be possible. \nHe looks back to his papers.    End of conversation. \nLANDON I'm sorry I haven't always treated Jamie the way -- I should have. She deserves better. \nReverend Sullivan glances up.       As if surprised Landon is still there. \nLANDON I care for her. \nREV. SULLIVAN I don't want to see her hurt. \nLANDON I wouldn't do that -- \nREV. SULLIVAN This week. \nLANDON Ever again. \nThe Reverend looks out the window. A gray day, cold, bitter, stark. He considers his options. \nREV. SULLIVAN Have her home by one. And drive carefully. \nEXT./INT. YUGO (CARTER DRIVEWAY) - FEW DAYS LATER \nLandon's under the Yugo's hood.     Josh, the kid from next door, is in the driver's seat. \nLANDON Start the engine. \nJosh turns the key. Nothing happens.     Under the hood, Landon changes something. \nLANDON Again. \nJosh tries the engine again.    Still no go.   Landon changes something else. \nLANDON One more time. \nJosh tries one more time. The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES, then amazingly STARTS again. It's running. Landon high- fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in. \nEXT./INT. STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER \nKelly hands a paper to Landon. \nMR. KELLY Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good. \n", "test3_input": "He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away. Their hands still touching until she looks again into the telescope eyepiece. \nJAMIE The second best thing is Jupiter. \nShe swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket. \nLANDON Can you locate XXI5639I? \nJAMIE Sure. \nShe takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE Here.   Why am I looking at this star? \nLANDON Because I had it named for you.     I know it's not an official designation -- \nShe couldn't be happier.     She reaches for his hand. \nJAMIE It's wonderful. I love you. \nIt's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object. \nLANDON (respecting her boundaries) Okay.   I'm stopping. \nAnd he does.    They snuggle.   Silence, then: \nLANDON What's number one? \nLong pause. \nJAMIE (very shy) In April when the dogwoods and wisteria are blooming... Get married. \nHe doesn't make fun.     He strokes her hair.    Kisses her forehead. \nINT. KITCHEN - 5 AM \nLandon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking coffee. \nCYNTHIA A late night or an early morning? \nLANDON (honest) Late night. (smart-aleck) You? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA Were you with Jamie? \nLANDON Yeah. \nCYNTHIA You sleeping with her? \nLandon doesn't dignify this question with an answer. \nCYNTHIA I was cleaning yesterday.   I found this. \nShe pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.      Landon is horrified. She reads it. \nCYNTHIA Scuba dive. Touch a moon rock. Learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs. Go to college? (pause) She talking to you 'bout this stuff? \nLandon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table. Smoothes it. Gently discouraging. \nCYNTHIA Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities. \nLANDON I could take after Dad, too. \nCYNTHIA You do. You're handsome and charming. \nLANDON I meant he's a doctor. \nCYNTHIA That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being. \nLANDON I could do it if I tried.   Even Kelly thinks so. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCYNTHIA That'd be something. \nShe doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic. \nCYNTHIA But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment -- \nLANDON (angry now) Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed -- \nCYNTHIA (honest) Disappointment isn't something anyone plans for. (quieter) It catches you by surprise. \nLong pause.    They are both sorry to have raised their voices. \nCYNTHIA Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ? \nLANDON Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me. \nINT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - EVENING \nLandon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan. Silence, then: \nREV. SULLIVAN Landon.   You're not the quiet type. \nLANDON No. \n", "test3_true": "LANDON Like what, sir? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREV. SULLIVAN You decide. \nLandon searches his mind for just the right subject. \nREV. SULLIVAN How about your family? \nLANDON Okay.  Sure. (beat) My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand. (pause) Made a big impression on him. \nReverend Sullivan looks at his daughter.       She's nodding, interested. \nLANDON My cousin Mike. He's from a big family. He's the fifth kid. He heard that every fifth child in the world is Chinese. So he thought he was. \nJamie smiles. \nLANDON We didn't tell him any different for years -- \nREV. SULLIVAN (getting to the point) Your parents are divorced? \nLANDON Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress. \nREV. SULLIVAN How do you -- the two of you -- get by? \nLANDON Materially or spiritually? \nREV. SULLIVAN (surprised) Either. Both. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON (honest) I don't know. We used to try to believe in each other. \nHis eyes meet the Reverend's.      The Reverend's got to respect him some. \nINT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - NIGHT \nReverend Sullivan looks out the window into the back yard. \nHIS POV \nJamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her newer, larger telescope. They are laughing, jostling each other, comfortable, happy. \nINT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT \nReverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away. \nREV. SULLIVAN You and the Carter boy. Want to catch me up on recent developments? \nJAMIE You're asking if we're involved? \nREV. SULLIVAN I'm asking how much. \nJAMIE Dad -- \nREV. SULLIVAN It's time to tell him. (pause) It would be the right thing. \nShe turns to him, upset.    Her anger spilling out. \nJAMIE Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREV. SULLIVAN (calm, stung) No.   I want what's best for you. \nJAMIE This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me! \nREV. SULLIVAN You're sure?    You're sure you can trust him? \nHe's playing to her old insecurities.      She's not one hundred percent sure. \nREV. SULLIVAN (gentler) Isn't it better to know? \nTheir eyes meet.     She knows he's right. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING (EARLY FEBRUARY) \nFerris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos! on the marquee. \nLandon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy tickets. Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them. \nLANDON Hey, Belinda. \nShe takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him. \nLANDON Clay, Eric. \nEric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers and laughs. He's become Landon. Landon reddens, now realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan. \nEXT. SIDEWALK (DOWNTOWN BEAUFORT) - MOMENTS LATER \nLandon and Jamie walk.       The theater in the b.g. \nJAMIE (re: his status) From citizen high to citizen low. \nLANDON I don't care. \n(CONTINUED) \n"}

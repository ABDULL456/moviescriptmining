He's trapped. \nEXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING \nRaining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind. \nLANDON (rude) You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere -- \nJAMIE -- This play means a lot to me. \nLANDON (snorting) This play -- ? \nJAMIE -- I know you don't suck at acting. \nLandon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night. \nJAMIE But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater -- \nLANDON -- What are you going on about? \nPause. \nJAMIE I can judge too. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe exhales, eyeing her, daring her. \nJAMIE You don't care about classes or graduating. But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again. \nLANDON That's deep -- \nJAMIE -- Your act only works with an audience. \nLANDON My act?! \nShe walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last car in the parking lot. \nFire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot. \nEXT.

Closer and closer. \nBACK TO SCENE \nLANDON Yes! \nShe swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling. A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING. \nJAMIE Really? \nLandon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the glove compartment knob. \nLANDON Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave school if I screw up the play. \nJAMIE (to herself) 28 and 42. \nPause.   He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested. \nLANDON What's with the friggin numbers? \nJAMIE 28 is do something illegal.   42 is befriend an enemy. \nLANDON I'm an enemy? \nJAMIE Kinda.    Yeah. \nEXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER \nLandon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her. \nJAMIE The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me. \nLANDON Good thing. \nIf she's offended, she keeps it to herself. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDON You got some kind of list? \nJAMIE Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know? \nLANDON Maybe a little of both. \nThey both smile. \nJAMIE I'll take a chance. \nLANDON Go for it. \nJAMIE It's like a to-do list, but for my life. \nHe smirks. \nJAMIE If you can't imagine the future, you won't have one. \nHe lights a cigarette.       She reaches for it. \nLANDON (joking) Having a cigarette. 100. \nShe grins and takes a drag.      They share the cigarette. \nLANDON So what else is on this list? \nJAMIE It's private. \nLANDON (cajoling) You want to tell me... \nShe eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing her dreams with him. \nLANDON (guessing, rudely) Get very wasted. Lose your virginity -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAMIE (correcting) Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery -- \nLANDON (contemptuous) Ambitious. \nJAMIE Being negative's a lot more work than being positive. \nLANDON Like you'd know. \nJAMIE I do know.

What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths. \nLUIS Scalene? \nLANDON Okay.   Make me an isosceles. \nLuis steps outward, directly opposite Landon. \nLANDON Yes!    Two sides the same. \nLandon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student, Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks back.

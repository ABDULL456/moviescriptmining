(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE (annoyed) A hundred. Then there's his classics list. And his European list. 
Landon realizes this is why she's always reading. 
LANDON That on your 'Life List.'    To read all those books? 
She doesn't deny it.       He just dives in. 
LANDON Jamie. Maybe I want to try being positive. 
She looks up.    Examines his face for the truth. 
LANDON Maybe I miss doing that dumb play with you. 
Students seated near them have overheard.      Whisper. 
LANDON Maybe you inspire me. 
JAMIE That sounds like horseshit. 
LANDON Which part? 
JAMIE All of it. 
LANDON It's not. 
JAMIE Prove it. 
She picks up her books and tray.      Everyone is watching. 
LANDON I just did! 
EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL 
Landon follows Jamie out of the building.      Catches up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON Jamie -- 
JAMIE You lack honor. You lack compassion. You lack honesty. You lack humanity. 
She heads to the old Pontiac.       Landon jogs after her. 
LANDON Okay. Maybe some of that is true -- 
JAMIE You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend -- 
LANDON I don't want to be just your friend -- 
JAMIE You don't know what you want -- 
LANDON You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you -- 
JAMIE And why would that scare me? 
LANDON Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God. 
She gets into her car. Slams the door.        STARTS the ENGINE. She recognizes the truth. 
LANDON But the real reason you're scared? You like me! 
She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at Landon's spectacle. 
LANDON If you were really my friends, you'd be helping me, not running me down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ERIC The only one running you down is you. 
EXT. BRIDGE OVER INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY - NIGHT 
Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights. 
Nearby, an abandoned car.     A rusty old Yugo. 
INT. CARTER KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Landon comes in from outside. Is surprised to find Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform. 
CYNTHIA Out with Belinda? 
LANDON That's over.   Way over. 
CYNTHIA I can't know things if you don't tell me. 
Pause. 
LANDON Dad came to the play. 
CYNTHIA (surprised) You saw him? 
LANDON We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no. 
CYNTHIA (disbelief) After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once. 
LANDON He wants to show now.

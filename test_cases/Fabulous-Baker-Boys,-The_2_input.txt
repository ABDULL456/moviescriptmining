SUSIE (continuing) Sorry. 
Frank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of "Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in, and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital. After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand. 
SUSIE Fellas, fellas ... 
Jack and Frank stop. 
FRANK What's the problem? 
SUSIE The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... (searching) ... music.  You know what I'm saying? 
Jack and Frank look at one another. 
SUSIE (continuing) I mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here I'm having a little trouble getting a word in. 
Jack and Frank just stare. 
SUSIE (continuing) I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right? 
FRANK (icily) No. We are not supposed to be backing you up. 
SUSIE What I mean is -- 
FRANK We're a team.  We work together. 
SUSIE So work with me, not against me. Okay? 
Frank stares at Susie for a long moment. 
FRANK I suppose we can bring it down a little. 
JACK I'll drop the eighths. 
FRANK Okay? 
Susie looks at the two brothers. 
SUSIE Okay. 
WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER 
Frank is on Willie's telephone. In the front of the store, just out of earshot, Jack sits at a beat-up grand, while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another. 
FRANK I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got a voice like an angel ... What? 
Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie, making a very sexy silhouette against the front window, is running her hand over a pearl-white piano. 
FRANK (continuing) No, I wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel. 
As Frank continues to talk in the background, Susie looks over at Jack. 
SUSIE Hey, he's not sore, is he? 
JACK He'll come around. 
Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano. 
JACK (continuing) You never sang before? 
SUSIE Not for money. With my mother. 
Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand. 
SUSIE (continuing) She used to waitress downtown, nights, when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing. You know how people whistle when they're nervous? My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you.  I don't know. If they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments. (shrugging) But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since, I always wanted to sing. I never took lessons or anything, though. I guess you guys took a lot of lessons. 
Jack looks down at the piano in front of him. 
JACK Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons. 
JACK AND NINA 
Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds. 
NINA You shave like an old movie, Jack. 
As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror. 
JACK In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him. 
NINA Is that what you used to do? 
JACK My days are not the old days, genius. 
NINA What are they? 
JACK The recent past. 
NINA Oh. (nodding to the ceiling) Bigfoot gets his out of a can. 
JACK How do you know? 
NINA I saw his stuff in the bathroom. 
JACK Oh? 
NINA I guess it's getting serious. 
JACK Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him. 
NINA I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this? 
Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.

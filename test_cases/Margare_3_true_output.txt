2ND MOURNER She sure did. 
EMILY So. Now I've said my little piece. And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met. She was twenty one. Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence. 
WOMAN MOURNER It's OK, Emily. 
EMILY I know...! (She waits) And I was nineteen! Even though it's impossible for my children to believe I.was ever that young. Emily's college-age kids, a boy and a girl, smile warmly at her from across the room. 
91 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT. LATER. DAY. 91 
Everyone is milling around. Lisa is talking to Emily. 
LISA Emily, thank you so much for letting me be here. 
EMILY Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by. 
LISA Didn't she have any family? 
EMILY No, she was the last one. Except for some cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail. She's the one who gave you my number... 
LISA Yeah... 
EMILY Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all. 
WOMAN MOURNER Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so much for doing this. Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye. 
91 CONTINUED: 91 
EMILY Listen. I still can't believe this is happening...! (she starts crying) I mean what the fuck is wrong with her? 
WOMAN MOURNER I don't know! 
EMILY I don't understand why she didn't kill herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and then after all that with her mother, and then her father, she gets hit by a fucking bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica. Always the worst luck. Always. (noticing LISA) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming. Please don't stand there staring at me, OK? 
LISA (startled, embarrassed) I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye. 
EMILY It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're very sweet. 
LISA (to Woman Mourner) Goodbye. 
WOMAN MOURNER Goodbye. As Lisa-goes out she hears: 
WOMAN MOURNER (CONT'D) Who is that? 
EMILY That's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident. She was right-there when she died, and she wanted to come to the funeral. I told her there was no funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I wouldn't have done that at her age, would you? 
WOMAN MOURNER No... 
92 TIME PERMITTING. 92 
93 TIME PERMITTING. 93 
94 TIME PERMITTING. 94 
95 EXT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 95 
Lisa is on the phone.- The Times article about the accident is 
on her bed. O.C. we hear Curtis practicing his scales. 
LISA No -- M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn? . Thank you. 
She writes down the number and hangs up. Looks at the number. 
Dials the phone. It rings once. She hangs up. 
96 INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY. 96 
Lisa is very disengaged from the discussion. John is walking back and forth, reading aloud from King Lear. 
JOHN 
(READING) "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." (Pause) We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." What do you make of that? Lisa? Lisa? 
LISA I don't know. 
JOHN Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here? 
LISA I don't know. Sorry. 
JOHN You know what, Lisa? That's not good enough. That's not good enough. Shakespeare wrote something: What's your response? And don't tell me you don't have one because I don't buy it. 
LISA I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me. 
JOHN (Pause. Then:) Matthew? 
MATTHEW I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun.

MATTHEW (CONT'D) Like as far as the gods are concerned we're just ants. Nothing. (like a newscaster turning to his colleague) Darren? The class laughs. 
DARREN (responding in kind) Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's Gloucester. Maybe another character would have a different point of view. 
JOHN OK: That's a valid point. Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesn't mean he personally agrees with it. Yes: David? 
DAVID Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying there's a higher consciousness that we can't see. That the gods' perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception, our perceptions are like comparing flies to 
BOYS 
JOHN OK...I don't think that's what he's getting at...I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering. 
DAVID But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness, and he's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary, that's just because we're limited by our viewpoint. 
JOHN Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." I have to agree with Matthew, that seems pretty unambiguous. 
DAVID Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher purpose that we can't see. He's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isn't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is.

JOHN OK, but -- I still don't think that's what he's trying to say. Um... 
DAVID No, like if you say they kill us for their sport, when our perception of the gods is so meager that we can't even tell what they're doing, then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport? 
JOHN 
(LOST) I don't know ...Um -- Monica? 
MONICA I don't think that's what he's saying at all. I think he's saying the gods don't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun -- 
MATTHEW Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys. Anybody? Anybody? 
MONICA Yeah...1 
DAVID But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do anything? 
JOHN David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here -- 
DAVID Scholarly opinion...: 
JOHN And in this particular play what I think he's trying to say is pretty black -- pretty bleak --

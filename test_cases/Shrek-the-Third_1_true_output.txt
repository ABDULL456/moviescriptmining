Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a cottage in the distance and heads toward it. 
SHREK I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve. And then I'll know it's... then I'll know it's whack-- 
Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch, striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 62. 
EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP -- CONTINUOUS 
A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the door. 
ARTIE SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO ME! 
SHREK Artie! Wait! 
Shrek, Puss, and Donkey run into the camp. 
ARTIE C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help! Hello? 
Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified. 
DONKEY AHHHH! 
WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN) Greetings cosmic children of the universe, and welcome to my serenity circle! 
Shrek watches. 
WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN) Please leave any bad vibes outside the healing vortex. And now prepare ... 
With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears. 
The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out. 
MERLIN I knew I should of gotten that warranty! 
Merlin smashes the security device with his little fist and is promptly zapped in the head. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 63. 
MERLIN AHH! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
ARTIE Mr. Merlin? 
SHREK You know this guy? 
ARTIE Yeah. He was the school's magic teacher until he had his nervous breakdown. 
MERLIN Uh, technically I was merely a victim of a level three fatigue, and at the request of my therapist and the school authorities, I have retired to the tranquility of nature to discover my divine purpose. 
Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head. 
Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment. 
MERLIN Now, can I interest anyone in a snack or beverage? 
SHREK Uh, no. 
Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks. 
MERLIN Sure you don't wanna try my famous rock au-gratin? 
Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding from eating rocks. 
MERLIN It's organic! 
They both stare at him uncomfortably. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 64. 
SHREK Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on the way in. What we need are directions back to Far Far Away. 
ARTIE What's with the "we"? Who said I was going with you? 
SHREK Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of people counting on you so don't try and weasel out of it. 
ARTIE If it's such a great job, why don't you do it? 
SHREK Understand this kid, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out! 
ARTIE Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice Guy?" 
SHREK I know, and I'm gonna miss him. 
ARTIE You know what? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone? 
SHREK Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before I kick it there. (TO MERLIN) Now which way am I kicking? 
MERLIN Oh, I could tell you. But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible. 
SHREK Self-destructive ra... (TO MERLIN) Look, are you gonna help us or not? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 65. 
MERLIN Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul. 
SHREK Yeah, I don't think so.

LAWRENCE (sarcastic) You know another one? 
TRUMAN I can't do it. 
LAWRENCE (insistent) A half hour across the bay.  Sea air.  Do you good. 
TRUMAN No, I... (searching for a plausible excuse) ...I got an appointment uptown. 
LAWRENCE This is a sure thing. (conspiratorial) They're upping our quota.  You need this. 
Lawrence exits the cubicle.  Truman's head drops.  He picks up the framed picture of his wife from his desk.  MERYL, early thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail.  He deposits the photo in his briefcase and departs. 
INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY. 
TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the Staten Island ferry. 
As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering a flashback in his head. 
EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER. 
The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father, KIRK, in a small sailing dinghy. 
TRUMAN (shouting above the wind) Let's go further, daddy!  Let's go further! 
FATHER (shouting back) It's getting late, Truman. 
TRUMAN (entreating his father) Please!... 
Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon. 
INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY. 
TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street into the bright sunlight, gasping for air. 
Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street subway station.  Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as he departs. 
COMMUTER 1 (commenting out of Truman's earshot) I can't believe he's taking the long way. 
COMMUTER 2 He'll never make it. 
INT.  SUBWAY TRAIN.  DAY. 
TRUMAN stands in a packed subway car, anxiously glancing at his watch, wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief. 
INT. TAXI.  DAY. 
A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten Island.  TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across. refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor. 
EXT.  BAY STREET, STATEN ISLAND.  DAY. 
TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do condominium on Bay Street.  As he approaches the lobby, he realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his suit jacket. 
INT.  CONDOMINIUM.  DAY. 
A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk, is having his hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties.  Anticipating Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and swiftly departs through a rear door.  TRUMAN enters the lobby and approaches the CONCIERGE, trying to keep his arms tightly at his sides to hide the perspiration. 
TRUMAN I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton. 
CONCIERGE You from the insurance company?  You missed him. 
TRUMAN When will he be back? 
CONCIERGE Vacation.  Two months.  He waited as long as he could.  You was supposed to be here by four. 
A clock on the wall reads 4.l2pm. 
INT.  SUBWAY.  AFTERNOON. 
TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated. The only other occupants in the train, a TALL WOMAN, mid- thirties, reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS, late-teens, sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her. 
YOUTH 1 (to woman) You wanna read to me? 
His companion smirks.

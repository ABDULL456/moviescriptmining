BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM. 
TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms. 
MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and draws it out of the wood. 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -- bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision. 
MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew. He does. 
MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion. 
He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and -- 
Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle. 
Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant. 
SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening. 
Jake looks down at the palms of his hands. 
JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground and -- 
INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS. 
ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and -- 
The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees, which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral radiance. Jake looks down -- 
JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to the roots of the trees and -- 
CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but -- 
IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW. 
CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which FILLS THE UNIVERSE and -- 
REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his head, while inside -- 
TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the wind of time blowing through him as -- 
REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while -- 
INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora -- 
--but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight. 
A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow. Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and -- 
PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK which seems to echo to eternity and -- 
SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body. He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room. 
MO'AT It is finished. 
Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.   The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Did your Spirit Animal come? 
Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How can he tell them what he has seen? 
Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul. 
MO'AT (to Jake) Something has come. (to the others, subtitled) It will take time for the meaning to be clear. 
She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He gets up, weakly. 
OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him. 
GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed. 
Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them there. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You are part of the People. 
All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest -- hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone. DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT 
JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS RISES behind the trees. 
NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water. Jake follows her and -- 
UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES. 
They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them. 
Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float weightlessly, as if between worlds. DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE 
Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains. 
Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their footsteps with expanding rings of light. 
It is an exquisitely beautiful spot. 
The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her. 
NEYTIRI This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered. 
Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES. 
JAKE It's like -- a sound you feel. 
NEYTIRI We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa. 
A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. 
They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense, almost luminous. He feels drawn into them. 
But she pulls back a little. 
NEYTIRI You are Omaticaya now. You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree. (she looks away) And you may choose a woman.

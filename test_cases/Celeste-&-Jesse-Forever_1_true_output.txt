CUT TO: 
89 INT. CAR-DAY 89 
Celeste chain smokes. She makes up songs about how shitty the traffic is. She laughs uncontrollably. She just screams. 
90 INT. DELI-BIG SUR-LATE AFTERNOON 90 
Celeste sits at a window counter. She looks out onto a small street in the center of town. She unwraps her sandwich from noisy, wax paper. It's really quiet in the deli. She sees a group of wedding guests outside. They wave. She waves back. 
91 INT. RECEPTION TENT-EARLY EVENING 91 
The wedding is under way. 
PRIEST I now pronounce you husband and wife. 
Tucker and Beth kiss. Everybody explodes in applause. We see Celeste in the audience, clapping. She looks beat down and tired. 
CUT TO: 
92 INT. RECEPTION TENT-NIGHT 92 
Three girls, with no stage presence, are giving a speech. They are trading off rhyming couplets. 
GIRL #1 She pursued her love of Spanish men, but missed her Tucker, more than just as a friend. 
GIRL #2 And our princess returned home to her loving prince, and they've been together ever since. 
ALL THREE GIRLS We love you, Bethy!! 
The audience applauds. Celeste rolls her eyes. 
GIRL #2 And now we're gonna hear from Celeste, Beth's best friend in the world. 
A little more applause. Celeste has completely forgotten she was supposed to speak. Oh no. She gets up slowly and grabs the mike. 
CELESTE Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, that was so...wow. There are no words. Well, this is gonna sound bad but I actually forgot that I was speaking tonight. 
Beth looks at her, frozen. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I don't where to start. Um...how do you get a nun pregnant? You fuck her? 
Beth's father laughs uncontrollably. He's the only one laughing. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Thanks, Tom. Man, it was much longer than I thought to get to Big Sur from Los Angeles on a Friday afternoon. Stellar call on having a destination wedding the weekend before 4th of July. Busiest travel day of the year. So thanks for that, Mrs. Weinberg. 
Wedding guests look uncomfortable. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) But the truth is, I would go anywhere for Beth. She's my best friend. And I'm so happy for her. Senior year of college, we had a tradition. Every Sunday, come rain or shine, Beth and Tucker would meet me and Jesse at the Bishop with a 12-pack of Miller High Life, the champagne of beers, and we would meet to talk about what was important in the world, you know, Heidegger's influence on hip-hop. Or the feminist duality on "Melrose Place." Life's big questions. Beth and Tucker were just friends then but there was always something there. Just an ease they had with each other. Jesse and I spent years trying to get them together, unsuccessfully. (MORE) 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) But we all remained friends and watched as Tucker dated the most slutty, vacuous and vile girls on the planet. For five long years. 
Tucker flinches. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Finally, he removed his head from his ass, and saw what was in front of him. And that was beautiful Beth. And none of us could be happier about it; they were perfect. At last. Love wins. 
Wedding guests clap. They think it's over. It's not. Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd. Veronica is next to him. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Um...Jesse and I are getting a divorce. So that's...yeah, our timing was not as good, I guess. Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to be best friends. Work hard and respect that. It doesn't come easily. Be patient, don't always think you're right. And if you are, it doesn't fucking matter anyway. Fight for it, everyday, I wish I had. 
93 EXT. RECEPTION TENT-AN HOUR LATER 93 
Celeste is holding a small plate of food. Jesse sidles up to her. 
JESSE I know this may not the best time to talk about this...but...at some point, we will have to talk about Tucker's dance moves. 
INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is. 
CELESTE He is so special. Not as special as that poem. That those girls did? 
JESSE CELESTE Wow. Wow. 
He takes a beat. 
JESSE Your speech was really...beautiful. Thank you. 
CELESTE I meant it. 
JESSE I know.

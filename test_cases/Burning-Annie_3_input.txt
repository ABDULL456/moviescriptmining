He doesn't look excited at the prospect, but Charles does. 
CHARLES Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in ages. Say hi for me. 
27 EXT. FRANNIE'S ­ DAY 27 
Max walks with Beth down the city street. She carries an umbrella and scans the skies. 
BETH Wasn't it supposed to rain? 
MAX I dunno. 
BETH Max, it's been ten minutes and we're still discussing the weather. 
MAX So? Think of all the people who've died in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a worthy issue. 
BETH I just feel like there are other things we could be talking about. You're the one person I could rely on to say something original. 
MAX Okay, okay. (BEAT) So, what classes are you taking? 
BETH This was a mistake, wasn't it? 
MAX What? No. 
They stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon. 
BETH Look, let's just call it a day. I was excited to hear from you, but I can't take you like this. 
A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They hesitate. Suddenly, from inside: 
CHARLES (O.S.) Max! Beth! Come sit with us! 
MAX No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To be honest, it's nice being with someone besides my suitemates for a change. 
They look in and see... 
28 INT. FRANNIE'S ­ CONTINUOUS 28 
...Charles, Scott, Amanda, Sam and Jen, seated around a huge table. They are waving them in. Beth enters, Max reluctantly follows. 
JEN Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you! 
AMANDA It's been so long! 
Everyone scoots over to make room. Max is still stunned but has no choice. He sits. 
JEN How did we ever fall out of touch? We shouldn't let that happen again. 
BETH I know! I even miss this place. I live on the wrong side of campus now. You guys still come here? It's so dark and the menu is tiny. 
CHARLES It never changes, that's why. 
SAM (TO JEN) What are you gonna get? 
JEN Maybe an omelet. 
MAX Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic. 
JEN So don't get the eggs. 
MAX It's just that, it's the smell. It's the smell that bothers me. 
JEN Are you serious? How can you be allergic to the smell of my eggs? 
BETH Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just incredibly picky about food. 
CHARLES Even other people's. 
MAX Look, if you're going to have eggs, let me at least switch seats with Sam, so I'll be farther away from it. 
SAM Max, what's up with you today? Join a support group. 
CHARLES If it really bothers you, why don't you and Beth switch? 
This would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back. 
SAM What about people at other tables? Should we ask the management to stop serving egg- products to people upwind of you? 
JEN Why can't you just get along with everyone for once? 
MAX Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch. Come on, Beth, get up.

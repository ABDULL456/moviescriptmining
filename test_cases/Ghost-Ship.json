She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos to pour herself a cup of coffee. \nINT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT \nEpps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening. \nAs Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold. \nINT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nEpps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the silence. \nINT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nEpps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along. Finally she comes out into... \nINT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nWhere the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS. \nShe turns, shinning her light back from where she came. Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through the line of burners. Nothing moves. \nEpps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping. \nShe moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding her light out before her. She comes to the end of the compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting machinery and a stack of oil drums. \nShe approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here. \nShe tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is metallic and staccato. \nShe stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside. \nThe BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER. She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top of the ship and freedom. \nMURPHY Murphy to Epps. \nShe settles back, exhausted. \nMURPHY Murphy to Epps. \nEPPS (taking her radio) Epps. \nMURPHY You just shoot at something? \nEPPS Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird. \nShe wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, when she smells something really awful. \nShe steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds. \nShe hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes. \nIt takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines her light back to the headless torso. \nShe shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her. \nShe spins around to see another body above her. Except this one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth. \nOne of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe. \nINT.

Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago. \nGreer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the remains of the headless torso. \nMURPHY Bodies're too fresh. \nDODGE Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind. \nMurphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through it. \nMURPHY Greek citizen. Merchant navy. (standing) Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did. \nGREER And look what happened. \nDODGE Damn barbaric is what it is. \nMURPHY Could be meant as a warning. \nGREER Stay away. Or else. \nEPPS Because of the gold. \nMURPHY That'd be my guess. \nDODGE So whoever did this might still be around. \n", "test1_true": "MURPHY Maybe. \nA beat as they consider the implications of this. \nEPPS So, what?

We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place. \nA beat as nobody's too sure about this. \nMURPHY Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough to fix that boat, I don't know what is. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY \nDodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of smoke. \nDODGE All the seals and gaskets're shot. Anything that was rubber burned up. \nMurphy stands at the doorway, looking on. \nMURPHY Can't you use something else? \nDODGE I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time. \nMURPHY Do what you need to do. Just do it fast. \nDODGE Right. \nINT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY \nEpps sleeps in her bunk. \nINT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY \nDodge and Greer climb down in the darkness. \nDODGE I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do. \nGREER I ain't no mechanic, just so you know. \nDODGE You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it. \nINT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book. He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call log. He takes a seat, paging through it. \nINT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY \nGreer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when he slips. \nGREER Dammit! \nA beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening. \nGREER Dodge? \nHe moves on, shinning his light as he goes. \nINT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship. \nGREER Dodge! \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY HEARD. He stops. The song is \"DAISY\" (\"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.\"). \nHe holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and the light falling from the open door. \nINT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log book. \nOn the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, coming to \"TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'\" \nHis finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: \"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.

He looks to it, but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL CLOSES AGAIN. \nMurphy takes the radio. \nMURPHY This is Murphy. Anybody trying to call me? Over. \nHe waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button. \nMURPHY Greer? Dodge? \nAgain, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO: \nVOICE (V.O. RADIO) \"Cock-a-doodle-doo,\" said the rooster to the crow. \"Where are you now? I know, but won't say so.\" \nMurphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button. \nMURPHY Who is this? \nThe RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if someone were there but not speaking. \nMURPHY Who is this!! \nThe CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS. \nVOICE Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. \nThe CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY. Murphy squeezes the talk button. \nMURPHY Greer! Dodge! \nOnly silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio sounds. \nDODGE Dodge to Murphy. \nMURPHY (taking radio) Murphy. \nDODGE You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on \"C\" deck. Cabin 400. \nMURPHY What is it? \nDODGE I think you better see this for yourself. \nINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls from the open door as he approaches. \nAT CABIN 400 \nAs Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the middle of the cabin. \nDODGE I found him like this. \nGreer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other. \nMurphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in tongues. \nGREER Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY \nAN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE \nAs a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated. \nEPPS (O.S.) Hard to say. \nBACK TO SCENE \nGreer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy looking on. She turns it off, standing upright. \nEPPS I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma. \nDODGE A what? \nEPPS I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. (a beat) What happened up there? \nDODGE I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else. \nMURPHY He must've seen something. \nA beat as they consider this. \nEPPS Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside. \n", "test2_true": "Another beat as they hold there. \nMURPHY Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio. \nEPPS Greer? \nMURPHY I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody. \nAnother long beat as they think about this. \nMURPHY It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it? \nDODGE Not me. \nAnother beat as this sinks in. \nEPPS (looking to Greer) He needs a doctor. \nMURPHY I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up. (to Epps, meaning Dodge) Keep an eye on him. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT \nA gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as he holds the radio mic. \nMURPHY (to radio) United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard.

This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Last known position one seven four west, five seven north. I am afloat and drifting.  Require immediate medical assistance for one person, possibly comatose. I am a one hundred twenty foot civilian tug, hove to at port bow of disabled passenger liner Chimera. I repeat, Chimera. Over. \nOnly the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT \nGreer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door comes open and Murphy steps in. \nMURPHY How's he doing? \nEPPS Same. Any luck? \nMURPHY No. I'll try again later. \nA beat as they look on at Greer. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT \nMurphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log book Murphy found in the radio room. \nEPPS (reading it) They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS. \nMURPHY Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here. \nDODGE (taking a seat) On a passenger ship in 1953? \nMURPHY If they knew what they were carrying. \nEPPS You're saying they mutinied for the gold? \nMURPHY If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats. \nEPPS Only something must've gone wrong. \nDODGE Yeah, way wrong. \nA beat as they consider it. \nDODGE So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan? \nMURPHY How do you mean? \nDODGE Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all. \nMURPHY I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth. \nDODGE Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal. \nMURPHY What do you propose? \nDODGE For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them. \nA beat as Murphy holds there. \nMURPHY There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is. \nDODGE With all due respect, skipper. (a beat) Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it. \n", "test2_id": 2155, "test3_input": "INT.

CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when something can be heard ahead of her. She stops. \nFOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back into the shadows, holding there. \nThe footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP. \nEpps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving toward it. \nAs she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship. \nA CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her. \nShe scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again.

CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom. \nShe steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it becomes absolutely deafening. \nThe ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back and forth. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy slows and finally stops. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nA few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING GROWS STILL LOUDER. \nEpps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER. \nEpps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS. \nEXT.

She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the murky water. \nSeveral more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many. They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before. \nAs they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.

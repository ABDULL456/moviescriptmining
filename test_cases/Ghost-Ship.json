{"train": "Ghost Ship - by Mark Hanlon - First Draft \n\"GHOST SHIP\" \n(formerly \"CHIMERA\") \nby \nMark Hanlon \nFirst draft \nFADE IN \nINT. BARGE - DAY \nCrewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side. \nINT. BARGE - LATER - DAY \nEpps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull. \nEXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY \nEpps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north- west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward. \nEXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nUp ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents. \nEpps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be considered pretty. \nShe clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY \nDODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's name \"Arctic Warrior\" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north. \nThey watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor. \nEPPS It's a slow leak. \nShe unclips and drops to the deck. \nGREER What's slow? \nEPPS Maybe twenty gallons an hour. \nDODGE Where from? \nEPPS Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem. \nGREER Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem. \nDODGE I'll sleep good tonight knowing that. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE. \nGREER (V.O. RADIO) Greer to Murphy. \nMURPHY (lifting the radio) Go. \nMurphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up at him from the stern. \nGREER The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka. \nMURPHY Of course they did. \nGREER Let the buyer beware. \nMURPHY What do you say, Dodge? \nDODGE (V.O. RADIO) (taking the radio) If it started out at twenty an hour the piece of shit'd be at the bottom of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess. \nEXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY \nHIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY \nThe shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one side as it moves into the harbor. \nEXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY \nA smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie her up. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nCOASTGUARDSMAN Darlene -- \nGIRLFRIEND You, shut up. \nEPPS (starting off) Listen, I don't want any trouble, okay -- ? \nGIRLFRIEND (stopping Epps) Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right now. \nMURPHY (stepping up) What seems to be the trouble, ladies? \nRIVETER Whyn't you mind your own business, chief. \nMurphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back to Epps and the Girlfriend. \nMURPHY As I said, what seems to be the trouble? \nRIVETER Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down? \nMURPHY I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go. \nEpps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking Murphy by the collar. \nRIVETER These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it. \nMURPHY You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan. \nRIVETER Or what? \nOr WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks in two over the Riveter's head. \nDodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half he still holds, shaking his head. \nThe Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own. \nMURPHY Epps? \nHe looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She grabs her coat. \nCOASTGUARDSMAN Wait. \nEpps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his girlfriend. \nCOASTGUARDSMAN Darlene. It's over. \nHe gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes as the others look on. \nCOASTGUARDSMAN I don't love you anymore. \nDarlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her on the back. \nCOASTGUARDSMAN (to Epps) Come on, Candy. Let's get out of here. \nThe Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy and the others as he leads her out. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY \nMurphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring in her step and a song in her heart. \nEPPS Morning everybody. \nGREER Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps? \nEPPS Showed him a hell of a lot more than that. \nGREER I bet you did. \nMURPHY Candy? \nEPPS It's my pen name. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY \nMurphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky. \nGREER Red sky at night, sailor's delight. \nMURPHY Red sky in morning, sailor take warning. \nEXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nAs the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT \nDodge and Epps play cards at the galley table. \nDODGE Fuck it. \nHe puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her cigarette, collecting her winnings. \nDODGE Smugglers maybe. \nGREER Smuggling what? Tundra grass? \nA beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic. \nMURPHY Merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west, five seven seven five north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior. Do you copy? Over. \nAgain, only the quiet hiss of static comes back. \nGREER Call the Coastguard? \nMURPHY Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out. \nEXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT \nThe Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer. \nMurphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching. \nMURPHY Alright. Back it off. \nGreer throttles back and the boat slows. \nMURPHY Hit the lights. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nThe halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly illuminating the water in front of the boat. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nThe four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad beam of light with a joy stick. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nAs the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight over the bow of the boat and into the darkness. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nThey peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, when a shadow looms into view. \nMURPHY Whoa, whoa. \nGreer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow looms bigger before them in the light from the boat. \nAs they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come around, the name \"CHIMERA\" can be seen above the anchor alleys. \nMURPHY \"Chimera.\" \nMurphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER. \nMURPHY Chimera. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nThe tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera rising above it. \nMURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER) This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior. Is there anyone aboard? \nThe quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nMurphy raises the mic again. \nMURPHY Chimera, I am hove to at your port bow. Is there anyone aboard? \nThey wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the glare of their lights. \nMURPHY Epps, come with me. You guys sit tight. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT \nEpps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against the movement of the water. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nGreer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen making their way up under the floodlights. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nMurphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, lending a still darker ominousness to it. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nMurphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in. \nMURPHY It's a risk I'm willing to take. \nGREER All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it. \nMURPHY So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before. \nDODGE It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size. \nMURPHY The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull. \nA long beat as they hold there. \nMURPHY Listen. Forget this job's just a pay check for a minute. You know I've been good to you. But I'm prepared to offer you something better now. (a beat) If we do this right, it's worth a lot of money. A lot of money. \nThey hold there looking on at him, waiting. \nEPPS Go on. \nMURPHY Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more. (a beat) What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways. \nA beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer. \nMURPHY Think about it. A million bucks a piece. (a beat) You want to spend the rest of your days drag-assing tank barges on the gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's get to work. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY \nThe tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of day. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY \nMurphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look on. \nMURPHY (to radio) United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over. \nAfter a moment, a distance-warped, coolly professional, female voice comes back. \nCOASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over. \nMURPHY North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention. \nCOASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel? \nMURPHY A passenger liner. Over. \nCOASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Say again. Over. \nMurphy looks to the others, almost smiling. \nMURPHY A passenger liner, north island. Over. \nCOASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over. \nMURPHY Passenger vessel \"Chimera.\" I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at... (checking his watch) Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over. \nCOASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over. \nMURPHY Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY \nDodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of the boat under the power winch. \nDODGE Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than usual twin cable rig this time, consisting of a pair of number three gauge braided wire tows. (a beat) We'll tie off through the anchor alleys. And come down to the aft port and starboard pins. Here.  Thus, we need to get two of these... (indicating the cable) Up there. \nHe indicates the bow of the Chimera. \nDODGE Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy. (a beat) Any questions? \nEPPS Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow. \nDODGE Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions? \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY \nMurphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables dangling from it down to the winch on the stern. \nWITH EPPS \nEpps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes his face out from the other side. \nDODGE Ready? \nEPPS Bring it on, dude. \nDodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten it down, with the effect of joining the two cables. \nEPPS OK. \nDodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable through the anchor alleys. \nDODGE (O.S.) (finally) Hit it! \nMurphy eases forward on the throttle, picking up speed. \nEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe giant ship CREAKS AND MOANS as it starts forward, a small bow break forming on its hull. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the Chimera along behind it. Dodge lets out a hoot, exchanging high fives with Epps and Greer. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy smiles as he looks back at the Chimera following behind. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE ON A CHART. The south Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. A pencil traces a route. \nMURPHY (O.S.) I figure we go through at the Unimak Pass here. Refuel at Sanak Island. \nGreer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand over the map table. \nMURPHY With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop. \nDODGE Sounds reasonable. \nGREER Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back? \nDODGE They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away. \nGREER I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size. \nMURPHY The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try. \nEPPS They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away. \nDODGE Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either. \nEPPS Ever heard of insurance, big boy? \nMURPHY Either way, we found it. It's ours now -- . \nAn EXPLOSIVE THUD shudders the boat. They look to each other. \nDODGE (moving for the door) What the... \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nDodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another LOUD THUMP BLOWS OUT OF THE TURBINE VENTS, SHOWERING OIL OVER THE DECK. \nDODGE (shouting up to the pilothouse) ALL STOP! ALL STOP! \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nGreer shoves the throttle back. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing from the turbine vents. \nEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nas the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nDodge pulls open the door. The place is thick with smoke as he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks inside. \nDODGE Mother fucker! \nMURPHY What is it? \nDODGE Threw a turbine blade. \nDodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum intake blade, hot to the touch. \nDODGE Son of a bitch! \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY \nGreer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck. \nDODGE The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered. \nMURPHY How long to fix? \nDODGE Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending. \nGREER You think the extra strain caused it? \nDODGE Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things. \nA doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK CAN BE HEARD. \nA beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock. \nAll but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING. \nEpps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces her, now silent. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY \nEpps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through it. \nINT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating bizarre patterns. \nINT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie on the floor. \nINT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY \nEpps moves along, passing through a doorway into \nINT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine ball. \nShe steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm sea. \nINT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY \nEpps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to the ceiling. \nINT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship. \nFinally the passage opens into yet another compartment, apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes. \nIn the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly preserved. \nMail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' eye. \nA heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, as though blown back from some terrific explosive force. \nEpps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her light inside. \nA clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats. \nEpps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold. \nShe reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high and five feet across. \nA beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in gold. \nINT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY \nThe debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 4' stack of gold ingots. \nDODGE (O.S.) What the fuck we gonna do with it? \nGreer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on. \nGREER What the fuck you think we gonna do with it? It's ours, baby. It's all ours. \nMurphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it. \nGREER How much you figure that's worth, skipper? \nMURPHY (still looking it over) Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million. \nGREER Ho, baby! \nEPPS That's a lot of money for somebody to just let float away. \nMurphy looks up at her from the gold. \nMURPHY Yes, it is. \nA beat as they all hold there. \nMURPHY It's a hell of a lot of money. \nDODGE What, you think there's something funny about it? \nMURPHY A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it? \nGREER If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off. \nMURPHY Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for. \nEPPS That's what I call a payday. \nGREER Hell yeah. \nThey slap hands. \nINT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nMurphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door marked \"CAPTAIN.\" The door is ajar. He pushes it open. \nINT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is ordered and in its place. \nMurphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and protractor amidst other sundry items. \nINT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of slippers lie beneath it. \nINT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an EXPLOSION SOUNDS. \nEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior is tied. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to the deck. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, coming to the engine room door. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an extinguisher of his own. \nThe flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment. \nDodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and hands singed. \nAn EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire. \nDODGE (over the roar) Murphy! \nMurphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out. \nDODGE Propane tanks're gonna go! \nMurphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher into them, holding it there. \nThe flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again as clouds of halon rise up. \nFire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the wall again. \nMurphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the deck, and finally out. \nThey stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, but the fire is out. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY \nDodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on. \nDODGE One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up. (taking a drag) An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire. \nGREER Looks like it took out the backup genny too. \nMURPHY Terrific. \nEpps arrives with a first aid kit. \nMURPHY How's that leg? \nEpps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn. \nDODGE Seen better -- Ow! \nEpps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide. \nEPPS This's gonna hurt a little. \nDODGE Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn! \nEpps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it. \nGREER What now? \nMURPHY We could call for help. \nIn one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging there undisturbed. \nINT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nA pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material crumbling in her hands. \nINT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nA drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket watch and fob, and a room key. \nEpps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, presumably his wife. \nINT. CHIMERA - \"A\" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY \nEpps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but stops, holding there, strongly sensing something. \nTHE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing. \nEpps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, then turns to walk away. \nEPPS Hey! \nEpps moves off as the man walks around the corner. \nEPPS Hey, wait a minute! Hey! \nMOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen. \nEpps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway. She turns back, running right into Murphy. \nMURPHY Take it easy, you'll live longer. \nEPPS Did you see him? \nMURPHY Who? \nEPPS The guy. He just came this way. \nMURPHY What guy? \nEPPS There's somebody else on this boat. \nMURPHY What? What the hell're you talking about. \nEPPS I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy. \nMURPHY Are you sure? \nEPPS Of course I'm sure. I saw him. \nMURPHY You sure it wasn't me? \nEPPS It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard. \nA beat as Murphy looks back at her. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT \nGreer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light. \nDODGE Light in those passages ain't so good. \nEPPS I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody. \nGREER What'd he look like? \nEPPS Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there. \nDODGE Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure. \nGREER She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it. \nEPPS Maybe that is his boat. \nDODGE Gimme a break. \nA beat as they sit in silence. \nMURPHY If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs. \nDODGE Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours. \nMURPHY Not in the eyes of the law. \nEPPS So, we find this guy and make a deal with him. \nMURPHY We don't exactly have the best bargaining position. \nDODGE I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway? \nMURPHY And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off? \nMURPHY Captain relieved of command. \nHe holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final entry, reading: \"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General SOS.\" \nHe turns the page to see only the words \"GOD SAVE US\" scrawled in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL CLOSES AGAIN. \nMurphy takes the radio. \nMURPHY This is Murphy. Anybody trying to call me? Over. \nHe waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button. \nMURPHY Greer? Dodge? \nAgain, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO: \nVOICE (V.O. RADIO) \"Cock-a-doodle-doo,\" said the rooster to the crow. \"Where are you now? I know, but won't say so.\" \nMurphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button. \nMURPHY Who is this? \nThe RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if someone were there but not speaking. \nMURPHY Who is this!! \nThe CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS. \nVOICE Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. \nThe CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY. Murphy squeezes the talk button. \nMURPHY Greer! Dodge! \nOnly silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio sounds. \nDODGE Dodge to Murphy. \nMURPHY (taking radio) Murphy. \nDODGE You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on \"C\" deck. Cabin 400. \nMURPHY What is it? \nDODGE I think you better see this for yourself. \nINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls from the open door as he approaches. \nAT CABIN 400 \nAs Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the middle of the cabin. \nDODGE I found him like this. \nGreer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other. \nMurphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in tongues. \nGREER Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY \nAN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE \nAs a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated. \nEPPS (O.S.) Hard to say. \nBACK TO SCENE \nGreer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy looking on. She turns it off, standing upright. \nEPPS I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma. \nDODGE A what? \nEPPS I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. (a beat) What happened up there? \nDODGE I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else. \nMURPHY He must've seen something. \nA beat as they consider this. \nEPPS Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside. \nA beat as Murphy looks on. \nMURPHY Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get back to shore, you can do whatever you want with your share. But until then, the gold stays right where it is. \nDodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of coffee. \nEXT. CHIMERA - DAY \nThe sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY \nMurphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat. He steps forward, crossing to the corner. \nThe radio set lies before him, dented in and completely demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nDodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast. \nMURPHY Just what the hell do you think you're doing?! \nDODGE I don't know what you're talking about? \nMURPHY I think you know. \nDODGE Maybe you can tell me then. \nMurphy shoves him hard into the wall. \nMURPHY The radio! \nDODGE (not having a clue) The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio. \nMurphy tightens his grip. \nDODGE Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?! \nMURPHY You smashed it! \nDODGE What?! \nMURPHY Don't lie to me! \nDODGE What the fuck -- ? \nMURPHY You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday. \nDODGE I didn't touch the fucking radio. \nMurphy tightens his grip still more. \nDODGE I didn't touch the fucking radio! (a beat) Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper? \nMURPHY Conveniently enough for you. \nDODGE Look, I didn't touch it. Alright? \nMurphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting him go. \nDODGE Jesus. \nDodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on. \nEPPS (O.S.) Murphy. \nThey turn to see Epps in the hatchway. \nEPPS It's Greer. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to see them. \nGREER Never been more thirsty in my life. \nMURPHY Drink up then. \nGreer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a seat, looking on at him. \nMURPHY How're you feeling? \nGREER Lost my sea legs. \nEPPS Any dizziness? \nGREER No. \nEPPS Looks like part of the general log. \nEpps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out. \nEPPS \"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.\" \nMURPHY February first. \nEPPS The same day she supposedly went down. \nMURPHY Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then. \nEpps continues to read. \nEPPS \"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.\" \nMURPHY Collision? With what? \nEPPS The page's missing. Then their SOS was real. \nMURPHY But where's the damage? \nEPPS Maybe the other ship took the worst of it. \nMURPHY If it was a ship she hit. \nA beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE. \nDODGE Dodge to Murphy! \nMurphy reaches down for his radio. \nMURPHY (to radio) Yeah. \nDODGE You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time! \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY \nMurphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS. \nMURPHY What the hell happened! \nDODGE Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull! \nGREER We're not gonna be able to pump it! \nMURPHY Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off! \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nThe tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their gear to the crane. \nWater is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs precariously at the bow of the Chimera. \nMurphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse. \nMURPHY Dodge! \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nWater is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to one side. Dodge wades through toward the door. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, then Murphy. \nDodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, which now lists at a near 45 degree angle. \nWITH DODGE \nDodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the starboard rail. \nHe pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up and edges his way toward the bow. \nWITH THE OTHERS \nEpps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the skewed deck crane. \nWITH DODGE \nThe tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera. \nBelow, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it sinks lower and lower. \nWITH THE OTHERS \nThey look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship. \nGreer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing. \nWITH DODGE \nBACK TO SCENE \nMurphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook it on its wind gauge. \nON THE BUOY \nThe buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMurphy corrects. \nEPPS Higher. You're gonna miss it. \nMurphy holds the loop steady. \nON THE BUOY \nThe loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes down. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMurphy yanks on the line. \nON THE BUOY \nAnd the loop catches on the wind gauge. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy heels over as it's pulled. \nON THE BUOY \nIt drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with a huge BOOMING CLANG. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing bowing a little with the weight as they look on. \nGREER We're still drifting. \nMURPHY The mooring hasn't come taught. \nEPPS It's not gonna hold us. \nMURPHY Doesn't matter. \nON THE BUOY \nAs the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high. \nThe ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own mooring. \nON THE BUOY \nThe buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable. \nDODGE No fucking way. \nON THE BUOY \nThe gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain of spray, whipping wildly from side to side. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera. \nMURPHY Damn it. \nThey look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the ship drifts away. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT \nMurphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him. \nEPPS Hey. \nMURPHY Hey. \nEPPS Couldn't sleep. \nMURPHY Wish I could say the same. \nEPPS Dodge. (no answer, knocking again) Dodge. \nDODGE (O.S.) (finally, from inside) What? \nEPPS Get up. \nDODGE (O.S.) Yeah, yeah. \nINT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT \nEpps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat as she holds there in the darkness. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT \nMurphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of water. \nMURPHY You're late. \nDODGE Sorry. \nMURPHY (handing him the shotgun) Don't fall asleep. \nDODGE (laying out his blanket) Right. \nINT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT \nGreer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT \nDodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is \"Daisy\" playing on a music box somewhere in the ship. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nDodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES. \nINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nDodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another passageway. \nHe approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. It stops. \nHe holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST. \nHe raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end. \nDODGE Dodge. \nSOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END \nSLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other end of the passageway. \nBACK TO SCENE \nHe gets no response, then presses the talk button. \nDODGE This is Dodge. Over. \nHe is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON THE RADIO: \nVOICE \"Cock-a-doodle-doo,\" said the rooster to the crow. \"Where are you now? I know but won't say so.\" \nDodge hits the talk button. \nDODGE Who is this? \nThe RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back. \nDODGE Identify yourself, motherfucker! \nSOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END \nSLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far end of the passageway. \nBACK TO SCENE \nOnly silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then: \nVOICE Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. \nTHE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens. \nVOICE Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy -- \nDodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle of light. \nON SHOTGUN \nAs the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing pulls it away. \nEXT. CHIMERA - DAY \nEpps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD, then stops. \nIt is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS. \nEpps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with a start. \nGREER Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. \nShe holds there a beat, looking around. \nGREER You okay? \nEPPS Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all. \nGREER What? \nEPPS Nothing. Let's get outa here. \nThey start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops. \nBeyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows. \nMOVING WITH EPPS \nAs Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and low to the deck. She stops. \nWITH THE LIGHT \nAs Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still on. \nShe turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the darkness and starts off, Greer following. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight. \nIt is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear. \nShe raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to see that it is blood. \nShe looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them from the darkness. \nHe has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging limp beside it. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY \nGreer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment. \nGREER Can't find the shotgun. \nMURPHY So whoever did this now has our shotgun. \nGREER Doesn't look like it much matters. \nEPPS What do we do with him? \nMURPHY Leave him till we can get some help. (a beat) From now on, nobody comes down here. \nGREER What about the gold? \nMURPHY Leave it. \nGREER Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here. \nMURPHY You think whoever did this is reasonable? \nGREER All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was. \nEPPS I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share. \nGREER I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this. \nMURPHY Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it. (a beat) You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that. \nGREER Fine with me. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nEpps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where Greer was found, room 400. \nShe holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. She opens it. \nINT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting room in the front, is a bedroom. \nEpps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall. \nMurphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened. \nINT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY \nGreer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language. \nMURPHY (V.O.) Must've been him all along. \nMurphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade. \nMURPHY Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. He's off his nut, no doubt there. \nThey watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs. \nMURPHY What do you think? \nEPPS Could be a stroke. Who knows? (a beat) The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. \"Like wild dogs.\" \nMURPHY Over the gold. \nEPPS Maybe it was more than that. \nGreer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He presses his face to the glass. \nEPPS They went crazy. \nMURPHY Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him. \nA beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his wounds smearing in broad red streaks. \nEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY \nA partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps and Murphy stand over it. \nMURPHY We lash a few of these together it might get us far enough into the shipping lanes to be rescued. \nA beat as they look on at the rotting hull. \nMURPHY Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water. \nEPPS If the weather holds it might not be so bad. \nMURPHY It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat. \nEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY \nEpps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into a single usable raft. \nINT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY \nGreer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white light from the skylight falling on him from above. \nINT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY \nEpps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, raises the radio. \nEPPS (holding down talk button) Murphy? \nShe waits, holding there as only silence comes back. \nEPPS Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy? \nAgain, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable presence on the other end. \nEPPS (raising the radio) Who is this? \nThe channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, \"DAISY\" COMING BACK OVER THE RADIO. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, stopping there. \nAt the other end the light falls from the door at room 400. \nThe MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there. \nINT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM. \nThe sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, she continues on, coming to the bedroom. \nEpps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING. \nShe crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then: \nVOICE \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the crow. Where are you now? I know but won't say so.\" \nEPPS (V.O.) NO!!!! \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned state. \nKATIE It isn't real. \nEpps looks back at her from the other side of the room where she stands. \nKATIE Many bad things have happened here. But you mustn't allow the evil inside. I tell you this because you can see me. The others can't. But you must leave. You must leave. \nA LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns back Katie is gone. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps moves quickly along, raising her radio. \nMURPHY Epps to Murphy. \nOnly WHITE NOISE COMES BACK. \nEPPS Epps to Murphy. \nOnly WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be seen. \nAs she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken out. \nA GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF METAL follows it. \nEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across. \nThe ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a mine field for a drifting ship. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas duffle. \nEPPS What happened? \nMURPHY We hit land. \nEPPS What? \nMURPHY We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one. \nEPPS Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows. \nEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull precariously. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the passage some distance down. \nAT THE OTHER END \nEpps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face down in the passage. \nThey step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the body over. It is Greer, dead. \nEPPS He's been shot. \nMurphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes. \nMURPHY Let's get the hell out of here. \nINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nMurphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nAs Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft. \nMURPHY It should be enough to get us to one of those islands. Gimme a hand, wouldya? \nShe joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to the rail. \nMURPHY Prop it here. We need to pull these braces off. There's a hammer on the stand. There. \nEpps crosses back to the stands. \nAT THE STANDS \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when something can be heard ahead of her. She stops. \nFOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back into the shadows, holding there. \nThe footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP. \nEpps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving toward it. \nAs she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship. \nA CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her. \nShe scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck. \nAT THE BOTTOM \nEpps gets up, runs. \nWITH MURPHY \nMurphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps moves quickly along. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD. \nINT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom. \nShe steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it becomes absolutely deafening. \nThe ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back and forth. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy slows and finally stops. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nA few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING GROWS STILL LOUDER. \nEpps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER. \nEpps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS. \nEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious rock promontory of a small island. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, water pouring in behind it. \nEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a huge gash rising on its port side. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nA massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in through the breach. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end of the passage. He begins backing away. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps is forced under as the water in the hull is already half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING EXERTION. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo compartment. \nINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nEpps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays. \nEpps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she was. \nWITH EPPS \n", "test1_input": "EPPS Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her. \nMurphy nods, considering it. \nMURPHY As reasonable an explanation as any, I guess. \nEpps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it. \nMURPHY Ever heard of the Mary Celeste? \nEPPS Nope. \nMURPHY She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard. \nEPPS So what did happen? \nMURPHY Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure. \nEPPS You think she's sailing without a crew? \nMurphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow. \nMURPHY I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current. \nEPPS You're more practical than superstitious. \nMURPHY Only way to be. \nEpps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light. \nEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY \nGreer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck. Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily. \nMURPHY What's this? \nDODGE Turbine rotor's shot. \nMURPHY I thought you said it was just a blade. \nDODGE Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal. \nMURPHY How much longer's that gonna take? \nDODGE Like I always say -- \nMURPHY I know I know, two ways to do anything -- \nDODGE The right way and the wrong way. \nMURPHY But how long? \nDODGE Hard to say. \nMURPHY We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history. \nDODGE I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is. \nMURPHY What about running number two by itself? \nDODGE It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it. \nMURPHY How long, then? \nDODGE I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- . \nMURPHY How long? \nDODGE Three, four days. \nMURPHY Goddamit, Dodge. \nDODGE What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper. \nA beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right. \nCOASTGUARD DISPATCHER (O.S RADIO) (from the pilothouse) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior.

Over and out. \nA beat as they hold there, thinking about it. \nMURPHY Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate. \nDODGE Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway. \nGREER Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge. \nDODGE Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky? \nEPPS If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot. \nDODGE Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't. \nMURPHY We all want to get outa here, Dodge. Especially me. With that boat in tow. You got three days.

ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nA pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates to Dubayy. \nMurphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an \"X\" there. A beat as he looks on at it. \nHe opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks over the passenger manifest. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY \nMurphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of the papers inside. \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nDodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he skins his knuckles. \nDODGE Fucker! \nGREER Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal. \nDODGE (inspecting his skinned knuckles) Damn mind of it's own. \nGREER (seeing Murphy) Morning, skipper. \nMurphy has stepped out into the sunlight. \nMURPHY Morning. \nGREER You're up late. \nMURPHY Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps? \nDODGE Went aboard. \nMURPHY She take a radio? \nGREER Yeah. \nMurphy nods. A beat. \nINT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY \nEpps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She walks on. \nA pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time. And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an instant it is there and gone. \nShe puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing to be seen now. \nINT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \n", "test1_id": 2154, "test2_input": "She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos to pour herself a cup of coffee. \nINT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT \nEpps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening. \nAs Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold. \nINT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nEpps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the silence. \nINT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nEpps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along. Finally she comes out into... \nINT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nWhere the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS. \nShe turns, shinning her light back from where she came. Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through the line of burners. Nothing moves. \nEpps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping. \nShe moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding her light out before her. She comes to the end of the compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting machinery and a stack of oil drums. \nShe approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here. \nShe tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is metallic and staccato. \nShe stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside. \nThe BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER. She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top of the ship and freedom. \nMURPHY Murphy to Epps. \nShe settles back, exhausted. \nMURPHY Murphy to Epps. \nEPPS (taking her radio) Epps. \nMURPHY You just shoot at something? \nEPPS Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird. \nShe wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, when she smells something really awful. \nShe steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds. \nShe hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes. \nIt takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines her light back to the headless torso. \nShe shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her. \nShe spins around to see another body above her. Except this one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth. \nOne of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe. \nINT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT \nA lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various rotting parts. \nGREER (O.S.) Ho-ly shit. \nMURPHY (O.S.) Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago. \nGreer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the remains of the headless torso. \nMURPHY Bodies're too fresh. \nDODGE Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind. \nMurphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through it. \nMURPHY Greek citizen. Merchant navy. (standing) Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did. \nGREER And look what happened. \nDODGE Damn barbaric is what it is. \nMURPHY Could be meant as a warning. \nGREER Stay away. Or else. \nEPPS Because of the gold. \nMURPHY That'd be my guess. \nDODGE So whoever did this might still be around. \n", "test2_true": "MURPHY Maybe. \nA beat as they consider the implications of this. \nEPPS So, what?

We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place. \nA beat as nobody's too sure about this. \nMURPHY Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough to fix that boat, I don't know what is. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY \nDodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of smoke. \nDODGE All the seals and gaskets're shot. Anything that was rubber burned up. \nMurphy stands at the doorway, looking on. \nMURPHY Can't you use something else? \nDODGE I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time. \nMURPHY Do what you need to do. Just do it fast. \nDODGE Right. \nINT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY \nEpps sleeps in her bunk. \nINT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY \nDodge and Greer climb down in the darkness. \nDODGE I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do. \nGREER I ain't no mechanic, just so you know. \nDODGE You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it. \nINT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book. He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call log. He takes a seat, paging through it. \nINT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY \nGreer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when he slips. \nGREER Dammit! \nA beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening. \nGREER Dodge? \nHe moves on, shinning his light as he goes. \nINT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship. \nGREER Dodge! \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nGreer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY HEARD. He stops. The song is \"DAISY\" (\"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.\"). \nHe holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and the light falling from the open door. \nINT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nMurphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log book. \nOn the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, coming to \"TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'\" \nHis finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: \"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.

She shines her light on the room. It is exactly as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light under it. She sits down, trying it. \nINT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nDodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them. \nMURPHY (O.S.) You shouldn't be down here alone. \nDodge turns to see Murphy standing there. \nDODGE Just wanted to check on our little baby. \nA beat as they look on at the gold. \nDODGE That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants. \nMURPHY If money can buy what he wants. \nDODGE I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy. \nMURPHY Then you're a lucky man. \nMurphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it. \nMURPHY We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first. \nDODGE Right. \nMurphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge looks after him. \nEXT.

CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY \nGreer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke. \nINT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY \nMurphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, scavenging for food. \nINT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY \nEpps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway. \nEPPS Murphy? \nNo one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the galley. Nothing. \nINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nEpps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry to the swimming pool. She walks on. \nINT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY \nEpps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls. She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool. \nEpps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her clothing hanging loosely from a frail body. \nGIRL You must leave. \nA beat as Epps stands there. \nEPPS (finally) Who are you? \nFrom this distance and in the light it is hard to fully discern the girl's features. \nGIRL There's great evil here, more than you can know. Leave now or you may never leave. \nEPPS But -- \nA HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look. When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet \"TICK\" SOUND ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom. \nShe steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles. \nAs she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood. \nAnd, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up. Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams. \nEpps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood. \nEPPS My God.... \nEpps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far apart. \n", "test3_true": "The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches out, near tears, helpless to do anything. \nEPPS No!! \nEverything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there. \nThe blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking on in disbelief. \nMURPHY (O.S.) You okay? \nEpps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door. \nEPPS Yeah. (looking back to the pool) Yeah, fine. \nA beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT \nGreer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire. \nDODGE You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat. \nGREER After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather. \nMURPHY Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait. \nDODGE There's a charming thought. \nGREER We can always start shooting birds. \nEpps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette. \nDODGE What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross? \nEPPS (snuffing it out) Why not? \nINT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT \nThe SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure. \nINT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY \nSheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming down when Greer steps in. \nGREER Looks like we're in a strong current. (closing the door) Must be making almost five knots full on ass backwards. \nGreer crosses to the window, stepping up. \nGREER Nasty little swell outa the north west too. \nMurphy nods as he looks out. \nMURPHY Let's just hope somebody sees us first out here. \nINT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY \nA file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts. \nEpps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled \"FULL FARE PASSAGES\" and are divided by first, second, and third class. She goes through them, coming to a section that says \"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN.\" \nShe pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, Angela age: 17. \nShe pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: \"400.\" She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP. \nEXT.

It's got a transmitter aboard. \nEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nDodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy. \nMURPHY Let's go, let's go, let's go. \nDodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat. \nON THE BUOY \nAs it drifts along the side of the Chimera.

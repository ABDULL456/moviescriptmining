{"test1_input": "She thrusts it toward Ned's face! There's a business card stuck on the end. He pulls it off. \nANGLE - CLOSE ON BUSINESS CARD \nIt reads: LE HOT CLUB! No Air Conditioning... And Proud Of It! Scribbled next to it is the message... \"Meet me at 7:30\". The edges of the card are scorched. \nINT. LE HOT CLUB - NIGHT \nIt's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded... and HOT. Everybody is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes. \nNed enters, sees Lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg crossed provocatively over the other. A beer can is stuck to the gum on the bottom of her shoe. It falls off with a CLUNK. \nHe sits on the stool next to her. She looks at him, smiles. \nNED Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked me to take care of this. \nHe reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a LIT CIGARETTE. It has a very long ash. \nLOLA Thanks... \nShe takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then... \nNED You smoke too much. (looks around, then) It's hot tonight. \nLOLA Is it? I never know. My body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal. \nHe notices the drink in her hand is BOILING. A saxophone begins to softly wail Lola's Theme. Ned looks over to see a QUARTET, featuring Dizzy on sax. The GUITARIST spontaneously bursts into FLAME! A FIREMAN, in full gear, jumps up from the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. None of the band members miss a beat. \nNED Maybe we should look for a cooler place. \nLOLA I doubt we'll find one. Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. I go out there expecting to find a cool breeze... but it's just a lot of hot air. \nNed glances at the MALE CUSTOMERS... sitting at the bar across from them. They're staring coldly at Ned. \nNED What're they lookin' at? \nLOLA A lot of them have tried that seat. You're the first one's lasted this long. \nNED I feel honored. \nLOLA Don't. It's broken. \nA beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a CRASH! Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over. \nNED Did you bring the... papers? \nLOLA No. I thought you might come over... \nNED Sure. I'll drive you. \nLOLA I brought my own car. \nNED I'll follow you then. \nLOLA I know it sounds silly, but would you leave first... wait in your car? I come here a lot and I wouldn't want those men to think I'm \"easy\"... a slut who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat. But if you leave first... \nNED ...they'll think I'm a putz for passing up a sure thing. \nLola stares at Ned for a long moment... then SLAPS his face. He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. Then, suddenly, she SLUGS HIM so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar! \nLOLA (for all to hear) Now leave me alone! \nShe pauses to give him a flicker of a COY SMILE... then picks up her drink and moves to a nearby table. Ned struggles to his feet and staggers to the door. \nINT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT \nNed is a mess! Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. Shirt soaked in sweat. He turns the radio ON. LOLA'S THEME starts playing. \nA small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, turning slowly. The venetian blinds on his side windows are partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light. \nANGLE - HIS POV OF ROAD \nHe's following Lola's car. It signals and turns left. \nINT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT \nStill hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan. It spins faster. MUCH faster! The car becomes like a wind tunnel! \nEXT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a large two story house surrounded by lush greenery. \nNed climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side and sticking out crazily. \nANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV \nIt opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe. She casually shakes it off... going to the front door. \nINT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThey enter. It's DARK. Ned squints into the shadows. \nNED Well, here we are... in the dark. \n", "test1_true": "NED You what? \nLola CLAPS her hands twice and all the LIGHTS COME ON. She smiles at him... drops her car keys on the hall table, then goes up the stairs. \nNed drops his car keys on the table too and follows her. \nEXT. PORCH OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLola clicks on a porch light. She and Ned step out. Dozens of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch. \nLOLA My wind chimes. \nNed steps over, running his hands along the boxes. They \"thud\" against each other. \nNED You know, these would work a lot better if you took them out of the boxes. \nHe slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal chimes. They \"tinkle\" and \"clang\" melodically in the breeze. \nLOLA Well well... I guess you have been around. I'm impressed. \nShe moves close, coming on to him. Ned feels uneasy. \nNED Why don't we take a look at those... papers? \nLOLA (remembering) Papers. Right. \nINT. DRESSING AREA OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLola comes in, looks around, then down. She removes her shoe, pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNed is looking through a book... \"KAMIKAZE KAMA SUTRA - The Encyclopedia of Deadly Sexual Positions.\" Lola comes back in, hands Ned the two scraps of paper. \nNED That's it? These are the... papers? \nLOLA Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can you tell me what they are? \nHe checks them out... shrugs. It's obvious. \nNED This one's a laundry receipt... and the other one's an expired lottery ticket. \nHe hands them back to her, but she gently pushes them away. \nLOLA No. You keep them... as a memento of our time together. \nShe slips them into his jacket pocket... then sensuously slides her hands around him, grabbing his buns, pulling him closer. \nLOLA I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay you for all you've done? \nNED Cash would be nice. \nLOLA Isn't there some other way? \nNED I suppose you could wash my car. \nLOLA No, I mean, isn't there something else you want? Something I could give you? \nShe seductively starts to slide the jacket off his shoulders. \nNED Hey... slow down... there's a speed limit in this state. Sixty-five miles an hour. \nLOLA How fast was I going, officer? \nNED Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three. \nLOLA Suppose you pull me over and frisk me? \nNED Suppose I let you off with a warning? \nLOLA Suppose I find a cop with a bigger nightstick? \nNED Suppose I put you under arrest for being a bad girl with bad thoughts? \nLOLA Suppose you handcuff me to the bed? \nNED (rapid run-on) Suppose I do and then we lose the key and while I'm gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and I can't get back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a Polish sausage on a flaming spit! (shakes his head) Nah... I better be going. \nHe turns and leaves. She is stunned, confused, breathless. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nNed opens the door, pauses, turns... as Lola joins him there. She looks into his eyes with desire. \nLOLA You're not so tough. Last chance. \nShe moves her lips close to his, about to kiss him. Then... \nNED No thanks. I got a cold shower and a wife who trusts me waiting at home. \nLOLA What's the matter? Don't you want me? It's the way I look, isn't it? \n", "test1_id": 1023, "test2_input": "Ned rubs his temples, shuts his eyes. \nNED (V.O.) It was all starting to give me a headache bigger than the national deficit. \nINT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" plays on the stereo. Lola sits on the floor by an end table, eyes dazed, staring blankly. A lamp with a \"clapper\" switch sits on the table. \nAs the CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY to her, she absently \"claps\" the light off... then on... then off... then on... then off... \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON female hands using a keyhole saw to cut through a railing on the second floor landing above the foyer. \nOutside... the SOUND of a car... headlights! The sawing stops. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nNed pulls up. The house is dark and ominous. So is the MUSIC. \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe front door is open a crack. He cautiously pushes it and the door CR-E-A-K-S open very slowly. The door STOPS, but the LOUD CREAKING continues. Ned touches it lightly with the tip of his finger. The CREAKING STOPS. \nNED Lana? \nNed moves up the stairs. The CAMERA BOOMS UP with him, HOLDING ON an ECU of the partially severed railing. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNed enters. Hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot bathtub. He turns the water off, looking around, puzzled. \nLoosens his tie, rubs his head. A splitting headache. Opens the medicine cabinet and... SCREECH! YEOW! CRASH! A CAT leaps out!... darts away. There's a NOISE from downstairs. \nINT. THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nSomeone is POUNDING on the door. Ned enters and opens it. It's Laura. \nLAURA Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so much to tell you. \nNED Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab a chair. \nLAURA Thanks... I brought my own. \nShe drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table. Ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on. He starts searching through the cupboard for teabags. \nNED So... what have you got? \nLAURA A lottery ticket and a laundry receipt. (lays them on table) I found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client. \nNed freezes, staring out the window, unable to face her. \nLAURA You remember that night, don't ya Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L- O... L-A. Lola. \nNed turns to her when he hears Lola's name... looking baffled by this convoluted piece of logic. \nLAURA (shrugs it off) Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's mind works. \nHe turns back to the cupboard, picking up a container. \nNED How about Ovaltine? \nLAURA Fine. Then I remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife's car for two months. You with me so far? \nNED I'm way ahead of you. \nHe brings the Ovaltine container to the table. \nLAURA Well back it up. You probably took a wrong turn. Remember your insurance policy... the one we couldn't find? I started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me? The answer came up... Lana. And since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here. \nA huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them. Laura SMASHES it with her fist, breaking it open! Cookies spill out... and the insurance policy. \nNED So that's where she hid the Oreos. \nHe sits down... starts eating Oreos... twisting them apart. \nLAURA Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot Max Shady. She and Frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy. But she shot the wrong guy. \nNED That's the craziest thing I ever heard. \nLAURA (she presses on) Don't you see... Frank was going to let her take the fall. So she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide. (beat) That's when I realized there was a connection between Lola and Lana... \nNED Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters. \nLAURA Well, hang on to your jock strap, Ned. There's more. \nShe unrolls a complex genealogical chart... walks him thru it. \nLAURA Not only is Frank's father Dwayne Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher and Lola Cain's former lover... Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max and Frank are half-brothers who never met. \nLaura pauses dramatically, then announces. \nLAURA Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered both of Helen Shady's sons. \n", "test2_true": "LAURA And you haven't even heard my story. \nINT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT \nThe keyhole saw cuts through the railing. The CAMERA REVEALS Lana, eyes filled with Machiavellian rage. \nShe enters the bathroom, lays the saw blade down. Suddenly... a PAIR OF HANDS plunge into frame, grabbing her by the throat! \nWe GO WITH HER as she is pushed back into the tub, the hands forcing her head under water. Lana grabs a diving mask, clamps it over her face. One of the attacking hands rips it away! Lana grabs a snorkel, sticking it in her mouth. The hand pulls it from her, tossing it aside. \nThe hand shoves a little RUBBER DUCKIE into Lana's mouth! Lana struggles, finally going limp. Her open eyes stare up from beneath the water. The last few bubbles rise to the surface. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLAURA He turned into a monster. And that's when I left him. I just couldn't... \nThe tea kettle WHISTLES! Laura pulls it off the burner. The whistling subsides... replaced by the distant SOUND of water running upstairs. Ned cocks his head, listening. \nNED That damn faucet keeps turning on all by itself. I'll go check it. \nLAURA Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine. \nNed exits. Laura opens the Ovaltine container. It's empty. A DARK SHADOW moves past the window behind Laura. Suspense MUSIC. Laura opens the cupboard. PIGEONS explode out, wings beating furiously! She catches her breath, looks in the cupboard. The cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit. She shoves them aside, looking for the Ovaltine. \nINT. FOYER - SAME TIME \nNed looks up toward the light from the bathroom. Water seeps over the edge of the landing and down the steps. As he moves up the steps, the SOUND of MUSIC... the familiar strains of \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\"... grows louder and LOUDER. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME \nIt's filled with steam. He waves the steam away... STARTLED to see Lana's lifeless body beneath the water, the rubber duckie jammed into her mouth. The tub overflows on the floor. \nHe turns the faucet off. The water stops... and so does the MUSIC. Puzzled, he turns the faucet on. The MUSIC STARTS. Turns it off. The MUSIC STOPS. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nAs Laura turns away to enter the pantry... her Husband's twisted face suddenly appears in the kitchen window! \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nNed enters. The MUSIC is coming from the closet. Ned yanks the door open! A flock of PIGEONS bursts out!... revealing a GUEST MUSICIAN playing an instrument. \nGUEST MUSICIAN I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a gig tonight. \nNed shuts the door, eyes shifting. Lola must be near. \nINT. PANTRY OFF KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura searches the large walk-in pantry for tea bags. She hears a LOUD CRASH of BREAKING GLASS in the kitchen... stops and listens... then casually shrugs it off. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura's Husband stands in the kitchen. The back door is open... the window shattered. He SEES... the kitchen towels hanging sloppily on the rack! The disorganized clutter of cans and boxes in the cupboard! WE PUSH IN to his wildly insane eyes! \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME \nAs Ned enters the upstairs landing, we hear VOICES in his mind. \nNED (ECHOING V.O.) Women are an open book. You can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches. I'd stake my career on it... stake my career on it... stake my career on it... \nThe repetitive ECHO gets to him. He smacks his head with the palm of his hand. The skipping stops... followed by... \nNED (ECHOING V.O.) ...If anyone ever proves me wrong, I'll throw away my badge. \nIN THE DARKNESS \nA woman's HAND unrolls a leather kit... the \"U-Pick an Ice Pick Porta-Pik-Pak!\"... with seven ice picks in separate slots, each labeled with a day of the week. \nThe hand selects \"Wednesday's\" ice pick, pulls it out. Then... BONG... BONG... BONG... BONG...! \nCANTED ANGLE ON - A GRANDFATHER CLOCK \nIt CHIMES loudly. It's twelve midnight! \nTHE HAND \nreturns the ice pick to its slot, selects the one for Thursday. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura comes out of the pantry. She stops... gasps! Everything in the cupboard is neatly stacked! All the towels are straight! \nShe whirls around... coming face to face with her Husband! He smiles demonically, holding up the Ninja Turtle float ring. \nLAURA'S HUSBAND Forget something, sweetheart? \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME \nNed nears the bathroom door and suddenly... A PIERCING SCREAM! Lola charges, an ice pick raised over her head! She knocks him backward, into the bathroom, slashing at him. But he deflects the attack, grabbing at her arms. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \n", "test2_id": 1024, "test3_input": "Laura backs away from her Husband. He holds her wedding ring. \nLAURA'S HUSBAND You forgot to flush, darling. \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME \nAs Ned and Lola continue their violent struggle... Lola grabs toiletries to aid in her attack. She squirts Ned with SHAVING CREAM... squeezes TOOTHPASTE in his hair... and throws BATH POWDER in his face! \nNed is blinded. Gaining the advantage, Lola shoves him back, slamming his head into the wall. He's dazed, helpless. \nLola raises the ice pick, moving forward to strike! But Ned grabs a HAIR BLOWER and swings it around, pointing it at her like a gun! She freezes... then smiles contemptuously. \nLOLA What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me away? \nShe LAUGHS arrogantly. Ned clicks on the hair blower to HIGH, a blast of HOT AIR hitting Lola's face, puffing her cheeks out, pushing her back, hair flying wildly! \nHer backside hits the railing where Lana has cut it... the wood splintering! \nLola tumbles over backward, SCREAMING! She hangs suspended in mid-air for a moment, like a cartoon character, arms flailing. Then... WHOOM!... she FALLS to the marble floor below, hitting with a LOUD THUD! \nINT. THE KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura's Husband hears Lola fall, turning. Laura grabs the iron skillet and CLOBBERS him with it! BONG! He goes down. \nLAURA I never forget anything... honey. \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME \nNed stares at the hair blower in his hand. Filled with disgust and revulsion, he throws the \"weapon\" down. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura pulls TWO REVOLVERS from her purse... spinning them like John Wayne... expertly tossing one over her back, catching it in front! She heads for the foyer. \nINT. FOYER - A MOMENT LATER - ON LOLA'S BODY \nLaura pauses, looks down at Lola's body... notices something. She pushes Lola's skirt a bit higher with the toe of her shoe. \nLAURA (outraged) Those are MY panties! \nShe looks up... sees a light emanating from the bathroom. \nON THE LANDING \nLaura moves through the shadows... stops outside the bathroom, pressing her back against the wall, guns up and ready. \nShe swivels into the doorway... taking a shooter's stance... guns pointed! She sees... LANA... submerged in the tub, face up, the rubber duckie in her mouth. \nLaura steps back and turns... right into a THING covered in white! Startled, she SHRIEKS! Ned drops the white towel he's using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste. Relieved to see it's Ned, she throws her arms around him! \nLAURA Oh Ned! \nNED You were right... there's a million things I don't know about women. Maybe you can teach me a few hundred. \nHe pulls out his police badge, looks at it. \nNED Hell... I had too many careers anyway. \nHe tosses it away, over the railing. \nINT. FOYER - ECU LOLA - SAME TIME \nThe badge drops from above, landing on the floor right in front of Lola's lifeless face. A beat. Her eyes pop open! \nINT. BATHROOM - ECU ON BATH WATER - SAME TIME \nSuddenly, the rubber duckie pops to the surface. \nON THE LANDING \nLaura hugs Ned again, arms locked around his neck, still gripping a gun in each hand. \nLAURA Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved you! \nINT. FOYER \nLola sits bolt upright, bloody but still bouncy. \nINT. BATHROOM \nLana suddenly SITS UP in the tub, inhaling a huge GASP of air, her eyes wild! \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLaura's Husband's eyes POP OPEN! He SITS UP suddenly... smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table! He topples back slowly... really dead! Finally. \nINT. THE STAIRCASE \nLola's feet move steadily up each stair... her bloody hand grasping the ice pick. \nINT. BATHROOM FLOOR - LOW ANGLE \nLana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around. She picks up the pointed saw from the floor. \n", "test3_true": "Ned and Laura still embrace, her forearms crisscrossed behind his neck. It's been a long embrace. \nSuddenly, Lana and Lola both appear, SCREAMING like banshees! \nLana charges from the bathroom, grasping the sharp saw blade! Lola races at them from the stairway... with the ice pick! \nWithout missing a beat, Laura raises the barrels of both guns and FIRES at them simultaneously... right next to Ned's ears. \nThe impact of one bullet knocks Lana all the way back through the bathroom, CRASHING spectacularly out the window! The other bullet sends Lola flipping down the staircase! \nNed looks stunned, his eyes crossed... the thundering gunshots still ringing in his ears. Laura proudly blows the gunsmoke away from the end of each barrel. \nLAURA Got 'em! \nNED (deafened) WHAT? \nLAURA I said... I GOT 'EM! \nNED HUH?!!! \nLAURA (yells) THEY'RE DEAD! GONE! KA-PUT! \nHe strains to make out what she's saying, ears still ringing. \nNED (yells back) SURE I'LL MARRY YOU! NEXT TUESDAY WOULD BE PERFECT! \nA beat. Laura opens her mouth to correct him, then decides against it. She smiles... speaking softly, almost shyly. \nLAURA Okay. But I want to have kids. \nHe hears THIS... smiles at her. \nNED Great. \nThey embrace. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - NEAR DAWN \nWe MOVE IN SLOWLY toward the house. \nNED (V.O.) So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women really are like a big jigsaw puzzle... with pieces that never seem to fit where you want 'em to. \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nNed and Laura are in bed, wrapped in each other's arms. \nNED (V.O.) All I know is, there are three things that men can't possibly ever do... \nNEW ANGLE - NED AND LAURA \nRevealing that it's NOT \"voice over narration.\" Ned is actually rattling on aloud again. \nNED ...understand women... give birth... and program a VCR. And giving birth is the easy one. \nLAURA Ned... \nNED Yeah, Laura? \nLAURA Knock off the chatter, will ya? \nHe smiles at her. They kiss. Romantic SAXAPHONE MUSIC begins to play... only this time, it's \"Laura's Theme.\" \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... revealing Dizzy laying on the bed beside them... playing the sax. \nAfter a beat, Laura turns to Dizzy. \nLAURA We won't need you anymore. \nNed casually slips him a twenty dollar bill. Dizzy slips off the bed and out the door. Laura turns to Ned. \nLAURA We can make our own music. \nHer hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed, toward the floor. Suddenly... she comes up with a CONCERTINA, a small accordian... and begins to play it! \nNed lays there listening for a few moments, a stunned look frozen on his face. Then... he reaches under the pillow and pulls out a HARMONICA and joins in. \nThe CAMERA BOOMS UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT... as they play MEDLEY of all the MUSIC heard in the film. \nFADE TO BLACK \nROLL END CREDITS \nAfter the final credit, WE HEAR: \nLAURA (V.O.) Ned, do you know... I want you to make love to me all night long? \nNED (V.O.) No. But if you hum a few bars... I'll fake it. \nTHE END \nFatal Instinct Writers : \u00a0\u00a0David O'Malley Genres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller User Comments \n", "test3_id": 1025}

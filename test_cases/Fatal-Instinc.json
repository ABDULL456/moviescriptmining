{"train": "\"FATAL INSTINCT\" \nScreenplay by \nDavid O'Malley \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN ON: \nEXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT \nThe sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell. \nCLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELS \nand a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier. \nOPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER. \nAfter several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with each step. \nThe MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond. \nNED (V.O.) To some guys, women are like a cheap puzzle... with pieces that just don't fit. They think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley... more tangled than a telephone cord... and colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. But those guys don't even have a clue. \nShe stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term \"femme fatale\" was coined for her. She's on display... and knows it. \nNED (V.O.) When you know women the way I do, you understand exactly what what makes them tick... what makes them hum... what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk. And it's not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course. \nThe CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM. \nOne is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost. \nNext to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his fingers. \nThe CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola. \nANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POV \nShe walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing. \nNED (V.O.) There are two kinds of women in this world... and I've known 'em both. \nANGLE - ARCH \nArch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't \"voice-over\" narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud. \nNED (V.O.) One will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt. But the other kind... \nARCH (interrupts) Jeez... knock off the chatter, will ya. \nNED Just trying to keep you awake, Arch. \nARCH I'm awake! Where do you come up with all that crap about women? \nNED It's true. Women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em... they're an open book. You can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches. \nARCH Are you kiddin'? \nNED I'd stake my career on it. Anybody ever proves me wrong, I'll throw away my badge. \nARCH Aayyhh... women are trouble... \nNED I used to believe that too. Until I married Lana. Now, she... is a peach. \nARCH Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. Everything a guy could ever want, including NO kids. \nNED I'd love to have kids. \nARCH What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break! (looks around) Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes you think Milo's gonna show up here? \nNED Logic. He knocked off all those banks. He's got cash. He's gonna want to spend it. This is one of the few places that still takes cash. Sooner or later... he's gotta turn up. \nARCH And how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag? \nNED The \"Support Hose Bandit\"? When you see him... you'll know him. \nIn the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the \"Support Hose Bandit\", ambles by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through the panty-hose pulled down over his head. \nARCH These are the best damn Nachos in North America. Maybe the world! \nHe pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and turns the container over. \nARCH I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. You want some? \nNed shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean. \nA SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME. \nA beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes. \nLOLA Got a light? \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY \nRichly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. As in all \"Noir\" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk. \nLAURA, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer office, files in hand. She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self- sacrificing \"girl-friday\" and legal secretary. She keeps his life from spinning crazily apart. She absolutely adores him. \nNED Laura... do you know where...? \nLAURA (hands him file) Right here. The judge decided to skip arraignment and take Milo direct to trial. You're six minutes late, but don't sweat it. You got Judge Allen. He's always eleven minutes late. \nShe picks up a lawbook, flips it open to a dog-eared page. \nLAURA I suggest you try Lemming versus Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed. \nNED (thinks about it) Yeah. Good idea. \nHe smiles gratefully... drops the file into his briefcase. \nNed heads for the office washroom. Laura darts ahead of him into the washroom and turns the water on. \nNed steps in... splashes some water on his face. Laura grabs a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly... hands it to Ned. He dries his face, looking at her with genuine fondness and gratitude. \nNED I don't know what I'd do without you? \nShe glances toward the toilet, notices it hasn't been flushed. She FLUSHES it, lowers the seat. \nLAURA Really? \nShe sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as he shaves with an electric razor. \nNED Laura, how long have you worked for me? \nLAURA Two years, seven months, twenty-three days, nineteen hours... (checks her watch) ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds. (softly, to herself) ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty- five... fifty-six... \nNED And when was the last time I gave you a raise? \nLaura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point. \nLAURA Never. But that's okay. I don't need a raise. In fact... I was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary. \nHe clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long moment, considering this, then... \nNED Naw. That's okay. You keep it. \nHe gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew... right next to her face. He exits. \nLaura stares at the towel with a tortured expression. The CAMERA PUSHES IN to her face as we see... \nINT. ULTRA-MODERN BEACH HOUSE - DAY \nScrawled on a steamed-up bathroom mirror - FLASHBACK - CAPE COD - THREE YEARS EARLIER. A hand wipes the mirror off, revealing Laura... younger, longer hair, with a nasty black eye. \nLAURA'S HUSBAND appears behind her, glaring insanely. He looks toward the towel rack. \nThere are three towels... with HIS - HIS - HIS embossed along the bottom edge. One towel hangs longer than the others. \nLAURA'S HUSBAND Did we forget something? \nShe meekly lines up all the towels. \nLAURA'S HUSBAND Did we forget something? \nShe meekly lines up all the towels. \nINT. BEACH HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY \nLaura's Husband pulls the cupboard open. All the cans and boxes are neatly stacked in straight lines. All except one. She straightens it... trembling with fear. \nEXT. DECK OF BEACH HOUSE - DAY \nHe pulls her outside, nodding toward a line of tall PINE trees behind the house. They are all straight and even... except one, whose tall branches tower conspicuously above the rest. \nHe holds up a chainsaw, nodding toward the trees. Shaking and tearful... she backs into the house. \nEND FLASHBACK \nBACK TO LAURA \nSCREAMING out in terror! Ned rushes in, shaking her. \nNED Laura. Laura! What is it? \nLAURA (coming out of it) I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a bit... claustrophobic... in the bathroom. \nNED Maybe we should try some prune juice. \nHe gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze, then exits. She shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure. \nNed opens a wardrobe closet in his office. He walks along, looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits, hanging neatly. Laura follows behind him. He stops and stares, indecisive. \nNED Damn birds! \nHe grabs his shoe, heaving it toward the open window. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING \nFrank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant smirk. WHAP! Ned's shoe hits him right in the face! \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nNed comes down the courthouse steps. He pauses in the street, glimpsing the back of a WOMAN passing nearby... a STUNNING BLOND decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat... a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel shoe. It must be LOLA. He turns to watch her. \nA HORN BLARES! BRAKES SCREECH! The SOUND OVERLAPS to... \nINT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY \nThe door opens. Ned enters, looking terrible. Suit ripped, hair messed up, bruised and battered, briefcase crushed. \nLAURA My God, Ned... you look like you were hit by a bus. \nNED I was. (notices) Who's in my office? \nLAURA Max Shady's mother. \nNED Not again. \nINSIDE THE OFFICE \nMRS. SHADY, an older woman with a pleasant appearance, sits in an overstuffed leather chair. Ned and Laura enter. \nNED Hello, Mrs. Shady. \nNed goes straight to his office closet, pulls out an identical blue suit... and starts stripping off his tattered clothes. \nNED Laura... check on my insurance. Make sure it's paid up. \nLaura reluctantly returns to the outer office. \nMRS. SHADY Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max, is getting out of prison tomorrow. \nNED (checks his watch) Gee, has it been seven years already? \nMRS. SHADY Seven long, miserable years in the slammer. And he's a bit pissed off. \nNED Well, being locked in a tiny room with no TV can make a guy feel pretty tense. \nMRS. SHADY I'm very concerned about him, Mr. Ravine. He said you were a two-bit shyster... and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball! \nHe goes to her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking her right in the eye, attempting to provide solace. \nNED I'm sure the experience wasn't all negative. He probably made a lot of friends... \nMRS. SHADY (ever hopeful) You think? \nNED ...learned a useful trade... \nMRS. SHADY Oh yes... live autopsies... \nNED ...caught up on all those books he wanted to read... \nShe struggles to her feet feebly... \nMRS. SHADY Maybe so... but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles... \nShe hauls off and PUNCHES him like a pile driver! WHAM! He doubles over, gasping. \nMRS. SHADY ...smash your face... \nShe KNEES him in the face, raising him up... then nails him with a devastating RIGHT CROSS, spinning him around. He collapses over the desk. \nMRS. SHADY ...and decimate your wardrobe. \nShe grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the back! \nMRS. SHADY And I wouldn't want that to happen. (spanks his butt) He's a naughty naughty boy. I just thought I should warn you. \nShe turns and shuffles out, passing through the outer office. \nMRS. SHADY (to Laura) Bye for now. (pauses by desk) Oh... may I have a cookie? \nLAURA (at file cabinet) Sure. \nShe grabs a handful of cookies and casually flings them at Laura... as she heads out the door. \nMRS. SHADY Thank yooooooooou. \nLaura rushes into Ned's office with the file folder. He staggers unsteadily by the desk. \nLAURA Oh my God, Ned. \nNED I hate when she comes to see me. \nLAURA Don't you realize, Ned?... you could be in real danger. \nShe thrusts it toward Ned's face! There's a business card stuck on the end. He pulls it off. \nANGLE - CLOSE ON BUSINESS CARD \nIt reads: LE HOT CLUB! No Air Conditioning... And Proud Of It! Scribbled next to it is the message... \"Meet me at 7:30\". The edges of the card are scorched. \nINT. LE HOT CLUB - NIGHT \nIt's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded... and HOT. Everybody is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes. \nNed enters, sees Lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg crossed provocatively over the other. A beer can is stuck to the gum on the bottom of her shoe. It falls off with a CLUNK. \nHe sits on the stool next to her. She looks at him, smiles. \nNED Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked me to take care of this. \nHe reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a LIT CIGARETTE. It has a very long ash. \nLOLA Thanks... \nShe takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then... \nNED You smoke too much. (looks around, then) It's hot tonight. \nLOLA Is it? I never know. My body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal. \nHe notices the drink in her hand is BOILING. A saxophone begins to softly wail Lola's Theme. Ned looks over to see a QUARTET, featuring Dizzy on sax. The GUITARIST spontaneously bursts into FLAME! A FIREMAN, in full gear, jumps up from the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. None of the band members miss a beat. \nNED Maybe we should look for a cooler place. \nLOLA I doubt we'll find one. Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. I go out there expecting to find a cool breeze... but it's just a lot of hot air. \nNed glances at the MALE CUSTOMERS... sitting at the bar across from them. They're staring coldly at Ned. \nNED What're they lookin' at? \nLOLA A lot of them have tried that seat. You're the first one's lasted this long. \nNED I feel honored. \nLOLA Don't. It's broken. \nA beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a CRASH! Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over. \nNED Did you bring the... papers? \nLOLA No. I thought you might come over... \nNED Sure. I'll drive you. \nLOLA I brought my own car. \nNED I'll follow you then. \nLOLA I know it sounds silly, but would you leave first... wait in your car? I come here a lot and I wouldn't want those men to think I'm \"easy\"... a slut who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat. But if you leave first... \nNED ...they'll think I'm a putz for passing up a sure thing. \nLola stares at Ned for a long moment... then SLAPS his face. He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. Then, suddenly, she SLUGS HIM so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar! \nLOLA (for all to hear) Now leave me alone! \nShe pauses to give him a flicker of a COY SMILE... then picks up her drink and moves to a nearby table. Ned struggles to his feet and staggers to the door. \nINT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT \nNed is a mess! Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. Shirt soaked in sweat. He turns the radio ON. LOLA'S THEME starts playing. \nA small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, turning slowly. The venetian blinds on his side windows are partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light. \nANGLE - HIS POV OF ROAD \nHe's following Lola's car. It signals and turns left. \nINT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT \nStill hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan. It spins faster. MUCH faster! The car becomes like a wind tunnel! \nEXT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a large two story house surrounded by lush greenery. \nNed climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side and sticking out crazily. \nANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV \nIt opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe. She casually shakes it off... going to the front door. \nINT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThey enter. It's DARK. Ned squints into the shadows. \nNED Well, here we are... in the dark. \nHe steps out, pauses... turns to her. \nNED Don't forget to lock up. \nNed pulls the door shut. The lock CLICKS. He pauses by his car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the door. \nHe tries the knob, but the door is locked. He looks through the small window. He sees Lola standing inside... breathing heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart. \nHe pushes against the door. It won't budge. He goes to the large window, gazing inside. She slides one hand enticingly across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose. \nHe points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it. She looks away. Frustrated, Ned tries the window. It's locked. \nHe picks up a wrought iron chair, SLAMS it into the window! The heavy chair falls apart. The glass doesn't even vibrate! \nHe sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of the house! THUNDER CRASHES and LIGHTNING FLASHES in the sky! \nHe PLOWS into the side of the house, SMASHING a huge hole thru the wall!... MOWING a swath in the carpet! \nLola GASPS. Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. She opens her arms, breathless. The MUSIC SWELLS dramatically! She intercepts him, embracing him passionately. \nLOLA I knew you'd come back... \nNED (looking past her) I forgot my car keys. \nHe struggles free, grabbing his car keys from the hall table. She follows, embracing him again, even more tenaciously. \nLOLA That's not what you came back for. \nNED Yes it is. \nImpatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. She's relentless... devouring him with her lips and tongue. \nOverwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. His car keys drop from his hand. She pushes him down toward the floor. \nLOW ANGLE - AT FLOOR LEVEL \nHer hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open. The buttons fly in all directions! She grabs at his leather belt, twisting it in her hands... ripping it in two! \nShe grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off! Then the other!... tossing them over each shoulder! \nNed and Lola tumble across the floor, arms and legs entangled... rolling themselves up in a rug in the process. \nANGLE - FIREPLACE \nA roaring fire. We HEAR O.C. MOANING and HEAVY BREATHING. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a sheepskin rug in front of the fireplace. No one is there! A crystal vase falls, CRASHING on the stone hearth. The CAMERA TILTS UP to REVEAL Ned and Lola... stretched out on the mantle, ravishing each other. \nANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR \nThe door suddenly BURSTS OPEN! Ned and Lola tumble out... wrapped in each other's arms, food tumbling out with them. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nANGLE - THE DINING ROOM TABLE \nThe table wiggles. The CAMERA MOVES UP to REVEAL Ned and Lola kissing passionately. She lays on the table, arms and legs stretched upward... a spinning plate balanced on the pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter balanced on the end of her pointed left toe. Her right foot brushes the platter to keep it spinning. The Ed Sullivan Show position. \nSEVERAL ANGLES - IN BED \n-- Ned and Lola's entangled legs, moving under the sheets. \n-- Ned sitting, wrists tied to the brass bed with silk scarves. \n-- Lola, also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk scarves. \n-- Then... A WIDER ANGLE... revealing that they are BOTH tied... at opposite ends of the same bed! \nANGLE - THE BASEMENT STAIRS \nWrapped in each other's arms, they tumble down the stairs... crashing into a workbench, still kissing passionately! \nANGLE - A WALL SOCKET \nNed's hand plugs in a cord. RACK FOCUS to a soft lamb's wool BUFFER WHEEL rising into frame, WHIRRING. It dips into an open can of FLOOR WAX... then moves over to Lola's naked body, buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss. The CAMERA MOVES to her EYES. They're CROSSED in ecstasy. \nANGLE - THE BEDROOM FLOOR \nHEAVY BREATHING. SQUEAKY BED NOISES. The CAMERA MOVES up along the mattress. The bed moves with a jerky rhythm. The CAMERA REVEALS Lola's hand, grasping the sheet tightly. WE MOVE UP to Lola, lying face down against the pillow. \nLOLA (breathless) ...don't... stop... \nFULL SHOT - THE BED \nNed jumps up and down on the bed like a trampoline! Lola is on her stomach, bouncing each time Ned's feet hit the bed. \nLOLA ...Oh Ned... please... don't... stop... \nHe does a complete BACK FLIP!... then keeps bouncing. \nEXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nThe wind blows. THUNDER and LIGHTNING! RAIN pours down. \nHis voice begins to ECHO and FADE as the CAMERA MOVES IN to a CU of Lola's enraged EYES! \nNED (voice echoing) ...you aren't very attractive... you aren't very attractive... you aren't very attractive... \nAnd then WE SEE... \nA CLOSE SHOT of her hand, grasping the ice pick... scratching it along the side of the tub, peeling back the porcelain. A GRATING SCREECH OVERLAPS to... \nINT. PET STORE - DAY \nTIGHT on a SCREECHING TROPICAL BIRD. We PULL BACK to reveal Ned looking around the store. His ripped pants have been temporarily repaired with big pieces of masking tape. A CLERK steps over with two big Parrots on her shoulders. \nCLERK Don't touch anything. You bond with it... you buy it. Whatdya want? \nNED I'd like to buy a pet. \nShe eyes him suspiciously. \nCLERK Yeah. For what purpose? \nNED It's a gift... for my wife. \nCLERK Right. They all say that. \nNED She spends a lot of time alone. I thought it might be nice if she had something to keep her company. \nCLERK Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know you're not the kind of guy who punches out parakeets? Or takes some poor defenseless animal, throws it in a sack and runs over it with your car five or six times. \nNED I would never hurt an animal. \nCLERK Boy, I would. They're driving me CRAZY! \nTurns and SHOUTS at the noisy birds. \nCLERK Shuddup! \nThey do. She turns back to Ned. \nCLERK Okay... tell me more about this broad you're married to. I like to match people with the pets they deserve. \nINT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nA typical police squad room... smoke-filled, cluttered, busy. Arch sits at a desk doing paperwork, surrounded by the Gang Members... who are also filling out papers. Arch SINGS to himself, munching on nachos from a big pile of chips. The Gang Members harmonize with him. \nA Gang Member reaches for a nacho chip. Arch grabs for the gun in his shoulder holster. \nARCH Uh-uh. \nThe Gang Member drops the chip. Arch pops it in his mouth, continues singing. The Gang Members join in with harmony. \nNed enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes in it. He steps over to his desk, looking at the singing Gang Members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them off neatly. \nNED (doubtful) You do all my paperwork? \nThey all hand over their completed paperwork. Ned stares at them for a beat... surprised. \nNED Get out of here. \nThey do. He opens the files... checks out the papers. Arch notices something O.S. and gets up. \nARCH And a damn good job, too. One of 'em even did it in Spanish. \nArch turns the sound up on a wall-mounted TV monitor. \nARCH Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours. \nOn the screen... it's Max Shady speaking to the press. \nMAX (O.S.) (on T.V.) ...I'd like to reach down Ned Ravine's throat and pull out his guts with my bare hands! \nARCH (shocked) Jesus... you hear that? \nNED He's just working through his anger, trying to find a constructive outlet. \nARCH Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The guy's a friggin' looney! \nNED Trust me, I spent a lot of time with him when I was preparing his case. He's really a very sweet, sensitive human being. \nMAX (on T.V.) I'd like to mash his head like a ripe melon... \nNED He gets a little melon-dramatic. \nMAX (on T.V.) ...then cut off all his fingers and rip out his liver with my teeth! \nNED (shrugs) See. Loves to exaggerate. \nArch slumps in his chair, really stunned. \nARCH Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit. \nNed laughs it off. He starts checking through the messages and paperwork on his desk. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up. \nNED Lieutenant Ravine. \nShe steps into the doorway of his office. \nLAURA Were you? \nNED What? \nLAURA There's lipstick on your collar. \nShe returns to her desk. Disturbed, Ned quickly pulls the shirt collar out, checks it. \nNED No there isn't. \nLAURA No... there isn't. But you answered my question. She's a real looker, huh? \nNED Who? \nLAURA Lola Cain. \nNED I hadn't noticed. \nShe opens the blinds behind her and looks at Ned through the window between their offices. \nLAURA Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't noticed. (returns to work) That's alright. She noticed enough for both of us. \nShe picks up a stack of papers from the FAX machine. Ned steps into the doorway, wearing a clean shirt. \nLAURA I worry about you, Ned. I worry a lot. (hands him papers) Max Shady's been faxing death threats to you all morning. \nNED (reading bits) ...stick a knife in your... (reacts, next) ...rip the eyeballs out of your... (next) ...drive razor-sharp spikes under your... \nLAURA Did you get to the one...? \nNED ...cut it off... shove it in a blender. \nLAURA Yeah... that one. \nNED (tosses them aside) He's just getting it out of his system. Once they say it... they never do it. You know... like the President. \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. They look up to see an ominous SILHOUETTE of a MAN on the milkglass. Ned starts toward the door. Laura grabs his arm, stopping him. \nLAURA (whispers) Wait. It might be him. \nShe opens her purse, pulls out a big COLT .45, holding it out to him. Ned stares at it, taken aback. \nNED Where did you get that? \nLAURA (as if obvious) From my purse. \nNED What are you doing with it? \nLAURA (still obvious) Handing it to you. \nNED Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun for? \nLAURA You shoot it. A bullet comes out. Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a cop, I'd think you'd know these things. \nNED Laura... put the gun away. \nHe hands the gun back to her... goes to the door... opens it. There's a young DELIVERY MAN holding a bouquet of flowers. \nDELIVERY MAN (checks card) Flowers for Ned Rav... (looks up) Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy? Man, you are dead meat! \nNed grabs the flowers, slams the door. Laura takes the envelope from the flowers... opens it. \nLAURA Is this another sick joke from Max Shady? \nShe looks at the card... her expression turning cold. \nNED What is it...? \nLAURA (hands it to him) Lola Cain. \nShe grabs the flowers... takes them into the bathroom. \nLAURA I'll put these in water for you. \nNed opens the envelope. An audio cassette drops into his hand. Written on the label: PLAY ME. \nFrom the bathroom, we hear the LOUD SOUND of a TOILET FLUSHING. \nINT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT \nIt's raining. Ned pops the cassette into the tape player. \nLOLA'S VOICE Ned, darling... I know this seems like a strange way to talk with you... but since you won't take my calls, I have no other choice. (then suddenly) Watch it! That red car's turning left! \nNed swerves to avoid a collision, HONKING his horn. \nLOLA'S VOICE I love you, Ned. We're meant to be together... forever. (then suddenly) The light's changing! Floor it! Go! Go! Go! \nNed guns it!... accelerating through a yellow light. \nLOLA'S VOICE Nice move! (then sincere again) Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not even your wife. I'd hate to have to tell her about us, but if necessary... I will. \nThe CROWD presses closer... not missing a thing. A WOMAN snaps a FLASH PICTURE! A MAN turns on his video camera. \nLOLA It doesn't matter. She'll know all about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE! \nMortified, Ned spins on his heels and makes a bee-line for the safety of the Men's Room. Lola holds up two tickets. \nLOLA I got us tickets to see Iron Butterfly! \nNED I hate opera! \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nNed bursts in, goes to the urinal... not noticing BEN ARUGULA, an older gentleman in a business suit, standing at the urinal next to him. A beat later... Lola enters. \nLOLA Why are you running from me? Didn't it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing my buns with carnuba wax? (looks down) Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey want to go exploring? \nNED He's busy right now. \nArugula glances sideways at Ned, curious and uneasy. \nNED Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a big mistake! One lousy mistake in his whole stinkin' life! So why don't you give him a BREAK! Besides... he belongs to my wife! \nEXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY \nLana FIRES her gun rapidly... BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!... over her shoulder, behind her back, under her leg. \nANGLE ON TARGET \nA full-body cut-out of a man, wearing one of Ned's trademark gray suits. A HUGE SMOKING HOLE has been blown right through the crotch! Lana smirks, inhales the SMOKE from the gun barrel... and blows it out. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nTILT DOWN from an official government seal that reads \"ARS GRATIA ARTIS.\" JUDGE Ben Arugula... the distinguished looking gentleman from the men's room, sits on the bench. Ned, Laura and a SLIMY DEFENDANT stand at the defense table. \nJUDGE ARUGULA I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey for setting yet another unusual legal precedent. This is the first time I've ever tried a case in which the JURY was found to be insane. \nANGLE - JURY AND BAILIFF \nThe BAILIFF is handing out straitjackets to all the JURORS. The Jury Foreman struggles to get his on and laced up. \nBAILIFF (to another Juror) What're you? A thirty-eight long? \nBACK TO JUDGE ARUGULA \nJUDGE ARUGULA The jury will be remanded to the Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi Valley. Court's adjourned. \nINT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY \nThe JURY is led from the courtroom in straitjackets and chains. Ned and Laura follow them out. \nNED Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you tell me? \nLAURA It's not important. I just had one last year. \nNED Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate! \nIn the b.g. the Slimy Defendant pulls a gun and forces CITIZENS... including Judge Arugula... up against the wall, robbing them! \nLAURA Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll have another one sometime. \nNED I insist. And I want to get you a nice present. \nLAURA You're so sweet. You don't have to. You gave me a present last year. Those lovely Ginzu knives. \nNED Yeah... aren't they great! They last forever. And you can cut right through a shoe with 'em! \nAs they walk off, we HOLD ON a CLOSE SHOT of a newspaper. The headline reads: EX-CON STALKS COP/LAWYER NED RAVINE! Below it is a picture of Max Shady, eyes wide with psychotic rage... a huge cigar in his mouth, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt. \nHands lower the newspaper... revealing Max himself, with the same cigar, shirt and crazed look on his face. \nINT. LE MISS FASHION BOUTIQUE - DAY - MONTAGE \nLaura models hats... each one becoming more outrageous. She coaxes Ned into joining her. They BOTH try on WOMEN's hats... smiling and laughing... as \"Brown Eyed Girl\" plays. \nIn one of the mirrors, we SEE Max Shady's reflection... as he also tries on women's hats, watching them, puffing his cigar. \nINT. LE HULA BOWL RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nLaura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each side with long, curved plastic straws. The cap emblem reads \"BEER BIMBO.\" A price tag hangs from it. She is beaming. \nIn the b.g., Hawaiian DANCERS juggle flaming torches as they dance around an ICE SCULPTURE of a Hula Dancer. \nNED It's nice to be off the streets... away from all the pain and misery out there. \nNed motions casually toward the world \"out there\"... sticking his thumb into the eye of a WAITER who is bending over to pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic CHAIN REACTION of small disasters that finally culminates with someone near the dance floor bumping into the Torch Juggler, throwing his rhythm off. \nDistracted, he starts catching the FLAMING ENDS of the torches! OW! OH! YI! OUCH! YIPES! \nHe drops them all. The Waiter who bumped into him, politely picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the Torch Juggler. He grabs the flaming end of the torch... and lets out a SCREAM! \nHe lunges toward a voluptuous HULA GIRL ICE SCULPTURE, grabbing the frozen breasts. His burned hands SIZZLE! \nNed and Laura don't even notice... gazing only at each other. \nLOLA (to Laura) Like some ice for your drink? \nShe drops the ice Mermaid head. It shatters Laura's glass to bits! Lola turns to Ned with a cold glare. \nLOLA Does your wife know you're... \"working\" late? I certainly hope so, Mr. Ravine. \nShe lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then flips it like a jackknife. It STICKS into Ned's chair, right between his legs. \nLola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at Laura... then exits. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING \nFrank opens the hood to Ned's car, holding a screwdriver in one hand... a wrench in the other. He doesn't know where to start. \nCLOSE ANGLE - MAX SHADY'S FEET - MORNING \nA NEWSBOY tosses a folded newspaper. It lands at Max Shady's feet. Max picks up the paper, opens it. The headline says: SHADY READS NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF RAVINE RESIDENCE! Max looks around self-consciously, eyes shifting uneasily. \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING \nLana stands by the front door. She calls upstairs to Ned. \nLANA Hurry up, darling. You'll be late! \nFrank slips in, wearing his greasy overalls. He wipes his hands on a rag... giving Lana a sly wink. \nFRANK (whispering) It's all taken care of. When do I knock on the door? \nLANA Wait until I signal you. When I raise the blinds... you knock. \nShe steps over to the blinds and demonstrates. He knocks. \nLANA Not now! \nFRANK Oh, later... right... okay. \nShe nods, patronizing. Frank exits. Lana picks up the Skunk, cuddling him. Ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit. Lana kisses him passionately... a final farewell. \nLANA Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye- bye to Little Ned. He loves his daddy... don't you Stink Pot? \nNED (pets the skunk) See you tonight, Junior. \nAs soon as Ned closes the door, Lana's smile vanishes and she casually tosses the Skunk aside with a LOUD CRASH O.C. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING \nNed turns the car key. Nothing. He gets out, opens the hood. He stares... dumbfounded. \nINT. THE HOUSE - MORNING \nNed comes in, visibly upset. Lana acts surprised. \nLANA What's wrong? \nNED This neighborhood is getting worse all the time! Damn kids stole my engine! \nLANA Why don't you catch the train to Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty minutes. \nNED I'll just fly up. \nLANA No! \nNed looks at her strangely. She catches herself. \nLANA I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists seized the airport this morning. A plane crashed into the tower... and all the runways are on fire! \nNED Yeah. So? \nLANA And it's fogged in. \nNED (disappointed) Dammit. \nLANA For my peace of mind... take the train. \nLana goes to the window, starts to raise the blinds. \nNED I can't do it. You know how I feel about riding trains. \nShe stops... letting the blinds drop down. \nLANA Darling... it's only a short trip. \nNED (reconsiders) Yeah... right. A short trip. \nShe starts to raise the blinds again. He picks up the phone. \nNED (he hesitates) A short trip to hell in a metal tomb! \nHe slams the receiver down. Lana drops the blinds again... \nLANA Just because both your parents died in a train wreck... \nNED And my brother, Jeff... \nWe now SEE that the seat of Max's pants has been ripped out, his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nNed stares out the window... apprehensive, nervous. \nFrank and Lana enter at the opposite end of the coach. They spot Ned, quickly ducking into a seat where they can observe him yet remain hidden from view behind the tall seatbacks. \nINT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY \nMax walks through the car looking for Ned. He pauses, puffing on his big cigar. A WOMAN PASSENGER looks up and is shocked to see Max's scraped bare butt hanging out only inches away. \nWOMAN PASSENGER OH! My dear gracious! \nMax swivels around to look at her... turning his bare behind toward an IRRITABLE MAN across the aisle. \nIRRITABLE MAN SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish that foul smelling cigar? \nMAX (turning slowly) You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU want me to put out my cigar? You want ME to put out my CIGAR? \nIRRITABLE MAN Yeah. \nMAX Certainly. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nMax enters through the vestibule, without his cigar, stopping in his tracks when he sees Ned. He smiles to himself, then ducks back into the lavatory. \nINT. LAVATORY - DAY \nMax looks at himself in the mirror. He's a disaster. He opens the violin case, pulling out his trademark \"Ned Ravine\" gray suit on a hangar. It's not even wrinkled. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nNed looks pale... sweating... reacting tensely to every lurch and bump the train makes. The feeble Old Woman strains to pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle, inch by inch, toward Ned. \nANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA \nLana peers over the seat, watching Ned with a cruel smile. \nLANA It's already getting to him. He'll be out of that seat and into the vestibule within ten minutes... I guarantee it. \nINT. LAVATORY - DAY \nMax is cleaned up, dressed in the suit. He straightens his tie, slicks his greasy hair back, sticks a big cigar in his mouth and grins at himself in the mirror. \nMAX You talkin' to me? You talkin' to ME? You... talkin'... to... ME? \nHe reaches into the violin case, pulls out a complex assortment of metal parts, assembling them swiftly. CLICK... SNAP... CLUNK! It's an incredibly nasty looking high-tech, automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip. \nHe screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the ceiling. POOF!... a muffled gunshot! Debris fall around him. He looks up. He has blown a HOLE through the roof of the coach. \nHe adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale from 1 thru 11. He turns it all the way down to \"0\"... DEAD SILENT. He pulls the trigger. The gun RECOILS, but there is absolutely NO SOUND! He has blown another HOLE in the ceiling. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nNed looks across the aisle to see a GROSS SLOB pulling all kinds of strange food items from a paper bag, making a big, sloppy, disgusting SANDWICH that squirts and drips all over. Ned turns away... really queasy now. \nINT. LAVATORY - DAY \nMax reaches into the case, pulls out A BLENDER! He plugs it into the outlet and REVS it a couple times, grinning wickedly. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nMax steps out of the lavatory and sees the CONDUCTOR coming his way collecting tickets. He quickly spins around, slides the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars. \nThe Conductor can't get past the Old Woman, so he climbs over the top of her trunk, with no thought of helping her. \nINT. VESTIBULE - DAY \nMax looks out the side window, trying to conceal the weapon in front of him. The Conductor enters, sees him. \nCONDUCTOR Ticket? \nWithout turning, Max holds the ticket up over his shoulder. The Conductor takes it, punches it, notices the gun barrel. \nCONDUCTOR Sorry pal... automatic weapons are only allowed in the club car after nine p.m. \nMax turns, raising the gun with a nasty GROWL. The Conductor casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel, taking the gun. \nCONDUCTOR I'll check it with baggage. You can claim it at the depot in Santa Barbara. \nThe Conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag... along with a dozen other guns he's collected. He exits. Max whirls around facing the window, eyes filled with rage. Now what? \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nA gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of Frank and Lana. Their eyes widen. Suddenly, a stream of water hits Frank in the face! He sputters. A LITTLE KID named JEFF scrambles into the aisle. \nJEFF Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years old. Didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash? No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck? My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really neat. Everybody gets creamed! All bloody guts... heads ripped off and stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song \"Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts\"? \nLana turns to Frank... inspired. She leans toward Jeff. \nLANA You want to earn a couple bucks, kid? \nINT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY \nThe Conductor is still tagging weapons as the Old Woman comes up with a Ruger Mini 14 machine gun, a Mauser C96 automatic handgun, a sawed-off double-barreled .12 gauge shotgun... and an old wooden slingshot. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nLana looks through the small window into the vestibule and catches a glimpse of a gray suit. She ducks back, leaning against the lavatory door. \nINT. LAVATORY - THE MIRROR - DAY \nNed's dripping face rises up from the sink into view. He splashes more water on, trying to overcome his queasiness. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nLana reaches into her purse, pulls out a gun. She looks through the vestibule windows into the first coach car, her eyes searching for Frank. \nINT. FIRST COACH CAR - LANA'S POV - DAY \nFrank pokes his head out into the aisle, looking toward Lana. He waves at her. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nLana ducks back, pressing herself against the lavatory door... gripping the gun, tense. \nINT. LAVATORY - DAY \nNed starts to open the door, then stops. He notices the violin case. Opens it. A couple of bullets roll around inside. Then, he sees the blender... puzzled. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nLana leans forward, looking through the vestibule windows, watching desperately for Frank's signal. \nINT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY \nFrank looks out the window and sees... \nEXT. THE RIVER - FRANK'S POV \nIt looms ahead. \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nLana sees Frank's frantic signal. She raises the gun, pulls the hammer back and steps quickly into... \nINT. THE VESTIBULE - DAY \nMax hears someone enter. He stiffens... \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nNed steps out of the lavatory. \nINT. VESTIBULE - DAY \nLana FIRES!... blowing a hole right through Max and the window behind him! She keeps firing! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! More bullets than the gun could ever possibly hold! \nINT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY \nNed hears the GUNSHOTS and whirls around, looking into the vestibule through the glass window, just as... \nINT. VESTIBLE - DAY \n...Max turns to face Lana, filled with bloody bullet holes. \nMAX You shootin' at me? \nShocked to see it's Max, Lana empties the rest of the bullets into him... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Max is SLAMMED back into the vestibule door by the impact! \nMAX Yeah... you're definitely shootin' at me. \nShe fires one last shot... BLAM!!! \nEXT. TRAIN ON BRIDGE - DAY \nMax flies out the door, executing a perfect \"full gainer with a triple twist and a half-tuck\"... a flawless Olympic style dive... ending with a dead body \"belly flop\" into the water! \nINT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY \nFrank sees Max hit the river and lets out a loud \"WHOOP!\" The Old Woman shoots him a nasty look. He stifles himself. \nINT. VESTIBULE - DAY \nNed slides the vestibule door open... steps toward Lana. In a daze, she raises the gun, points it at him, pulling the trigger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. He takes the gun from her gently. \nINT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY \nFrank jumps up, rushing forward. He skids to a stop... seeing Ned through the glass! Shocked, he ducks back. \nINT. VESTIBULE - DAY \nNED In this crazy world, there's not a whole lot a guy can count on. But when the chips are down, I can always count on you. \nHe takes her hand gently and kisses it... \nArch points toward the cage. \nARCH They're waiting for ya. They didn't want to start without her attorney being present. \nCLOSE ON LANA - CANTED ANGLE \nThere's a BIG MOTH on her mouth. The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY. A beat... she spits the moth off, irritated. \nLANA PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could use a good exterminator. \nThree POLICE INVESTIGATORS sit opposite Lana at a long table. Moths flutter everywhere. \nINVESTIGATOR # 2 (to Police Guard) Let's get the SWAT Team in here. \nNed, Laura and Arch enter the cage as the Guard exits. \nLANA Can't you get me out of this cage, Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here. \nNED Judge said no bail. Don't worry. Just tell the truth, you'll be fine. \nHe turns to the Investigators. \nNED Who's gonna handle the interrogation? \nINVESTIGATOR 1 It's your collar... your bust... your call... your show... your play... your move... your wife... \nNED Okay, okay!... I'll handle it. \nLaura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook. Lana pulls out her mirrored compact, starts to apply lipstick. \nINVESTIGATOR 2 Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup allowed in this building. \nHe nods toward a warning sign: a circle around a LIPSTICK with a diagonal line thru it. She responds, cool, confident. \nLANA What're you gonna do... arrest me for primping? \nIn the b.g., members of the SWAT Team desperately swat at the fluttering moths. \nNed spins his chair around, plants one foot on it, leans on his knee, looking hard at Lana. \nNED Don't give us a tough time. Just spill it! What were you doing on that train? \nLANA Well... \nNed raises his hand, sits down, leans close, changing his tone. \nNED (confidential) As your attorney, I must advise you... you don't have to answer that question. \nNed stands, paces, agitated... plants his foot on the chair again. He leans toward her... getting tough again. \nNED Alright, quit playing games with us! (fires questions) Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get the gun? What's your link with the CIA? \nLANA I... \nNed jumps in, motioning with his hands for this to stop. \nNED Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I will not tolerate this unwarranted badgering of my client. She'll have her day in court, gentlemen. \nHe slams his briefcase shut and turns to Lana, sincere. \nNED I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine, for being so cooperative with these gentlemen. (turns to Laura) Did you get all that down, Laura. Every word she said? \nLAURA Yep. Both of 'em. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nThe CAMERA MOVES IN to a wire mesh cage at the very back of the yard. A small sign on it says: NED JUNIOR. The door is open. The cage is... empty! \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY \nLola rides the roller coaster with Lana's pet Skunk. She LAUGHS maniacally as they plunge down a steep grade! \nThe Skunk stands stiffly on her lap, his paws planted on the guard rail, eyes bulging out!... his fur standing straight up! \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY \nNed hesitates at the front door. It's open a crack. He moves inside cautiously. There is a strange BUBBLING SOUND coming from the kitchen. He moves toward it... apprehensive. \nHe enters the kitchen and SEES... a huge bubbling pot on the stove, foam spilling over from under the lid! His mind reels! He charges out the back door. \nEXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY \nNed bursts out the back door... CAMERA TRACKING with his feet as he dashes across the huge back yard... MUSIC POUNDING! \nHe SEES the EMPTY animal cage! The door is open. A fuzzy blanket hangs halfway out. \nShocked, Ned spins around... running back toward the house... CAMERA TRACKING HIS FEET, struggling to keep up. The CAMERA SLAMS into a tree!... CRACKING the LENS! \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY \nNed bursts in... SEES the bubbling pot!... a huge butcher knife on the counter!... and LOLA, arms outstretched to greet him. \nNED NO! \nJUDGE SKANKY Sustained. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nLaura is on the stand. Ned hands her a sheet of paper. \nNED And can you tell us what this is? \nLAURA Yes. It's a death threat that Max Shady FAXED to you on the day he was released from prison. \nNed snatches it back, pacing, folding it into a paper airplane. \nNED A FAX in which he threatened to puree certain parts of my anatomy in a blender! I'd like to submit this into evidence. \nPROSECUTOR (jumps up) Objection! Who cares about the FAX in this case? \nJUDGE SKANKY I'll allow it. \nNed sails the paper plane toward the COURT CLERK, who is at an evidence table already piled high with tagged guns, appliances, knickknacks, auto parts and other junk. \nThe plane sails toward an open window. The Clerk grabs it... going OUT the window with the plane! \nEXT. COURTHOUSE LAWN - DAY \nThe Cheerleaders lead the SPECTATORS in an exuberant CHEER. \nCHEERLEADERS U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi! You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A- M-A! How you think you got that way? Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama! \nIn the b.g., the Court Clerk plummets to the ground, then staggers to his feet, and stumbles... dazed... back toward the courthouse. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nOne of the JURORS watches a \"DICK VAN DYKE\" re-run on a small portable TV monitors, oblivious to the testimony. In the b.g., the battered Clerk stumbles back in with the paper plane. The Conductor is on the stand. Ned holds up a BLENDER. \nNED And is this the blender you found in the lavatory of the train? \nCONDUCTOR Yes... it is. \nNED I'd like this marked as evidence. \nThe Bailiff reaches out, Ned waves him off... instead, tossing the blender over several heads to the Court Clerk... who runs to catch it, CRASHING into the wall. The blender falls, SHATTERS. \nANGLE - BROADCAST BOOTH \nSPORTSCASTER Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's check out the re-play. \nOn the RE-PLAY SCREEN we see the action repeated in SLOW MOTION as the Sportscaster draws lines, circles, x's and squiggles. \nSPORTSCASTER Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide open! But instead of handing it off, Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh! The pass is wide! A real wobbler! There's no way! He scrambles, but he just can't get his hands on it... And RIGHT THERE!... (freezes the frame) ...WHAM! That blender is gone! \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nAt the defense table, Laura glances over at Lana, who is casually browsing through a copy of GALS & GUNS magazine. Laura reacts, then, trying to be as diplomatic as possible... \nLAURA Ned... did you ever consider that maybe you don't know women as well as you think you do? \nPROSECUTOR (O.S.) Now would you tell the court, in your own words, what you said to Mr. Ravine? \nThey both look toward the witness stand. Ned is shaken. \nNED (whispers) I'm really worried about this guy. He could blow our whole case right out of the water. \nANGLE - WITNESS STAND - MOMENTS LATER \nJeff, the little boy from the train is on the witness stand. The Prosecutor stands by, listening as... \nJEFF (singing) Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... mutilated monkey meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet... Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... and me without a spoon! \nThe JURORS turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in front of them. The Courtroom erupts. The Judge pounds his gavel LOUDLY. \nJEFF (pointing at Lana) That lady paid me two bucks to sing it to him...! \nBut NO ONE hears this in all the confusion. The Judge, also looking ill now, bangs his gavel again. \nJUDGE SKANKY Recess! Ten minutes! \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY \nThe Judge, Jury, Attorneys and Spectators are all playing on the swings, teeter-totters, monkey bars... having a blast! Ned and the Prosecutor play \"dodge-ball.\" Laura cheers Ned on. The Prosecutor rockets the ball at Ned... and just misses! \nPROSECUTOR Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha! \nLAURA No you didn't! \nNED No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile! \nThe BAILIFF steps into CLOSE UP, blowing a whistle loudly! \nBAILIFF Recess is over! Let's go... move it, move it, move it! \nINT. BROADCAST BOOTH - LATER \nMarching band MUSIC fades off-screen. \nLana is on the stand. The Bailiff swears her in. \nBAILIFF Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? \nLANA (looks to Judge) Do I have to answer that, Harlan? \nJUDGE SKANKY No, no dear. I'll vouch for her. \nNed approaches. \nNED Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you Lana? \nLANA No. Call me Angel Tits. \nPROSECUTOR I object! \nJUDGE SKANKY Sustained. Counselor... you will address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine. \nNED (after a beat) Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell the court... what were you doing on that train? \nLANA I saw Max Shady at the station... saw him get on board. I knew he'd made threats to kill you and mutilate your reproductive organs... \nNed and EVERY MALE in the courtroom winces at this, doubling over in imagined agony. Lana pauses, then continues... \nLANA ...so I got on the train too... so I could warn you. \nNED Do you want to have children? \nLANA Someday. With the right man. \nNED But you couldn't have children if my... (makes a gesture) ...were... (another gesture) ...and, uh... \nLANA It would be difficult. \nNED So you followed him, knowing you had to protect me... your husband... your best friend... the man you love... the future father of your children. \nLANA Something like that. \nNED And when you saw that maniac standing in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and fired and fired and FIRED! \nLANA And fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired... \nShe pauses to count off on her fingers, then... \nLANA ...and fired and fired and fired. \nNED The defense rests, your Honor. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nThe COURTROOM ARTIST has been sketching intensely throughout the trial. We finally see... he's been sketching a BOWL OF FRUIT on the Court Recorder's desk. Ned picks up some fruit from the bowl and approaches the defense table. \nNED How can you convict a courageous woman who risked everything to save the life of her beloved husband? A woman who acted boldly to stop a demented maniac from doing THIS!... \nNed shoves the BANANA and two PLUMS into a demonstration blender on the defense table. He hits the puree button and the blender WHIRRS loudly! \nNED (shouts over) ...pulverizing the private parts of the man she loves! \nAll MALES in the courtroom react with pained expressions, cringing and doubling-over. Ned turns the blender off. \nNED (directly to Jury) Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the potential mother of my potential child. I challenge YOU to strike a blow for motherhood and the American justice system! Put the \"con\" back in the Constitution. Put the \"ju\" back in jurisprudence. Put the \"can\" back in American. And put the \"dom\" back in freedom. Find this woman INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed happy tonight! \nINT. PRESS ROOM - LATER \nA REPORTER opens the door marked PRESS ROOM. Inside, a DOZEN REPORTERS press their pants on a dozen ironing boards. \nREPORTER The jury's back! \nThe Reporters scramble for the door, pulling their pants on! \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS a folded piece of paper as the Jurors pass it along to the FOREMAN... who hands it to the Bailiff... who hands it to the Judge. He unfolds it, reads it... then winks flirtatiously at the FEMALE JUROR who wrote it. She blushes. \nJUDGE SKANKY (back to business) So... has the jury reached a verdict? \nJURY FOREMAN (stands up) Yes we have, your Honor. \nJUDGE SKANKY How do you find the defendant... on the count of manslaughter? \nJURY FOREMAN Not guilty. \nJUDGE SKANKY On the count of murder in the first degree? \nJURY FOREMAN Not guilty. \nJUDGE SKANKY On the Count of Monte Cristo? \nJURY FOREMAN Not guilty. \nA BOISTEROUS CLAMOR in the court. The electronic signs FLASH \"NOT GUILTY!\"... \"NOT GUILTY!\"... \"NOT GUILTY!\" \nJUDGE SKANKY Good. Then on the count of three, let's all get the hell out of here! One... two... \nOne of the Coroner's INVESTIGATORS approaches Arch and Ned. \nINVESTIGATOR Looks like a suicide. We found a note. \nHe holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers. Ned takes it, trying to unroll it. \nINVESTIGATOR It was stuck up his nose. \nNed hands it off to Arch, who casually unrolls it. The Investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame. \nARCH (reading it) \"I can't take it anymore. I'm a mediocre mechanic... and a lousy lover.\" \nNED He's sure got that right. \nArch gives Ned a very strange look. Ned feels his stare. \nNED The \"mechanic\" part, I mean. \nIn the b.g., various COPS pair up to have their pictures taken by the Police Crime Scene Photographer... posing, grinning. \nNED (stares at the body) I don't know why, Arch, but I just can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't suicide. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES \nbehind Ned on his line, revealing Frank... pinned to the wall by the power screwdriver stuck in his back! It's still running... vibrating with a GRINDING HUM. \nNed reaches out and turns the screwdriver OFF. \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY \nNed enters, pausing. He hears VOICES. He goes to the living room. Lana and Lola turn to see him in the doorway. He is shocked. Lana looks shaken. But Lola is cool... in control. \nLANA Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um... \nNED (nervous, defensive) Um? She told you her name was Um? And what other lies did she tell you? I've never seen this woman in my life! Never followed her home! Never had sex with her in the refrigerator! It's all a sick fantasy... and I deny everything! \nHe turns to Lola. \nNED When will women like you learn, you can't tear apart a perfectly good marriage with your vicious lies... Miss UMMMM! \nLOLA Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith. I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine. The big powerful kind that suck up everything in sight. I was just telling your wife, if she wants to get rid of all her dirt, she has to be willing to pay the price. \nShe turns to Lana with a cold and contemptuous glare. \nLOLA Let me know what you decide, Mrs. Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a convenient \"payment\" plan. A pleasure meeting you... Ned. \nLola exits. As soon as the door closes, Lana whirls around in a fury!... SMASHING a lamp! She SHRIEKS furiously! \nLANA I... hate... SALESMEN! \nHe puts his arms around her, comforting. \nNED I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything. Tell you what... let's take a trip. \nLANA A trip? \nNED Yeah. Just the two of us. \nLANA (darkly inspired) I like that. Just you and me... all alone. I'll start packing. \nNED Great. Listen... I got something to take care of. I'll be back in awhile. \nHe kisses her and exits. Lana turns to look up toward the landing, a vengefully insane smile clouding her face. \nINT. LOLA'S HOUSE - DUSK \nA demanding KNOCK at the door. Lola hesitates at the door. \nLOLA Who is it? \nThe door CRASHES OPEN! Ned is silhouetted in the doorway. He looks really pissed! Lola turns and runs. Ned sprints after her, leaping through the air... bringing her down with a tackle! \nNED I just want to talk. \nLOLA Why didn't you say so? \nHer foot shoots out, smashing him right in the face... WHAM! She jumps up and scrambles away. Ned pursues her. She grabs a bottle of scotch from the counter, spins around. \nLOLA Would you like a drink? \nShe throws the bottle! He ducks and it shatters on the wall! \nNED No thanks. I'm driving. \nShe whirls on one foot, nailing him in the head with a FLYING SPIN KICK! He stumbles back, dazed. She grabs an ice pick. \nLOLA Then let's get to the point! \nLola charges! Ned rolls onto his back, jamming both feet into her stomach, heaving her up over him... thru the air! She SLAMS into the wall!... then slowly turns... still cool and collected. She raises a cigarette... lights it with the ice pick \"lighter.\" \nLOLA So what's your problem, tough guy? \nNED Stay away from my life, my wife, my home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on a vacation and when I come back, I don't ever want to see your face again! \nNed rubs his temples, shuts his eyes. \nNED (V.O.) It was all starting to give me a headache bigger than the national deficit. \nINT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" plays on the stereo. Lola sits on the floor by an end table, eyes dazed, staring blankly. A lamp with a \"clapper\" switch sits on the table. \nAs the CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY to her, she absently \"claps\" the light off... then on... then off... then on... then off... \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON female hands using a keyhole saw to cut through a railing on the second floor landing above the foyer. \nOutside... the SOUND of a car... headlights! The sawing stops. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nNed pulls up. The house is dark and ominous. So is the MUSIC. \nINT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe front door is open a crack. He cautiously pushes it and the door CR-E-A-K-S open very slowly. The door STOPS, but the LOUD CREAKING continues. Ned touches it lightly with the tip of his finger. The CREAKING STOPS. \nNED Lana? \nNed moves up the stairs. The CAMERA BOOMS UP with him, HOLDING ON an ECU of the partially severed railing. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNed enters. Hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot bathtub. He turns the water off, looking around, puzzled. \nLoosens his tie, rubs his head. A splitting headache. Opens the medicine cabinet and... SCREECH! YEOW! CRASH! A CAT leaps out!... darts away. There's a NOISE from downstairs. \nINT. THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nSomeone is POUNDING on the door. Ned enters and opens it. It's Laura. \nLAURA Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so much to tell you. \nNED Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab a chair. \nLAURA Thanks... I brought my own. \nShe drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table. Ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on. He starts searching through the cupboard for teabags. \nNED So... what have you got? \nLAURA A lottery ticket and a laundry receipt. (lays them on table) I found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client. \nNed freezes, staring out the window, unable to face her. \nLAURA You remember that night, don't ya Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L- O... L-A. Lola. \nNed turns to her when he hears Lola's name... looking baffled by this convoluted piece of logic. \nLAURA (shrugs it off) Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's mind works. \nHe turns back to the cupboard, picking up a container. \nNED How about Ovaltine? \nLAURA Fine. Then I remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife's car for two months. You with me so far? \nNED I'm way ahead of you. \nHe brings the Ovaltine container to the table. \nLAURA Well back it up. You probably took a wrong turn. Remember your insurance policy... the one we couldn't find? I started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me? The answer came up... Lana. And since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here. \nA huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them. Laura SMASHES it with her fist, breaking it open! Cookies spill out... and the insurance policy. \nNED So that's where she hid the Oreos. \nHe sits down... starts eating Oreos... twisting them apart. \nLAURA Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot Max Shady. She and Frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy. But she shot the wrong guy. \nNED That's the craziest thing I ever heard. \nLAURA (she presses on) Don't you see... Frank was going to let her take the fall. So she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide. (beat) That's when I realized there was a connection between Lola and Lana... \nNED Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters. \nLAURA Well, hang on to your jock strap, Ned. There's more. \nShe unrolls a complex genealogical chart... walks him thru it. \nLAURA Not only is Frank's father Dwayne Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher and Lola Cain's former lover... Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max and Frank are half-brothers who never met. \nLaura pauses dramatically, then announces. \nLAURA Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered both of Helen Shady's sons. \nLaura backs away from her Husband. He holds her wedding ring. \nLAURA'S HUSBAND You forgot to flush, darling. \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME \nAs Ned and Lola continue their violent struggle... Lola grabs toiletries to aid in her attack. She squirts Ned with SHAVING CREAM... squeezes TOOTHPASTE in his hair... and throws BATH POWDER in his face! \nNed is blinded. Gaining the advantage, Lola shoves him back, slamming his head into the wall. He's dazed, helpless. \nLola raises the ice pick, moving forward to strike! But Ned grabs a HAIR BLOWER and swings it around, pointing it at her like a gun! She freezes... then smiles contemptuously. \nLOLA What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me away? \nShe LAUGHS arrogantly. Ned clicks on the hair blower to HIGH, a blast of HOT AIR hitting Lola's face, puffing her cheeks out, pushing her back, hair flying wildly! \nHer backside hits the railing where Lana has cut it... the wood splintering! \nLola tumbles over backward, SCREAMING! She hangs suspended in mid-air for a moment, like a cartoon character, arms flailing. Then... WHOOM!... she FALLS to the marble floor below, hitting with a LOUD THUD! \nINT. THE KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura's Husband hears Lola fall, turning. Laura grabs the iron skillet and CLOBBERS him with it! BONG! He goes down. \nLAURA I never forget anything... honey. \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME \nNed stares at the hair blower in his hand. Filled with disgust and revulsion, he throws the \"weapon\" down. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nLaura pulls TWO REVOLVERS from her purse... spinning them like John Wayne... expertly tossing one over her back, catching it in front! She heads for the foyer. \nINT. FOYER - A MOMENT LATER - ON LOLA'S BODY \nLaura pauses, looks down at Lola's body... notices something. She pushes Lola's skirt a bit higher with the toe of her shoe. \nLAURA (outraged) Those are MY panties! \nShe looks up... sees a light emanating from the bathroom. \nON THE LANDING \nLaura moves through the shadows... stops outside the bathroom, pressing her back against the wall, guns up and ready. \nShe swivels into the doorway... taking a shooter's stance... guns pointed! She sees... LANA... submerged in the tub, face up, the rubber duckie in her mouth. \nLaura steps back and turns... right into a THING covered in white! Startled, she SHRIEKS! Ned drops the white towel he's using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste. Relieved to see it's Ned, she throws her arms around him! \nLAURA Oh Ned! \nNED You were right... there's a million things I don't know about women. Maybe you can teach me a few hundred. \nHe pulls out his police badge, looks at it. \nNED Hell... I had too many careers anyway. \nHe tosses it away, over the railing. \nINT. FOYER - ECU LOLA - SAME TIME \nThe badge drops from above, landing on the floor right in front of Lola's lifeless face. A beat. Her eyes pop open! \nINT. BATHROOM - ECU ON BATH WATER - SAME TIME \nSuddenly, the rubber duckie pops to the surface. \nON THE LANDING \nLaura hugs Ned again, arms locked around his neck, still gripping a gun in each hand. \nLAURA Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved you! \nINT. FOYER \nLola sits bolt upright, bloody but still bouncy. \nINT. BATHROOM \nLana suddenly SITS UP in the tub, inhaling a huge GASP of air, her eyes wild! \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLaura's Husband's eyes POP OPEN! He SITS UP suddenly... smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table! He topples back slowly... really dead! Finally. \nINT. THE STAIRCASE \nLola's feet move steadily up each stair... her bloody hand grasping the ice pick. \nINT. BATHROOM FLOOR - LOW ANGLE \nLana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around. She picks up the pointed saw from the floor. \n", "test1_input": "INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT \n...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, and speeds away! \nA beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars. \nNED Police emergency! I need your car! \nHe pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper cars in the pavilion. \nNed's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS! \nNed SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out and SMASHES into the pavillion railing! \nNed swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG inflates in his bumper car. \nArch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says: DEAD END ALLEY. \nNed and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow after Milo. \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nIN THE ALLEY \nMilo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard. \nMilo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink. \nA SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and flips Milo's knife away. \nMilo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back. \nNED You take science in high school, Milo? \nMILO I skipped high school, cop! \nNED Then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics. \nMILO What about it? \nNED If you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty-three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity? \nMILO Yeah. So? \nNED The gun will blow up in your hand... and it won't even scorch my pinkie. \nMILO Ha! That's just theoretical hypothesis. Inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment. \nNED Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart guy. Let's find out. \nMilo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off with a loud POP! \nNed cuffs Milo's hands behind him... spins him around. \nNED You have the right to remain silent... next... if you waive that right, anything you say... next... \nREVEAL ARCH \nholding up a series of \"cue cards\"... as Ned reads from them. \nNED ...may be used against you in a court of law... next... You have the right to an attorney... Do you have an attorney? \nMILO Nahhhh! \nNED Then today's your lucky day... \nHe flips out a business card, handing it to Milo. \nANGLE - THE BUSINESS CARD \nIt reads... \"Ned Ravine - Defense Attorney\" \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - DAWN \nLarge. Expensive. Impressive. The name on the mailbox reads \"Ned and Lana Ravine.\" \nWe begin to HEAR the O.S. SOUND of passionate lovemaking! \nOMIT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOUSE - DAWN \nThe CAMERA MOVES up the stairs, into the bedroom. Still O.S., we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... passion... squeaky bedsprings! \nA trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy coveralls with a \"Frank Kelbo - Mobile Mechanic\" namepatch, dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun... \nThe bed shakes violently. A female VOICE calls the shots as various tools drop to the floor. \n", "test1_true": "A beat. The LIGHT clicks ON. LANA; a sexy redhead with a cool, manipulative edge, and FRANK; a slick, smarmy Lothario, lay under the sheets, panting, glistening with sweat. \nLana reaches for a pack of \"Fatal 100's\" on the bedside table. \nLANA Not bad for an auto mechanic... \nFRANK (grins, cocky) Yeah, well you're not so bad yourself... for a lawyer's wife... \nLANA Better watch your tongue, sweetie, or I'll have my husband arrest you. \nFRANK Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When does he ever find time for you? \nShe lights a cigarette... exhales a soft, gloomy cloud. \nLANA He doesn't. That's why I need you to keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod? \nFRANK Maybe you should trade him in on a new model. \nLANA I would... if I could make any money on the deal. \nFRANK (reaches for her) Want to go for another test drive? \nThe SOUND of an automobile engine outside. Lana stops him. \nLANA Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm still under warranty. \nEXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING \nNed glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then takes note of his wife's silver Mercedes... sitting on floor jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it. \nINT. HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - MORNING \nNed enters. Lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned unevenly, hair disheveled. She smokes a cigarette. \nNED Morning sweetheart. \nNed kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through the kitchen on his way to the dining room. She reacts with bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot. \nLANA Uh huh. Want some coffee? \nNed steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase. \nNED No thanks. \nNed sees Frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, coveralls hastily pulled on inside-out. Frank is reading a copy of INSURANCE DIGEST magazine. A headline on the cover touts an article: \"LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOUR CAT!... Cover All Nine Lives For The Price of One!\" Ned's smile fades. \nLANA Frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car. \nHe steps over to the table... gives Frank a cool stare. \nNED How long you been working on Lana's Mercedes, Frank? \nFRANK (shrugs) Oh... I don't know... six, seven weeks. \nNED And ya still haven't found the problem? \nFRANK (a leering smile) Think I got my finger on it though. \nNed turns to Lana. \nNED I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't born yesterday. He's not fixing your car. He's SCREWING you! \nLana tenses up at this. Frank freezes. He figures they've been busted. He sits there, holding the magazine, not moving a muscle... as Ned turns on him. \nNED YOU are screwing my wife! I can see what your game is, Frank. You open up her hood, poke around in there... squirt some lubrication in... play around with all her parts... then take an old used piston and stick it in... then pull it out... in, out, in, out! Every day! There's no end to it. You just keep coming and COMING!... and the bill just gets bigger and BIGGER! \nLana braces herself against the sink, breathless... turned on by Ned's description. Ned goes to her, sympathetic. \nNED But you don't see it, do you, Lana? You're too good... too pure. You can't see the evil in people like him. (turns to Frank) Well, you're not getting away with it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're fired! \nLANA (breathless) Ned... don't you have to be somewhere? \nNED (checks his watch) Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late for court. \nHe goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him. He looks at her lovingly... touches her face tenderly. \nNED You are so naive. \nHe picks up his briefcase, gives Frank a nasty look, then exits thru the back door. \nLana and Frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot now! Frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm. Lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. He lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her. \nSuddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank... not even noticing Lana on the table. \nNED Finish your coffee... then GET OUT! \nHe slams the door. A beat. Lana and Frank begin to devour each other with passionate kisses. Another beat. The front doorbell RINGS once... then again. \nFRANK Who's that? \nLANA Just the postman. He always rings twice. \n", "test1_id": 1023, "test2_input": "He lays them on the corner of the stand... then slips into the chair. He picks the cards up and flips thru them. On the back we can see scribbled... \"NED'S IDIOT CARDS\" \nNED Yeah. These are them. \nNed jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the cards. \nNED Reading from the cards now... quote \"You have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say... may be used against you in a court of law.\" Is that right? \nNED (back in the chair) That's right. \nNED (stands up, announces) WRONG! The official Miranda warning is... \"anything you say CAN be used against you in a court of law.\" Not \"may\"... \"CAN!\" (on the attack) Don't you know the difference between \"can\" and \"may\", Detective? Every school kid knows \"can\" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while \"may\" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act. \nNed pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he hits the chair. \nNED I didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns! I was trying to protect society from a deranged MADMAN! (leaps up, pointing) But this ivy league fop...!!! \nThe courtroom ERUPTS! The Judge bangs the gavel. Ned strides proudly toward the defense table. \nNED I have no more use for this witness. \nJUDGE ALLEN Mr. Ravine... \nNed turns. The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach the bench. Ned does, resting his hand on it. \nJUDGE ALLEN I'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar. \nThe Judge smacks Ned's hand with a ruler! \nNED Ow! \nPROSECUTOR (jumps up) But your Honor...! \nJUDGE ALLEN I know, I know. It's a technicality. But it's the kind of technicality that makes the American legal system what it is today! Court's adjourned! \nThe Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it on the bench like a gavel. BAM! BAM! BAM! It is DEAFENING! Everyone covers their ears in pain. \nThe THX Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the screen... along with \"The Courtroom Is Listening\" \nINT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nNed turns the key... enters through the private door. He HEARS the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's Theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the outer office. \nANGLE - NED'S POV THRU OPENING \nA gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high-heeled shoes. \nThere are several CANDY WRAPPERS, CIGARETTE BUTTS and other pieces of TRASH stuck to the bottom of one shoe. \nNED \npushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips up slowly, revealing her eyes. \nLOLA I waited. You never came back. \nNed reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel. \nNED I got busy. Here's that paper towel I promised. \nLOLA Thanks... \nNED How'd you get in? The door was locked. \nLola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. She smiles. \nLOLA It's miraculous what a real woman can do... with a bobbie pin. \nNed looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She pulls out a pack of cigarettes... BLACK LUNG LITES. \nLOLA (offering) Cigarette? \nNED No... thanks. They're bad for ya. \nHe goes to the water cooler. She lights up, exhaling a soft cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring. \nLOLA Yes, I know. I like things that are bad for me. (touching lawbooks) So... I hear you go both ways. \nNed hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup. \nNED Only once. It was a fraternity prank. I never saw him again. \nHe gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand. \nLOLA No, I mean... you're a cop and a lawyer. \nNED Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets... but they all deserve a fair and costly trial. \nNed turns, tries to casually \"dunk\" the crumpled cup in the waste basket. He misses. \nLaura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. She sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to pick it up. \nLAURA I'll get that. \nShe picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket. \n", "test2_true": "LOLA Lola Cain. \nLaura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps toward Lola, extending her hand. Lola takes her time removing the long white glove... finally reaching out and shaking Laura's hand with a condescending air. \nLOLA (sarcastic) So lovely to meet you, Laura. \nNed grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing each lawbook in its proper slot. \nThe \"handshake\" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then aggressive, eventually becoming a \"standing Indian wrestle\" as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force. Ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away. \nNED Gotta keep these darn books in their right place or we'll never find the ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M... R thru B... W thru F... \nLaura suddenly whirls Lola around, putting her in an arm lock. But Lola elbows Laura in the stomach! Laura doubles over. Lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand... then spins, twisting Laura's arm, flipping her head over heels! \nLaura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. Lola strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. She takes a drag. Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the couch, landing on her feet.

You don't need to wait. I'll see you tomorrow. \nLola looks at Laura... icy, haughty, triumphant. Laura moves reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame chewed to pieces... whirls around, heads back toward Ned. \nLAURA I should call someone to fix this... \nNED Tomorrow... \nShe instantly spins around, heads back toward the door... \nLAURA I'll call from home. \n...and exits. Ned sits down on the corner of the desk. Lola sits in the chair across from him. \nLOLA I think I should warn you, Mr. Ravine... I'm not wearing any underwear. \nShe crosses her legs suggestively... then slowly, enticingly, re-crosses them in the other direction. \nUnimpressed, Ned opens Laura's desk drawer... pulls a pair of sexy lace panties from a Kleenex-style dispenser box labeled \"PANDORA'S POP-UP PANTIES\"... which pulls another pair up into position. He tosses the panties to Lola. \nNED Try these on. \nShe does... very, very slowly and seductively... as they talk. \nNED So... what can I do for you? \nLOLA I've run across some... papers... and I thought you might be able to tell me what they are. You see, I'm not very experienced when it comes to... papers. \nNED I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able. Do you have the... papers... here? \nLOLA No... they're at home. I thought you might stop by... \nNED I'm on duty tonight. \nLOLA Don't they ever give you a night off? \nNED Yeah. Tomorrow. \nLOLA (picks up cigarette) Why don't we meet tomorrow evening then? \nShe finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile... \"snapping\" the elastic waistband. She goes to the door, pauses... turns to him. \nLOLA I'll let you know where. \nNED (steps over to her) What's wrong with my office? \nShe looks around, exhaling another cloud of smoke. \nLOLA Nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix. \nShe opens the door. Behind her, in the hall, we see Dizzy, the saxophone player, wailing away on \"Lola's Theme.\" \nCLOSE ON LOLA \nShe takes a final, long drag on her cigarette, then reaches O.S. with it... toward Ned. \nLOLA Take care of this for me, will ya? \nWith a sultry smile, she turns and leaves, closing the door. \nANGLE ON NED \nThe cigarette is stuck in his nose. \nINT.

She kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap with a gaudy floral design on his head. \nLANA Yeah, well you came to the right place. \nShe walks to the living room. Frank follows, still wearing the shower cap. Lana snaps her fingers. \nLANA Sit down. \nHe sits in a chair, looking around. \nFRANK Where is he? \nLANA On duty all night. By the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow. \nShe sits on the couch, picks up a stack of papers. \nLANA I was just reading over... \nShe looks up at Frank. Sees the shower cap. \nLANA Take off the hat, Frank. \nHe slips the shower cap off as Lana continues. \nLANA I was just reading over my husband's insurance policies. You wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, Frankie? \nFRANK Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies part-time. I got half a brain... or didn't you notice? \nLANA I musta had my eye on something else. (hands him papers) How about a translation. \nHe flips through, scanning the pages, shrugging. \nFRANK Standard accident policy... all the usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three million bucks! (flips page) And there's a triple indemnity rider. \nLANA Meaning? \nFRANK Aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. If the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the policy. \nLANA Nine million dollars...? \nFRANK Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the company. Nobody ever collects. \nLANA Why not? \nFRANK Well, like here... it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream. \nLANA All three? \nFRANK See what I mean, sweetheart? What are the odds of that? \nLANA It could happen. (dramatic beat) Suppose it did happen? \nFRANK Then you'd be rich. \nLANA Then we'd be rich. \nFRANK What're you sayin'...? \nShe drops to her knees in front of him, her face close to his, speaking with a persuasive urgency. \nLANA We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch! And I know exactly how! He has a legal symposium in Santa Barbara this weekend... All we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving. \nFRANK How we gonna do that? Didn't you tell me he hates trains? \nLANA That's where you come in, baby. You're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. That should be no problem for you. \nShe gets up, walks to the adjoining room... snapping her fingers at her side. He follows. \nShe steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale- model of Dealey Plaza and a train station, complete with HO- Scale model trains chugging around the tracks. \nShe uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot. \nLANA Then... we give him a lift to the train station... through Dealey Plaza, past the Book Suppository and around the grassy knoll... \nFRANK Isn't that out of our way? \nIgnoring this, she turns the LIGHTS OFF, walks over to a screen and picks up a remote control. She clicks the button. A SLIDE PROJECTOR comes on, throwing an IMAGE on Frank's back.

We see: a shot of the depot, a map of the rail route, a gun, a river, a Bingo game, baseball action and a huge dollar sign! \nLANA Ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars... trying to avoid a panic attack. Fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, I shoot him, shove him out the door... he hits the river and drowns. Bingo! A triple play. We're rich! \nThe lights click ON. \nFRANK You been thinking about this a lot, haven't you? \n", "test3_true": "They embrace, kissing passionately, dropping out of frame. The model train CHUGS faster, the train whistle SHRIEKING a long \"Woooooooo-woooooooooo!\"... racing into a model tunnel. \nINT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT \nNed and Arch drag in a bunch of bad-ass, multi-ethnic GANG MEMBERS they've just busted. Ned angrily shoves one of the toughest gang members against the wall... losing his cool. \nNED Stand over there and shut up! \nGANG MEMBER #1 Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you be layin' no deleterious malfeasance on us. \nNed goes ballistic and slams him into the wall again! \nNED Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want to hear language like that! \nArch grabs Ned by the shoulder, pulling him back, calming him. \nARCH Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy. You seem a little tense tonight. What is it? \nNed regains his composure. He's depressed. \nNED Aw... I don't know. I guess it's Lana. It's just... I know she wants to have a baby so bad... \nGang Member #1 steps closer, listening. \nNED ...but I never get to spend any time with her. And when I am home... it's like she's, you know... avoiding sex. \nGang Member #1 steps closer, listening. \nGANG MEMBER #1 You should try to be more sensitive, man. More romantic. Bring her flowers. \nHe steps between them, putting his arm around Ned's shoulder. \nGANG MEMBER #1 Try to understand how she feels. After all... \nHe steps back, begins to SING \"Try A Little Tenderness\"... \nGANG MEMBER #1 She may be weary... Women do get weary... Wearing that same old shabby dress... But when she's weary... Try a little ten-der-ness... \nThe other Gang Members join in on the SECOND VERSE with a sweet, mellow street-corner harmony as back-up... and some smooth group choreography. \nThe COPS on duty listen raptly, getting maudlin and dewey- eyed. Tears roll down the cheeks of the BOOKING SERGEANT. \nThe lights dim. A big, gruff COP makes eyes at a HOOKER being booked... and they start to slow dance. \nArch watches all this with a sentimental smile, munching on his Nachos. When the song ends, Arch puts a comforting hand, covered with Nacho cheese, on Ned's shoulder. \nNED That can't be it. I'm the tenderest guy on the force. Nah... I think she's just afraid she won't be able to get pregnant. \nARCH What's to be afraid! It's like making breakfast! You bring home the bacon... she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got an omelette in the oven! (a beat, then) Why don't you knock off early... go home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change. \nNED Naw... I can't. I got all this paperwork. \nARCH Don't worry about that. \nGANG MEMBER #1 We'll do our own paperwork, man! \nOTHER GANG MEMBERS Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit. \nNed nods, smiles and gratefully \"high-fives\" the Gang Members as he heads for the door. \nINT. THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe house is dark. A key turns in the lock and Ned enters. \nIN THE BEDROOM \nIt's dark. Ned quietly undresses and slips into bed. \nINT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON LANA - DAWN \nSunlight creeps through the windows. Lana's eyes flutter open. She sees Ned beside her... sleeping. Suddenly, it hits her. She turns! Frank is on the other side, curled up, snoring. She's laying between both men! \nLana elbows Frank. He stirs, groggy. She covers his mouth... indicating Ned. Frank's eyes bug out! He slips out of bed. The bed frame SQUEAKS LOUDLY! Frank freezes. Ned sleeps on steadily. \nFrank grabs his clothes. An unending torrent of coins fall out of his pants pockets, CLANGING on the floor! He freezes. Ned sleeps on. Frank retrieves the coins, clumsily stepping on the TV REMOTE CONTROL. \nA high-tech, sleekly designed TELEVISION MONITOR rises up... clicks ON. Frank tries frantically to push the set down, but it keeps rising into position. An IMAGE appears. It's WILLARD SCOTT, doing the weather on the TODAY SHOW. \nFrank grabs the remote control, frantically pounding on all the buttons. The VOLUME goes up... SOUND BLASTING! \nWILLARD SCOTT (on television) ...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of female! Smokes three cigars a day, drinks a straight shot of vodka at bedtime... and still has sex! \nThe alarm clock goes off, CLANGING LOUDLY! Lana dives for it, slamming her hand down, killing the alarm. \nGoing for a double-play, she flings the clock at the TV, nailing the on/off switch! Silence. Ned is still out cold. \nFrank moves toward the door... but with each step the floor CREAKS LOUDLY! He turns the knob. It CLUNKS! He pulls the door open v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y and it CRE-E-E-E-A-K-S like the piercing metal brakes of a train! \nHe blows Lana a kiss, then pulls the door closed very gently. It sticks. He pulls harder. The knob pops off in his hand and he falls backward, tumbling down the stairs with a HUGE RACKET! Ned doesn't stir. Finally it's SILENT. Lana exhales. \nA SMALL BIRD lands on the sill of the open window, trilling a sweet little \"CHIRP.\" Ned sits bolt upright, irritated. \n", "test3_id": 1025}

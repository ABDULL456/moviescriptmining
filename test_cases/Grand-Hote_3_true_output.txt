BACK TO: 
THE BARON 
He slumps on the arm of the chair. 
KRINGELEIN (watching him) The Baron is tired? 
BARON No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just -- (he shrugs his shoulders) Well -- well -- 
KRINGELEIN Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights? 
BARON I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke! 
KRINGELEIN Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron -- 
The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur -- 
CUT IN: 
FLASH OF CHAUFFEUR 
Arguing with Senf. 
CUT BACK TO: 
BARON 
BARON Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein. (he strides off) 
Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron. 
He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron money. Charming scene. 
CUT TO: 
BARON AND CHAUFFEUR 
Moving into position. They are talking. 
BARON (quietly) I've quit. 
CHAUFFEUR You can't. 
BARON I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you. 
CHAUFFEUR What about the money? 
BARON I'll pay you back. 
CHAUFFEUR How? 
BARON I have an idea working in my head... (he glances at Kringelein) 
CHAUFFEUR You might find a bullet through that head... 
BARON If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back -- 
At that moment a voice is heard. 
VOICE Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam Grusinskaya's car. 
It is passed along. 
INSIDE PORTER (calls through his little telephone) Madam Grusinskaya's car -- 
MEGAPHONE (outside) Madam Grusinskaya's car -- 
BARON (quickly to chauffeur) Later. (Chauffeur exits with bad grace.) 
Baron looks off... 
FULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE 
Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. Music comes up. 
Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward. 
As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause. 
GRUSINSKAYA (to them) Go on please -- go on, Suzette. 
She and the Baron are alone. 
BARON (quietly) Bless you... 
GRUSINSKAYA Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre. 
BARON I can't. 
GRUSINSKAYA No? 
BARON No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now... 
GRUSINSKAYA Why do you think -- 
BARON Why? 
GRUSINSKAYA They've brought me such good luck -- you --

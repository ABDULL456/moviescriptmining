176   BACK TO ROBERTS (PRESENT)                                      176 
Roberts looks at him inquisitively. 
ANGLE ON STANLEY 
As a wry Indiana Jones smirk slowly crosses his face.   He slowly shakes his head. 
ROBERTS Cheer up, Stan, we got him. You're a hero. 
STANLEY Yeah that's me. Hero. 
They walk to the door and out. 
ROBERTS I was wrong about you, Stanley. I wanted you to know that. You know, you should take your daughter on vacation. Relax a little, you're lucky to be alive. 
Stanley slaps Roberts on the arm and walks out. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
177   INT. CREDIT SUISSE (MONTE CARLO) - DAY                         177 
A WOMAN who looks surprisingly like Ginger with blonde hair and dark shades saunters into the Credit Suisse main bank in Monte Carlo. 
She walks up to a desk and sits down in front of a young female BANK EXECUTIVE. Both women speak in French with SUBTITLES. 
WOMAN I would like to transfer money between my employer's accounts. 
BANK EXECUTIVE Certainly. May I have your employer's account number and password, please? 
The Woman slides a piece of paper across the desk as she casually lights a cigarette. 
(CONTINUED) 
177   CONTINUED:                                                       177 
BANK EXECUTIVE (looking at the account number, realizing who she is dealing with) Oh, of course. You realize, how should I say, there is a substantial amount of money in that account. 
The sexy Woman smiles. 
WOMAN That's why I'm here. My employer doesn't like drawing attention to himself. He likes to keep a low profile. 
The Bank Executive keys in the account numbers. 
BANK EXECUTIVE Of course. Would you feel more comfortable dealing with the bank president? 
WOMAN (exhaling) Would you? 
BANK EXECUTIVE Yes... 
WOMAN Get him. 
BANK EXECUTIVE Right away. A glass of Cristal while you... Wait a moment... 
WOMAN What? 
BANK EXECUTIVE There seems to have been a series of large withdrawals out of this account. 
WOMAN That's impossible. 
The Woman spins around the terminal. 
The Executive and the Woman look at each other in astonishment, then both look back at the screen. 
(CONTINUED) 
110A. 
177   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             177 
The balance now reads $500.00. 
We PUSH INTO A CLOSEUP OF the terminal.   Then THROUGH it. 
178   TERMINAL                                                        178 
We PUSH INTO a CLOSEUP of the terminal. Then THROUGH it. We SHOOT THROUGH the system of wires and microchips, DOWN and THROUGH T1 lines, ACROSS the world at light speed, and EXIT the computer world FROM... 
179   INT. DINER - SOMEWHERE IN ARIZONA - DAY                         179 
The screen of Stanley's laptop. 
HOLLY (O.S.) Everything okay, Dad? 
Stanley, sitting at a booth, looks up from his laptop at Holly who was studying a road map of Arizona. 
STANLEY Everything's fine. Just making the last of some charitable donations..

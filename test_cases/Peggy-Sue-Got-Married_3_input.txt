ELIZABETH He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late. 
BARNEY Let's go. 
PEGGY (hugging Elizabeth) Goodbye, Grandma. 
ELIZABETH Have a good time. 
Barney and Peggy open the door and exit. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE DRIVEWAY 
Peggy and Barney approach the car. 
PEGGY What does Grandma think you do at your meetings? 
BARNEY Stag movies. Smokers. 
Peggy chuckles as they get into the car. The car proceeds along the driveway and turns onto the highway. 
INT. CAR  DRIVING 
Barney is at the wheel. 
BARNEY I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you. 
PEGGY I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. (beat) Has it ever worked before? 
BARNEY The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one. 
INT. LODGE - NIGHT 
A onestory, pitchroof building. The sign over the entrance reads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is a logo of a spreading sunrise. Peggy and Barney pull up to the front, exit the car and enter the building. 
INT. LODGE  ANTEROOM 
Thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. Most are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts. They either wear or carry tricorner hats. Peggy and Barney enter. Several men approach them. Peggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm. 
GEORGE Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to have you with us. 
PEGGY Thank you. 
HENRY You know, you're a lucky girl. You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather. 
PEGGY Ah... thank you. 
BARNEY Let me take your jacket, Lilla. I've got, to get my robe. 
Peggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak, room. 
AL You know, this is very exciting for all of us. 
GEORGE We've been waiting a long time for someone like you. 
Barney rejoins them, wearing his hat and robe. The group begins to enter the main room. 
PEGGY (nervous) Do you have to wear that hat? 
BARNEY It wouldn't be a lodge without hats. 
Barney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly through the doorway. 
BARNEY Don't you worry. I'll be watching after you. 
INT. LODGE  MAIN ROOM 
A large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold painted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders, with lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front of the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth". 
Peggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne. 
HENRY Hey, George. Get the lights. 
The LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles. 
The men form a semicircle around Peggy. Old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose. The men rejoin the line. 
LEO COOPER, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant. 
LEO (to Peggy) Are you ready, dear? 
PEGGY Yes, sir. 
Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms. 
PEGGY Fasten your seat belts. Here we go.

Edmund comes slowly down the steps, his gun pointing here, then there in his perfectly steady grip. The thrill of the hunt is in Edmund's eyes. The downstairs is thick with ominous shadows. At the bottom of the steps, he stops and listens again. He moves in two quick steps to the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining room. He seems to hear something at the rear of the house. He turns and moves back along the central hall, very slowly. The alcove under the stairs is pitch black. Edmund points his gun at that approaching space and stops. He listens. The TINKLING of the wind chimes rises weirdly, making it hard for him to hear.

Edmund's hand reaches out to the wall.   His fingers find the light switch. He flips it. 
For a second, we are blinded by the glare. In the next Instant, as we see that the space below the stairs is empty, Matty screams from the top of the stairs -- 
MATTY He has a gun! 
Edmund thinks she is warning him.   He spins to look. 
WALKER Where? 
Suddenly, Racine bursts from the hall closet, the wooden plank raised above his head. He brings it down fast toward Edmund's head. 
Edmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm that holds the gun, to protect himself. The wooden plank smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmund's forearm, half by his head. The gun BLASTS once. 
One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night. 
Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. 
Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. 
Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. 
Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer. 
Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold. Edmund comes on. 
Racine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden plank. He swings it up. 
The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD. 
Matty, up the stairs, turns away. 
Racine falls back on the floor.

EXT. TRUNK OF WALKER'S CADILLAC - NIGHT 
The trunk is open like a giant maw. A sheet of plastic has been spread across the inside. Edmund's body flops down inside. He has been dressed, his shoes and watch put on. Racine drops the blooded wooden plank beside the body, then throws a blanket over the corpse and slams the trunk. Racine turns to Matty who stands, fully dressed, shaking in the foggy air. 
RACINE The cars at the end of the drive. Spend the fifteen minutes cleaning up inside, then come. You're gonna have to be careful in this fog. (he looks at her) Are you all right? 
She nods. 
RACINE Fifteen minutes. 
Racine gets in the Cadillac and pulls away. 
INT. CADILLAC - ON DESERTED BACKROAD - NIGHT 
WIPE TO: 
The first stretch of Racine's route to "The Breakers" looks different in the dense FOG. Racine has to take it slowly. 
He consults his watch. A branch from one of the overhanging trees looms up abruptly in the windshield, like a grasping arm. Racine flinches. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 
Racine drives through the silent neighborhood. The  houses are invisible in the FOG, their presence indicated only by an occasional glowing light. Suddenly, a police  SIREN pierces the night, followed by the appearance of a flashing red light on the street behind the Cadillac. 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Racine's eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing red light growing in it. Racine pulls over. The police car slows as it reaches the Cadillac, pulls alongside, and then speeds on ahead, SIREN squealing. A light goes on in the house in front of which Racine has stopped. He pulls away. 
EXT. FOUR-LANE INTERSTATE - NIGHT 
The Cadillac pulls up to the interstate from the side street.

As on the other night, there is more traffic here.   But it is moving slowly in the FOG. 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Racine has to cross two lanes of traffic to go south. He peers out through the misted windshield. He starts to pull out and a sports car appears from nowhere, doing fifty, sitting on his HORN. Racine hits the brakes. As soon as it has passed, there is a lull. Racine fishtails across the road just ahead of a truck and moves south. 
EXT./INT. CADILLAC - INTERSTATE - NIGHT 
The traffic on Racine's side of the interstate has slowed. There's an accident up ahead. The police car that passed Racine is on the scene, but the lone Cop is not enough. Some Passing Motorists have pulled over to help with the wreck and direct traffic. The FOG is aglow with flashing red and white lights and burning flares. A Man signals for Racine to stop. The cars in the opposite lanes are allowed to pass through. Racine keeps his head down. 
A STOCKY TRUCKER comes out of the glowing FOG and walks up to the Cadillac. He leans down into the driver's window. 
STOCKY TRUCKER Hey, man, do you have any flares? 
RACINE Uh -- no.     I don't think so. 
STOCKY TRUCKER (irritated) Could you check your trunk? We got kinda of a mess here.

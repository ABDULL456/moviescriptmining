Your school records say you don't have the math skills. \nJohnny swallows this. He knew it was coming. The Major deletes \"Pilot\" from the list, then several other items. \nMAJOR That rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and I'm afraid we reserve non-military options for candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son... \nHe turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list.

I'm putting you down for the Mobile Infantery. \n40\tINT\tAUDITORIUM - DAY - CARMEN \nproudly takes the Federal Service oath with about twenty-five other people, a gleaming silver FLEET PIN on her chest.

Zander and I are a flight team now. \nZander puts his arm around Carmen, gives her a squeeze. \nZANDER Best in the Fleet ! \nJOHNNY I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ? \nJohnny turns to leave. \nCARMEN Johnny, wait... \nZANDER Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. \nJohnny turns back to face Zander. \nJOHNNY You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ? \nZANDER You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ? \nJOHNNY Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers. \nEveryone can see what's about to happen. A circle is forming, Fleet on one side, Mobile Infantery on the other. \nZANDER Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here. \nCARMEN Zander, please... Let's go ! \nZander takes off his hat. \nZANDER It's alright. What's he gonna do ? \nWHAM !\tJohnny punches him right in the nose. Zander goes down, bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny. \nACE Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch. \nZander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him back. Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist. \nCARMEN What's wrong with you ? \nJOHNNY Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch. \nCarmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy, for her part, couldn't be happier. \nDIZZY Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet weren't meant to mix ! \n98\tINT\tLASER PARLOR - NIGHT CYCLE - JOHNNY grinds his teeth as a laser mounted on a robot arm finishes slicing an intricate pattern into his arm. \nJOHNNY It hurts...! \n104\tEXT\tKLENDATHU - HIGH ATMOSPERE - NIGHT - THE CAPSULES \nburn when they hit atmosphere, outer skin tearing away in big silver sheets. \n105\tINT\tCAPSULE - NIGHT - JOHNNY \ntakes in ENTRY DATA from the heads up display. \nGUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in twenty-fivr seconds ...LZ has been identified ...beacon is in place... \n106\tINT\tRODGER YOUNG - COMMAND AND CONTROL - CARMEN \nwatches nervously as deadly bursts of bug plasma fill the heavens around the battle group. Below, the surface of Klendathu fairly bistles with outgoing defensive fire. \nDELADIER This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...! \nZANDER That's it, we're empty ma'am ! \nOut the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn. \nDELADIER Someone made a big goddam mistake ! Get us out of here, Number 1 ! \nCarmen dodges past burning ships, avoids collision with Dauntless, and then KA-WHAM !\tthey're hit. Carmen flies out of her station and into CAMERA hard. \n107\tEXT\tKLENDATHU - CLOUD LAYER - NIGHT - THE SECOND SKIN \ntears away. Johnny is sitting on air. \nGUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in fifteen seconds... deploying chute now... \nThe chute pops. Across the sky, lit by outgoing bug plasma, he can see hundreds of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer. It's quiet in the clouds, then: \n108\tEXT\tKLENDATHU - NIGHT - FROM THE AIR - JOHNNY \nlooks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield. Plasma blasts exploode into the sky. THOUSANDS OF BUGS boil out of the ground to defend against the invader. \nGUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in five... four ... three... \nJohnny burns his chute off, drops the last hundred feet and lands on the bounce. \n109\tEXT\tKLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY'S POV - THE FLASH PULSE of bug batteries, screaming voices on the com, concussions shaking the ground. None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT. Lieutenant Willy shouts. \nLIEUTENANT WILLY Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA ! \nA HOPPER (an airborne Arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and \"pop out\" wings for gliding) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut. \nACE KILL IT ! \nJohnny and Ace open fire, backing away. Pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts gushing. \nJOHNNY Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? \nACE I didn't see him ! \nNow comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications, and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS. \nKITTEN SMITH Here they come...! \nDIZZY Ace, what're we doing ? \nACE I uh... uh... \nDizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects. \nSHUJUMI You want some ? Here's some ! C'MON ! \nJOHNNY Don't waste your ammon on the workers ! \nShujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs. \nSHUJUMI AAAAAAAAAAAA ! \nHe fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off. \nKATRINA Let's get out of here ! \nNow the ground opens behind her and a huge (6 meters) TANKER BUG lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes. \nDIZZY Look out ! \nThe tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out from under her. \nKATRINA AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! \nWarriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him. \nJOHNNY C'mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out of here ! \n110\tEXT\tKLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY \nZANDER Give me hand, willya ? \nCarmen takes his hand. Zander kisses her. \nZANDER I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen. \nCARMEN You weren't thinking...you were dreaming ! \nZANDER If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ? \nCARMEN There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too... \nZANDER So ? \nCARMEN So who's got time to get married ? \nCarmen lets his hand go and leaps through the hatch. Zander falls back onto the conveyer belt, finds himself eyeball-to-eyeball with a horribly maimed trooper, scrambles to get off. \n118\tINT\tBATTLE STATION TICONDEROGA - COMMON AREA - ZANDER \njoins Carmen in the crowded common area where dead bodies compete for space with wounded awaiting triage. Survivors watch casualty lists scroll ba on a Federal Net terminal. \nZANDER Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it. \nCARMEN Funny... \nZANDER I'm not kidding. Marriage is - \nCARMEN No, funny there's almost no wounded at all. \nZANDER Hey, bugs don't take prisoners. \nCarmen looks at the words at the Net terminal: WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE ? She bites her lip, enters Johnny's name. In an instant, she has the news: RICO, JOHN D. - KIA \nCARMEN Oh no. \nTears fill her eyes. \nZANDER Carmen...? \nCARMEN Excuse me...! \nShe rushes away. Zander looks at Johnny's name on the screen, shrugs, presses the ERASE button. \n119\tINT\tTICONDEROGA - CORRIDOR - ZANDER \nfinds Carmen, sagging against a wall, weepimg. \nZANDER I'm sorry, Carmen. \nCARMEN Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different... \nZander puts an arm around her. She holds on tight. \nCARMEN No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool. \nZANDER You're upset, that's alright. \nZander kisses her hair. Tears roll down her face. \nCARMEN No, don't you see ? No one can wait for anything anymore... You're right... We should get married... \nZander holds Carmen as she sobs, feeling lucky. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n120\tINT\tSTASIS TANK - DAY CYCLE - JOHNNY'S BODY \nfloats, suspended in fluid, mouth hanging open, his skin white as death. A low underwater KNOCKING wakes him. He opens his eyes and sees Ace and Dizzy outside the tank. \nAce holds up a KIA list, pointing at Johnny's name, laughing: Rico, John V - KIA. Their voices are distant and garbled. Dizzy cups her hands against the side of the tank. \nDIZZY Two more days. \nJohnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue. Johnny gives a weak thumbs up. The knocking sound continues. \nJohnny turns. A STEEL HAND taps the side of the tank. Johnny grins, astonished. The man wearing it is his former high school teacher, now a Lieutenant, Jean Rasczak. \n121\tEXT\tSPACE - AQZ - A BATTLE GROUP \nconsisting of STARSHIPS, their tender, FREIGHTERS and other SUPPLY CRAFT. \n122\tINT\tTROOP TRANSPORT - M.I. QUARTERS - JOHNNY \nstows his gear along with Ace and Dizzy. Acroos the room, a collection of battle-hardened vets check out the newcomers. \nACE Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires... \nJOHNNY He was our teacher... He was great. \nThe cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a TANKER BUG. \nJOHNNY WATCH OUT ! \nThe tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole. Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus an arm, screaming. \nBIRDIE AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! \nJohnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his pulse cannon. \nRASCZAK Sugar, in for pick up ! \nRasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP ! The big bug explodes. \nRASCZAK Gas that hole and close it ! \nThe Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down beside Rasczak. \nRASCZAK Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ? \nJOHNNY Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. \nRASCZAK I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. \nRasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer. \nRASCZAK Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes with a factory guarantee ! \nDizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back. \nDIZZY Way to go, amigo ! \nJOHNNY I'm gonna need a squad leader. \nACE No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material. \nJOHNNY What about it, Diz ? \nDIZZY (a snappy salute) Looks like I'm your girl, sir. \nTac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air. Flaming debris rains down. \nRASCZAK Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's our trash ! \nRoughnecks head out on the bounce. \n126\tEXT\tTANGO URILLA - RIDGE - DAY - JOHNNY \nand the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving. \nJOHNNY What kind of stinkin' bug is that ? \nJohnny jumps the magnification on his \"head up\". Down in the pit, a giant translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery. \nSUGAR WATKINS You never seen how they do it before ? \nJohnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly. \nACE Agghh ! It's making me sick...! \nThe plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction. \nSUGAR WATKINS It's gonna pop ! \nWOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew. \nGILLESPIE Sir, look ! \nSergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position. \nRASCZAK We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ? \nGILLESPIE Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...? \nRasczak moves off down the line giving orders. \nRASCZAK Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower ! \nGILLESPIE Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir. \nRASCZAK They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ? \nDIZZY That'd be me, sir. \nRASCZAK Heat it up. \nDizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL. \nRASCZAK Roughnecks, you may fire at will. \nis in holo conference with an INTELLIGENCE OFFICER \nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement... \nRASCZAK I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P. \nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment. \nRASCZAK Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed... \nThe Intelligence Officer reddens. \nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job. \nRASCZAK My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap- \nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders ! \nVOICE (O.S.) That'll be all, Major. Dismissed. \nThe Intelligence Officer disappears abruptly. A new hologram appears. Rasczak's jaw drops. It's his former student Carl Jenkins, now a Colonel, weary and pissed off. \nCARL This conference is over. Do your duty, Lieutenant. That's an order. \nRasczak recovers, salutes stiffly. \nRASCZAK Yes, sir. \n132\tINT\tPRE-FAB SLEEPING UNIT - DAY - JOHNNY AND DIZZY \nare making love. The door pops open. Rasczak stands there. Dizzy ducks under the covers. Johnny manages a salute. \nRASCZAK Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics. \nJOHNNY Yes, sir ! \nRASCZAK Who's that with you ? \nDizzy shows herself, grinning. \nRASCZAK Report in ten minutes. \nRasczak slams the door shut on them. They fall back into one anothers arms, laughing as they resume lovemaking. \nDIZZY Planet P ? What kind of name is that ? \nJOHNNY They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. \n133\tEXT\tPLANET P - BAD LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS \nmove through canyons of towering wind-carved rock formations. Gillespie carries the communications package. \nGILLESPIE I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder. \nRASCZAK Keep trying, Sergeant. \n134\tEXT\tCANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS \nwalk in a column far below. Something is watching from the above... HOPPERS, lots of them, moving from rock to rock for better position. \n135\tEXT\tCANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - ACE sees something out of the corner of his eye. \nJOHNNY BUGS...! \nThe hoppers hit. Several Roughnecks go down. Everyone opens up. Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground. \nDIZZY Johnny, watch out ! \nA burning bug hurls itself at Johnny. Johnny jumps out of the way as Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks. \nRASCZAK LET'S GO ! ON THE BOUNCE ! \n136\tEXT\tFLAT LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS \nmove out into the open. In the distance they see 4th Brigade HQ, a walled compound and partially constructed landing pad. \nRASCZAK Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ? \nGILLESPIE AAAAAAAAAAA ! \nTwo hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs join to feast. \nRASCZAK Throw a rifle ! \nDizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak. Gillespie writhes in the hopper's claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie. \nRASCZAK I expext any one here to do the same for me... Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action. The rest of you make for 4th Brigade. \nJohnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down on the flat lands from the canyon walls. \nRASCZAK The distress call... The bugs wanted us to rescue you...! \nGENERAL OWEN Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time... waiting for the most opportune moment ! \nRasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com. \nRASCZAK To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak. Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are going to be attacked...! \nGENERAL OWEN They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets ! \nRasczak looks at General Owen with contempt. \nSUGAR WATKINS (O.S.) Fire in the hole ! \nAn explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole. \n143\tEXT\tOFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - GENERAL OWEN \nblinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen, collapsing to his knees. \nGENERAL OWEN Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my boys and girls...! \nThe Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before. Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard. \nLT. RASCZAK Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and you're not ! \nGENERAL OWEN I know... I wish you'd shoot me... \nLT. RASCZAK I oughta ! \nAnd it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down next to Johnny and Rasczak. \nACE Lieutenant, we got trouble ! \n144\tEXT\tRAMPARTS - DAY - RASCZAK \nand Johnny join other stunned Roughnecks to see THOUSANDS OF BUGS on the march from every direction. Bug batteries open up in the distance. \nRASCZAK Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ? \nJOHNNY What's going on, Diz ? \nDIZZY (O.S.) I got power ! Gimme a minute ! \nJohnny runs for the communications room. \nJOHNNY We don't have a minute ! \n145\tINT\tCOMMUNICATIONS - DAY - DIZZY \nhas the board up. Outside the battle has begun. Nukes go WOMP ! and pulse guns chatter. \nDIZZY What frequency ? \nJOHNNY All bands. \nDIZZY Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group... \nRODGER YOUNG (O.S.) This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear ! \nJOHNNY SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now ! \nRODGER YOUNG (O.S.) What is your position ? \nJOHNNY Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission ! \nRODGER YOUNG (O.S.) Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy ! \nJOHNNY Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy ! \nJohnny races out the door. \n146\tEXT\t4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE COMPOUND \nis white hot as Roughnecks on the walls unload nukes. Johnny crosses the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall. \nJOHNNY Boat coming down, sir ! \nThe Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes. \nROUGHNECKS I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too ! \nJohnny scans the battlefield. Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass. Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath millions of marching feet. \nACE Jeez, we musta killed a million already...! \nJOHNNY Not enough, I guess. \nSugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below, stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers. \nslams into the cockpit. Out the front screen, violent bursts of BUG PLASMA fill the sky as they break atmosphere. \nJOHNNY Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock...! \nThe co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow. \nZANDER On whose authority, Corporal ? \nJOHNNY This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission. \nThe pilot turns around. It's Carmen. \nCARMEN Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! \nJOHNNY I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! \nJohnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command. \nCARMEN Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet P-11... \n149\tINT\tBOAT - CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY returns to Dizzy's side as the medics struggle to save her. Blood pours out of her mouth. Her body thrashes. \nDIZZY JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH BREATHE GOD JOHNNY CAN'T HEH HEH HEH HEH...! \nDizzy dies. A Medic slaps her. Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank. They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there, stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit. \nCARMEN Negative on your request. Fleet Command has the battle group on standby... \nCarmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck. \nCARMEN ...I'm sorry. \nJOHNNY We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit. \nCARMEN No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. \nShe points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires. \nCARMEN I thought you were KIA, Johnny... \nJOHNNY That was just a mix up. \nCARMEN You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it. \nJOHNNY What happened to your eye ? \nCarmen touches the scar over her eye. \nCARMEN Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K. \nJOHNNY I like it. It's kinda...you. \n150\tEXT\tBATTLE GROUP - ORION SYSTEM - THE BOAT \nlands on the flight deck of the Rodger Young in the midst of the flotilla. \n151\tINT\tOFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY CYCLE - ZANDER \nenters, watches Carmen dress.

Dizzy is laid out in dress gray. The surviving Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects. \nJOHNNY Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets... But in war, we must go on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting. \nSeveral INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay. \nJOHNNY Officer on deck ! \nEveryone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room. His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, nods to Carmen. \nCARL Please continue, Sergeant. \nJOHNNY Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death. \nA HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER. \nJOHNNY Would'ya mind moving your boat ? \nFLEET OFFICER Better talk to the boss. \nThe cargo bays open to deploy FLEET SKIMMERS. Zander jumps down to oversee the operation. \nJOHNNY You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant ! \nZANDER This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ? \nJOHNNY You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down - \nSuddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty. Zander and Johnny share a look of concern. \nZANDER Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! (to his crew chief) I'll take the first group. \nJOHNNY Saddle up, boys, that's our trash ! \n156\tEXT\tSPACE - PLANET P ORBIT - BUG PLASMA \nbegins to take a toll on the battle group as the orbiting ships lay their eggs.

Warp in 5... 4... \nKA-WHAM ! The Rodger Young takes a direct hit. \n158\tEXT\tRODGER YOUNG - PLANET P ORBIT - THE RODGER YOUNG \nis cut in two. The rear section explodes, the forward section begins to burn towards the bridge. \n159\tINT\tRODGER YOUNG - BRIDGE - CAPTAIN DELADIER \ncalmy evacuates the bridge.

I'm going in... \n164\tEXT\tPLANET P - BASE CAMP - DAY - ROUGHNECKS \nboard the Skimmers. Zander approaches Johnny, upset. \nJOHNNY What's your problem now, Lieutenant ? \nZANDER The Rodger Young just burned up... \nJohnny's face falls. \nJOHNNY Any survivors ? \nZander points. Far in the distance, a glowing pod plummets toward the planet. Johnny tracks it on his \"head up\". \nJohnny and Zander stare each other down. \nZANDER Let's go. JOHNNY Move out. \nJohnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and the others fall in behind him. \nACE Bug hunt ! \nROUGHNECKS BUG HUNT ! \n172\tINT\tTUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY \nleads his deadly force through enemy territory.

She can hear BUGS CLICKING. She's in a pit filled with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING. \nShe crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound. The moaning turns to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself up to peer over the edge. \n174\tINT\tBUG CITY - THE ROYAL COURT - DAY - CARMEN \nsees hundred of bugs at work, WARRIORS, WORKERS and dozens of small (2 meters) CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her, but pays her no attention. \nShe sees the source of the screaming:\tCaptain Deladier is hold between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees, \nDELADIER NAAAAAAAA...! OH PLEASE... \nThe BRAIN BUG is huge (5 meters) and pulpy. I has vestigial legs that cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of chariot bugs. \nDELADIER ...OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA...! \nA thorn-like PALP unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into Deladier's head and sucks her brains out. \nDELADIER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! \nCarmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into her limbs. \nCARMEN AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! \nNow the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape. All she wants to do is die. \nSuddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it. A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. Johnny enters the chamber alone. \nThe warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks. The warriors freeze. \nJOHNNY You know what this is...? \nJohnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp. \nJOHNNY Sure you do... You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you ? \nJohnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him. The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, his finger on the nuke's trigger. \nJOHNNY I'll take you with me. \nThe Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses. Johnny reaches for her. \nJOHNNY Take my hand ! \nChariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge. \nJOHNNY Roughnecks...NOW ! \nJohnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to bug and Roughneck alike. \nSugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a claw through the gut. \nZANDER AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! \nHe blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny and Carmen. \nJOHNNY Weapon ! \nAce throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior. Every bug in the chamber is dead. \nJOHNNY Are you hurt ? \n", "test1_input": "Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends. \nJOHNNY Did you read her mind ? \nCARL Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. \nIt's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny. \nJOHNNY Yeah, but I want Carmen. \nCARL You got it bad. \nCarmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off. \nCARL Don't forget about this afternoon. (to Carmen) He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss. \nCarmen blushes, covers. CARMEN She's flying starships ! \nJOHNNY Who ? \nCARMEN Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical \nJOHNNY I have good reflexes. \nCarmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm. \nCARMEN C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology. \n9\tINT\tBIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER \nis an older woman, very spry, also blind. Johnny, Carmen and other students gather around covered lab tables. \nBIOLOGY TEACHER For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin. \nThe students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60 centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection. \nCARMEN Eeuch ! \nJOHNNY Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug. \nBIOLOGY TEACHER Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society. \nJOHNNY Better put your goggles on. \nJohnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill. \nBIOLOGY TEACHER Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly. \nCARMEN But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel. \nBIOLOGY TEACHER True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society. \nShe points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR. \nBIOLOGY TEACHER They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space. \nJohnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out. \nJOHNNY Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal... \nCARMEN Excuse me...! \nShe heads for the door, hand over her mouth. \n10\tEXT\tCIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN \nwalk home from school together. \nJOHNNY 35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers. \nCARMEN Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. \nJOHNNY Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. \nCARMEN Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. \nJOHNNY Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? \nCARMEN I don't want everyone to see. \nJOHNNY Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? \nCARMEN How come that's all you talk about anymore ? \nJOHNNY It's all I think about anymore. \nIndeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand. \n11\tEXT\tPUPLIC TRANSPORTATION - DAY - CARMEN \n", "test1_true": "CARMEN You can't walk me home. \nJOHNNY Why not ? \nCARMEN I thought you were going to help Carl. \nJOHNNY Carl can wait. \nCARMEN Johnny, my Dad's home today. \nJohnny's face darkens with frustration. \nJOHNNY What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager ! \nCARMEN It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. \nJOHNNY Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ? \nCARMEN Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? \nCarmen steps into the flux.\tZAPPP!\tShe's gone. Johnny grins, happy to be in love. \n12\tINT\tCARL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - JOHNNY \nis hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor. \nCARL Don't think about it... go on instinct. \nJOHNNY Ace of spades. \nThe ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates \"no match\". Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds. \nCARL Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know. \nJOHNNY In addition to \"psychic dolt\" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts. \nWrong again. \nCARL Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. Federal studies like this might provide a clue. \nThe next card up is the nine of clubs. \nJOHNNY I wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. Four of spades. \nSuddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold. \nCARL Cyrano, you big yellow turd ! \nJohnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck. \nJOHNNY He just wants attention. You don't play with him like you used to. \nCarl concentrates for a moment. \nCARL Go bug Mom, Cyrano. \nCyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time. Carl clears the screen. \nJOHNNY How do you make him do that ? \nCARL I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it. \nFrom upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks. \nMOM (O.S.) Get out ! Get out ! CARL...! \nJOHNNY Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me. \nCARL Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet. C'mon let's go. \nCarl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all. \nJOHNNY Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ? \nCARL Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ? \nJOHNNY I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe. \nCARL Your father will never let you. \nJOHNNY I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know. \nCARL Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ? \nJOHNNY Eight point... no, uh, seven... \nCARL If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance. \nJOHNNY All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not. \n", "test2_input": "JOHNNY Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now ! \nJohnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP ! \nMOTHER Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach ! \nFATHER Teenagers ! \n27\tINT\tUNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - EVERYONE \nat the \"Farewell Dance\" is dressed up. Rasczak and other TEACHERS chaperon. A spotlight finds the BAND LEADER. \nBAND LEADER Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so let's turn down the lights and make it a slow one. \nThe lights go down. Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny standing alone near the dance floor. \nDIZZY Hey, Rico, wanna dance ? \nJOHNNY Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen... \nDIZZY Too bad for her if she's not around. \nDizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close. \nDIZZY You know, it's sad... Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight. There is an invitation here. Johnny doesn't take it. \nJOHNNY You still gonna play for Brazil ? \nDIZZY Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start. \nJOHNNY Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. \nDIZZY How come we never got together ? \nDizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses the room, stunning in her formal. \nJOHNNY Can't we just be friends, Diz ? \nDIZZY Sure. \nJOHNNY Uh, look, Diz... \nDIZZY Guess you gotta go. \nJOHNNY You're the best. \nJohnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with. Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly. \n28\tINT\tGYMNASIUM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT - CARMEN AND JOHNNY \ndance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids. \nJOHNNY Isn't it great to be in love ? \nCARMEN How do I know if this is love ? JOHNNY It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't... \nCARL Outa the way you two ! \nCarl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer. Johnny goes in for the kiss again. \nCARMEN Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation... \nJOHNNY Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet. \nJohnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her, but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak. \nJOHNNY Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak. \nCARMEN I'll meet you outside. \nJohnny heads over to Rasczak. \nJOHNNY Mister Rasczak ? \nRASCZAK What is it, Rico ? \nJOHNNY I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year. \nRASCZAK (smiling) Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something. \nJOHNNY I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen. \nRASCZAK Good for you. Go find out. \nJOHNNY Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ? \nRASCZAK Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico. \n29\tEXT\tUNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - JOHNNY walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander. He wears the blue uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN, a pair of silver wings. \n", "test2_true": "ZANDER Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ? \nJOHNNY None at all... We won. \nCARMEN Good luck at the academy. \nZander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic. \nZANDER Always. \n30\tEXT\tPROMENADE - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN \nwalk together along the river holding hands. \nCARMEN He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ? \nJOHNNY Yeah, sure, I guess. \nCARMEN No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance. \nJOHNNY What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot. \nCARMEN Zander is going for pilot, too. \nJOHNNY You two have so much in common. \nCarmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye. \nCARMEN Johnny Rico, you're jealous ! \nJOHNNY I can't help it. \nCARMEN He's nothing like you. \nJOHNNY I don't even know if you're my girl. \nCarmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny. CARMEN Are you the boy for me ? \nJOHNNY I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service. \nThey kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart, breathless. \nCARMEN Oh, Johnny... \n31\tEXT\tPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN \nmaking out as they wait their turn. There are a few other people around including a POLICEMAN. \nCARMEN Everyone's looking... we shouldn't... \nJOHNNY Who cares ? \nCARMEN You're right. Let's never stop... \nPOLICEMAN Hey, you, there's a place for that ! \nWithout stopping, Johnny pulls Carmen into the flux.\tZAPPP ! \n32\tINT\tFEDERAL HOUSING - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN \nkissing at her front door. Johnny moves his hand tenatively to Carmen 's breast. She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt. \nJOHNNY I love you, Carmen. \nCARMEN Shhh... \nShe puts her mouth on his and they melt together. The door flies open, and CARMEN'S DAD stands there. \nCARMEN'S DAD Carmen, it's late. Get inside. \nCARMEN Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny. \nCarmen ducks inside. Her father looks Johnny over. He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face. \nCARMEN'S DAD I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ? \nJOHNNY Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from now on, Mr. Ibanez. \nCarmen's Dad reddens. He'd like to punch Johnny out. \nCARMEN'S DAD Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you and your rich family. The Federation'll give her everything she needs. \nCARMEN (O.S.) Dad, leave him alone... Carmen's Dad slams the door in Johnny's face. \n33\tEXT\tFEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN meet Carl in front of the induction center where a staedy flow of prospective citizens file through the main doors. \n34\tINT\tLOBBY - DAY - THE RECRUITING SERGEANT \nis missing one arm. He smiles broadly at the three teenagers. \n", "test3_input": "JOHNNY Sir, thank you, sir ! \nZIM Don't stand there dumb... GO ! \nJohnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth. \nJOHNNY YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...! \nNext in line, Ace scowls. \n72\tINT\tBARRACKS - NIGHT - THE RECRUITS \nhave some free time. Johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons that designate him as Squad Leader. \nKITTEN SMITH Look at him. Do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself ? \nACE Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, I guess. \nJOHNNY I just want you guys to know that I'll never do anything that I haven't asked you to do first. \nJohnny approaches Dizzy. \nJOHNNY Couldn't've done it without you, Diz. Friends ? \nDizzy smiles, shakes. \nDIZZY Yeah, sure... friends. \nBronski walks through with the mail. \nBRONSKI Levy... Shujumi... Rico. \nJohnny grabs the E-disk, pops it into his handcam. The Fleet Mail logo appears: APPROVED MESSAGE \nJOHNNY Bet it's from my girl. \nJohnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship Athena. \nCARMEN Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here. \nACE Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that ! \nJOHNNY Shhhh...! \nCARMEN I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. \nJohnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously. \nJOHNNY All it takes is the love of a good woman... \nThe image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit. She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of Saturn sparkle in bright solar light. \nCARMEN Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had to show you. It's great to be out here on my own. I'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the universe... (she sighs) And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny. I don't want to have kids. I want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me. \nJohnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do. \nCARMEN I know that's not what you wanted to hear... but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I'll know that we'll always be friends. \nThe Fleet Mail logo appears again:\tEND OF MESSAGE. Johnny shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder. \nACE Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out. \nJOHNNY It's what I deserve. ACE Whad'ya talkin  about ? \nJOHNNY I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool. \nACE You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around. \nJohnny smiles in spite of himself. \nJOHNNY Thanks, Ace. \nJohnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin. Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him. \n73\tEXT\tLIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS \narm their Marauder power suits. Zim and Bronski wear Command model suits with rank designations. Johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on each squad member's power suit. \nZIM With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ? \nRECRUITS Sir, yes, sir ! \nZIM The live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit your target, it will shoot you... \nFifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story building facades. \nZIM The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ? \nJOHNNY Sir, yes, sir ! \n", "test3_true": "ZIM Perfect score for this exercise is 300. B company came through last week with 285. I expect you to do better. \n74\tEXT\tLIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS \ntake out the target drones as they appear. Halfway through the course, a recruit takes a hit and goes down, immobilized. Djana'd has a clear shot, but Breckinridge gets in her way. \nDJANA'D You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge \nBefore the others can react, a second drone appears. \nJOHNNY CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN ! \nEveryone kisses dirt. Pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead. Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground. Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones. \nJOHNNY Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard. Move out. \nThe squad resumes ist advance. Breckinridge bangs on his helmet. There is something wrong with his \"head up\" display. \nJOHNNY What's the problem ? \nBRECKINRIDGE Dunno. Display's fritzed. \nDJANA'D Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up our score... JOHNNY Let me see. \nBreckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny. Djana'd turns on Breckinridge. Her \"head up\" zeroes him. \nDJANA'D How come when something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge ? \nThat's when Djana'd trips on a loose stone. She fumbles her rifle and it discharges. The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off. The recruits stare in horror. \nJOHNNY Oh, God... uh... MEDIC ! \nZim arrives with Bronski on the bounce. \nZIM Rico, you are relieved of squad command. Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico to the C.O.'s Office. \nThe recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade. No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing. \n75\tINT\tC.O.'S OFFICE - DAY - JOHNNY \nstands before the C.O. braced by Katrina and Ace. Zim and the C.O.  are both saddened by the proceedings. \nC.O. Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ? \nJOHNNY Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir. \nC.O. Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ? \nJOHNNY Sir, no, sir. \nC.O. Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ? \nJOHNNY Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir. \nC.O: (sigh) You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404. You may, of course, demand trial by court martial. \nJOHNNY Sir, no, sir ! \nC.O. Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ? \nJOHNNY Sir... I guess I do, sir. \nZim looks out the window. Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes, crying as she heads off down Washout Lane. \nC.O. Sergeant, we've lost two recruits over this incident already... is there any possibility of salvaging this man ? \nZim I believe so, sir. \nC.O. Alright. We'll try administrative punishment. Until then you are confined to your quarters, Rico. \n76\tINT\tBARRACKS - SUNSET - JOHNNY \nlooks out the window to the parade ground where a POST has been erected. The recruits look up as Zim enters. \nZIM Alright, let's go, Rico. \nJohnny takes off his shirt. Ace who now holds the chevrons of squad leader, watches, feels bad for his pal. \n77\tEXT\tPARADE GROUND - SUNSET - THE RECRUITS \nstand with recruits from other platoons. Johnny is led to the post and strung up as the C.O. reads the charge. \nC.O. For incompetence of command, for failure to abide by safety regulations in a live fire exercise, for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate... \nZim steps up to Johnny, offers him a red rubber mouthpiece. \nZIM Bite on this. It helps. I know. \nC.O. ... recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced to administrative punishment. Ten lashes. \n"}

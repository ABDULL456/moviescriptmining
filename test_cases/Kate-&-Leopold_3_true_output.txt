YUPPIE WOMAN You tell him. 
LEOPOLD Need I add that without our patronage you would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew your filthy mouth? 
COUNTER MAN Where do you get off? You don't even have any money. 
LEOPOLD Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing. 
COUNTER MAN Not in my store you're not. 
He comes out from behind the counter. He's big. 
LEOPOLD (very superior) Do you intend to physically escort me out...? 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street. 
LEOPOLD Did you see what he did? Did you see that? 
No one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street. Thunder is heard. 
EXT. N.Y.C. - NIGHT 
Gargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, Alphabet City. 
EXT. CLAIRMOUNT STABLES - 4 A.M. 
Pouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and hastily backs up along side Leopold. 
KATE Leopold! Leopold, get in. 
Leopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat. 
INT. CAR - 4 A.M. 
KATE (nearly in tears, trying to dry him off) Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're all right. I didn't think I'd ever find you. You had us all so worried. Oh, Leopold! 
She hits him hard. 
KATE Don't you ever go out again without my permission, do you hear me? I was frantic. You could have been killed a hundred times over. I never would have known. 
She rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She pulls herself together and looks at him. 
KATE Leopold, are you all right? 
LEOPOLD (looking deep into her eyes for the first time) I wish to go home. 
KATE Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy. 
LEOPOLD (badly shaken) No... I wish to go home. 
Kate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight ahead. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
CHARLIE (on the phone) I don't know. It's just Leopold. Like Cher. Or Goofy. 
Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted. 
CHARLIE Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. You look horrible. 
KATE Charlie, don't start. I haven't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year. If you make a wisecrack I'm going to burst into flame. 
CHARLIE It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look horrible. 
KATE I'm too tired for this now. I'll just save it up and kill you tomorrow. Help Leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed. 
LEOPOLD I've something to say. To the both of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. After witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent I am outside of my acquaintance... I don't know how to proceed. I frankly... am in need of assistance. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. In the event you have missed it, I am apologizing. 
There is a long pause. 
CHARLIE About time. (he shakes Leopold's hand reluctantly) Welcome back. (he leaves) 
KATE Don't mind him. His heart would be in the right place if he had a heart. Surliness runs in my family. 
LEOPOLD I understand. It practically races through mine. 
KATE (shocked) Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one that's not at my expense. That's good. 
They look at each other just a second too long.

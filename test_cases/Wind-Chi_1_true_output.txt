The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958. 
Both wear blood-soaked letterman jackets bearing the DISTINCTIVE COUGAR INSIGNIA and stand in a post-accident haze. 
One's chest is concave, stove-in by the impact with the steering wheel. The other's teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away. 
She reels away in horror, forced to take the long way back to the Oldsmobile. She runs the last few yards to the car where we can hear the eerie sound of STATIC emanating from the radio as she hurls herself - 
83   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 83 
Inside.   Safe! 
She sits there, out of breath. She glances over quickly at our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the steering wheel. 
She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again. 
She turns down the volume on the radio. 
GIRL (chattering teeth) - I did it - got through - but I don't know how much she understood - the operator I mean - 
He doesn't respond. 
GIRL (cont'd) - Just have to hope - maybe - they can trace the line - 
When this too gets no response from him she looks over, frowning. She scoots a little closer across the front seat toward him. 
Which is when WE SEE - 
HIS GHOST 
standing outside the car, slack-expressioned and staring. 
He stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night.

GIRL (cont'd) Hang in there, can't be much longer... 
She reaches to jostle him awake.    One touch confirms her worst fears. 
She reaches up to switch on the INTERIOR LIGHT, to get a better look at him. 
GIRL (cont'd) Oh god! 
Her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it seems for a moment she's going to be sick. She covers her mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror. 
Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake him. 
GIRL (cont'd) No! Please! Don't leave me alone! 
Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria. She shakes him harder. His inert body spills to one side, slumping against her. 
Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her. 
She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance as she can between herself and the corpse. 
Cowers against the passenger door. 
The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies. 
84   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER                84 
The door opens and she backs out, hauling the dead body after her. Her face is red, tear-streaked. 
GIRL (crying) Sorry... sorry... I'm sorry... 
She strains to move his dead weight. Her feet slip on the ice and she lets go of him, catching herself on the open door.

She grabs the body under the armpits, hauls with all her strength. Drags him a few yards away from the Oldsmobile. His boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow. 
Behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft THUNK. 
Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice. She goes down hard on her ass, sprawling. Sits there a beat, as-

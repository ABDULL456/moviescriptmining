In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every monitor, laughing. 
ERWIN Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter! 
Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races from the control room via a long thick cable running overhead. 
ERWIN (continuing) He's going for the satellite dish! If he uplinks with a communications satellite he can beam himself any- where in the world! We'll never be rid of him! 
Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots past them, going through the ceiling to the... 
EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting ready to beam Freddy. 
INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME 
Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it hard. 
EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky. 
EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT 
The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite tumbling into deep space. 
The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun. 
Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons. One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun. 
ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a solar prominence. 
INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME 
The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of dust billows up. 
Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees this and jumps in-between them, yelling: 
ERWIN No! Wait! 
Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy run to his side. 
Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies. 
MEAGAN Erwin? Erwin?! 
MURDOCH He's dead... and so are you if you don't put your hands up right now! 
Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun as he says: 
MURDOCH (continuing) It's time I taught you girls some respect for the law! 
In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head. 
PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face. 
MURDOCH (continuing) So... you wanna be a punk? 
Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan. 
MURDOCH (continuing) Then die like a punk! 
Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We see Murdoch's name written into his shorts. 
As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks the shotgun and... 
BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and spinning to a stop like a hubcap. 
Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their guns in panic. 
MEAGAN NO! 
Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN- FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ past. 
More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio is crowded with muzzle flash. 
More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

ROBERTA See how I pushed you? It means your feet aren't centered. 
Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys. 
ROBERTA Can you bring over a chair? (to Guadalupe) It's probably better for you to sit. 
The boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him. 
ROBERTA Where were you today, Naeem? 
NAEEM I can't be in violin class anymore. 
ROBERTA Why not? 
NAEEM My mother won't let me. 
ROBERTA What? 
NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of African fabric. 
MRS. ADISA My son's got more important things to do than learn dead white men's music. 
ROBERTA They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"! 
MRS. ADISA How many Black classical composers can you name? How many Black classical violinists do you know? 
ROBERTA That doesn't mean it's the way it should be. Naeem's learning to play music -- and that makes him feel good about himself. Why should it matter who wrote it? 
NAEEM Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class? 
Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then addresses Roberta. 
MRS. ADISA Look. I've seen this before. You white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place. No thank you. 
She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them. 
INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back: Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the book down and dials the phone. 
ROBERTA Brian Turner's room, please. 
While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures. 
INSERT - PICTURES 
Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were 3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them. 
BACK TO ROBERTA 
She's really depressed herself now. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
ALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS waiting in THE HALL. 
ALICE And which ocean is this? 
Kids simultaneously yell out "ATLANTIC" and "PACIFIC." 
ROBERTA Excuse me... I'm here for the violin students. 
ALICE (icy) You're late. 
ROBERTA Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry. 
ALICE They're having a lesson now. 
ROBERTA But this is when they have violin class! 
ALICE That's not my problem. 
Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess. Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up. 
ROBERTA I thought all the teachers agreed to this. 
JANET In theory. (to a student) Adam! I want you in my office right after lunch, you understand? 
ADAM What'd I do? 
JANET Think about it! (to Roberta) Whenever you pull kids out, it's a disruption, plus it's extra work for the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed. Some teachers resent it. 
ROBERTA Well, can't you talk to them?

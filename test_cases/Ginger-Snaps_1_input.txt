SAM (to Brigitte) Sorry about him, he's an ass hole. Morely! My girlfriend's, she won't leave him at home alone any more. Ya know, dog killers. Morely, no! Sit! Brigitte's mouth is hanging open. Morely slobbers all over her hands. 
BRIGITTE (V/O) I know, I look like an asshole. Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with Morely. Morel growls at her. Sam is about to resume his accident story when, 
JASON Watcha got for us? Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise. Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms. 
SAM New harvest, see whatcha think. (to Morely) What's your problem? Never seen a pretty girl before? Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth. 
JASON/TIM/FRANK (digging out cash) Thanks, man. Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger. Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space. Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved. Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects squarely with his snout. Morely keels back, and Sam snaps him up. 
SAM Sorry, he's not really like this. I'm really sorry. 
GINGER Jus' get'im out! 
SAM I'm really - well, see you guys. And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone. Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door. The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like they're lepers. 
JASON You okay? 
GINGER Yeah. Just hate dogs. They give one another this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises reluctantly. 
GINGER Well. Thanks for the smoke. 
JASON Maybe we could --/ Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun and shoots him. 
GINGER I'll letcha know. Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the van doors open and saunters out. Brigitte :Follows, trying not to laugh. 
INT. SCHOOL CAN - DAY 
Brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls' washroom. She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the last scene. 
BRIGITTE I'll letcha, I'll jus' let-choo know. Bud. .So Ginger. Wanna tell me about you and like, the planet yer currently visiting? No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She smacks her dry lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks from the tap. 
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 36 
GINGER (O/S) Bee-? Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth. Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it stuck. 
GINGER Bee! 
BRIGITTE 
(STARTLED) Yeah! 
GINGER Com'ere-! Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it empty. She giggles and moves to the next one. 
BRIGITTE That smoke fucked me _up._ up. Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages peeled off. she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet paper. The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo, under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted. Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits her on the way in. 
INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY 
Ginger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall. Brigitte has not fully closed the door. Ginger is just as stoned as Brigitte. 
BRIGITTE Geez that's not right. 
GINGER 1 didn't think.

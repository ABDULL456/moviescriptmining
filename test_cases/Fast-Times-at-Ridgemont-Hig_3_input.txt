Spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man. 
EXT./INT. MUSTANG 
on the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger into one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party. But instead, at the moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting to switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected. The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna. There is a silent moment of terror. 
SPICOLI Are you okay? 
There is silence. Outside the smashed car, the Granada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C. 
GRANADA JOCKS Fuck youuuuuuuuuu! 
Then L.C. stirs and utters his first words. 
L.C. My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us. 
SPICOLI Just be glad you're all right. 
L.C. My brother is gonna shit. 
SPICOLI Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us? 
L.C. First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.. 
SPICOLI Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car. 
L.C. You can't fix this car, Spicoli. 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE MUSTANG 
waffled and mangled. It is just inches away from scrap iron. 
SPICOLI I can fix it. 
MONTAGE OF SHOTS 
as we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many signs and placards all over school, proclaiming Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has shown this year. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RIDGEMONT SCHOOL - FLAGPOLE - DAY 
From the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at something. They sadly shake their heads at the sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral. 
As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion. It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE. 
EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT 
The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students. We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more. 
The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader "husbands" sit directly in front of them in the stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit together in another section. 
ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON 
who is again sitting alone in the bleachers. Watching. Several old lunch court friends pass by, on their way to the concession area. 
STUDENT #1 Hey, Brad! How's going? 
BRAD All right. 
STUDENT #2 Where you working? 
BRAD Fish and chips place. 
STUDENT #1 Which one? 
BRAD Just a fish and chips place. 
Brad says nothing more. The students look at each other. 
STUDENTS We'll be seeing you, Brad! 
BRAD (sullen) Later. 
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - THE GAME - NIGHT 
Everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field. Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line. He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing Lincoln player. The ball is snapped, and Charles Jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The Lincoln player is hit and keels over. 
Charles Jefferson sets up for another play. The ball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another Lincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to spare any of them. There is pure madness in his eyes. It has taken him over. 
The Ridgemont points rack up. Jefferson is single handedly maiming Lincoln for Homecoming. 
EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT 
We see Jeff Spicoli and L.C. sitting calmly in the bleachers, watching.

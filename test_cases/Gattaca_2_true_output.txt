EUGENE Let me get it for you. 
Eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the elevator arrives and Jerome quickly wheels him away.  Eugene's head flops to the side as he passes out. 
INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT. 
JEROME unlocks EUGENE's condo and wheels his chair inside.  We see their reflection in a full-length mirror as Jerome pushes Eugene to the bedroom.  After removing Eugene's soiled clothing, he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed. 
EUGENE (maudlin, sobbing like a child) I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
JEROME (attempting to comfort) It's okay, Eugene. 
EUGENE You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car-- 
JEROME --What car?--Go to sleep. 
EUGENE --I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life. 
Jerome looks at Eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his shock at the revelation. 
JEROME It's all right. 
EUGENE (grabbing Jerome by the collar) I'm proud of you, Vincent. 
Eugene's head falls back onto the pillow. 
JEROME (smiling to himself) You must be drunk to call me Vincent. 
But Eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again. Jerome pulls a blanket over him. 
On the verge of leaving, Jerome's attention is drawn to a wall on the far side of the room.  Approaching the wall, near Eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir coming from inside the adjacent condominium.  Jerome contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead - climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium. 
INT.  JEROME'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. 
JEROME fastidiously vacuums with an upright cleaner.  Using a hose attachment he cleans around a picture frame that contains Jerome's original computer keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box. 
INT. GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY. 
In the vast room of COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS we pull-focus to discover that we have been filming the complex through the transparent specimen bag containing JEROME'S EYELASH. 
On the mezzanine floor overlooking the scene of the crime, the INVESTIGATOR holds the bag, transfixed by the lash.  The lead homicide detective, DETECTIVE HUGO, finishes interviewing a GATTACA SECURITY GUARD and approaches the Investigator. A large telescope in the background. 
Although Hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior, his body language betrays his displeasure.  Hugo clearly does not relish the Investigator's involvement in his case. 
DETECTIVE HUGO I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this. 
INVESTIGATOR (gently rebuking his subordinate) A man's dead, Detective. 
DETECTIVE HUGO Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges... 
INVESTIGATOR Grudges? 
DETECTIVE HUGO (looking out over the balcony) I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... (searching for the words) ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives. 
INVESTIGATOR (shaking his head adamantly, referring to the bag in his hand) No, this is your man. 
DETECTIVE HUGO (not so convinced) With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests-- 
INVESTIGATOR --What about his profile? 
Hugo refers to a print-out of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT's profile including his Genetic Quotient.  (The fifteen-year-old photo of Vincent now bears little resemblance to his assumed identity.) 
DETECTIVE HUGO According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes. 
INVESTIGATOR (terse) So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.

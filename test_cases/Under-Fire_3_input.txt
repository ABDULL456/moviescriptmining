EXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Price bounces along, whistling, "San Francisco." An occasional Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past. He strolls up the walkway of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow. 
INT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT 
Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief negotiation of the black market value. 
PRICE (in broken Spanish) Cuanto? 
OLD WOMAN Quince. 
PRICE Veinte. 
OLD WOMAN Diezysiete. 
She shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the room to change the dollar into cordobas. Price idly studies the pictures on the wall: 
PICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN. 
PRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier. 
THE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't heard them enter over the sounds of music and our preoccupation with the pictures. 
PRICE What is this? I'm a journalist! 
No answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge. 
PRICE Journalista, journalista! 
The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it briefly and takes the passport. He nods. 
A rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away. 
As the Guard hauls him outside, the OLD WOMAN appears in the doorway with a stack of local currency. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MILITARY HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 
Price is led into a dark cell where another PRISONER, 50, lies in street clothes on the floor. The Prisoner is spat upon by the Guards and kicked awake. Price cringes. 
GUARD Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta... (in Spanish to Price) Here is a Priest for you to confess your sins. 
The Guards laugh and leave. The Prisoner rises to his feet. Price keeps his distance. The Prisoner looks in bad shape. 
PRISONER PRIEST Cigarillo? 
Price hands him a cigarette and lights it. A long, deep drag. 
PRICE Priest? (the man nods) (in broken Spanish) What are you doing here? 
PRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) The government accused me of using the church to hide Rebels and guns. 
PRICE (in Spanish) Governments are always wrong, eh? 
PRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) This time they're right. Who are you? 
PRICE (in Spanish) Un periodista. 
PRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) Whose side are you on? 
PRICE (in Spanish) I don't take sides. I take pictures. 
PRISONER PRIEST (in Spanish) No sides? 
PRICE (in Spanish) No. 
The Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain. 
PRISONER PRIEST Periodista Puta, todos periodistas son putas. (All journalists are whores) 
The Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is surprised to be treated so despicably. 
PRISONER PRIEST (quietly) Go home. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM 
Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans. The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes. 
FIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone. 
PRICE Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh? Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time magazine. 
The soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion to Price's tone, shouting:

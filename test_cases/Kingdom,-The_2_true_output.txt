146   INT. WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE - CUBICLE - DAY                146 
Fleury, Sykes, Leavitt and Janet sit around Janet's cubicle. Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares. Subpoenas stacked on the corner of Janet's desk. Leavitt quiet, obviously fucked up. 
Grace approaches. 
DIRECTOR GRACE We're going to testify next Tuesday. Fleury's going first. I'm gonna go through it with each of you one on one in advance - make sure we're all on the same page. If they ask if we've talked about this, the answer is unequivocally "No." OK? (beat) You did outstanding work over there. I'm proud of you. You hold your heads high. 
SILENCE from the team. 
DIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D) Ronnie, you ready? 
RONALD FLEURY Yeah. 
Grace turns to leave. Fleury gets up to follow. They head down the hallway. 
ADAM LEAVITT Janet... my dreams are... (beat, intent) What did he whisper to you? 
Confusion from Janet. 
ADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D) In the briefing ... to get you to stop crying about Fran... before any of this... before we even got Airborne? What did he say to you? 
Janet looks up:   Leavitt waiting...

The eight year-old Grandson. Tears in his eyes, standing in front of fresh graves. His AUNT kneels down next to him, tears flowing, in Arabic: 
AUNT Will you tell me what Grandfather whispered to you before they took him? 
He turns to his Aunt...

Leavitt still waiting: 
ADAM LEAVITT Do you remember? 
Janet looks at Leavitt, PAUSES... 
JANET MAYES (ALT: RONALD FLEURY) (reluctantly) He said... "We'll kill them all." (alts: "We will win this." "We will end this." "We will finish this.") 
FLASH TO: 
149    EXT. SUWEIDI GRAVEYARD - SAME MOMENT                       149 
The boy quietly answers, in Arabic: 
GRANDSON "Don't worry: we'll kill them all." 
And in his saucer-wide brown eyes, shrink-wrapped in angry tears, we see the parts of the future that will burn.

Sunlight shines TIGHT ON Fleury's face: stitches the length of his cheek remain. PULL OUT: Fleury and his son throwing a baseball. Lyla watches, standing by a tree. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   136. 
Father and son throwing the ball back and forth. 
KEVIN FLEURY You stop the people that hurt Uncle Fran? 
Fleury stops, just staring at his little son. Tosses back the ball. 
KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) Did you get the bad guys, Daddy? 
Fleury catches the ball, stares at his son. 
TIGHT ON FLEURY: He reaches and pulls his son close, holding him for what might just be forever... (alt: He hands Kevin Al- Ghazi's prayer beads.) 
KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) There's a lot of bad people out there... aren't there, Daddy? 
RONALD FLEURY Yeah, there are... (a beat) But you want to know something? 
KEVIN FLEURY What? 
RONALD FLEURY You're not one of them. (alt: There's a lot of good guys, too)

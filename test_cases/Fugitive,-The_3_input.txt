The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and three other prisoners. Jailers escort them to... 
An Illinois Department of Corrections guard moves alongside, checking the undercarriage with a pole-mounted mirror. 
The GAVEL CRACKS as we -

The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging: 
PRISONER #1 Hey. Illinois penal regulations require a meal for transport rides of four hours or more. 
Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." Checks his watch: 4:00. 
YOUNG GUARD Jack! Feedin' time. 
Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker. 
PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the aisle... 
PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp plastic shank. 
Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank. 
COPELAND Breathe, and you're first. 
Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun carelessly ready. 
Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble doesn't respond. 
YOUNG GUARD Suit yourself. 
He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it. 
Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as... 
KIMBLE Look out! 
Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into Young Guard's gut. 
Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES... 
Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges inside, but... 
Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator. 
The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard. 
EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
As the bus careens off the road, accelerating. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT 
As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat. 
Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes off target as... 
EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT 
The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the bottom of a small ravine. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down. 
On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around at... 
Kimble. Rising between the seats. 
A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head. 
Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to find Kimble. 
OLD GUARD (to Kimble) You. You're a doctor. C'mere. 
He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

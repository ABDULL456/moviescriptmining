What to do now? 
GENE She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph. 
ELEANOR GRANT Of course.  I wish everything were that easy. 
KRISTA I've got the pen if you've got the paper. 
GENE looks at her. She smiles back. 
KRISTA How about that? 
He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, the one MR. SMITH gave him. 
KRISTA Is that something precious? 
GENE No, that's,..that's fine 
He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen. GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the envelope. 
ELEANOR GRANT What's her name? 
GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR. SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt - do it! GENE pulls his eyes away. 
GENE Her name? Her name is Lynn. 
ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket. Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA talking to him. 
KRISTA It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic. 
He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the sweat from his face. 
KRISTA If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble. 
He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where his gun is. 
He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security. There is the hint of a gun on his hip. 
GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is the SECURITY MAN staring at him? 
ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph. 
ELEANOR GRANT Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too. 
GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to stop the shakes. 
The doors open, startling him. 
INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM 
ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and applause. 
GENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH. 
The doors close and the elevator descends. 
INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM 
MR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes. 
MR. SMITH She was right in front of you! What's wrong with you!? 
His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs GENE into a corner, physically terrified. 
MR. SMITH Are you 'fucking with me!? 
GENE The gun... 
MR. SMITH What about the gun? 
GENE It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it. 
MR. SMITH You... 
He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket. 
MR. SMITH You won't get many chances like that, Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Don't blow the next one.

The GUN wielding passenger hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the car, another man methodically waits. \nINT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES \nThe sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for Danny to sleep.

Frustated, she rolls off Derek and onto her side. \nSTACEY Fucking pervert, Dan! \nDANNY There's a black guy outside Der... breaking into your car. \nDerek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and shoves in a clip. \nDEREK How long has he been out there? \nDANNY Not long. \nSTACEY \nWho? \nDEREK Nobody. Relax. \nStacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his black combat boots. \n", "test1_true": "DEREK Not right now, honey. (to Danny) How many? \nDANNY One...I think. \nDEREK Is he strapped? \nDANNY Hunh? \nDEREK Does he have a fucking gun, Dan? \nDANNY I'm not sure. \nDEREK Is there a driver? \nDanny nods his head yes. \nDEREK Okay.

BRONCO - THE OTHER MAN \nStunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway Tranny. Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder. The car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side window. He then walks towards the car and fires shot after shot at it until it disappears. \nINT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - DARKNESS \nDavina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they were in Vietnam.

He listens to the conversation through the the crack in the door as his eyes swell. \nMURRAY (O.S.) I do not have a problem with him as an individual, alright!? \nSWEENEY (O.S.) Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate this kid. \nINT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION \nThe bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48, looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY, who now has his jacket off. \nHe points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF. \"Daniel Vinvard - American History\" is in the upper left hand corner. \nMURRAY This paper is a travesty, Bob! Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero?! You've gotta draw a line. \nSWEENEY Murray...it says in your syllabus that they could do their report on any book related to the struggle for Civil Rights. \nMURRAY Oh come on, Bob! \nSWEENEY Let me finish! He needs help...I'm not disputing that. But I read it and I'm not going to throw him out. \nMURRAY His brother probably put him up to it. \nSWEENEY I can guarantee you his brother didn't have anything to do with it, Murray. \nMurray sighs and takes off his glasses. \nMURRAY Don't let him walk scot-free here. For his sake...not mine. You might be all he has left. \nSweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENS \nMurray walks out and turns back to Sweeney. \nMURRAY Thanks, Bob. \nSWEENEY (O.S.) Okay. Get in here, Dan! \nDanny and Murray make hostile eye contact. \nDANNY I knew it was you. \nSWEENEY (O.S.) Shut up and get your ass in here! \nINT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERS \nBefore he even gets through the door he's chastised. \nSWEENEY What's it gonna be, Dan? \nDANNY What's what going to be? \nSWEENEY This petty shit you're pullin'. \nDANNY Well...I don't know. \nSWEENEY You said it, all right. Sit down. \nDanny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the teenager and leans back in his chair. \nSWEENEY Are you okay? \nDANNY Yeah. \nSWEENEY Any time you wanna talk, Dan-- \nDANNY Okay. \n", "test2_true": "DANNY Fine. \nSWEENEY Adjusting okay? \nDANNY Yeah. \nSWEENEY He was a student of mine. Honors English. He was a great student... like you...but he hung out with scumbags. Also like you. That's why he ended up in the pen, hunh? \nNo answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper. \nSWEENEY Great writing. I can't correct it though. It wreaks too much of shit. \nDANNY Come on, man! I followed directions and wrote an \"A\" paper. It's got nothing to do with Derek. \nSWEENEY Everything you do now has something to do with Derek. Who told you to do this? \nDANNY Let us get on with our lives, man! \nSWEENEY Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he can take care of himself.  I'm worried about his little brother. (softly) Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you! \nDANNY Do it. What?  You don't think I could handle it? \nSWEENEY (smiling in disbelief) The street would kill you, Danny. You're not tough. The second a brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll be holierin' for Doris. (pondering to himself) So here's the drill. Take it or leave it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm your history teacher from here on out. We're gonna deal with shit happening right now. Call it American History...X. I see your ass once a day. Any more, any less, and you're a memory at Venice High. Clear? \nDANNY It took me a week to read Mein Kampf. Come on, Sweeney. \nSWEENEY My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a another paper on my desk tomorrow. \nDANNY What am I doing it on then? \nSWEENEY It'S not a \"what\", it's a \"who.\" (after a beat) Derek. \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. VENICE SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA series of intercuts shows activity in and around the pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster. OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia. A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and boxers. \nTIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk, performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit, recovers, and looks off into the distance. \nDANNY (V/O) People look at me...and they see my brother. That's how things have gone since the murder of our father. \nEXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURT \nFrom afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold glance. \nDANNY (V/O) Little Henry Hastings and his older brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline Crip...Henry's on his way. \nLittle Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing. \nDANNY (V/O) Venice Beach, man. It didn't always look like this. I mean...our Dad used to take us down here to run...and it was cool. Derek fucking owned this place.        Since then though...the gangs, man-- \nTIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he takes a drag off his Marlboro Red. \nDANNY (V/O) --they've moved west from Inglewood and South Central and have really just...taken over. Especially at my high school. The Venice Locos are big too but they hang out in bumluck Mar Vista. It's scary. (then) And then there's The Disciples of Christ. The D.O.C. \nJerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra players and spectators. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACK \nDANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3 blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1 Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better, predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed on his head. \nJEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON. Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on the bleachers. \nLAWRENCE Seven-six. Let's go!  Set some picks! \nSETH Bring it on, boy. \nDerek quickly moves his eyes to the court. \nLAWRENCE Boy? \nLawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers. \nSETH Lucky piece of shit! I'm through \"monkeying\" around with your ass! \nLawrence spins around and challenges Seth. \n", "test2_id": 2476, "test3_input": "LAWRENCE Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating, cracker, motherfucker. A hundred bucks says I make you my bitch. \nSETH (to the crowd) Here we go! Trying to make ends meet for that cut in welfare. \nHe makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline. Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks at him, concerned. \nDANNY It's eight-six, Seth. \nSETH When I want your fucking opinion I'll ask for it, fuckhead. (to Derek and Cam) Help me cover here, guys. \nDerek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose and embarrass them. \nCAMMERON You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid. \nSETH I'll take this negro down. \nDEREK You can't take a shit, Seth.  Shut up. \nDerek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and stands. He shouts for all to hear. \nDEREK I got a bet. \nLawrence stares at him, sensing something harder. \nDEREK I come in, same score now, first one to eleven. Black boys against the white boys. \nLawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief. \nLAWRENCE Name your price, Cracker. \nDEREK No money...for the court. We win, you grab your shit and find a different place to run. Not just today... forever. You win, and we don't come back. No hitching, no fighting, here in front of everyone. Six-eight, our ball. \nThe action around the court gets very still.  Finally, Lawrence nods. \nLAWRENCE You got a lot of fucking balls, man. Bring it. Right now. \nDerek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey. Lawrence gets his team together. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE \nNo more mixed assemblage of players.  One team is white, one team is black. \nA SERIES OF SMOTS \nDerek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket. \nSETH Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish. \nSETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches intently. \nCAMMERON It's all you, Der! \nLAWRENCE Fuckin' BYU, man!  All right!  All we need is one now! \nLawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding competitive boundary. A look filled with rage. \nCAMMERON Use that fat ass and keep him out, Seth! \nSeth and the opposing player bang to get position underneath. \nLAWRENCE I ain't losin' in my house!  Clear it out! \nThe POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court -- his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face, sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS. \nCURTIS That's fuckin' offense! \nLAWRENCE Get the fuck outta here!  He was movin' his feet! \nDerek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down. \nDEREK (threateningly) I'll go if you want to. \nLAWRENCE You wanna piece! Bring it! \nPlayers quickly rush to restrain the two even though the teams hate each other. \nDEREK If you wanna go...I'm ready.  Don't be throwin' fuckin' elbows. \n", "test3_true": "Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip. Cameron stares at Derek. \nCAMMERON Hey.  Are you copacetic? \nDerek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey. \nCAMMERON He's gonna do that 180 spin move. \nDEREK I know what he's gonna do. \nDANNY You gotta call offense on that shit. \nDEREK Not on point game you don't. \nSTACEY Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull that shit. It's fucking- \nDEREK Not on point, honey. \nHe turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence. He stands in front of him and checks the ball in. \nDEREK \nTens! \nLawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT. Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off the fast break and DUNKS IT. \nDANNY (amazed by the dunk) Holy shit! \nEverybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered. Everyone is riveted on Derek. \nSETH (to the other team) Get off my  fucking court!  This is my house! \nDANNY Yeah! Fuck...yeah! \nA sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his bitter opponent, and says nothing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - BY THE COURT \nDerek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off. \nDANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear, and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER. \nDerek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill. Derek meets their gaze. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - PRESENT - DANNY'S POV \nDanny awakens from his daydream. The black players now stare at him. Danny puts his board down and skates down the boardwalk. \nDANNY (V/O) It was only the beginning. (then) Derek once told me that minorities would take America over one day. That white people are too afraid. Maybe he was right. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SMALL BEACH HOUSE - A PATIO \nDanny skates up to the gate and kicks his board up to his hand.  He passes two SURFBOARDS on his way towards the back. \nEXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - TWO 14-YEAR-OLDS \nLIZZY, the redhaired beauty from earlier, and her blond friend KAMMI, sturable out and laugh. They're stoned. \nKAMMI Hey! Danny! \nDANNY (smiling) Hey. LIZZY You're going tonight, right? \nDANNY Where? \nLIZZY That party. Go there. \nThe two young girls giggle and take off. \nINT. TINY, MESSY BEDROOM - SAME \nJASON and CHRIS, two 17-year-old skinheads with shaved heads, prepare to hit the surf. Chris sings to INSTITUTIONALIZED BY SUICIDAL TENDENCIES on the stereo while Jason throws on a ZOG T-SHIRT, the tops of their fullsuits hang down. \nDANNY (O.S) There's dick for waves. \n", "test3_id": 2477}

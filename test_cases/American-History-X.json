{"train": "AMERICAN HISTORY X screenplay by David McKenna February 6, 1997 \nINT. HOUSE - CLOSED EYES \nA young man's blue eyes slowly open.  A girl moans from the next room. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - A LARGE TIRE \nturns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an earlier rain. TUPAC SHAKUR blares from inside. \nINT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE EYES \nThey snap wide as the young woman in the next room MOANS even louder. \nEXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A WET NIGHT \nA slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD BRONCO rests in the driveway. \nEXT. WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM \nTUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car. \nThey move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the car, another man methodically waits. \nINT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES \nThe sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for Danny to sleep. Next to a digital clock that reads 3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side. \nA poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall. Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes scattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner. \nThe off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's attention. He sits up and looks through the blinds. \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME \nDanny SEES a man reach through the broken window and unlock the door. He quickly. pans to the idling Trans Am. \nINT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY \nHis fearful expression says it all. \nDANNY Holy shit. \nDanny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent bedroom down the hall. He barges through the door. \nINT. DEREK'S BEDROOM - A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG \nIt hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant, tome-filled bookshelf. The moans, meanwhile, approach orgasm. \nTIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head, a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade. Danny watches her fuck, only for a second. \nDANNY (softly) \nDer ! \nDanny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek forcefully grabs his little brother's arm. \nDEREK (controlled) \nWhat? \nStacey stops and looks over.  Frustated, she rolls off Derek and onto her side. \nSTACEY Fucking pervert, Dan! \nDANNY There's a black guy outside Der... breaking into your car. \nDerek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and shoves in a clip. \nDEREK How long has he been out there? \nDANNY Not long. \nSTACEY \nWho? \nDEREK Nobody. Relax. \nStacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his black combat boots. \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING \nCops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee. The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly reaches for a file. \nRASMUSSEN All right. Moving on-- (acknowledging) Good Morning, Doctor. \nThe group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare. \nSWEENEY Good morning. \nRASMUSSEN Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney. He's Principal over at Venice High and for some time now he's done a load of outreach work with gangs...in and out of the can. \nSweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.  He sips water and continues. \nRASMUSSEN Three years ago a local kid named Derek Vinyard gets sent up for murdering a couple of Crips who were trying to jack his car. Bob taught Vinyard back in high school and has followed the case closely. \nYOUNG COP He was a skinhead, right? \nSWEENEY Derek was more like...the skinhead. He and Cameron Alexander. \nCOP #2 \nWho? \nRasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view. \nRASMUSSEN Cammeron Alexander is probably the biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in LA County. He promotes white power bands, writes reviews, columns, all at the ripe age of forty. \nYOUNG COP (smiling) He's forty? Jesus. \nRASMUSSEN Pretty clean record...runs everything out of his house down by the beach. \nSWEENEY There weren't any organized white gangs around Venice before those two hooked up. Very few, if any. It was mostly just black and Mexican. But it was tiny. They hit it off though... and Alexander hit the jackpot with Derek. \nRasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR. \nRASMUSSEN We got some uncut footage here. Courtesy of NBC. \nON THE TELEVISION-- \nREPORTER Earlier this evening...LA County Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a suspected Compton drug den. \nRASMUSSEN (to the group) This being February of '90. \nEXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPE \nA YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck, he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera. \nREPORTER To my right I have Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek. (to Derek) How do you feel about all this, son? \nDEREK How do I feel? How do you think I feel? It's typical. \nREPORTER Typical how, Derek? \nDEREK Well...look at our country. It's a haven for criminals. Black...brown... yellow...whatever. \nREPORTER So you're saying the murder of your father is \"race\" related? \nDEREK Every problem in this country is \"race\" related. Every problem, not just crime. These problems are rooted in the black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian...every non- Protestant group in our society. (then) Look at the shit. Immigration... welfare...AIDS...they're all the problems of the non-white. Look at the statistics. \nREPORTER Most of these issues you're referring to though son are related to-- \nDEREK (interrupting) No no no! Don't say poverty right now cause that's not it. They're not a product of our fucking environment either! Minorities don't give two shits about this country! They're here to exploit...not embrace. \nRASMUSSEN (O.S) (over reporter's question) When Alexander got his hands on this segment...he copied it, sent it out and it became the Gettysberg Address for hate groups across the country. \nBACK TO THE TELEVISION. \nDEREK Millions of white Europeans came to this country and flourished within a generation! A generation! So what the fuck is wrong with these people?! \nREPORTER What does any of this have to do with your father? \nDEREK Because my father was doing his fucking job! Saving a nigger neighborhood he didn't give two shits about! And he got killed by some drug dealer who still collects a fucking welfare check. \nDerek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to the reporter who just stands there, speechless. \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME \nRasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and he turns it off. \nDANNY (reading the slip) Oh, man! Come on. Get a job. \nThe teacher stares at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRINCIPAL LOBBY - DANNY \nHe sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR. ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the secretary as she types and talks on the phone. \nTIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through the the crack in the door as his eyes swell. \nMURRAY (O.S.) I do not have a problem with him as an individual, alright!? \nSWEENEY (O.S.) Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate this kid. \nINT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION \nThe bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48, looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY, who now has his jacket off. \nHe points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF. \"Daniel Vinvard - American History\" is in the upper left hand corner. \nMURRAY This paper is a travesty, Bob! Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero?! You've gotta draw a line. \nSWEENEY Murray...it says in your syllabus that they could do their report on any book related to the struggle for Civil Rights. \nMURRAY Oh come on, Bob! \nSWEENEY Let me finish! He needs help...I'm not disputing that. But I read it and I'm not going to throw him out. \nMURRAY His brother probably put him up to it. \nSWEENEY I can guarantee you his brother didn't have anything to do with it, Murray. \nMurray sighs and takes off his glasses. \nMURRAY Don't let him walk scot-free here. For his sake...not mine. You might be all he has left. \nSweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENS \nMurray walks out and turns back to Sweeney. \nMURRAY Thanks, Bob. \nSWEENEY (O.S.) Okay. Get in here, Dan! \nDanny and Murray make hostile eye contact. \nDANNY I knew it was you. \nSWEENEY (O.S.) Shut up and get your ass in here! \nINT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERS \nBefore he even gets through the door he's chastised. \nSWEENEY What's it gonna be, Dan? \nDANNY What's what going to be? \nSWEENEY This petty shit you're pullin'. \nDANNY Well...I don't know. \nSWEENEY You said it, all right. Sit down. \nDanny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the teenager and leans back in his chair. \nSWEENEY Are you okay? \nDANNY Yeah. \nSWEENEY Any time you wanna talk, Dan-- \nDANNY Okay. \nLAWRENCE Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating, cracker, motherfucker. A hundred bucks says I make you my bitch. \nSETH (to the crowd) Here we go! Trying to make ends meet for that cut in welfare. \nHe makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline. Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks at him, concerned. \nDANNY It's eight-six, Seth. \nSETH When I want your fucking opinion I'll ask for it, fuckhead. (to Derek and Cam) Help me cover here, guys. \nDerek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose and embarrass them. \nCAMMERON You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid. \nSETH I'll take this negro down. \nDEREK You can't take a shit, Seth.  Shut up. \nDerek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and stands. He shouts for all to hear. \nDEREK I got a bet. \nLawrence stares at him, sensing something harder. \nDEREK I come in, same score now, first one to eleven. Black boys against the white boys. \nLawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief. \nLAWRENCE Name your price, Cracker. \nDEREK No money...for the court. We win, you grab your shit and find a different place to run. Not just today... forever. You win, and we don't come back. No hitching, no fighting, here in front of everyone. Six-eight, our ball. \nThe action around the court gets very still.  Finally, Lawrence nods. \nLAWRENCE You got a lot of fucking balls, man. Bring it. Right now. \nDerek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey. Lawrence gets his team together. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE \nNo more mixed assemblage of players.  One team is white, one team is black. \nA SERIES OF SMOTS \nDerek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket. \nSETH Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish. \nSETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches intently. \nCAMMERON It's all you, Der! \nLAWRENCE Fuckin' BYU, man!  All right!  All we need is one now! \nLawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding competitive boundary. A look filled with rage. \nCAMMERON Use that fat ass and keep him out, Seth! \nSeth and the opposing player bang to get position underneath. \nLAWRENCE I ain't losin' in my house!  Clear it out! \nThe POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court -- his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face, sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS. \nCURTIS That's fuckin' offense! \nLAWRENCE Get the fuck outta here!  He was movin' his feet! \nDerek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down. \nDEREK (threateningly) I'll go if you want to. \nLAWRENCE You wanna piece! Bring it! \nPlayers quickly rush to restrain the two even though the teams hate each other. \nDEREK If you wanna go...I'm ready.  Don't be throwin' fuckin' elbows. \nINT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON SETH \nHe points his Glock 9mm at the mirror. \nSETH Drop the t.v., nigger. \nHe laughs to himself and exits. \nINT. HALLWAY - SETH CONTINUED \nHe bangs on Derek's door once more, pissed that Derek didn't open it earlier. He heads for the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUE TV ACTION \nDanny, Davina, and Doris are glued to the news story on the same station. Doris, once beautiful, is now aged and graying. NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION CONTAINERS, and a spoon rest on the coffee table. \nTIGHT ON THE TELEVISION. A WELL-DRESSED BLACK WOMAN speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story. Random black protestors nod and comment in the background. \nBLACK WOMAN Maybe now whites will understand the motives behind people like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers.  Just put the shoe on the other foot. \nFLASH TO: \nEXT. CHINO PRISON - THE VINYARDS ON NEWS FOOTAGE \nDanny walks' towards Derek and they smile and hug.  Davina and Doris soon join in. \nDavina \nBLACK WOMAN (V/O) Derek Vinyard deserved the death penalty for what he did to that young man! And now he walks the street as free as you and I. \nDANNY {to the tv) What about OJ, bitch!? \nINT. VINYARD HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE TV \nThe news segment winds down. \nBLACK WOMAN (fed up, to the camera) They've done it to us again. \nA hand reaches over to turn the channel. IT'S SETH. Doris, in an awful state, lays back down. \nTIGHT ON SETH. Tattoos cover his forearms. A BLOODY SNAKE is halfway tucked under his rolled-up sleeves. \nSETH Nigger lovin' Jew media calling the shots. Watch cartoons. It's the only t.v. that's safe nowadays. \nDORIS No one's safe--until we all are. \nSeth looks at the woman like she's from another planet. He laughs and goes into the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - SETH'S POV \nHe looks through the fridge but finds nothing. He closes the door and looks at the family pictures on the door. \nA FAMILY SHOT of Doris, Derek, Danny, Davina, and DENNIS VINYARD in front of church. Seth appreciates Dennis in a coat and tie. Below that, a picture of a dirty and rugged Dennis and a young Davina, wearing her father's FIRE HELMET. Danny with Doris. \nSETH Come in here, Dan. \nINT. SMALL KITCHEN - SAME \nHe sits and comes upon Davina's revealing CROTCH. She studies and so does he. Danny walks in the kitchen and looks through the fridge. He pulls out a leftover piece of steak and gnaws on it. Seth looks over at Dan \nSETH Where the fuck you find that? \nDANNY Goin' to Cam's party tonight? \nSETH Is Davina's ass water tight? \nDanny laughs. \nDAVINA Hurry up and leave, Goodyear.  You've taken your dump now go. \nSETH Listen to you. You callin' me a blimp, you fuckin' Democrat?! \nDAVINA Yes! I am! \nDanny takes a bite and laughs at Seth. \nDANNY I'm there tonight. \nSETH Oh yeah? You ask Derek? \nDANNY I don't know.  I feel threatened by them. \nDAVINA They feel threatened by you! \nSETH (ignoring her) What else, Danny? And speak intelligently you little queer faggot. \nDavina's attention is rapt on her little brother. \nDANNY I hate the fact that it's cool to be black these days. \nSETH Good. DANNY I hate this hip hop influence on white fuckin' suburbia. \nSETH \nGood! \nDANNY I hate Hilary Clinton and all of her Zionist MTV pigs telling us we should get along. Save the rhetorical bullshit honey, it ain't gonna happen. \nSeth looks at the young man.  He smiles at him with distinct revelation. \nSETH That's the best shit I've ever heard come out of that mouth. \nTIGHT ON DAVINA. She stares at the two hate mongers. \nDAVINA I feel.sorry for you, Danny. \nSETH Shut up, Davina. \nDAVINA You shut up, you poison to fuckin' society! Get out of our house! \nSETH (laughing) Is this any way to treat a guest? \nDAVINA Derek hates you, Seth. \nDEREK (O.S.) How do you know who I hate, Davina? \nTIGHT ON DEREM VINYARD - SILENCE. \nHe's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt and tats hanging down his arm. A black jacket wraps around his waist. \nDAVINA (O.S) What do you mean? \nSeth stands and smiles. \nSETH Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin' A. Long time no see. Look at that hair. \nSeth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a reluctant hand instead. \nDEREK Gimme just one second, okay? \nSeth nods as Derek stares at Danny. \nDEREK Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf? \nDANNY What's it to you? \nDEREK (ready to kill) What's it to me? \nDANNY (seeing this) I mean...how'd you find out? \nDEREK None of your fucking business how I found out. \nSETH I thought it was a great idea. \nDEREK That figures.  You're more stupid than he is. \nSETH It's nice to see you too, man. \nDEREK Why'd you do it, Dan?  Because of Seth. \nDANNY No. \nDEREK Cammeron? \nDANNY I did it cause I felt like it. \nDEREK Oh, you do everything you feel like? I feel like smacking you in the fucking head. Would you mind if I did a report on that? \nDANNY Uhhh...yeah. \nDEREK I'll see ya. \nDORIS Okay. Be careful. \nDEREK \nI will. \nDerek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW and goes down the alley. \nINT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS \nShe thinks to herself and closes her eyes. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK \nDerek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted windows, it cruises past the apartment complex. \nINT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK \nCUT TO: \nDanny's attention is everywhere except on his homework. \nDANNY This sucks. \nHe walks back out of his bedroom. \nINT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DANNY'S POV \nHe watches Davina complete her homework on the couch. Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep. \nDANNY Hey. \nDAVINA Hey what? \nDANNY Come here. \nDAVINA \nWhat!? \nDANNY Come here for a second! \nThe scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently follows him down the hall. \nINT. BEDROOM - TWO SINGLE BEDS \nShe sits on the edge of DANNY'S bed.  Danny hands her his assignment instructions. \nDAVINA I got shit to do, Dan. \nDANNY Just read it. \nShe sighs and begins to read it out loud. \nDAVINA \"American History X? Take home paper as assigned by Principal Robert Sweeney?\" (to Danny) Why is he giving you homework? What happened to Murray? \nDANNY Asshole turned me in. \nDAVINA Why? \nDANNY Just read. \nDAVINA \"Describe in detail your opinion of -the historical event that took place in the early morning of October 4th, 1993.\" What's that? \nDANNY The night Derek wasted those guys. \nDavina takes a moment. \nDAVINA Sweeney gave you this? \nDANNY \nYep. \nDAVINA (continuing her reading) \"Before and after...how has this event helped or hurt your present perspective concerning life in contemporary America. Use the standard five paragraph format, blab blab blah--this'll be good for you.. \nDANNY Nooo...it'll be good for you. \nDEREK Are you ready to do something about it? \nET AL Yeah. \nDEREK Okay then. \nAND THEY'RE MOVING.  In formation.  Fast.  Directly at us.    Angry. \nAs the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING MASK. He pulls it down over his face. \nThe foot soldiers follow him in unison. \nDEREK (back to his troops) Remember. No names. Danny?  Stay right on my fucking ass, man. \nAnd now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA SWINGS behind them, we see their destination. \nEXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME \nThey storm the front entrance. The few people who are in there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth catches up to another and gets him on the ground. \nSETH Wheto's your fucking green card, asshole? \nSeth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman alone like she's not even there and pushes over an adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF BEANS. \nDEREK (referring to the border) Can't hide from me, motherfucker! \nHe kicks the man and looks around the market for more. Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a shelf of POTATO CHIPS. \nDEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors. \nINT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER \nHe rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and-- FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like he's Superman. \nDerek looks to his watch and straightens up. \nDEREK Let's go! We're outta here!  Move ! \nFrom just inside the door we see skins get in their last blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR; \nINT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY \nHe takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone- faced brother. \nDANNY (V/O) And before Derek could even blink...he had a crazed army behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - PRESENT - THE COMPUTER \nDanny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen. \nDANNY (V/O) Willing to follow his word like it was the word of God. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nAs the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey sits close to Derek. \nDANNY (V/O) And then came October 4th, 1993. \nINT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM \nDoris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard, shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away. \nDANNY (V/O) Things were fine on the homefront. My Mom had a good job but a below average boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom house that Dad left us with. Everyone was happy. \nTIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos, loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall. \nDANNY (V/O) Everyone but Derek. \nDEREK Fuck you, Murray. White men don't cruise the streets of LA killing each other. \nMURRAY No.  You guys make bombs. \nDerek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide. \nDEREK You're so fucking lame. A couple of cranks in cabins in Montana is not statistically significant. (then) White Americans don't take PCP and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over and trust the law. \nDAVINA You couldn't tell. \nA RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door. \nDORIS Find an apartment because I want you out of here. \nDEREK Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's-- \nDORIS I don't wanna hear it anymore!  I want you out! \nSTACEY He can move in with me. \nDORIS When? \nSTACEY Tomorrow. \nDORIS Good. \nShe walks past Derek and into the back bedroom. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT \nHe rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down. From the other room, he hears Doris break into another coughing fit. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY \nHe sits beside her and hands her a glass of water. \nDANNY Here. \nDORIS Thank you, honey. \nShe coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away. \nDORIS Hey. Come here.  Sit with me. \nDANNY I've got this thing to do. \nDORIS You can sit down for two seconds. \nHe looks at her and sits beside her. \nDANNY Don't breathe on me. \nDORIS I won't. \nThey share a smile. \nDANNY It's cold in here, no wonder your sick. \nShe stares and smiles at him for a few moments. \nDANNY What? \nDORIS What? I'm not allowed to look at you anymore? \nHe smothers her face with his hand, jokingly. \nDANNY No. You're not. \nDORIS (laughing) Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you ever gonna let that beautiful hair grow back? \nDANNY Nope. Never. \nDORIS I bet you will. \nHe smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room. \nDANNY Get some sleep. \nDORIS If you need me to proof anything for you I will. \nDANNY I'll be all right. \nDORIS Wake up early if you get tired. \nDoris watches him disappear down the hall, distant thoughts creeping back slowly. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nINT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S EYES \nThey clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the sentence \"There might have been if I testified.\" Only when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He continues typing. \nDANNY (V/O) (continuing) Over the next year we'd lose our house and the rest of our father's pension to attorney fees. My mother...much to all of our surprise...stood by Derek. \nDanny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door. \nINT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV \nHe looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door. \nJASON We're here, dude. \nCHRIS Drop your dick and grab your stick. \nDANNY I told you I can't tonight. \nDORIS (O.S.) (from the couch) Danny? \nDANNY It's okay, Mom. \nThe two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards back to his bedroom.  He shuts his bedroom door. \nINT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME \nDanny looks at the two. \nDANNY If I don't finish this thing I'm dead. \nCHRIS Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow. You can't miss the party. \nJASON Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to grab your ass. \nDANNY She did? \nCHRIS (nodding) You gotta hit that shit.  It's the only fun thing that's legal anymore. \nThe PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it. \nDANNY Hello? \nINT.  DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY \nThe only illumination shines through the window from the street.  Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk phone, all packed up and almost out the door. \nSWEENEY Dan? \nDANNY (O.S.) Yeah? \nSWEENEY Dr.  Sweeney. \nINTERCUT THE CONVERSATION \nDANNY (worried) What's going on? \nSWEENEY Nothing here. Is everything all right over there? \nDANNY Everything's fine. \nSWEENEY How's it comin'? \nDANNY I'm doing it right now. \nCMRIS Who is it, dude? \nDANNY (covering the receiver) It's Sweeney. \nCHRIS Who?! Why is he calling here!?  Fuck you, Sweeney! Asshole! \nJASON (grabbing the receiver) Get a fucking job, you reggie! \nDanny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends. \nDANNY You fuckers are going to get me booted! (into the receiver) Dr. Sweeney? I'm sorry, man. \nChris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a picture of O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the kids. Derek walks in. \nCHRIS Yo!  What's up, Fat Seth!? \nSeth throws Chris against the wall. \nSETH I'm not fat, cockwart!  I'm husky! \nCMRIS Okay! I'm sorry, bro! \nDANNY Take it easy, dude! \nSeth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt.  Chris and Jason stare at him like he's gonna hurt him. \nDANNY What're you doin'?! \nDEREK Your brother's a piece of shit! \nSeth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny. Seth mixes into the party and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins. Danny follows Seth towards the keg. \nDEREK'S POV. He analyzes the crowd.  Quickly, Chris recognizes him. \nCHRIS Holy shit.

Mr St John' face hardens. 
MRS ST JOHN (coldly) I'm a professional lady Mr Darwin. I don't do party tricks. 
DARWIN I am a professional man. And I asking for no more than I ask of all my colleagues - a demonstration of competence. 
MRS ST JOHN It is you who are here to be tested, Sir, not me. 
DARWIN Then I am sorry to have wasted your time. 
He puts his jacket back on and heads for the door. 
121   INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.                                       121 
Mrs St John follows him. As he reaches for the doorhandle, and opens it, she says: 
MRS ST JOHN She's with you, you know that. 
Darwin turns. 
MRS ST JOHN Your little girl. I saw her from the window standing at the top of the steps. 
DARWIN How dare you. 
MRS ST JOHN Pardon? 
DARWIN ...prey on people's grief like this. 
MRS ST JOHN I have done no such thing. 
DARWIN (furious) Do you take me for an idiot? Clearly Gully has appraised you of my history. 
MRS ST JOHN I beg to inform you he did no such thing! 
DARWIN It is chicanery of the very lowest order and I despise it utterly! 
MRS ST JOHN Get out. 
122   EXT. THE HOUSE. DAY                                           122 
Darwin steps outside and she slams the door on him. Darwin continues to rant at the closed door, standing in the pouring rain without his umbrella. 
He gets to the top of the steps, and looks around, trying to get his bearings. 
In a pool of lamp-light at the far end of the street a figure stands watching him. 
Darwin squints at her through the rain, which is falling harder now. 
The figure is Annie. 
She looks at him crossly, then heads off up a cobbled side- street. 
Darwin follows. 
123   EXT. MALVERN. SIDE STREETS. VARIOUS. NIGHT                    123 
Darwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes. 
DARWIN Annie. Annie! 
The rain is getting heavier, turning the gutters into rivers. 
Water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the cobbles, making them slick and treacherous. 
Darwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys, the sound of rushing water echoing all around, the little girl always ahead of him. 
A DRUNK MAN in oilskins comes barreling past him, head down, cursing the weather. 
A child's ball goes floating downhill in the current. 
Darwin loses Annie, then he sees her again, at the top of a steep flight of stone steps. 
Darwin, drenched chases after her.

PUPKIN approaches the STAGE MANAGER. 
PUPKIN (to STAGE MANAGER) I'm the King. 
STAGE MANAGER (smiling) What can I do for you, your highness? 
CATHY LONG passes by.     She spots PUPKIN, and walks swiftly over. 
CATHY LONG What are you doing here, Mr. Pupkin?!?!

The lights are dimmed. Music is playing on the phonograph. Two candles burn on the elegantly-set dinner table. MARSHA stands in the middle of the room, in front of LANGFORD. She is singing. LANGFORD is still encased in tape. 
MARSHA (singing to the music) "I'm gonna love you, Like no one's ever loved you, Come rain or come shine, Happy together, unhappy together, And won't it be fine."

Now PUPKIN stands before PATTEN, held by PLAINCLOTHESMEN who frisk him and hand PATTEN the autograph book. GIARDELLO stands next to PATTEN. 
PATTEN (to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN) I hope you brought me the right guy this time. (to PUPKIN) Where's Jerry Langford? 
PUPKIN (to GIARDELLO) Are you on the show? 
PATTEN No, Mr. King. That's my assistant, Mr. Giardello. 
PUPKIN I want to see someone on the show. 
PATTEN Well, you tell us where Mr. Langford is and we'll let you see anyone you want. 
PUPKIN Just get me someone from the show. 
PATTEN starts browsing through the autograph book. 
PATTEN Come on, Mr. King. Let's not fool around. (looking up from the book) Should we know about any of these people? 
PUPKIN (gesturing to the book) That's Orson Bean. 
PATTEN I see.   (to GIARDELLO)   Check these out. 
GIARDELLO starts looking through the autograph book. 
PATTEN Now are you going to talk to us, or not? 
PUPKIN Sure I'll talk. Just get me someone from the show. 
PATTEN (to GIARDELLO) Get that Thomas guy in here. 
GIARDELLO leaves. 
PATTEN We haven't much time, Mr. King. 
PUPKIN looks towards the door. 
PATTEN Let's start with your name. 
PUPKIN Rupert Pupkin. 
PATTEN That's your real name? 
PUPKIN Yes sir. 
PATTEN You an American? 
PUPKIN Yes. 
PATTEN Then why do you people do these things? 
THOMAS enters.   He scrutinizes PUPKIN. 
PUPKIN Are you on the show? 
THOMAS Yes.   I'm Bert Thomas. 
PUPKIN pulls thin piece of neatly typewritten paper from his inside jacket and hands it to THOMAS. 
PUPKIN Here's the introduction to my act. Please make sure Mr. Randall follows it exactly as I've written it. 
PATTEN nods to THOMAS who takes the paper and reads it as he leaves. 
PATTEN Okay.   How about helping us, Mr. King? 
PUPKIN What about make-up?   I need make-up. 
PATTEN (to PLAINCLOTHESMEN) Put some color in his cheeks.

Hope you got some Partagas in that rust bucket, Sal. \nEXT.-EDGE OF SPACE \nTHE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere. \nPILOT \nI brought you the most amazing... \nAmazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire. \nEXT.- MARS \nLOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME, BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed. \nINT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER \nPOV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast. Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash. \nEXT.-CARGO SHIP \nThe pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull. \nWIDER \nTwo sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship, FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire. \nA BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN. \nINT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER \nA lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider. \nThe harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome, intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST. \nWEST \nSino-Jordanian Raiders. They're claiming the cargo ship violated their air-space. \nINT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER \nAnother pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING towards the assault craft just below West's. \nJEB \nThis cold war's heating up. Where did they come from? \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \nWEST \nHell. And we're going to send them back screaming. \nWest activates his targeting computer. \nWEST \nLast one to kill a bad guy buys the beer. \nTARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS. \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \nWest closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent surface of the bubble glass under West's feet. \nWEST \nWhat's that sound? must be the fat lady warming up. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction, heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken. \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \nWest doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships heading straight for each other. \nWEST \nThat's right. Come on, come on, you wanna play, I wanna play. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nWEST \nI can hear her.

The curtain's coming down. Sing you fat, old bag, sing! \nWest hits the firing stud. \nEXT.-DEEP SPACE \nWest's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead, the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him. \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \n(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the blackness of space and the starfield beyond. \nMajor West, your ship is not equipped for rescue. You are not authorized to jeopardize this asset. That is a direct order. Acknowledge! \nWest slams a switch, deactivating his radio. \nWEST \nNever liked that station, anyway. \nHe BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nJeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below. \nOverhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle. \nINT.-3EB'S FIGHTER \nThe canal floor is rushing up fast. \nCOMPUTER \nImpact in five seconds. \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nDon is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below. \nCOMPUTER \nWarning. Proximity alert. \nWEST \nJeb, I'm going to give you a little kiss. Don't take it the wrong way. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nWest angles his ship directly under Jeb. \nINT.-JEB'S FIGHTER \nThe expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship. \nJEB \nDon, abort. Abort. \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nJeb's fighter is visible overhead. \nWest going up. Don angles the throttle. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nDon's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter, angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust. \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nJEB (OVER) \nDoes this mean we're going steady? \nWest pulls his throttle all the way back. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nWest shoots up and out towards the dark of space. \nWEST (OVER) \nYou weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy. \nThe rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base. \nCUT TO: \nCHAPTER 2: Mission Objectives \nIMAGES-CLOSE.

MAUREEN ROBINSON stands, talking with a PRINCIPAL who in less than happy. \nPRINCIPAL \nHe hacked our main power grid to run his experiment. The school was in chaos. We didn't even have lights. \nThe room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body. \nMaureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously glancing behind couches, into cabinets. \nPRINCIPAL (OVER) \nHe never showed, huh? \nWILL \nMaybe if I had actually broken the time barrier he would have paid attention. \nPENNY \nDon't let him get to you, kiddo.

Ground me? \nCHAPTER 4: Major West \nINT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR \nJohn and the General walk the metal passageway. \nJOHN \nWe're lucky they didn't press on Daniels, condition. \nGENERAL \nI figured a chance to look at the ship would keep the dogs at bay. \nJOHN \nBen, I'm worried about jamming in a replacement pilot at the last second. My family' a on this mission. I need someone who's more than just spit and polish. \nGENERAL \nI've got your man. He just doesn't know it yet. \nThe General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal... \nINT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS \nA figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated. \nGENERAL \nAt ease, Major. \nWEST \nSir, why was I pulled off active duty? I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll fight a court martial, General. \nGENERAL \nDo you know Professor Robinson? \nWEST \nBy reputation only. \n(to John) \nYour father's battle strategies were required reading at the Academy. \nGENERAL \nHow much do you know about the Jupiter Mission, Major? \nWEST \nThe Jupiter is fully automated. The pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's a baby sitting job, sir. \nGENERAL \nMajor, you are aware Earth's resources are severely limited. \nWEST \nEvery schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment. Sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages. \nGENERAL \nWhat I am about to tell you is classified. Every schoolchild has been lied to. The recycling technologies have failed. In less than two decades Earth will be unable to support human life. \nGENERAL \nWe spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. We partnered with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government. The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as well as we do. They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, I guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons like us. our crops will wither. We will be left to die. \nWEST \n...Captain Daniels doesn't have the flu, does he sir? \nGENERAL \nDaniels was murdered in his apartment last night. The flu story is a cover we fed the press. \nWEST \nDan was a good pilot. A good man. \nGENERAL \nYour rescue stunt over Mars was foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major. \nWEST \nI had a friend in trouble. \nGENERAL \nYou endangered a one billion dollar spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order because of a friend? \nWEST \nYes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir. \nJOHN \nHe'll do. \n(stepping forward) \nGENERAL \nCongratulations Major, you're the new pilot of the Jupiter mission. \nCHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith \nEXT.-DESERT-DAY \nSun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN. \nMAN \nPerhaps a brief jaunt down memory lane is required. I was contracted to provide Daniels, apartment code. My work is done. \nBUSINESSMAN \nShe heads toward the readouts. West turns to John. \nWEST \nThat's one cold fish I'd love to thaw. \nJUDY \n(turning) \nI'm not going to make it home for dinner, Dad. \nWest turns to John.

Around it hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles. \nMAUREEN (OVER) \nHe won first prize again. He practically brought down his entire school. But he won first prize. \nMaureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John. \nJOHN \nA non-working prototype for his time machine. Sharp stuff for a midget. \nMaureen is silent. \nJOHN \nI'm sorry about dinner. I had to work late. The new pilot-. \nMAUREEN \nWhat you had to do was prioritize your family over the mission \nJOHN \nMaureen. This mission is about our family. So we can stay together \nMAUREEN \nThe perfect nuclear family. The most stable social unit, ideally suited for the isolation of a long journey into space. It's all just PR, John. You're never home. Judy is becoming a ghost just like you. Penny can't see past her own navel and Will has to black out-his school, just to get his father's attention. The perfect nuclear family in ruin. \nJohn stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair. \nJOHN \nI know, Maureen. I'm scared too. \nA beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close. \nINT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT \nJohn stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags. \nWIDER \nWill lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat.

Smith. \nSmith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device. \nSMITH \nYou'll forgive me if I forgo the kiss, my sleeping behemoth. \nSmith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad. \nSMITH \nBut the time has come to awake. \nROBOT \nRobot is on-line. Reviewing primary directives. One, preserve the Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship systems. Three \nSMITH \nSpare me the chatter. \nSmith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again. \nSMITH \nWhat noble charges my steely centurion. Sadly I fear you have far more dire deeds in store for you. \nSmith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch. \nROBOT \nRobot is on-line. Reviewing primary directives. Two hours into mission destroy Robinson family. Destroy all systems. \nSmith smiles. Removes the re-programming module. \nSMITH \nNow that's more like it. Farewell my tin-plated pal. Give my regards to oblivion. \nSmith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL. \nINT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE \nSmith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link. \nMajor, your escape vector in clear of all military and commercial traffic.

He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS \nSmith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm. \nHe spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits a stud. The blast shield opens. Space. \nSMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words. \nTHE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up, lights activating as his CPU comes on line. \nSMITH \nNo. \nSmith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot. \nSMITH \nDisable program. \nNo response. The Robot continues to power up. \nSmith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down. \nROBOT \nRobot. Return to your docking bay and power down. \nROBOT \nCommand accepted. \nThe Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in amazement.

Maureen grabs an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny. \nMAUREEN \nPulse, respiration and bleeding- \nPENNY \nBasic triage, lock down and stabilize. I know the drill. \nJohn is standing, helps Don to his feet. \nWEST \nNEXT picnic, no robots. \nDon moves fast to the helm.

Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it. \nBURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature seared into his flesh. \nWEST \nSino-Jordanian technology. You're a Goddamned spy. \n(realizing) \nYou did this. \nDon slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens. \nSMITH \nStop.

It has a tendency to spook the patients. \nMAUREEN \n(to Smith) \nThank you. \nSmith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like. \nSMITH \nYou are a good woman, Maureen. Any man could see that. I hope I have proven the well-being of your family is of great importance to me. Perhaps, if you convinced your husband to trust me... \nMaureen stares at him. A beat.

The area around the Jupiter Two is now filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system. \nJOHN \nSee anything familiar? \nDon just shakes his head. \nCOMPUTER \nSearching for recognizable constellations. \n(a beat) \nUnable to locate. \nJOHN \nThis computer has star maps of the entire known galaxy. \nPENNY \nWe're lost, aren't we? \nJudy wraps her arm around her sister. \nWEST \nWhat the hell is that? \nVIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal. \nJOHN \nAny effect on the ship? \nWEST \nNo. \nVIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the portal appear to be in different places. \nJOHN \n(off the navigational hologram) \nAll the planets have moved. \nWEST \nAnd where did that come from? \nCHAPTER 12: The Proteus \nEXT.-SPACE \nBreaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle catches the light from the dual suns. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe crew man their stations.

Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor. \nTHE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery. \nDon pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside. \nINT.-HYDROPONICS LAB \nA jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don. \nWEST \nThis explains where all the plants came from. \nJUDY \nGrowth like this would take decades. \nThe Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw. \nSMITH \nUnhand me, you mechanical moron. \nDon's eyes fix behind Smith's head. \nWEST \nDon't move. \nSMITH \nI am sick of your terrorism. If you are going to kill me, be done with it. Otherwise I will insist you treat me with the respect and- \nWEST \n(like steel) \nI said don't move. \nSmith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he pulls from its hiding place a small creature. \nAbout the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWill is watching through the Robot's eyes. \nWILL \nNeat. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN \nWest stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more friendly blue. Judy approaches. \nJUDY \nWell, who do we have here? \nAs the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like, trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast. \nWEST \nEasy there, little buddy. No one's going to hurt you. \nSMITH \nHow do you know it won't hurt us? \nDon has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds. \nJUDY \nLooks like you've made a friend. You have a good bedside manner, Major. \nWEST \nI'm going to let that one go. \nSMITH \nHow charming. Doctor Dolittle of outer space. \nJUDY \nWhere do you think it came from? \nJOHN \nIt's possible this is one of the creatures represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It must have been their ship attached to the other docking ring. \nThe beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there, burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH. \nWEST \nIt looks like a child. \nSMITH \nIf so, my dear Major, what do you suppose happened to its parents? \nJOHN \nLet's get back to the bridge. \nAs they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the background. Ominous. Unseen. \nCHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders! \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nPenny is still hanging overhead. \nPENNY \nI think I've got it. \nThe sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor. \nMAUREEN \nThat's strange. \nSCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with ambient heat. Penny lands beside her. \nPENNY \nThose scales are giving off heat. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE \nJohn is at the Com. \nJOHN \nI've tapped into the internal sensor array. Besides us, this ship is totally deserted. \nSMITH \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the wake of the fusion drives. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nCOMPUTER (OVER) \nWarning. Inner hull breach in twenty seconds. \nJOHN \nGive them a little encouragement. \nWEST \nElectrifying outer hull ... now. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive. \nThe spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of the giant probe ship. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the giant probe ship. \nJOHN \nGet us out of here. Fast. \nDon looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls. \nJOHN \nWhat are you doing? \nWEST \nNever leave an enemy stronghold intact. One of your father's first rules of engagement. \nDon hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD. \nJOHN \nDon, stop. That's a direct order. We might need to salvage- \nWEST \nThis is a military emergency. That means I'm in command. \nJOHN \nDon, no. I'm ordering you- \nWEST \nI hate spiders. \nDon hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD. \nWEST \nHang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy ride. \nDon angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's engines begins to glow. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow, venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star. \nTHE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders. \nTHE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship is buffeted by the shock wave. \nWEST \nI can't hold her. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nDon is struggling to keep control. \nWEST \nWe're going down. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD. \nWEST \nCan't get the stabilizers on line. \nJOHN \nPull up. Pull up. \nWEST \nReally? No kidding? Thanks. \nWINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A GIANT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE. \nDon banks the controls. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWEST \nI'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm going to try and make it. \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE \nThe Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe surface is coming up fast. \nWEST \nGot to slow us down. \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE \nThe Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice, three times across the alien sea. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWEST \nWILL \nBut I downloaded your neural net. \nROBOT \nRobot tried to destroy the Robinson family. Why would Will Robinson save Robot's personality? Your actions do not compute. \nWILL \nI guess sometimes friendship means acting with your heart, not your head. \nROBOT \nLogic error. Friendship does not compute. \nWILL \nDon't worry, Robot. Im going to build you a new body. I promise. \nWill turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of the ship. He lifts a circular bubble of diodes. Smiles. \nWILL \nMom always said I should try to make new friends. \nCHAPTER 15: Follow Orders! * return to CHAPTER \nINT.-BRIDGE \nMaureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don. \nMAUREEN \nThe atmosphere here can sustain human life. I've located 500 Rads radioactive material a mile north. \nJOHN \nThat's at least what we'd need to get the core functioning again. \nJohn looks out the viewscreen at the alien night. Turns to Don. \nJOHN \nWe'll set off at daybreak. it'll be safer. Those are my orders, Major. \nWEST \nI agree with your recommendation, Professor. \nMAUREEN \nD\u008etente is a beautiful thing. \nINT.-SICK BAY \nJudy examines the lizard monkey. Penny strokes the tiny creature, producing a string of BLIPS. \nPENNY \nWhat's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it cowboy or ballerina on Halloween? \nJUDY \nRight now she's a girl. But I think your little pal here is from a self-replicating species. At different stages of life she, or he, probably alternates sexes. \nPENNY \nImagine the savings on dating outfits alone. \nThe tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner. \nPENNY \nCan I keep her? \nJUDY \nPenny, you've never taken care of a thing in your life besides yourself. \nPENNY \nPlease. She's all alone. I promise I'll look after her. She needs me. \nJUDY \n...The moment you misplace her, or forget to feed her, we leave her on this planet where she can live in the wild. I'm not kidding Penny. \nAnd with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature. \nPENNY \nWe're both a long way from home, aren't we little one? \nThe creature makes a tiny BLIP. \nPENNY \nThat's what we'll call you. Blip. \nBlip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist. \nPENNY \nYou like that? \nPenny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek. \nPENNY \nNice girl. Pretty girl. Nice. \nThe creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying to imitate Penny's words of comfort. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nJudy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling. \nCHAPTER 16: Alien World \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB \nDon shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed security panel in the wall. \nSMITH \nRemove that lock this instant. I shall not be caged like some animal \nWEST \n(lethal) \nI gave my word I'd let you live. I never said for how long. \nSMITH \nThese quarters will be fine. \nSmith stares at him a beat. \nSMITH \nTell me, Major West. Are you really confident in Robinson's ability to guide us? If I were set free, I would support your right to command. With minimal force, we could take this ship and assure this mission continues under your leadership. \nWEST \n...My God Smith, you're right. How could I have been so blind? I'll just run and get you a gun so we can hijack the ship. Okay? \nSMITH \nMaureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles. \nJOHN \nWhat? \nMAUREEN \nIt's nice to have our family under one roof. Even if we had to go half way across the galaxy to manage it. \nJohn presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles. \nJOHN \nHow would you feel about a little late night tutorial, Professor? \nJohn moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME. \nMAUREEN \nMm. That's new. What are you doing? \nJOHN \nGoing for extra credit. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT \nThe ship sits on the alien landscape. \nMAUREEN (OVER) \nGood night John. \nJOHN (OVER) \nGood night Maureen. \nWILL (OVER) \nGood night Judy. \nPENNY (OVER) \nGood night Will. \nJUDY (OVER) \nGood night Penny. \nWEST (OVER) \nYou guys have got to be kidding. \nCHAPTER 17: The Core \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING \nWill comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen. \nWILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock. \nWILL \nOh man. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nA giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship. Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees. \nINT.-BRIEFING ROOM \nThe crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes. \nPENNY \nWhat are those rumblings? They've been happening all morning. \nJUDY \nHow can half the landscape have grown up overnight? \nJOHN \nOkay, let's get settled. Maureen? \nMAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates that make up this world appear mismatched. \nMAUREEN \nIt's impossible. But this planet's geothermic plates don't match up. \nJOHN \nI was afraid of this. \nAl1 eyes turn to John. \nJOHN \nI think these tremors are the result of opening and closing doorways. \nPENNY \nDoorways to where? \nJOHN \nThe future. \nSMITH \nPerhaps the Professor was hit on the head when we landed. \nJOHN \nRemember the portal that lead us to the probe ship? What if we crossed a into a time years after Earth sent a rescue mission. \nWEST \nYou're not serious? Time travel is impossible. \nWILL \nNo it's not. It's just improbable. Like hyperdrive was a hundred years ago. Nothing's really impossible. \nJOHN \nThis world could be riddled with doorways to the future. \nWILL \nSo if we walk into that forest outside, we're really just walking into this crater years from now. \nMAUREEN \nGeological plates from different times wouldn't fit together. That would explain the tectonic mismatch. But doorways in time, John? \nJOHN \nIf these portals are opening and closing, part of some cascading, natural phenomenon, they could be tearing this planet apart \nWILL \nThese portals are exactly what I predicted my time machine would do. What if the doorways aren't natural? A machine that bends space, like our hyperdrive, could be modified to bend time as well. What if someone on this world has built a device? \nJOHN \nSon, I appreciate your input but now isn't the time for flights of fancy. \nDon and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon. \nJOHN \nWe should be able to see the ship. \nSomething catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand. \nMETAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency. \nWEST \nCould these be from the probe? \nJOHN \nCorroded. This metal is decades old. \nDon finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand. \nWEST \nIt's not possible. \nWRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two. \nWEST \nWhat kind of nightmare is this? Where the hell are we? \nJOHN \nNo, Major, when the hell are we? \nSuddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying. John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful electrical blast, falling hard. Still. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nRolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot. \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE \nWill and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky. \nWILL \nI feel like we got turned around. \nSMITH \nJust follow your father's signal, young William. \nWILL \nOh shit. \nSMITH \nA boy of your intelligence shouldn't swear. \nWILL \n(pointing) \nLook. \nSMITH \nOh. Shit, indeed. \nREVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open to the sun. \nCUT TO: \nJOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness. \nWIDER \nINT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE \nOr what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him. \nVOICE (OVER) \nWell, well. All things really do come to he who waits. \nA FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow. \nJOHN \nWhat is this place? \nFIGURE \nWhy Professor, the shock must have scrambled your brain. Look around you. Don't you recognize the spot? You've come home. \nJOHN \nThis can't be... \nBut even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is. \nJOHN \nWhat have you done to the ship. ...Where's my family? \nFIGURE \nYour family is dead. Dead and in the ground. \nJOHN \nNo! \nFIGURE \nWhat fickle consort in memory. Time dims certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday. \nThe figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar. \nFIGURE \nI'll never forget that morning. Twenty years ago. What was it you said? I'll be back. I promise. But I knew better. You never came home. \nThe figure walks to one of the burned out panels. \nFIGURE \nWithout you, your family never had a chance. A few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship. They reached the planet and attacked. I can still hear the women scream. \nJOHN \nWho are you? \nThe figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but familiar. John's father's dog tags. \nFIGURE \nDon't you recognize me, Dad? It's me. I'm your son. Will. \nEXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY \nMaureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush. \nJUDY \nPenny? Penny? \nThe four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny. \nEnable gun for all users. \nGUN \nVoiceprint confirmed. \nWill hands Smith the gun. \nSMITH \nFinally. \nSmith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple. \nSMITH \nA brief lesson in survival on this world or any other. Never trust anyone. Remember it into your old age, should you have one. \n(shoving him forward) \nNow move! \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE \nJohn stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the control panel and the descending core material. \nJOHN \nWe can go back across the portals to the past, to the functioning Jupiter Two, where your mother and sisters are still alive. We can use this core material to escape together. \nOLDER WILL \nAnd then what? All of us lost in space. Don't you see? I can do what you never could. I can save us all. \nDon has edged his way to the descending core material. \nSMITH (OVER) \nI'm afraid not. \nThrough the doorway comes young Will, Smith walking behind him, hand on his shoulder, gun to his head. \nSMITH \nNever fear. Smith is here. \nJOHN \nWill, I. . . \nSMITH \nDon't move, Professor Robinson or this rather peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief. \n(off Don) \nI'll ask you to step away from that console, Major. \nDon stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John. Smith approaches the Robot. \nSMITH \nWell, well, some of us just don't know when to stay dead. \nSmith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt. \nSMITH \nI borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes of taking over the helm once we were in flight. But I seem to have found a better use instead. \nSmith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up, then fall limp. Docile. \nSMITH \nLet's try this dance again. You are the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do get it right this time. \nSmith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again. \nSMITH \nRobot, enable electric disrupters. \nThe Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles. \nSMITH \nNow that's a good gargantuan. \nSmith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head. \nSMITH \nSay goodbye to your past. You're future lies with me. I'm going home in your place. \nSmith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring at the time machine, eyes wide with awe. \nWILL \nYou did it. Just like I imagined. Re-routed the hypercore. But the natural power source, the delivery system. I never thought of those. \nOlder Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger self. Touches his hair. \nOLDER WILL \nYou will. The future is never what it looks like when you're ten. \nSMITH \nHeartwarming. Nauseatingly sentimental but heartwarming. \nSmith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will. \nSMITH \nWe certainly could have aged better, I must say Now, show me how your little time machine works. \nBut Will just smiles. \nSMITH \nAn odd moment for mirth, don't you think? What are you grinning at? \nOLDER WILL \nLook around you, Doctor. At this hostile world. Do you really think a boy could have survived all alone? \nSMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar. \nVOICE (OVER) \nNever fear, Smith is here. \nThe shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith. \nSPIDER SMITH \nHello, Doctor, how nice to see me again after all these years. \nSmith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye. \nSPIDER SMITH \nThe spider's sting had some unexpected side effects. \nSpider Smith flexes his three jointed arm. \nSPIDER SMITH \nBut my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world. \nLet's forget the past. \nWill turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows. \nSPIDER SMITH \nWhat are you doing? \nOLDER WILL \nFocusing the aperture. Remember, the energy around the portal will rip a man to pieces. \nSPIDER SMITH \nIsn't the doorway too small? \nOLDER WILL \nNot for me. \n(a beat) \nBut then I'm not going, am I? The spiders didn't kill the girls. It was you. I just never let myself see it. You kept me alive because you needed me. Because I could build this for you. You killed my family. Destroyed this world. And I helped. You became mad as the spiders. ...And I became you. \nSPIDER SMITH \nPoor, poor boy. Did you really think I would let you go home? Let all that I have become vanish? Look at me. I am no mere man. I am a God. \nSpider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders. \nSPIDER SMITH \nYour father was right. Within me roil the growing needs of a master race. We WILL descend upon helpless Earth. An entire planet to rule. \nHis arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth, bearing venomous fangs. \nSPIDER SMITH \nAn entire planet on which to feed. \nINT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE \nJohn and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER) the TREMORS are increasing in frequency. \nWEST \nI'll run, draw his fire. You may have time to get away with Will. \nROBOT (OVER) \nHalt or Robot will destroy. \nThe men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot. \nWILL \nDo you remember what I taught you. A long time ago. About friendship? \nROBOT \nFriendship means acting with your heart not your head. \nWILL \nThat's why I rebuilt you. Because I wanted us to be friends. \nROBOT \nLogic error. Friendship does not compute. \nWILL \nForget logic. Act with your heart. \nROBOT \nRobot has no heart. Robot is powered by a fusion pulse generator \nWILL \nEvery living thing has a heart. \nThe Robot stares at him a beat. \nROBOT \nAny attempts to override command protocols may result in fused processors in my neural net. \nThe floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams. \nWILL \nPlease, Robot, if you don't let us go, we're all going to die. I'm asking you now, will you help us? Will you be my friend? \nThe Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control bolt attached firmly on his CPU. \nROBOT \nRobot attempting to deactivate control bolt-commands overriddenattempting to reroute-dangercircuitry overloadattempting to escape-kill them, kill them... \nThe Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire. \nAt the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt. \nWILL \nYou did it. \nROBOT \nRobot will save ... I will save Will Robinson. I will save my friend. \nCHAPTER 21: Time to Die! \nEXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT \nPenny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES. \nMAUREEN \n(shouting ) \nPenny? Penny? \nPenny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently. \nMAUREEN \nWhere did you go? \nPENNY \nI came through the forest. I had a promise I had to keep. \nBefore Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling. \nJUDY \nInside. Fast. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE \nDon, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the ground RUMBLES. \nJOHN \nYou've got find your way back to the ship. The portals may still be stable. I'll try to meet you there. \nWEST \nThe trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT \nThe women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble. \nPENNY \nMom, the forest. \nPenny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back. \nMAUREEN \nWhere's John? \nWEST \nThe portal closed behind us. It was his only way back. \nMEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air. \nWEST \nWe've got to try and lift off. \nMAUREEN \nWe've already begun the pre-flight countdown. You have the Com. \n(off Don's expression) \nI'm going to save as many lives as I can, Major. Now strap in. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE \n(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls themselves beginning to crack. \nSMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank unfolds above the doorway in time. \nJOHN (OVER) \nNot so fast. \nWIDER \nJohn stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand, slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists. \nJOHN \nYou sabotaged our mission. \n(hook) \nYou killed my family \n(jab) \nYou stole my son. It's payback time. \nSmith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect. It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform. \nSPIDER SMITH \nSpare me the fury of the righteous. \nThe monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw. \nSPIDER SMITH \nI think there's time for a snack before my trip. \nJohn's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek. \nSPIDER SMITH \n(sarcastic) \nOh, the pain. The pain. \nJOHN \nYou ain't seen nothing yet. \nJohn feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch. \nSPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised. \nJOHN \nRemember the probe ship? These monsters eat their wounded. \nSMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping. \nSPIDER SMITH \nNo. Stop. No! \nSpider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him, sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below. \nSpider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red laser and is swept up by the tides of time. \nJOHN \nTake all the time you want to die. \nSpider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether. \nJohn turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT \nThe landscape is a sudden inferno. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT \nDon is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair. \nMAUREEN \nI kept hoping somehow he'd appear. \nMaureen stares a beat out the window. \nMAUREEN \nLet's go, Major. \nDon hits the engine switch.

Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair. \nMAUREEN \nI kept hoping somehow he'd appear. \nMaureen stares a beat out the window. \nMAUREEN \nLet's go, Major. \nDon hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life. \nMAUREEN \n(quiet) \nGoodbye my love. \nPENNY \nLook. \nThe roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL. \n2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE \nThe bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated doorway. Older WILL looks to his father. \nOLDER WILL \nDON'T make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel. \nAnd with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down through space and into the bubble and the doorway below. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the watery hull. \nJOHN \nCome with us. \nBut the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g. \nOLDER WILL \nI can't. There was only enough power for one person, one trip, remember? \nMAUREEN \nWill? \nOLDER WILL \nIt's good to see you again, Mom. It's good to see you alive. \n(fading) \nSorry about all the monkey business. \nMaureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever. \nJOHN \nHe sacrificed everything for his family. \nMAUREEN \n(fighting tears) \nHe had a good example. \nMaureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will. \nWILL \nDad? \nA beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags. \nWILL \nI'm glad you came back. \nJOHN \nI just want you to know I love you son. I love you very much. \nJohn takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.

The power drive begins to spin. The Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWEST \nI'm going to try to reach escape velocity. Maybe we can break the gravitational pull. \nJOHN \nNo. We don't have the core material.

I hope one day you'll be able to see that. \nWith that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot. \nWILL \nTake care of my dad, okay Robot? \nWill works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP \nA long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g. \nJUDY \nThe air is stale. Old. \nSMITH \nThat's the smell of ghosts. \nDon walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing. \nWEST \nI'm interfacing with the on board computer... Odd. \nJOHN \nNot working? \nWEST \nNo, it's just, I don't know, too fast. Most of the systems are down. \nThe Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead. \nJUDY \nMotion sensors are still working. \nWEST (OVER) \nWhat do you make of this? \nSmith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls. \nJOHN \nSome kind of hieroglyphics. \nWALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall. The sketches tell a story. \nHIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship. \nSECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter the giant ship. \nTHIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red substance. Don touches the stain. \nCHAPTER 13: Exploration \nJUDY \nIf I didn't know better I'd say this is blood. \nSMITH \nI know an omen when I see one. I suggest a hasty retreat. \nWEST \nJust imagine we're retreating in the opposite direction.

The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL... \nINT.-MAIN BRIDGE \nImmense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls. \nJUDY \nWhat the hell happened in here? \nWEST \nSome kind of fire fight. Look at this technology. I've seen some of this before. On the drawing boards. \nSmith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE. Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours. \nJohn and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on. \nJOHN \nCan you bring up the Captain's log? \nWEST \nThe data has degraded. I'm going try and gather any fragments I can. There isn't much, but ... here we go. \nMAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's Jab.

Slips it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit. \nWEST \nThis doesn't make sense. How could they launch a rescue mission for us when we've only been lost a day? \nJudy stands by the life sciences panel. \nJUDY \nI've got something here. \nA turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within. \nJUDY \nThey brought it up from the planet's surface. It's seems to be some sort of egg sack. \nDon notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove. \nWEST \nSmith, step away from there. \nSMITH \nHappy to oblige, Major. Although I don't think it's me you should be worrying about. But rather this. \nIn the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWill is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV. \nWILL \nI'm detecting motion.

If my theories are correct, these doorways should remain stable, for a while anyway. \nSMITH \nI can barely contain my glee. Why aren't you aging like the plants? \nWILL \nThat's just an effect of the portals forming. Once they stabilize you can cross from one time to another just like stepping between two rooms. \n(off his tracker) \nDad's signal is this way. Come on, Doctor Smith. \nWill takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold. \nSMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared. Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush. \nSmith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush, revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens. \nWILL (OVER) \nWhat did you find? \nWill has returned. \nSMITH \nCome, come, son, no time for distractions.

A reflection from the Jupiter Two bouncing off the ore in these walls. There's no core material here. \n(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the crater aging and crumbling in it's wake. \nJohn and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees, roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker, more deserted future. \nJOHN \nThe ship's back that way. we have to go through. \nEXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT \nPenny is pushing through the forest. \nPENNY \nBlip? I'm sorry. Blip? \nShe spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker, the sky red. Blip steps through the portal. \nPENNY \nBlip, wait. \nPenny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall trees beyond. A beat.

Here a dark haired beauty holds a single lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's. \nSuddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves. \nSHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard monkeys, two large, two smaller. \nDirectly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon. \nBLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK. \nPENNY \nBlip, no! \nToo late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness. \nBlip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical. \nThe giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw reaching out, touching her face.

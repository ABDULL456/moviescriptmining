Hope you got some Partagas in that rust bucket, Sal. \nEXT.-EDGE OF SPACE \nTHE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere. \nPILOT \nI brought you the most amazing... \nAmazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire. \nEXT.- MARS \nLOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME, BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed. \nINT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER \nPOV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast. Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash. \nEXT.-CARGO SHIP \nThe pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull. \nWIDER \nTwo sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship, FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire. \nA BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN. \nINT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER \nA lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider. \nThe harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome, intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST. \nWEST \nSino-Jordanian Raiders. They're claiming the cargo ship violated their air-space. \nINT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER \nAnother pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING towards the assault craft just below West's. \nJEB \nThis cold war's heating up. Where did they come from? \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \nWEST \nHell. And we're going to send them back screaming. \nWest activates his targeting computer. \nWEST \nLast one to kill a bad guy buys the beer. \nTARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS. \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \nWest closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent surface of the bubble glass under West's feet. \nWEST \nWhat's that sound? must be the fat lady warming up. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction, heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken. \nINT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER \nWest doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships heading straight for each other. \nWEST \nThat's right. Come on, come on, you wanna play, I wanna play. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nWEST \nI can hear her.

You are not authorized to jeopardize this asset. That is a direct order. Acknowledge! \nWest slams a switch, deactivating his radio. \nWEST \nNever liked that station, anyway. \nHe BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nJeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below. \nOverhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle. \nINT.-3EB'S FIGHTER \nThe canal floor is rushing up fast. \nCOMPUTER \nImpact in five seconds. \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nDon is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below. \nCOMPUTER \nWarning.

Don angles the throttle. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nDon's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter, angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust. \nINT.-WEST'S FIGHTER \nJEB (OVER) \nDoes this mean we're going steady? \nWest pulls his throttle all the way back. \nEXT.-MARTIAN CANAL \nWest shoots up and out towards the dark of space. \nWEST (OVER) \nYou weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy. \nThe rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base. \nCUT TO: \nCHAPTER 2: Mission Objectives \nIMAGES-CLOSE.

We didn't even have lights. \nThe room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body. \nMaureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously glancing behind couches, into cabinets. \nPRINCIPAL (OVER) \nHe never showed, huh? \nWILL \nMaybe if I had actually broken the time barrier he would have paid attention. \nPENNY \nDon't let him get to you, kiddo.

My family' a on this mission. I need someone who's more than just spit and polish. \nGENERAL \nI've got your man. He just doesn't know it yet. \nThe General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal... \nINT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS \nA figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated. \nGENERAL \nAt ease, Major. \nWEST \nSir, why was I pulled off active duty? I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll fight a court martial, General. \nGENERAL \nDo you know Professor Robinson? \nWEST \nBy reputation only. \n(to John) \nYour father's battle strategies were required reading at the Academy. \nGENERAL \nHow much do you know about the Jupiter Mission, Major? \nWEST \nThe Jupiter is fully automated. The pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's a baby sitting job, sir. \nGENERAL \nMajor, you are aware Earth's resources are severely limited. \nWEST \nEvery schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment. Sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages. \nGENERAL \nWhat I am about to tell you is classified. Every schoolchild has been lied to. The recycling technologies have failed. In less than two decades Earth will be unable to support human life. \nGENERAL \nWe spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. We partnered with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government. The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as well as we do. They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, I guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons like us. our crops will wither. We will be left to die. \nWEST \n...Captain Daniels doesn't have the flu, does he sir? \nGENERAL \nDaniels was murdered in his apartment last night. The flu story is a cover we fed the press. \nWEST \nDan was a good pilot. A good man. \nGENERAL \nYour rescue stunt over Mars was foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major. \nWEST \nI had a friend in trouble. \nGENERAL \nYou endangered a one billion dollar spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order because of a friend? \nWEST \nYes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir. \nJOHN \nHe'll do. \n(stepping forward) \nGENERAL \nCongratulations Major, you're the new pilot of the Jupiter mission. \nCHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith \nEXT.-DESERT-DAY \nSun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN. \nMAN \nPerhaps a brief jaunt down memory lane is required.

So we can stay together \nMAUREEN \nThe perfect nuclear family. The most stable social unit, ideally suited for the isolation of a long journey into space. It's all just PR, John. You're never home. Judy is becoming a ghost just like you. Penny can't see past her own navel and Will has to black out-his school, just to get his father's attention. The perfect nuclear family in ruin. \nJohn stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair. \nJOHN \nI know, Maureen. I'm scared too. \nA beat. Then she moves to him.

Smith activates the device. \nSMITH \nYou'll forgive me if I forgo the kiss, my sleeping behemoth. \nSmith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad. \nSMITH \nBut the time has come to awake. \nROBOT \nRobot is on-line. Reviewing primary directives. One, preserve the Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship systems. Three \nSMITH \nSpare me the chatter. \nSmith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again. \nSMITH \nWhat noble charges my steely centurion. Sadly I fear you have far more dire deeds in store for you. \nSmith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch. \nROBOT \nRobot is on-line. Reviewing primary directives. Two hours into mission destroy Robinson family. Destroy all systems. \nSmith smiles. Removes the re-programming module. \nSMITH \nNow that's more like it. Farewell my tin-plated pal.

John and Judy arrive behind Don. \nWEST \nThis explains where all the plants came from. \nJUDY \nGrowth like this would take decades. \nThe Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw. \nSMITH \nUnhand me, you mechanical moron. \nDon's eyes fix behind Smith's head. \nWEST \nDon't move. \nSMITH \nI am sick of your terrorism. If you are going to kill me, be done with it. Otherwise I will insist you treat me with the respect and- \nWEST \n(like steel) \nI said don't move. \nSmith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he pulls from its hiding place a small creature. \nAbout the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWill is watching through the Robot's eyes. \nWILL \nNeat. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN \nWest stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more friendly blue. Judy approaches. \nJUDY \nWell, who do we have here? \nAs the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like, trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast. \nWEST \nEasy there, little buddy. No one's going to hurt you. \nSMITH \nHow do you know it won't hurt us? \nDon has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds. \nJUDY \nLooks like you've made a friend. You have a good bedside manner, Major. \nWEST \nI'm going to let that one go. \nSMITH \nHow charming. Doctor Dolittle of outer space. \nJUDY \nWhere do you think it came from? \nJOHN \nIt's possible this is one of the creatures represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It must have been their ship attached to the other docking ring. \nThe beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there, burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH. \nWEST \nIt looks like a child. \nSMITH \nIf so, my dear Major, what do you suppose happened to its parents? \nJOHN \nLet's get back to the bridge. \nAs they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the background. Ominous. Unseen. \nCHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders! \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nPenny is still hanging overhead. \nPENNY \nI think I've got it. \nThe sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor. \nMAUREEN \nThat's strange. \nSCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with ambient heat. Penny lands beside her. \nPENNY \nThose scales are giving off heat. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE \nJohn is at the Com. \nJOHN \nI've tapped into the internal sensor array. Besides us, this ship is totally deserted. \nSMITH \nThe fire sensor. \nJudy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders. \nDON-CLOSE. Impressed. \nBLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel. \nOur group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in, the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY \nDon activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening. \nThe Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death. \nSMITH \nOpen, damn you. \nWEST \nIt's cycling a vacuum check. There is no way to speed up the protocols. \nSMITH \nFools. I warned you not to come aboard this cursed craft. You've killed us. You've killed us all. \nJudy throws him, hard, into the wall. \nJUDY \nShut up. \nWEST \nNow that's a bedside manner. \nThe first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nMaureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is within the holograph, fighting off the spiders. \nWILL \nCharge. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY \nThe Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling. \nThe airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside. \nJOHN \nWill, get the Robot in here. \nThe Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWill is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by. \nWILL \nI can't move him without letting the spiders into the ship. \nINT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY \nJOHN \nLeave him behind. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWILL \nI'm sorry, Robot. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY \nA spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK \nJOHN \nSeal it. Now! \nDon hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon. \nSMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision. \nTHE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the airlock. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in. \nJOHN \nGet us out of here. \nDon is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey. \nSMITH \nGet this cloying gargoyle off of me. \nHe throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the wall, SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles. \nJohn has strapped in beside Don. \nJOHN \nGet me an external view. \nA MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull. \nJOHN \nPrepare to disengage. \nTHE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap. \nPENNY \nGet it off me. Get it off. \nPenny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny. \nDon releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the ship is now entirely covered with spiders. \nWEST \nInitiating separation. \nLIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast. \nPENNY \nIt's okay. Everything's going to be alright. \nBut she sounds anything but sure. \nWEST \nWe're clear. Everybody hang on. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the wake of the fusion drives. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nCOMPUTER (OVER) \nWarning. Inner hull breach in twenty seconds. \nJOHN \nGive them a little encouragement. \nWEST \nElectrifying outer hull ... now. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive. \nThe spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of the giant probe ship. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the giant probe ship. \nJOHN \nGet us out of here. Fast. \nDon looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls. \nJOHN \nWhat are you doing? \nWEST \nNever leave an enemy stronghold intact. One of your father's first rules of engagement. \nDon hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD. \nJOHN \nDon, stop. That's a direct order. We might need to salvage- \nWEST \nThis is a military emergency. That means I'm in command. \nJOHN \nDon, no. I'm ordering you- \nWEST \nI hate spiders. \nDon hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD. \nWEST \nHang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy ride. \nDon angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's engines begins to glow. \nEXT.-SPACE \nThe probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow, venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star. \nTHE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders. \nTHE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship is buffeted by the shock wave. \nWEST \nI can't hold her. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nDon is struggling to keep control. \nWEST \nWe're going down. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD. \nWEST \nCan't get the stabilizers on line. \nJOHN \nPull up. Pull up. \nWEST \nReally? No kidding? Thanks. \nWINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A GIANT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE. \nDon banks the controls. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWEST \nI'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm going to try and make it. \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE \nThe Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe surface is coming up fast. \nWEST \nGot to slow us down. \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE \nThe Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice, three times across the alien sea. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nWEST \nMaureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles. \nJOHN \nWhat? \nMAUREEN \nIt's nice to have our family under one roof. Even if we had to go half way across the galaxy to manage it. \nJohn presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles. \nJOHN \nHow would you feel about a little late night tutorial, Professor? \nJohn moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME. \nMAUREEN \nMm. That's new. What are you doing? \nJOHN \nGoing for extra credit. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT \nThe ship sits on the alien landscape. \nMAUREEN (OVER) \nGood night John. \nJOHN (OVER) \nGood night Maureen. \nWILL (OVER) \nGood night Judy. \nPENNY (OVER) \nGood night Will. \nJUDY (OVER) \nGood night Penny. \nWEST (OVER) \nYou guys have got to be kidding. \nCHAPTER 17: The Core \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING \nWill comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen. \nWILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock. \nWILL \nOh man. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nA giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship. Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees. \nINT.-BRIEFING ROOM \nThe crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes. \nPENNY \nWhat are those rumblings? They've been happening all morning. \nJUDY \nHow can half the landscape have grown up overnight? \nJOHN \nOkay, let's get settled. Maureen? \nMAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates that make up this world appear mismatched. \nMAUREEN \nIt's impossible. But this planet's geothermic plates don't match up. \nJOHN \nI was afraid of this. \nAl1 eyes turn to John. \nJOHN \nI think these tremors are the result of opening and closing doorways. \nPENNY \nDoorways to where? \nJOHN \nThe future. \nSMITH \nPerhaps the Professor was hit on the head when we landed. \nJOHN \nRemember the portal that lead us to the probe ship? What if we crossed a into a time years after Earth sent a rescue mission. \nWEST \nYou're not serious? Time travel is impossible. \nWILL \nNo it's not. It's just improbable. Like hyperdrive was a hundred years ago. Nothing's really impossible. \nJOHN \nThis world could be riddled with doorways to the future. \nWILL \nSo if we walk into that forest outside, we're really just walking into this crater years from now. \nMAUREEN \nGeological plates from different times wouldn't fit together. That would explain the tectonic mismatch. But doorways in time, John? \nJOHN \nIf these portals are opening and closing, part of some cascading, natural phenomenon, they could be tearing this planet apart \nWILL \nThese portals are exactly what I predicted my time machine would do. What if the doorways aren't natural? A machine that bends space, like our hyperdrive, could be modified to bend time as well. What if someone on this world has built a device? \nJOHN \nSon, I appreciate your input but now isn't the time for flights of fancy. \nRobot is on line. \n(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled. \nWILL \nIt sounds like old morse code. \nChapter 18: Danger Will! \nINT.-CORRIDOR \nWill walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison. \nSmith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table, hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside. \nWill shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again. \nWILL \n(sounding out the code) \nDanger. \nINT.-SMITH'S CELL \nThe door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand. \nWILL \nYou said someone is in danger. \nSMITH \nWe all are. You are wise to arm yourself. \nSmith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy. \nWILL \nThis gun is set to fire for me only so don't try anything funny. \nSmith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going instead to the window and opening the blast shield. \nSMITH \nWilliam, you misjudge me. I only want to help you. \nWILL \nHelp us? You tried to kill us all. \nSMITH \nBut now our fates are intertwined. if your father and that idiot West fail, I will have no chance of getting home. It is in my best interests they succeed. And I always follow my best interests. \nSmith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL. \nSMITH \nWhat monsters roam these alien wilds? Fools. To set off blindly across this savage land. Much as I hate to admit it, it will be harder to manage without them. \nWILL \nWhat are you talking about? They'll be back. They'll be okay. \nSmith is silent. A long, lethal beat. \nWILL \nSomeone should go after them. \nSMITH \nWill, I forbid it. You're a boy. A clever one, certainly, but a child nonetheless. This planet is likely full of predators. Even if you found them, what if they're hurt, ravaged, dying, what good could you do? \nWILL \nBut you're a doctor. \nSmith turns away, hiding his smile. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY \nJudy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds. \nJUDY \nIt's impossible. \nMAUREEN \nNot really. Geologists have speculated that Dimondium might be naturally occurring in many older worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of rejuvenating itself. \nJUDY \nThis one is ten times more powerful then that on Alpha Prime. There's enough here to save Earth. \nPenny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples, talking into her video recorder. \nPENNY \nAfter much deliberation, the Space Captive has decided to accept her new role as member of the crew. The Robinsons, after all, can  obviously use her help... \nBlip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground. \nPENNY \n(flaring) \nNow look what you've done. Stop hanging all over me. \nBlip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick brush.. \nPENNY \nBlip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn. \nPenny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten. \nCHAPTER 19: A Different Future \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY \nWill and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation tracker in his hand. \nWILL \nI've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon. \nDead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves moving in the wind like an azure sea. \nWILL \nWow, that's Mom's favorite color. \nSMITH \nHow droll. \n(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them, flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within. \nSMITH \nRun, child, run. \nSmith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes. \nSMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown. \nDon and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon. \nJOHN \nWe should be able to see the ship. \nSomething catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand. \nMETAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency. \nWEST \nCould these be from the probe? \nJOHN \nCorroded. This metal is decades old. \nDon finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand. \nWEST \nIt's not possible. \nWRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two. \nWEST \nWhat kind of nightmare is this? Where the hell are we? \nJOHN \nNo, Major, when the hell are we? \nSuddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying. John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful electrical blast, falling hard. Still. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nRolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot. \nEXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE \nWill and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky. \nWILL \nI feel like we got turned around. \nSMITH \nJust follow your father's signal, young William. \nWILL \nOh shit. \nSMITH \nA boy of your intelligence shouldn't swear. \nWILL \n(pointing) \nLook. \nSMITH \nOh. Shit, indeed. \nREVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open to the sun. \nCUT TO: \nJOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness. \nWIDER \nINT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE \nOr what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him. \nVOICE (OVER) \nWell, well. All things really do come to he who waits. \nA FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow. \nJOHN \nWhat is this place? \nFIGURE \nWhy Professor, the shock must have scrambled your brain. Look around you. Don't you recognize the spot? You've come home. \nJOHN \nThis can't be... \nBut even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is. \nJOHN \nWhat have you done to the ship. ...Where's my family? \nFIGURE \nYour family is dead. Dead and in the ground. \nJOHN \nNo! \nFIGURE \nWhat fickle consort in memory. Time dims certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday. \nThe figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar. \nFIGURE \nI'll never forget that morning. Twenty years ago. What was it you said? I'll be back. I promise. But I knew better. You never came home. \nThe figure walks to one of the burned out panels. \nFIGURE \nWithout you, your family never had a chance. A few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship. They reached the planet and attacked. I can still hear the women scream. \nJOHN \nWho are you? \nThe figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but familiar. John's father's dog tags. \nFIGURE \nDon't you recognize me, Dad? It's me. I'm your son. Will. \nEXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY \nMaureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush. \nJUDY \nPenny? Penny? \nThe four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny. \nEnable gun for all users. \nGUN \nVoiceprint confirmed. \nWill hands Smith the gun. \nSMITH \nFinally. \nSmith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple. \nSMITH \nA brief lesson in survival on this world or any other. Never trust anyone. Remember it into your old age, should you have one. \n(shoving him forward) \nNow move! \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE \nJohn stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the control panel and the descending core material. \nJOHN \nWe can go back across the portals to the past, to the functioning Jupiter Two, where your mother and sisters are still alive. We can use this core material to escape together. \nOLDER WILL \nAnd then what? All of us lost in space. Don't you see? I can do what you never could. I can save us all. \nDon has edged his way to the descending core material. \nSMITH (OVER) \nI'm afraid not. \nThrough the doorway comes young Will, Smith walking behind him, hand on his shoulder, gun to his head. \nSMITH \nNever fear. Smith is here. \nJOHN \nWill, I. . . \nSMITH \nDon't move, Professor Robinson or this rather peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief. \n(off Don) \nI'll ask you to step away from that console, Major. \nDon stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John. Smith approaches the Robot. \nSMITH \nWell, well, some of us just don't know when to stay dead. \nSmith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt. \nSMITH \nI borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes of taking over the helm once we were in flight. But I seem to have found a better use instead. \nSmith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up, then fall limp. Docile. \nSMITH \nLet's try this dance again. You are the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do get it right this time. \nSmith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again. \nSMITH \nRobot, enable electric disrupters. \nThe Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles. \nSMITH \nNow that's a good gargantuan. \nSmith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head. \nSMITH \nSay goodbye to your past. You're future lies with me. I'm going home in your place. \nSmith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring at the time machine, eyes wide with awe. \nWILL \nYou did it. Just like I imagined. Re-routed the hypercore. But the natural power source, the delivery system. I never thought of those. \nOlder Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger self. Touches his hair. \nOLDER WILL \nYou will. The future is never what it looks like when you're ten. \nSMITH \nHeartwarming. Nauseatingly sentimental but heartwarming. \nSmith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will. \nSMITH \nWe certainly could have aged better, I must say Now, show me how your little time machine works. \nBut Will just smiles. \nSMITH \nAn odd moment for mirth, don't you think? What are you grinning at? \nOLDER WILL \nLook around you, Doctor. At this hostile world. Do you really think a boy could have survived all alone? \nSMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar. \nVOICE (OVER) \nNever fear, Smith is here. \nThe shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith. \nSPIDER SMITH \nHello, Doctor, how nice to see me again after all these years. \nSmith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye. \nSPIDER SMITH \nThe spider's sting had some unexpected side effects. \nSpider Smith flexes his three jointed arm. \nSPIDER SMITH \nBut my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world. \nThe trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT \nThe women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble. \nPENNY \nMom, the forest. \nPenny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back. \nMAUREEN \nWhere's John? \nWEST \nThe portal closed behind us. It was his only way back. \nMEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air. \nWEST \nWe've got to try and lift off. \nMAUREEN \nWe've already begun the pre-flight countdown. You have the Com. \n(off Don's expression) \nI'm going to save as many lives as I can, Major. Now strap in. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE \n(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls themselves beginning to crack. \nSMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank unfolds above the doorway in time. \nJOHN (OVER) \nNot so fast. \nWIDER \nJohn stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand, slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists. \nJOHN \nYou sabotaged our mission. \n(hook) \nYou killed my family \n(jab) \nYou stole my son. It's payback time. \nSmith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect. It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform. \nSPIDER SMITH \nSpare me the fury of the righteous. \nThe monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw. \nSPIDER SMITH \nI think there's time for a snack before my trip. \nJohn's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek. \nSPIDER SMITH \n(sarcastic) \nOh, the pain. The pain. \nJOHN \nYou ain't seen nothing yet. \nJohn feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch. \nSPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised. \nJOHN \nRemember the probe ship? These monsters eat their wounded. \nSMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping. \nSPIDER SMITH \nNo. Stop. No! \nSpider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him, sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below. \nSpider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red laser and is swept up by the tides of time. \nJOHN \nTake all the time you want to die. \nSpider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether. \nJohn turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it. \nEXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT \nThe landscape is a sudden inferno. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT \nDon is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair. \nMAUREEN \nI kept hoping somehow he'd appear. \nMaureen stares a beat out the window. \nMAUREEN \nLet's go, Major. \nDon hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life. \nMAUREEN \n(quiet) \nGoodbye, my love. \nCHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity \nThe ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way. \nWEST \nEngaging primary thrusters. Now! \nEXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT \nThe power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise. \nWe are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam. Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair. \nMAUREEN \nI kept hoping somehow he'd appear. \nMaureen stares a beat out the window. \nMAUREEN \nLet's go, Major. \nDon hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life. \nMAUREEN \n(quiet) \nGoodbye my love. \nPENNY \nLook. \nThe roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL. \n2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE \nThe bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated doorway. Older WILL looks to his father. \nOLDER WILL \nDON'T make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel. \nAnd with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down through space and into the bubble and the doorway below. \nINT.-JUPITER TWO \nThe ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the watery hull. \nJOHN \nCome with us. \nBut the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g. \nOLDER WILL \nI can't. There was only enough power for one person, one trip, remember? \nMAUREEN \nWill? \nOLDER WILL \nIt's good to see you again, Mom. It's good to see you alive. \n(fading) \nSorry about all the monkey business. \nMaureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever. \nJOHN \nHe sacrificed everything for his family. \nMAUREEN \n(fighting tears) \nHe had a good example. \nMaureen holds him close.

At different stages of life she, or he, probably alternates sexes. \nPENNY \nImagine the savings on dating outfits alone. \nThe tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner. \nPENNY \nCan I keep her? \nJUDY \nPenny, you've never taken care of a thing in your life besides yourself. \nPENNY \nPlease.

GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the front screen door. Pop is still there. 
GRADY I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue James Leer. 
MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and peers in at Grady. 
MISS SLOVIAK You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think about going home. You look like you need a little rescuing yourself. 
27	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB 
GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox. 
27A	EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB 
As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a perfunctory pat-down. 
BOUNCER (kidding him) Clean tonight, hub, Professor? 
GRADY As a whistle. 
28	INT. HI-HAT CLUB 
Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated shrug and she points. 
CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap. 
Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing WAITRESS. 
GRADY Double Dickel on the rocks. 
29	INT. BOOTH 
As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close. 
GRADY Is that just beer? 
CRABTREE Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way. 
GRADY I'm sure. Where is everyone? 
CRABTREE Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog. 
GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk. 
GRADY Jesus. He's out. 
CRABTREE glances over, nods. 
CRABTREE He has a book. 
GRADY I know. He started it Fall semester. 
CRABTREE He finished it Winter Break. 
GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.  He glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall. 
CRABTREE So. Is he any good? 
GRADY No. Not yet he isn't. 
CRABTREE Well, I'm going to read it anyway. 
GRADY Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one oÂ£ my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's- 
CRABTREE He is. Take my word for it. 
GRADY I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost ...did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now. 
CRABTREE On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket. 
WAITRESS (ducking in) Double Dickel. 
GRADY Thanks. 
GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah Green's slinky form seizes his attention. 
CRABTREE No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor? 
GRADY Shut up and drink. 
CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops. 
CRABTREE Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see? 
GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but it's not Oola CRABTREE is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER. 
GRADY President of the James Brown Hair Club For Men. 
Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp. 
GRADY (initiating an old game) He's a boxer. A flyweight.

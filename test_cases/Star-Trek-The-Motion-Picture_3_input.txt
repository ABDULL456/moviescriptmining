Scott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning from the observation window. Outside, the metallic.. CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the "WHOOSH" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious moment for Kirk, and his face shows it. 
OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, "Pod secured. Pressure equalized." Scott moves the control to open the hatch. 
58   INT. ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M)                              58 
A confusion of organized work and VOICES. The cargo deck bustles with activity; supplies and equipment being stored and installed. 
59   INT. CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK                       59 
Kirk and Scott are met by a nervous, perspiring ENSIGN. 
KIRK AND SCOTT Permission to come aboard, sir...? 
ENSIGN Granted, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral... Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately. 
SCOTT (to Kirk) Sir, you'll excuse me...? 
Kirk gestures him to leave, and Scott hurries away. Kirk stands a moment, gazing down at the cargo deck. 
60   ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M)                           60 
The crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage holds and maintenance lockers. 
61   CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN                                    61 
Kirk is drinking it all in. He's home. 
ENSIGN (nervous) Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll... 
KIRK I think I can find my way, Ensign. 
And Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him, relieved. 
62   EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK                                   62 
Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open. 
63   INT. ELEVATOR                                               63 
as Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat, savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control panel: 
KIRK Bridge! 
The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur- tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's speedy trip to the Bridge. 
64   INT. BRIDGE                                                 64 
A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip- ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled. It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to- tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly working her communications station, AD LIBBING "... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency five, will someone please check me?" At the helm, sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust- ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov argues the computer is not relaying that information. 
65   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                 65 
snapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering. And then he moves forward toward the command center. 
66   ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK                                        66 
as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased. 
UHURA Captain... Starfleet just signaled your transfer-of- command orders! 
67   ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION                            67 
as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk. 
All work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from the old crew: "Admiral Kirk..." "It's the Captain...!" etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them back, speaking crisply. KIRK I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical. (to Uhura) Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them. (glances around) Where is Captain Decker? 
SULU He's in Engineering, sir... (uncomfortable, indicates Captain's chair) He doesn't know. 
Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away, addresses Chekov: 
KIRK Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we're facing. 
And Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The moment the elevator doors snap closed: 
SULU I wouldn't have wanted to have been standing in his way. He wanted her back; he got her! 
ALIEN ENSIGN (perturbed) And Captain Decker? He's been with the ship every minute of her refitting... 
UHURA (brittle) Ensign -- our chances of coming back from this mission in one piece may have just doubled...! 
68   OMITTED                                                     68 
70   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                    70 
The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity. ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female) coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one- man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con- stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi- cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD LIBBED conversation among the Technicians. 
Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch it, sir" admonishment. Kirk moves on to:

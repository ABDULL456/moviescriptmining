{"train": "LIMITLESS \nWritten by \nLeslie Dixon \nBased on the novel by \nAlan Glynn \nDecember 21, 2009 INT. A BLACK SCREEN \nEDDIE (V.0.) They found me. \nINT. CLOSE 0N - A HIGH-TECH RESIDENTIAL STEEL DOOR \nbeing POUNDED in. WHAM! WHAM! Whoever's trying to get in is serious. The door shudders but doesn't give. It's state-of- the-art residential protection. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I might have five minutes. \nWe hear the WHRRRRR of POWER TOOLS going to work on his door. These people are determined. Professional. And prepared. \nEDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D) I'll never know how they got past security in a half-billion dollar building. \nEXT. THE CELESTIAL - LOOKING INTO THE LOBBY - NIGHT \nThe sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk. All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut. \nEDDIE (V.O.) They've become sophisticated. Before they couldn't have done this. But now...? \nThe CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors of this stunning new building, coming to rest on... \nEDDIE MORGAN, \n30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him, beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump. \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I will never let them touch me. \nHis attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the next apartment. He looks over, at- \nTHE ADJOINING TERRACE \nThrough the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing. \nEDDIE (V.0.) My neighbor must've heard the noise. Opened his door to complain. \nTwo MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded again. It doesn't give. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) He bought me half a minute. I wish he hadn't. Last thoughts are self- pitying and mine are no exception: the waste. The waste of it all. I mean, how many of us ever know what it is to become... the perfect version of ourselves. I'd come that close. To having an impact on the world. \nThe pounding intensifies. \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on... \nHe looks over the railing... \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... was the sidewalk. \nHis smile is bitter, as we CUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY \nEDDIE (V.0.) Not so long ago, this was me. \nEddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt. He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy \"writer's\" sport coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the Salvation Army. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I was a writer. Two years after my copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr came to a non-mutual end, I had, in an extraordinary burst of desperate energy, bullshitted my way into my first book contract. This was it: \nINT. EDDIE'S RATTY RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT ON AVENUE A- DAY \nEddie, slumped in his desk chair, is playing COMPUTER SCRABBLE. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Now, at last, I was ready to write. \nQUICK CUTS: --Eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and watching TV, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. -- Eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Gearing up, that's all. \n--Eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him clicking to 11:59 a.m. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Getting psyched. \n--Eddie sitting on the john, playing a game on his childhood Game Boy. \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) A few days did pass this way... maybe a few months... \n--Eddie at his desk. He glances at his LAND LINE. The message light is unblinkingly green. No one's called. \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Friends fled. \nLINDY Yeah, thanks. I do. \nShe smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. No good to keep looking. It's over. Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check, which Lindy grabs. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLINDY (CONT'D) Oh, please. \nHe knows she knows he can't pay. \nEXT. MIDTOWN STREET - DAY \nEddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street, feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck. \nEDDIE (V.0.) She was right. I was almost 35. No one talks about \"potential\" at 35. I had missed the on-ramp. Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower bunk of my childhood bedroom... my father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory... \nHe's interrupted by A VOICE - calm, amused: \nVOICE Eddie. Morgan. \nVERNON GANT looks him over with condescending bemusment. He's 30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs, is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in- law? \nVERNON Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--? \nEDDIE But who's counting. \nVERNON (taking him in) Hey, you!!! \nHe genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms. Eddie halfheartedly whacks back. Vernon sizes Eddie up. \nVERNON (CONT'D) Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't you? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEddie didn't need that. He's very self-conscious about his weight. \nEDDIE Sedentary job, you know... \nVERN So you're still trying to write? \nEDDIE As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract. \nVern looks half suspicious, half impressed. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) How about you? (POINTEDLY) Still dealing, Vernon? \nVERNON (SMUGLY) Do I look like I'm still dealing? \nEddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut. \nEDDIE No. \nVERNON Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna hear about this book. \nEDDIE Nah, I should go-- \nVERN You can't tell me you're a health nut, now. Not with that tire- \nEDDIE (ANNOYED) Enticing invitation. Thanks. \nVern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket pocket. \nVERN C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't give `em back. \nHe holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nEDDIE It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern. \nVERN When's that ever stopped you? \nEDDIE (SIGHS) Fuck. \nINT. BAR - DAY \nA BARTENDER brings beers to Eddie and Vernon who sit at the bar. Eddie clearly wishes he were elsewhere. \nEDDIE So... how's Melissa? \nVERNON Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to the beer. \nEDDIE I'm making conversation, Vern. \nVERNON Well, I don't know how Melissa is. \nINT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT (AN ALMOST SUBLIMINAL FLASH) \nMelissa, naked, silhouetted in the bathroom door. BACK TO: \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nA slightly younger Eddie is flipping through the Lange book. \nEDDIE (V.O.) ...sitting on the couch of a T.A. I was trying to make, waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom... hoping she'd have a condom... \nBACK TO: \nINT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - LANDING - DAY \nEDDIE (V.0.) Somehow, my unconscious had served that up... a memory I'd never even recorded. Or was it there the whole time... and all I needed... was the access? \nON EDDIE'S FACE - CLOSE \nAs it sinks in: \nEDDIE (V.0.) Vern was right. This was no recreational drug. \nEddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner suddenly intimate, confident. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use. \nVALERIE Well, who asked y- \nEDDIE Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor. \nDuring this speech, MUSIC COMES UP and the sound goes down... SEVERAL QUICK CUTS... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEddie and Valerie's mouths are moving... she's asking questions... he's supplying answers, lots of them... \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary, was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information. \nValerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes becoming... friendly. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) She didn't have a chance. \nINT. THE DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT FROM EDDIE'S - NIGHT \nA mirror image of Eddie's, but considerably nicer. We HEAR the SOUNDS of two people -- Valerie and Eddie -- HAVING WILD, mutually satisfying SEX from the other room. \nEDDIE (V.0.) We'd really worked on her paper, too. In 45 minutes it was a polished gem. She was pleased. \nWe see the laptop set up, books scattered -- then, obviously abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) One nice little side effect...? I stayed hard for hours. \nWe HEAR female groans of pleasure. Laughter. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA dishevelled Eddie opens the door to his apartment. He enters, looks around. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Happy and sore, I returned home. \nEDDIE'S POV - HIS LIVING ROOM \nIt's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers home: what a mess. Books scattered across the floor, dirty dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes. The nest of a slob. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) ... But it couldn't be my home, could it? Who would live like this? \nMONTAGE: Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books and tapes. Cleaning up the kitchen. The bathroom. Picks up books. He starts moving the sofa. \nQUICK CUTS: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape. If not stylish, habitable. Final shot: he's sitting on the (repositioned) couch. Thinking. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it, I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours... \nHe stares at the pack in his hands. It looks alien. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) ...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious and tidy. What was this -- a drug for people who want to get anal? \nHe gets up. Paces. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just clear. What I needed to do. And how to do it. \nHis eye falls on his COMPUTER. \nThe MONTAGE CONTINUES: Eddie flipping through research books, typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing Internet searches... pages and pages spit out of the printer. \nINT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nEddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly. He stirs, rolls over, cracks open an eye. \nHe gets up, schlumps to the mirror, looks at his unshaven face. The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes. \nEDDIE (V.0.) The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain. No surge of brilliance came up to greet me. I felt thick and stupid -- a shuffling zombie without my coffee and cigarette. In short... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nVERNON It works better if you're already smart. \nEddie can't get over how bad Vernon looks. \nEDDIE VERN- \nVERN You don't want to know. \nAnd Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what happened. \nEDDIE What's... um... what's it called? \nVERN It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. And that's the way we want it to stay. The boys in the kitchen are calling it MDT-48. \nEDDIE \"The boys in the kitchen...?\" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved. \nVERN \"FDA-approved,\" that's a laugh. Did you really believe that shit? \nEddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Okay, so what did we have here? Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere, given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years. \nVERN So you want some more of it? \nEDDIE Yes. Definitely. \nVern chuckles. He knew it. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nVERN We'll talk about it. But first maybe you can do me a little favor. \nEDDIE Uh... sure. \nEddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern clearly has him by the balls. \nVERN You can see, I'm in no shape to go out right now. Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? And maybe pick me up a little breakfast...? \nEddie sighs. Vern tosses him a set of KEYS. \nINT. A DRY CLEANER'S AUTOMATED CLOTHING RACK - DAY \nAs the plastic-wrapped clothes spin towards us... \nEDDIE (V.0.) It was amazing how quickly it all slotted back into place... \nINT. A DINER GRIDDLE - DAY \nAs two eggs are flipped, over easy. \nEDDIE (V.0.) ..the dealer-client dynamic...... \nINT. VERNON'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nAnd here comes Eddie, carrying Vernon's suit, and greasy bag of breakfast... \nEDDIE (V.0.) ...the easy sacrificing of dignity for the guaranteed return of a dime bag, or a gram, or in this case a little pill that was going to cost me a month's rent. \nHe arrives at Vernon's door. He takes out the keys Vern gave him, but he doesn't need them. The DOOR is AJAR. \nINT. VERN'S APARTMENT - DAY - EDDIE'S POV \nAs Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting, quite normally, on the couch. As he enters the room, though, he sees that the place has been RANSACKED. Destroyed. \nEddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck. And then sees it. \nVERN'S FACE -CLOSE \nIn the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE. \nEDDIE \nis no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS HEART as he peeks in... \nINT. EDDIE'S POV - VERN'S BEDROOM \nIt's been ransacked, too. Torn to shreds, bureau drawers opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives. But no one is there. \nINT. VERNON'S DESK - DAY \nEddie's shaking hand can barely hold the phone. \nEDDIE Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't. \nHe puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands. \nVARIOUS CUTS OF: Eddie sitting. Shifting his butt in various positions. Holding a BASEBALL BAT he's found --just in case \"they\" come back. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It took them forever. And the longer I sat there, the clearer I saw... Vern had known whoever had done this. He'd opened the door. \nCLOSE ON - EDDIE'S FACE \nEDDIE (V.O.) I hadn't heard her voice in 10 years. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Right before. I'd just run into him on the street. \nMELISSA'S VOICE God. (BROKEN) This is all so weird... \nEDDIE Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with- \nMELISSA No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more. \nEDDIE Not on this line, no. \nA beat. Eddie still can't believe he's talking to her. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Melissa... maybe... (a deep breath) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: EDDIE (CONT'D) Do you want to... meet somewhere, or...? \nHe lets it hang in the air for a moment. \nMELISSA'S VOICE Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay? \nEDDIE Then... I'll see you at the funeral. \nMELISSA No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay? \nEDDIE Okay. \nA beat. Melissa's voice is wan, vulnerable. \nMELISSA'S VOICE Okay. \nShe's hung up. Gone. Eddie turns back to the detective who's staring intently at him. \nDETECTIVE Something doesn't jell here. \nEddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS. \nThey are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively. \nEDDIE (V.O.) But I knew, when his attention wandered to something more pressing, that he was going to let me go. \nEXT. PRECINCT - DAY \nEddie walks down the stairs, shaken up but profoundly relieved. Even a little giddy. Then he stops. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) Only then did it occur to me that someone could have followed me from Vern's apartment. \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nEddie walks, trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his shoulder. \nEDDIE'S POV - THE STREET \nIs this guy following him? That guy? They all look innocuous. They all look threatening. He has no idea. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEDDIE (V.0.) Probably not. Hopefully not. Worth the risk? \nEddie enters, and, casting a surreptitious look around, closes the door behind him. \nINT. EDDIE'S DINING TABLE - DAY \nThe cash, the address book, and the bottle of pills are all laid out on the table. Eddie sits, looking at them, realizing that his life is now about to be jump-started. Yeah. Worth the risk. A smile twitches at the corner of his mouth. \nMUSIC UP UNDER: \nEXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY \nEddie is walking down the street, a brisk confidence in his step, that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his eyes. We know right away that he's on MDT. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Back on MDT, it was obvious what I should do. \nINT. A HIP DOWNTOWN MENS STORE - DAY \nEddie is being fitted for a sharp looking jacket. The camera moves to the mirror and we are suddenly (CONTINUOUS SHOT) in-- \nINT. TRENDY DOWNTOWN SALON - DAY \nA hip, pretty girl is giving Eddie a haircut. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) Vern's cash... \nTHE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN... but instead of finding him the chair we are... \nINT. GYM - DAY \nEDDIE (V.0.) And it wasn't just women. I was, for the first time in my life, a presence... \nINT. ANOTHER BAR - ANOTHER NIGHT \nThe CAMERA circles around a European-looking crowd... that's clustered around Eddie. He's finishing a long story -in French. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Of course, all this seemed to work better with people I didn't know... than with people who knew me... \nINT. A MODEST QUEENS LIVING ROOM - DAY \nEddie's MOTHER and FATHER, working class schlubs, sit on the floral sofa, staring at their now-dapper son, who is waving some paperwork in their faces. \nEDDIE ...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock -- (realizing they're lost) Okay, remember when I explained default flops? Did any of that stick? (THEY'RE LOST) CDS's? CDO's CBO's? \nHis parents stare at him. They don't know what to make of any of this. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I quickly returned to the unfamiliar audience. \nINT. ANOTHER UPSCALE BAR - NIGHT \nA sizable crowd is around Eddie, including finance types in suits. \nEDDIE --Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years? \nA well-dressed broker - KEVIN DOYLE - shakes his head. \nKEVIN DOYLE No, no, there are safeguards-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature. \nEddie's tone isn't aggressive -- it's genial, amusing. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) We're wired to overreach -- you look at history, I mean, all the countries that ruled the world? Portugal? With its big, butch navy? All that's left is salt cod and cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they just sit on their dank little island, fussing over their suits. Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're doing pretty well, we've got Poland and France, and a big Swiss bank account -- let's not invade Russia in the winter! Let's go home and pop a beer and live off the interest! \nThe crowd laughs. Eddie takes a swallow of his drink. \nKEVIN DOYLE (smiles, gets it) Yeah. It'll all happen again. \nEddie toasts him. \nEDDIE Hey, I want in on it! \nKevin Doyle, wishing Eddie was right, clinks his glass. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) My brain was just pouring this stuff out. Everything I'd ever read, heard, seen, was now organized and available --here it is, here you go.. \nEXT. THE BAR - NIGHT \nEddie leaves with several people. Kevin Doyle presses a card into Eddie's hand. \nKEVIN DOYLE You must have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEddie politely takes his card. Smiles charmingly. \nEDDIE Thank you so much. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) \"I must have a portfolio.\" Very well -- if I must, I must. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEddie pulls out the broiler and removes the ENVELOPE OF CASH he's taped in there. It's much thinner. \nEDDIE (V.O.) But Vern's cash was low. And it takes cash to make cash... \nINT. MARK SUTTON'S OFFICE - DAY \nEddie stands opposite Mark's desk. \nEDDIE (V.O.) But it takes cash to make cash... \nAnother ELEGANT MAN is there too, Mark's boss, DUNHAM. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I'd like to re-negotiate my advance. \nDUNHAM Well... sit down, we'll be discussing that. \nMARK SUTTON First, ah... I want to apologize, Eddie, if I in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities. \nEddie smiles coolly. In control. It's Mark who's a little nervous. \nMARK SUTTON (CONT'D) Mr. Dunham has read your pages, and we're prepared to make you what I hope will be a very exciting offer. \nDUNHAM What would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEddie holds there gaze, expressionless, but says nothing. After an uncomfortable moment, Dunham continues. \nEDDIE I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened. \nGennady just looks at Eddie, thinking it over. \nINT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY \nEddie sits on a bench, waiting. Gennady appears. Hands Eddie a large paper bag. Eddie reaches for it; Gennady holds it aloft for one last second. \nGENNADY Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate. \nHe lets the full picture sink in for a moment. Then: \nINT. LAFAYETTE TRADING - DAY \nCubicle after cubicle of GUYS - all guys - at computers, rolling the dice on the stockmarket. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at a day- trading firm... \nEddie alone in a stall. He takes TWO MDT TABLETS out of his wallet, downs them. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I'd been upping the dose for over a week. It seemed to cut my learning curve. \nOVERLAPPING DISSOLVES of Eddie working at a furious pace. Another trader stands behind Eddie, watching. Second shot: three traders are watching. Third shot: nine traders are watching him, awed. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It was instinct. But informed instinct -- instinct based on huge amounts of research, which, thanks to MDT, was conducted more rapidly and comprehensively than anyone at Lafayette Day Trading would ever know... \nTRADER BEHIND HIM Why are you buying that? The CEO just got indicted... \nEDDIE But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week. \nThe trader shakes his head. How did Eddie know that? \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) At the end of the week my brokerage account contained... over a million dollars. \nINT. LAFAYTTE DAY TRADING - OVERHEAD SHOT OF ROOM -- \"GOD SHOT\"- \nAs still more people drift over to where Eddie is sitting... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.O.) I'd heard the old metaphors about the stock market: it was a collective nervous system, a global brain, a numerical representation of the will of God... \nEDDIE - CLOSE \nEyes taking in data, fingers reacting on the keyboard... \nEDDIE (V.O.) Whatever it was, I was jacked in, booted up - my mind was living tissue inside the greater, functioning whole. (BEAT) By the end of the second week I had 2.6 in the bank.... \nINT. LAFAYETTE DAY TRADING BUILDING - DAY \nEddie at the computer, soaking up information, making trades. Kevin Doyle stands behind Eddie, flabbergasted as he watches. \nEDDIE (V.0.) The word quickly got out. \nINT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK \nQuick cuts of Eddie playing back his messages: \nEDDIE'S MACHINE You have... 19 messages. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Four job offers... my bank, raising my line of credit... a reporter... \nFEMALE VOICE Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your cooperation... (BEEP!) \nEDDIE (V.0.) (SARDONIC) All my new friends. \nGENNADY'S VOICE ...you stupid shit, I be there Thursday for the money, ten o'clock! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEddie makes a jerk-off motion, crosses to his window, looks down. \nEXT. EDDIE'S POV - HIS STREET - DUSK \nThere is a MYSTERIOUS BLACK CAR just sitting at the curb, in front of his building. No one gets in or out. Eddie turns back to his machine. \nEDDIE (V.0.) And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to sound casual. \nKEVIN DOYLE'S VOICE Eddie, I was having drinks with a friend of mine, and... ah, you won't believe this... \nINT. A FANCY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nLindy, Eddie's ex-girlfriend, is sitting across the table from Eddie. She peers at him, confused. Is this dapper stranger really her shlumpy ex? \nLINDY Carl Van Loon wants to meet you? \nEDDIE Apparently he does. \nShe is pleased for him, but flabbergasted. \nEddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room. Boom. A skip in time. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Then... I found myself at the door. With no consciousness that I had moved. \nHe puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he has become. \nLINDY Are you all right? \nHe doesn't look all right. \nLINDA When was the last time you ate something? \nDully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog: \nEDDIE (V.O.) It had been three days. \nINT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT \nEddie sits at a table, discreetly wolfing a few appetizers. Kevin Doyle arrives, looking a little nervous. \nKEVIN Hey. \nHe sits, launches in. \nKEVIN (CONT'D) He'll be here in ten. Now look, since we have a minute, be warned: Van Loon's mercurial. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KEVIN (CONT'D) One minute your best friend, the next...you're a leper. And he needs direct answers... anything tentative and you've lost him forever. I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.. \nEDDIE I'm eating, Kevin. \nThere is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again. \nKEVIN You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line HERE- \nEDDIE Have a toast point. \nBrazening it out again. Because Eddie isn't sure he can pull this off either. \nACROSS THE ROOM - LATER \nThere is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man. \nEDDIE'S TABLE -LATER \nThe martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE, does the same. \nVAN LOON So. Eddie Morgan. \nHe looks Eddie directly in the eyes. \nVAN LOON (CONT'D) What's your secret? \nA beat. Eddie looks at him back, directly in the eyes. \nEDDIE Medication. I'm on special medication. \nAnother beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't. \nANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT \nEddie is in mid-spiel, Van Loon listening intently. \nEDDIE --Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING-- \nPIERCE (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) Pattern recognition? So that's your snake-oil? Look, if there's one thing we all understand, it's understanding itself --that's how the business works... (SCOFFING) Pattern recognition. Please. \nEDDIE (POINTEDLY) Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns. \nKevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights: \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze. \nPIERCE Until they weren't. \nEDDIE Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works. \nPIERCE (SCOFFING) And you have a formula. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nKEVIN (MEDIATING) Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days-- \nEDDIE Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce. \nPIERCE (SNORTING) Delusions of grandeur. \nEDDIE I don't have delusions of grandeur. \nA beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I have an actual recipe for grandeur. \nVAN LOON You're a gusty little prick, Eddie. \nEDDIE Ooh. Now you're curious. \nVAN LOON Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think. \nEDDIE (DISMISSIVE) It's getting late. \nVan Loon laughs. \nVAN LOON All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal. \nEddie nods. \nVAN LOON (CONT'D) And you better be prepared. \nEDDIE I'm at your disposal. \nEddie opens the car door. Van Loon eyes his building, scoffs. \nVAN LOON You don't really live here...? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nEddie smiles. \nEDDIE The Spartans weren't big on amenities. \nVAN LOON Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked. \nHe gets out. Van Loon drives off. \nEXT. EDDIE'S BLOCK - NIGHT \nEDDIE (V.0.) I didn't go in. \nEddie keeps walking by his building. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest... \nHis stride picks up, buoyantly. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) There are moments in life, moments when you know you've crossed a bridge, your old life is over. Van Loon was my bridge. One week, two weeks from now, I would be hobnobbing with ambassadors, flying to Dubai for meetings, blowing off supermodels, vacationing in Medici villas... And that too, was only a bridge... \nHe steps off the curb. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Suddenly... \nA SHARP, JARRING \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSTON STREET - NIGHT \nEddie is stepping off another curb, God knows where. \nEDDIE (V.0.) There was another skip. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe stops, rocked. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) How had I gone that last 20 blocks? I got another ten... \nON EDDIE WALKING... \nEDDIE (V.0.) ... then... \n...in mid-step... \nEXT. UPPER 5TH AVENUE - NIGHT \nEddie is walking past the Metropolitan Museum. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I was back uptown. \nA SHARP, JARRING CUT TO: \nINT. A CLUB - NIGHT \nEddie is suddenly sitting at a bar, picking up a drink, people around him... \nEDDIE (V.0.) What bar was this? Was it Harlem...? \nA SHARP, JARRING CUT TO: \nEddie is dancing with a BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN... \nEDDIE (V.0.) Same bar? Different bar? How long had passed...? \nHe breaks away from her, starts for the door... \nMALE VOICE Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital... (VOICE QUAKING) ...and he's really sick. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Oh my God. What's wrong with him? \nMALE VOICE We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Of all the people I called, three were dead, and the rest were sick. \nEddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white. \nThe man takes out his cell phone and answers. \nMAN'S VOICE Hello...? Hello...? \nThe man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and follows. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY \nEddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly can. \nHe still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He can't run fast. \nTan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling. \nEDDIE (V.0.) In the end, my stupidity saved me. \nEddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk. \nEDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK \nis barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it -- then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it. When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians, his last glimpse is of- \nEDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK \ndisappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a crowd. \nTAN COAT \nhesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given him the slip. This time. \nINT. CHARLIE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nEddie, limping, enters, looking around anxiously. \nEDDIE (V.0.) What was I dealing with? Who could tell me? I hoped against hope... that Melissa would show. \nEDDIE'S POV - SCANNING THE PLACE \nNot one person in it could possibly be Melissa. Eddie sighs. Turns to go. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Eddie...? \nEddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick- waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her... and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock on his face. \nEDDIE Melissa...? \nHe goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years. \nEddie tries to conceal his shock. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (CONT'D) You... how are you doing? \nMelissa responds with a cynical shrug. Then, she eyes him. \nMELISSA Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way... (BEAT) You look good. \nEDDIE I guess I lost some weight... \nMELISSA Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you. \nThey regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start. Old emotions. New emotions. Shock. Dismay. Affection. \nMELISSA (CONT'D) I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on. \nEddie doesn't know what to say. \nEDDIE Since when do you read the Post? \nMELISSA These days, the Post's about all I can read. \nWHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not by Tan Coat. \nBy GENNADY THE RUSSIAN. \nGENNADY You fucking forget about me? Huh? \nEddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight in his fist. \nEDDIE I... I... ahh... \nGENNADY One o'clock? And you not here?! Eddie tries to catch his breath. \nEDDIE I'm here now! \nINT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - ON THE DOOR \nThey come into his apartment, Eddie using all his energy to stay upright. \nEDDIE I'll get you a check. \nGennady turns to ice. \nGENNADY A check? A check?! You out of your fucking mind?! What you think we are, some financial institution? \nEddie realizes his brain isn't working --of course Gennady can't take a check. \nEDDIE Gennady, look- \nGENNADY I cut your balls off! \nEDDIE I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF! \nGennady has punched him in the stomach. Harder than he's ever been punched. Eddie gasps for breath... holds his fist to his body, protecting the pill. Gennady notices. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGENNADY What you got there? \nEDDIE NOTHING-- \nGennady grabs Eddie's wrist and wrenches his hand open. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) It's aspirin. \nGennady snatches the pill away from him. Examines it. \nGENNADY Don't look like no aspirin I ever see! \nHis voice drips with crude contempt. \nGENNADY (CONT'D) What is it? Something good, eh? \nIn one swift motion, Gennady pops it in his mouth and swallows it! \nEddie is mute with shock. \nINT. A BANK - CLOSE ON \nEddie's shaking hands are handing Gennady a thick envelope. \nEDDIE That's the whole thing, plus twenty. \nHe looks desperately ill. He can barely stand. Gennady, meanwhile, is coming on to MDT. \nGENNADY I feel good. What in that shit? \nEDDIE Aspirin and vitamins. \nGENNADY You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I know you lie about the movie script too. \nHe wants to hit Eddie again, but thinks the better of it with all the bank cameras. \nTHE MONITOR - \nWe see Gennady give the camera a gay little wave, then turn and walk out. \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nEddie lurches along the street, staggering like a drunk, barely able to walk. People avoid him, veering away. \nEDDIE (V.O.) I had to get my stash. \nINT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nLindy clearly has a mid-level executive job; her office is better than a cubicle and she has a bit of a view. There is a KNOCK. A FEMALE ASSISTANT appears in the door. \nFEMALE ASSISTANT Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him... \nEDDIE appears in the door, looking deathly ill. \nLINDY It's all right, Lisa. \nINT. LINDY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nLindy enters. Tense, panicked. She walks to a SQUARE END TABLE, takes the lamp off it. The table is actually a box -- she lifts the lid. She reaches in... and pulls out the PACKET OF MDT. \nLINDY You asshole... in my fucking HOUSE?! \nFurious, she stuffs it into her purse and goes for the door. \nEXT. LINDY'S BUILDING - DAY \nAs she leaves, we see that we are in the POV of... \nA MAN \nacross the street. He clicks open a CELL PHONE. \nINT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThere is a KNOCK on the DOOR. Lying on the floor, trying to breathe, Eddie ignores it. His PHONE rings again. It takes a lot of effort just to answer it. \nEDDIE Hi -- Have you got it? \nAnd we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN: \nINT. A MOVING CAB - DAY \nLindy is on the phone. Her voice is tense, terrified. \nLINDY Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me. \nEDDIE Are you sure? \nLINDY He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Don't get out. \nLINDY What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?! \nEDDIE Call the cops. \nLINDY (PANICKING) There's traffic. We're slowing down... (to the driver) Go around him! Go around! (TO EDDIE) Shit! We're stopped dead. (A GASP) He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here- \nEddie, helpless on the floor, can do nothing. \nEDDIE LINDY--!!! \nEXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY \nLindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's after her like a shot. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nLindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging, trying to find a place not to be seen. \nTAN COAT \nZig-zags too, not far behind her. \nLINDY \nBegins to scream, desperate: \nLINDY Help! Help!! \nUp ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against the side of the horse. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak. \nLINDY (CONT'D) There's... a... man... chasing me. He has a long, tan -- \nThe cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS and TWITCHES, his eyes flutter, glaze... and HE TOPPLES OFF HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody. LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY... comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS. Dives behind one of them. \nAhead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples, families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low, although she's hyperventilating. \nLINDY (CONT'D) Are you still there? \nAnd we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN: \nINT. LINDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nEDDIE Yes. What's happening? \nLINDY I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me! \nEDDIE Just be still, stop talking. \nLINDY He killed a cop-- \nEDDIE I can take care of you now. \nLINDY That was never what I wanted. \nEDDIE A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you. \nLindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely. \nLINDY You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty. \nShe gets up, turns away from him. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLINDY (CONT'D) I understand that stuff now, Eddie. And I don't blame you for taking it. No one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. Invincibility in a bottle. And I know I'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life. \nThere's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard before. A matter-of-fact chill. \nLINDY (CONT'D) But once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want to fuck up? Who'd want to be human? \nShe heads for the door. \nLINDY (CONT'D) I just came up to say goodbye. I don't ever want to see you again. I'm not even going to stay in New York. Don't try to find me, and don't try to help me. \nShe goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's done with him. \nEXT. W HOTEL - LATER \nEddie at the WINDOW, looking down... \nEXT. EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET \nHe sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting. \nEXT. W HOTEL - DAY \nGennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him. \nEDDIE Looking for me? \nGennady quickly gets aggressive: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGENNADY You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are? \nEDDIE I was under the impression that our business was settled. \nSomething is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink. \nGENNADY Walk. \nGennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the (deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie remains cool. \nEDDIE So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman. \nGENNADY I want some more of that shit. \nEDDIE What shit. \nGENNADY The pills. \nHe whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT, doesn't react. \nEDDIE Well, so do I. You took the last one. \nGENNADY So you get me more. \nEDDIE I can't get more -- the dealer's dead. \nNow Gennady smiles. \nGENNADY Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nEddie doesn't like that Gennady knows anything about his business life. But he stands his ground. \nEDDIE Nothing. I. Can. Do. \nGENNADY Make some calls. One hundred pills. \nEDDIE A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on-- \nThe gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin. \nGENNADY You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages. \nEDDIE I might... be able to get ten. \nGENNADY Ten. Fuck your ten. \nThe men nod. They understand. \nINT. EDDIE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY \nEddie straightens his tie. Then opens his suit jacket, reaches in, and pulls along a seam. An invisible POCKET OPENS. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out. \nINT. A LABORATORY - NIGHT \nThe place is state of the art, but it's an after-hours, furtive meeting Eddie is having with a TECHNICIAN, who passes back a small PLASTIC ENVELOPE to Eddie. In it we see SEVERAL TABLETS of MDT. \nTECHNICIAN Well, it's nothing you can cook up on a stove top. Whoever made it, it's a real pro act. \nEDDIE Can you make more? \nTECHNICIAN Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities? Yes. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TECHNICIAN (CONT'D) But the exact method of delivery to the brain...? Darts at a dartboard. \nEDDIE Meaning...? \nTECHNICIAN Clinical trials. Guinea pig people. \nEDDIE That's too long. \nTECHNICIAN It's what it is. Or you'll kill people. You need twelve, eighteen MONTHS-- \nEddie tosses the envelope back at him, gets up. \nEDDIE Two million dollars if you do it in six. \nHe holds up the packet. The guy considers. Then slowly reaches for it, taking the MDT back. \nINT . RESTAURANT - DAY \nEddie is having lunch with several POWER PLAYERS. They are listening, mesmerized, to what Eddie is saying... \nEDDIE (V.O.) It was all going to work out... \nHis eyes flicker upwards. His two SECURITY MEN are seated at the bar. The CAMERA PANS to find... Also seated at the bar, is the DETECTIVE who questioned Eddie at the police station! \nEddie gets up, \"casually\" wanders over to where the detective is sitting, pretends to order another drink. He does not make eye contact with the detective, or look like he's talking to him. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I thought we straightened this out, Detective. \nDETECTIVE This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morgan. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFear begins to prick the back of Eddie's neck. But he strives for casual annoyance. \nEDDIE What is it about? \nThe DETECTIVE hands Eddie a magazine. \nTHE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS - CLOSE \nIt is turned to the middle, and there is a picture of Eddie, candid, on the trading floor. That fucking article! \nDETECTIVE A witness identified the Donatella Alvarez suspect as this person. You want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June \nEddie keeps his cool, does not look scared. Wanders back to the table, says a few cool words, and strolls back to the detective. The detective gets up. Shall we go? \nEDDIE (V.0.) Luckily, I could now afford Morris Brandt, the best lawyer in New York. \nEXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY \nEddie walks down the steps, with a beautifully dressed shark lawyer, MORRIS BRANDT, 50's. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Time was bought, and I was released -- for now. \nEddie's two SECURITY GUYS, waiting, fall into step ten paces behind him. \nMORRIS BRANDT You're lucky somebody wiped the room. Weak circumstantial at best. Just between us -- were you there? \nEDDIE I don't remember. \nMORRIS BRANDT (SHRUGS) Busy life. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe's heard it all, and doesn't really care. \nINT. CARL VAN LOON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nEDDIE (V.0.) Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood remained unaware that soon, I would be in a witness lineup as a possible murderer. \nEddie is making a presentation to the Van Loon Associates -- and a skeptical-looking OLDER GUY -- HANK ATWOOD. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) ...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out... \nEDDIE (V.O.) It was, as it turned out, a good moment to move. \nEddie comes in. The room has been completely ripped to pieces -- just like Eddie's apartment. Eddie just smiles. Because there was nothing for anyone to find. \nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY \nEDDIE (V.O.) No one knew, or would ever know, that I now carried the pills with me at all times. \nEddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it. \nGennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Right away, it was obvious he was on MDT. \nGennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a cigarette. His movements are elegant, refined. \nGENNADY Next week...? I require twenty pills. \nEDDIE Next week? You can fuck yourself. (BEAT) Not that you'll feel anything. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady laughs, an unpleasant sound. \nGENNADY I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police? \nGennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his shoulder, with smug confidence: \nGENNADY (CONT'D) Thursday. You have them here. \nGennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR is waiting for him and his boys. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Obviously, this could not go on. But there is very little on this earth that 45 million dollars can't solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers. \nINT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DAY \nEddie, Van Loon and associates are all waiting in the conference room. The clock on the wall reads 9:40. Van Loon looks glum. A long silence. \nPIERCE Well, you want to call it? \nASSOCIATE #1 Cold feet. \nVAN LOON There was all last night to tell us that. \nVan Loon pushes the intercom. \nVAN LOON (CONT'D) No call? \nSECRETARY'S VOICE Not yet. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't. (BEAT) It's still on. \nPIERCE (SARCASTIC) Oh, based on your graphs and projections? \nEDDIE (CALMLY REPEATING) I saw his eyes: it's on. \nPIERCE You know, remind me: who the fuck, exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry, Carl, I'm about at the end with this unqualified, posturing little- \nVAN LOON Pull it back, Pierce. \nPIERCE Since when is this little pisher the fucking Delphi Oracle?! \nVAN LOON PIERCE- \nSECRETARY'S VOICE (INTERRUPTING) Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here. \nEddie and Van Loon look at each other. What? Van Loon nods at Eddie; the two men get up. Pierce starts to get up too. \nVAN LOON Pierce, you can stay. \nPierce looks bitter -- chastened -- as Van Loon and Eddie go. \nINT. CARL VAN LOON'S INNER OFFICE - DAY \nVan Loon and Eddie enter, to find MRS. HANK ATWOOD, a well- dressed, well-preserved and beautiful 50, standing at Van Loon's desk. \nMRS. ATWOOD I wanted this to be as confidential as possible. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nVan Loon and Eddie can't imagine what's coming next. \nMRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D) My husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning. He's at Lenox Hill, undergoing tests. \nShe speaks with great dignity, distraught, but tightly controlled. \nMRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D) Obviously, it wouldn't be in our best interests for this to be reported by the press, as it might put some of his interests at risk. I just want you to know that we have every intention of signing the contract, and, as soon as he is able, we will proceed. \nEXT. VAN LOON'S BUILDING - DAY \nGennady, wearing a gorgeous cashmere coat, waits, now with \nTHREE SECURITY GUYS. \nGennady looks at his watch, then says something low and sinister in Russian to his associates. \nEDDIE (V.O.) But I had more important business... \nINT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DUSK \nEddie hurries into the room. Van Loon doesn't look up. He's watching a monitor, which has a live news feed to a financial channel. \nFEMALE NEWSCASTER ...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger... \nVan Loon turns to Eddie, furious, agitated. \nVAN LOON Have you been talking to anyone? \nEDDIE Not a word, Carl. \nVAN LOON Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to VAPOR-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement. \nVAN LOON No. Atwood's in a coma. \nEDDIE A coma? \nBlack looks between them as the newscaster continues. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It had gotten out, somehow. But I felt thick, stupid, tired. A small pain was starting behind my eyes. I'd been unable to take my MDT, and I was overdue. \nHe shoots Van Loon a glance. Van Loon is miserably fixated on the TV. \nINT. VAN LOON'S HUGE, SLEEK BATHROOM - DUSK \nEddie stands in a stall. Reaches into the lining of his coat. Unfastens the opening of the compartment. \nCLOSE ON THE OPENING \nThere is nothing inside. \nEDDIE, \npanicked, feels again. Nothing. The MDT is simply not there!!! He begins to hyperventilate. Spin in place. Push against the stall walls, trying not to scream. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The police station? A coat room? How? How? \nHe bursts from the stall, alone in the bathroom. Stares at himself, terrified, in the mirror. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) In an hour I'd be useless. In two I'd be sick. In 24, dead. \nINT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEddie bursts from the bathroom. Trying not to look too wild- eyed. \nVAN LOON Eddie--? This came for you. \nEddie looks at a LARGE BOX on Van Loon's desk. Indeed, his name is on it. Eddie, mystified, approaches it. As Van Loon continues to stare at the TV, disinterested in the box, Eddie gingerly opens it. \nINT. THE BOX - CLOSE \nInside are the SEVERED HANDS OF EDDIE'S SECURITY GUYS. (One black hand, one with the distinctive tattoos.) Gennady. Clearly these guys are dead. Eddie grabs the box and starts from the room. \nVAN LOON What are you doing, Eddie--? EDDIE--!!! \nBut Eddie's gone. \nINT. VAN LOON ASSOCIATES - DUSK \nPeople are leaving for the night. Eddie shoves past them, still holding the damning box, frightened, jacked up, desperate, shoving people out of the way to get to the elevators. \nINT. A LIMO - NIGHT - MOVING \nEddie sits in the back seat, the box freakishly sitting beside him. \nEDDIE (V.O.) I couldn't think. \nON EDDIE'S FACE \nHis brow is beaded with sweat. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Only MDT could help me. I had no MDT. And then... \nPUSH IN on Eddie's eyes. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) One thought. (BEAT) Was there anywhere... \nGENNADY (CONT'D) See, I dissolve pill in solution. You shoot it - goes straight into blood and to brain. Works much better. \nHe pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in the arm and injects the cloudy liquid. \nGENNADY (CONT'D) Now. Where do you keep yours? \nEddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go. \nEDDIE I'm plum out. \nGennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone. \nGENNADY They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nHe clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with sinister-looking silver instruments, and knives. \nINT. EDDIE'S STUDY - NIGHT \nThug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a SAFE. He calls excitedly, in Russian, to the other room. \nINT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nGennady calls back in Russian. Then picks up a particularly delicate, yet sharp-looking KNIFE. \nGENNADY This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate... \nEddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments. \nGENNADY (CONT'D) First, I will cut skin from you, flay you... you stay alive nice long time... then maybe we cut meat from you, steaks... or maybe softer parts... I get inspiration... \nHe looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on Eddie. \nON EDDIE \nStaring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and the knife is gone. \nGENNADY \nsenses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically. \nGENNADY (CONT'D) WHAT-- \nEddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes, writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet knife... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing. His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead. \nEddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted. \nFrom the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill -- the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie tries to get up, then falls back. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Not much of a triumph, was it? \nHe's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks back to the floor... \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Because I would die here, too. \nThere is a break in the convulsion. Then another one starts. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Only MDT could help me, and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream... \nGennady's BLOOD wells around Gennady's body in a crimson puddle. A puddle that's creeping closer and closer to Eddie's face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor... \nON EDDIE'S EYES \nbetween convulsions, suddenly looking. Looking at the blood. It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move, trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there... \nAnd now he turns his face down into the blood. \nAnd begins to lap it up. \nINT. EDDIE'S STUDY - DAY \nThe Thug finally gets the safe open. Inside is only one item - -the TATTOOED SECURITY MAN's SEVERED HAND. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAnd its middle finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck- you. The thugs are not amused. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe thugs are coming down the hall, muttering angrily... \nINT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMouth smeared with blood, Eddie is dragging himself by the elbows, across the room. Footsteps coming. Fast. \nINT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - THUGS' POV \n", "test1_input": "He turns off his phone, gets up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nVERN (CONT'D) Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you here, Eddie. But let's hang out again, have another beer. \nHe takes out his business card, and places it carefully next to the little white tablet on the bench. \nVERN (CONT'D) By the way, that's on the house. \nEDDIE I don't want it, Vern. \nVern smiles at him. \nVERN Don't be ungrateful, now. You know how much these things cost? \nEddie shakes his head. \nVERN (CONT'D) Eight hundred bucks a pop. \nHe pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still looking at the pill. \nWhich seems to be looking back at him. \nEXT. THE STREET - DUSK \nEddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self- loathing. \nEDDIE (V.O.) All the way home she was back on my mind ... Melissa. \nFLASH! \nA memory -- Melissa's face as she's talking, laughing. \nEDDIE (V.O.) She'd been so smart. Smarter than anyone around her. And oh, how she loved to provoke people... \nINT. A DOWNTOWN PARTY - PARTY - NIGHT \nMelissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types. \nMELISSA --Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--! \nThe men gasp, shocked and titillated. The women are furious. Melissa smiles to herself --she's trying not to crack up. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I thought, by now, she'd be curing cancer, directing movies, running for the Senate... \nWe HOLD ON MELISSA'S LOVELY, CONFIDENT FACE as her voice fades down and Eddie's fades in. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) What had happened? Her life made no sense. I mean, I could see a direct, plausible link between this Eddie, broke and buzzed at three o'clock in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie... \nINT. A DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN BEHIND A DESK - DAY \n--getting SPLATTERED by some ochre liquid from an offscreen source. \nEDDIE (V.0.) ...vomiting on his boss' desk during a presentation... \nINT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA YOUNGER, THINNER EDDIE rifles through a bureau, an old lady in bed, sleeping, behind him --an oxygen mask on her. She's clearly terminal. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) ... or stealing his dying Aunt's Percocet. \nEXT. THE STREET - DUSK \nEddie walks, pensive. \nEDDIE (V.0.) But there was no link between my Melissa and this upstate Melissa dumped, cold-calling people from her living room. \nEXT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - DUSK \nAn edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower Manhattan. This block may never be gentrified. \nEDDIE (V.O.) 40 long blocks later I was \"home.\" \nHe digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with... \nTHE LITTLE WHITE PILL \nINT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK \nIt's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years of paint. \nEddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad, and he knows he looks bad. \nHe reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the palm of his hand, looking up at him. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Well. There was less than nothing to lose. \nQuickly, impulsively, he swallows it. \n", "test1_true": "As Eddie passes, a neighbor's door swings open. Eddie tries walking faster. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I didn't want to see anybody. \nVALERIE, 26 and attractive, emerges, dressed to go out. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife. \nShe is immediately soured at the sight of Eddie. Eddie knows what she's thinking. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Tuesday. \nVALERIE Look, enough, okay--? \nEDDIE Just tell him- \nVALERIE Steve handles the rents. So feed your fucking bullshit to him. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her. I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance. \nValerie's tirade FADES up or down, depending on when we're hearing Eddie. \nVALERIE --Like the rent's not low enough--! \nEDDIE (V.0.) I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon about what this drug would do. \nVALERIE You could be a bike messenger and come up with that! \nEddie continues up the stairs. But she follows, getting in front of him. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.O.) ...What if it was a hallucinogen... oh my God... listening to her rag, if I were tripping...? I'd jump out a fucking window. \nVALERIE'S voice fades up. \nVALERIE --Look, I'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- I've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed. \nWe PUSH IN on Eddie's face, into his eyes... where we see his pupils contract just slightly. A flicker. \nEDDIE (V.0.) And then... I felt it. \nEDDIE'S POV - THE APARTMENT UPPER HALL... \nThe room is changing... springing into sharper focus. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Levels more, layers more, 3-D more... galactically more. But the same. Just the depth and beauty... of clarity. \nThere seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little more light -- he can see more clearly. The SOUND drops out for a moment; he can see VALERIE'S FACE, mouth contorted, continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her eyes that's not mean... something anxious.He looks at her with a sudden keen intelligence. And sympathy. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nShe's taken aback. \nVALERIE W-What? \nHis eyes go to THE BOOK BAG in her arms. \nEDDIE \"I was blind but now I see.\" \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nOn a gut instinct, Eddie takes a shot, pushing his words forward with a new, sharp, penetrating intimacy, articulateness. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) You don't like me, and I don't blame you -- you see a schlumpy energy- sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband. You're hoping I'll blow my brains out. But my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it? \nHe's hit a nerve. \nVALERIE Look, that's none of your- \nEDDIE Something wrong at school? \nVALERIE How do you know I'm in school! \nHis eyes flick down at her bag. \nEDDIE People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange. \nVALERIE Are you some kind of creep? Have you been following me?! \nEDDIE I just saw the book-- \nVALERIE You can only see a corner of it. How did you know? \nHe looks down. She's right --only a corner of the book is visible. Eddie realizes: \nEDDIE I've seen it before. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It was true. 12 years ago. In college... \n", "test1_id": 228, "test2_input": "KEVIN Yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now -- he'll never give you this chance again! \nEDDIE I need to, ah, analyze this data- \nWe see the two men continue to talk, Kevin growing more agitated, Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR: \nEDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Already I recognized it... the thick tongue, the leaden synapses. It was regular Eddie - the Eddie that, now, was unbearable to be. \nWe FADE UP THE SOUND on the two men: \nKEVIN ... Don't you get it?! This is your test--! \nEDDIE Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now! \nKEVIN And how am I going to look if you don't? \nEddie looks pretty bad. He massages his temples. \nEDDIE Okay, Kevin. Okay. \nHe hands up on a still-yammering Doyle. He picks up the MDT pill, looks at it. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It was my first morning off MDT in a month. The beginnings of a headache was curling around my head like a big fat, greasy python. \nAgain, he looks at the MDT tablet, weighing his options. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) But the time-skips had me scared. \nHe puts the tablet back down on the table. \nINT. THE REGENCY HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY \nEddie walks in, much more tentative in his stride, fear in his eyes. This is the real Eddie, the non-MDT Eddie and he feels suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling antique Persian carpets. \nEDDIE (V.O.) My thought -- such as I had one -- was to tap dance with Van Loon until I could find out more about MDT. \nINT. BAR AREA - DAY \nEddie sits on a couch, Pierce on another chair, Van Loon opposite, watching him. \nVAN LOON What do you know about Hank Atwood? \nEDDIE Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado... \nHe's struggling. \nVAN LOON Uh-huh. So this is \"prepared,\" Eddie? \nHe shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt. Eddie holds the stare and shoots a look back. \nEDDIE What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood. \nVAN LOON Where was he two years ago? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nA flash of panic in Eddie's eyes. What's the right answer? \nEDDIE Nowhere. \nAn agonizing pause. Then Van Loon nods. \nVAN LOON Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar. \nEDDIE Yeah, his Great Leap Forward. \nEddie is faking it. Pierce is looking at him intently. But Eddie's staying afloat. \nVAN LOON The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money. \nEddie's glance flicks to the TV behind the bar. A WOMAN'S PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it. It's the ITALIAN WOMAN he met last night! \nVAN LOON (CONT'D) ...Always picks green technologies, invests in them, and a year later he owns them. \nEddie strains to hear the ANCHORWOMAN'S VOICE... \nANCHORWOMAN ... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play. \nEddie tries to keep his face immobile. Van Loon's voice drones on, distorted now, as we HEAR Eddie's heart pounding. \nVAN LOON ...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game. \nANCHORWOMAN An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D) Anyone with information should contact local law enforcement authorities. --Steve? \nEddie bolts upright. \nVAN LOON You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team. \n", "test2_true": "EDDIE Excuse me. \nEddie dashes out. Van Loon and Pierce look at each other. \nEXT. THE REGENCY - NIGHT \nEddie bursts from the door, VOMITS into the gutter. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I couldn't have. \nHe leans against a street sign, trying to right himself. He gasps for breath. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) ...or could I? \nINT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nEddie comes in, breathing wildly, panicked. \nEDDIE (V.O.) If I could walk, talk, conduct business, seduce a woman, fight-- with no memory... could I kill someone? Was it even me? Who was I?! \nImmediately the PHONE RINGS. He nearly jumps out of his skin. He can't answer. He sits on the couch, head in his hands, rocking, as it rings. Finally, the machine picks up. \nMELISSA'S VOICE Hi, Eddie... it's Melissa. Listen, call me back as soon as you-- \nEddie lunges for the phone, picks it up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Melissa--? \nMELISSA (surprised he picked up) Eddie--? \nEDDIE Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere... \nMELISSA We're talking now. \nEDDIE Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two. \nMELISSA You can't see me, Eddie. \nEDDIE Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about! \nBut she's already hung up. \nCLOSE ON - EDDIE'S DRESSER DRAWER - DAY \nEddie's hands rummage through everything... \nEDDIE (V.0.) I realized that there were other people who might know about MDT... \nHis hands find what they're looking for. Vernon's LITTLE BLACK BOOK. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Vernon's other clients. \nINT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nEddie sits on the bed, the black book open on his knees. Eddie looks at the page, then reaches for the telephone. Picks it up. Hears STRANGE CLICKS over the dial tone. \nHe puts down the phone, fear on his face. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY \nEddie walks, slipping through the crowd, trying to suppress his limp... he looks nervously behind him... is that MAN in the TAN RAINCOAT following him? He tries to walk faster, but it makes his limp more pronounced. He turns the corner. He seems to have lost the guy. \nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY \nEddie sits on a park bench, making calls on his cell phone. \nEDDIE Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (SUSPICIOUS) Who is this? \nEDDIE I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Look... my husband died three days ago. \nEddie is floored. \nEDDIE I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEddie has dialled another number. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I, ah, may I speak to Jerry Brady? \nMALE VOICE Jerry's in -- who's this? \nEDDIE Uh-- Bill Johnson. \n", "test2_id": 229, "test3_input": "REUBEN John Steadman's in there. \nEDDIE Who's that? \nREUBEN --Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're your biggest contributor, give him his two shitty little minutes. \nEddie sighs, capitulating. Puts his hand on the door. \nEDDIE Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research? \nREUBEN Pharmaceuticals. \nEddie shoots him a look. \nINT. A LARGE, CASUAL OFFICE - DAY \nEddie comes in to find JOHN STEADMAN, 50's, well-dressed and gentlemanly, waiting. \nSTEADMAN Mr. Morgan. \nEDDIE Nice to see you. \nHe shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd. In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye that Eddie doesn't recognize. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) We appreciate everything you've done for us-- \nSTEADMAN Well, you've done most of it for yourself. Senator Morgan. \nHe says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. And suddenly, we know he's right. Eddie will win. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) I mean, everything from here's a technicality, isn't it, Eddie? \nAgain, that smile. Eddie doesn't know what this guy is about. And nobody calls him \"Eddie\" any more. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) I think we both know where it's heading... (A BEAT) If... you can maintain. \nEDDIE Maintain? \nSTEADMAN Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you. \nEddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he said? \nEDDIE What are you saying? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSTEADMAN We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week. \nEddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is he really talking to someone who makes MDT?! \nEDDIE Have you been watching me from the beginning? \nSTEADMAN No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us. \nEDDIE Who's \"us?\" \nSteadman just smiles, waves the question away. \nSTEADMAN You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting. \nEDDIE How did it get on the street? \nSTEADMAN Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it. \nMeaning, they took care of Vern. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) It will never again be on the street. It will never publicly exist. Obviously I don't need to detail the advantages for you. \nA long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit. \nEDDIE And what about for you? Why don't you take it? \nSTEADMAN We don't have to. You'll take it for us. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nEDDIE And in return...? I do what. \nSTEADMAN Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first. \nEDDIE And later...? What will you be \"bothering\" me with? \nSTEADMAN Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable. \nEddie takes that in. \nEDDIE And if I don't like your ideas? \nSTEADMAN Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light. \nEddie knows now. They own his ass. \n", "test3_true": "EDDIE Luckily I can do that myself. \nSTEADMAN Well, no, ah, that won't be the case. We shut your lab down this morning. \nEDDIE My lab? \nSteadman nods. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Which one? \nSteadman doesn't blink. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nSTEADMAN All of them. \nEDDIE You sure? \nSteadman suddenly chuckles -- not at all concerned by this. Even amused. \nSTEADMAN We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement. (BEAT) Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving... \nHe heads for the door. Eddie remains still. \nEDDIE Tell me something. \nSteadman stops, looks back at him. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Did I kill that woman? \nSteadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask. \nSTEADMAN Do you really want to know? \nEddie thinks. No, he doesn't. \nEXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY \nEddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep in thought. \nSTEADMAN It's not so bad, is it? \nEddie doesn't answer. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind- drag of compromise? \nA black LIMO waits at the curb. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the Constitution could stand a little tweaking... \nThey descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo door for Eddie... \nBut Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Eddie? \nEDDIE After you. \nSTEADMAN (CORDIAL) No, \"Senator\". You first. \nEddie gestures for him to get in. \nEDDIE Please. \nSTEADMAN All right then... \nHe gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled- down window, his face a cold mask. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Oh, now. Don't underestimate us. \nEDDIE Don't underestimate your own creation. \nSteadman looks at him quizically. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) EDDIE (CONT'D) You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private? \nSTEADMAN You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making. \nEDDIE You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours. \nSTEADMAN You'll run out. You'll die. \nEDDIE Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it. \nA flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger. \n", "test3_id": 230}

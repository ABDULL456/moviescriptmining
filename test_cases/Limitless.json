(BROKEN) This is all so weird... \nEDDIE Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with- \nMELISSA No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more. \nEDDIE Not on this line, no. \nA beat. Eddie still can't believe he's talking to her. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Melissa... maybe... (a deep breath) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: EDDIE (CONT'D) Do you want to... meet somewhere, or...? \nHe lets it hang in the air for a moment. \nMELISSA'S VOICE Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay? \nEDDIE Then... I'll see you at the funeral. \nMELISSA No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay? \nEDDIE Okay. \nA beat. Melissa's voice is wan, vulnerable. \nMELISSA'S VOICE Okay. \nShe's hung up. Gone. Eddie turns back to the detective who's staring intently at him. \nDETECTIVE Something doesn't jell here. \nEddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS. \nThey are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively. \nEDDIE (V.O.) But I knew, when his attention wandered to something more pressing, that he was going to let me go. \nEXT. PRECINCT - DAY \nEddie walks down the stairs, shaken up but profoundly relieved. Even a little giddy. Then he stops. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) Only then did it occur to me that someone could have followed me from Vern's apartment. \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nEddie walks, trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his shoulder. \nEDDIE'S POV - THE STREET \nIs this guy following him? That guy? They all look innocuous. They all look threatening. He has no idea. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEDDIE (V.0.) Probably not. Hopefully not. Worth the risk? \nEddie enters, and, casting a surreptitious look around, closes the door behind him. \nINT. EDDIE'S DINING TABLE - DAY \nThe cash, the address book, and the bottle of pills are all laid out on the table. Eddie sits, looking at them, realizing that his life is now about to be jump-started. Yeah. Worth the risk. A smile twitches at the corner of his mouth. \nMUSIC UP UNDER: \nEXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY \nEddie is walking down the street, a brisk confidence in his step, that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his eyes. We know right away that he's on MDT. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Back on MDT, it was obvious what I should do. \nINT. A HIP DOWNTOWN MENS STORE - DAY \nEddie is being fitted for a sharp looking jacket. The camera moves to the mirror and we are suddenly (CONTINUOUS SHOT) in-- \nINT. TRENDY DOWNTOWN SALON - DAY \nA hip, pretty girl is giving Eddie a haircut. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.)

EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHe sits at his computer, a salad beside him. His printer spits out page after page of manuscript. \nEDDIE ...enabled me to finish the book in four days. \nINT. MARK SUTTON'S OFFICE - DAY \nEddie puts down a thicker manila envelope on Mark's desk. Mark is astonished. \nINT. A SUGAR BOWL ON EDDIE'S TABLE - DAY \nIt contains ten tablets of MDT. Eddie's fingers reach in, take one. \nEDDIE (V.0.) A tablet a day... kept the torpor away. And what I could do with my day... was limitless. \nINT. THE MET - DAY \nEddie surveys paintings. \nEDDIE (V.O.) I now had cultural appetites. \nINT. A PIANO CONCERT - DAY \nEddie sits attentively in the audience, reading the score along with the music. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Learned to read music in a week... \nINT. THE EAST RIVER - DAY \nEddie runs, earphones on his head. We HEAR, dimly, French phrases. \nEDDIE V.0. Even half-listening to any language, I became fluent... \nEddie becomes aware that there's ANOTHER RUNNER --a powerful- looking man, gaining on him, closer behind than makes him comfortable. Eddie flicks a glance over his shoulder. \nEDDIE (V.0.) The only cloud was the nagging feeling I was being followed. \nWith a surge of effort, Eddie speeds up, sprinting across the street just after the light changes. WHIZZING TRAFFIC cuts the mysterious runner off, stops him from following. He remains, panting, at the light. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Was I? Or did MDT create paranoia? \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY - (SERIES OF SHOTS) \nEDDIE (V.0.) The focal point of my existence quickly became... protecting my stash. \nCLOSE ON: the plastic baggie of pills being DUCT TAPED inside the top of EDDIE'S BROILER. He SLAMS the broiler closed. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Call it a homage. \nINT. A BAR - NIGHT \nEddie stands there, in his new clothes, holding court. He has an entirely new aura. It's commanding. \nEDDIE (V.0.) I had a new, improved game. \nHe banters flirtatiously with a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) (PLAYFULLY) So you're saying that any author who's commandeered adjective status, \"Orwellian, Dickensian--\"? \nBEAUTIFUL WOMAN --is prosaic. Yes. \nEDDIE Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim- \nBEAUTIFUL WOMAN OR ZEITGEIST- \nEDDIE So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity? \nBEAUTIFUL WOMAN I... \nShe breaks off, shrugs, smiles. \nEDDIE Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships? \nHe puts a finger under her chin. He means her face, of course. The woman smiles, and blushes. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Fish in a barrel. \nINT. UPSCALE BAR BATHROOM - (UNISEX, FOR ONE PERSON) NIGHT \nTIGHT SHOT (LEGS ONLY) OF this regal, upscale women's panties down around her high heels and Eddie's legs between hers, pumping. A VASE shatters to the floor beside their feet, spilling its pricey orchids. \n", "test1_id": 228, "test2_input": "Gennady, wearing a gorgeous cashmere coat, waits, now with \nTHREE SECURITY GUYS. \nGennady looks at his watch, then says something low and sinister in Russian to his associates. \nEDDIE (V.O.) But I had more important business... \nINT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DUSK \nEddie hurries into the room. Van Loon doesn't look up. He's watching a monitor, which has a live news feed to a financial channel. \nFEMALE NEWSCASTER ...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger... \nVan Loon turns to Eddie, furious, agitated. \nVAN LOON Have you been talking to anyone? \nEDDIE Not a word, Carl. \nVAN LOON Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to VAPOR-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement. \nVAN LOON No. Atwood's in a coma. \nEDDIE A coma? \nBlack looks between them as the newscaster continues. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It had gotten out, somehow. But I felt thick, stupid, tired. A small pain was starting behind my eyes. I'd been unable to take my MDT, and I was overdue. \nHe shoots Van Loon a glance. Van Loon is miserably fixated on the TV. \nINT. VAN LOON'S HUGE, SLEEK BATHROOM - DUSK \nEddie stands in a stall. Reaches into the lining of his coat. Unfastens the opening of the compartment. \nCLOSE ON THE OPENING \nThere is nothing inside. \nEDDIE, \npanicked, feels again. Nothing. The MDT is simply not there!!! He begins to hyperventilate. Spin in place. Push against the stall walls, trying not to scream. \nEDDIE (V.0.) Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The police station? A coat room? How? How? \nHe bursts from the stall, alone in the bathroom. Stares at himself, terrified, in the mirror. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) In an hour I'd be useless. In two I'd be sick. In 24, dead. \nINT. VAN LOON'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEddie bursts from the bathroom. Trying not to look too wild- eyed. \nVAN LOON Eddie--? This came for you. \nEddie looks at a LARGE BOX on Van Loon's desk. Indeed, his name is on it. Eddie, mystified, approaches it. As Van Loon continues to stare at the TV, disinterested in the box, Eddie gingerly opens it. \nINT. THE BOX - CLOSE \nInside are the SEVERED HANDS OF EDDIE'S SECURITY GUYS. (One black hand, one with the distinctive tattoos.) Gennady. Clearly these guys are dead. Eddie grabs the box and starts from the room. \nVAN LOON What are you doing, Eddie--? EDDIE--!!! \nBut Eddie's gone. \nINT. VAN LOON ASSOCIATES - DUSK \nPeople are leaving for the night. Eddie shoves past them, still holding the damning box, frightened, jacked up, desperate, shoving people out of the way to get to the elevators. \nINT. A LIMO - NIGHT - MOVING \nEddie sits in the back seat, the box freakishly sitting beside him. \nEDDIE (V.O.) I couldn't think. \nON EDDIE'S FACE \nHis brow is beaded with sweat. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Only MDT could help me. I had no MDT. And then... \nPUSH IN on Eddie's eyes. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) One thought. (BEAT) Was there anywhere... \n", "test2_true": "EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) ... anywhere at all...I could have left one pill...? \nWe STOP at the END TABLE in Lindy's apartment, peer inside. Empty. We STOP at the UNDERSIDE of the GRILL on Eddie's old stove. Nothing. We continue to REWIND -- but every image we stop on reveals... nothing. \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I had to keep thinking. Somewhere safe... \nINT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEddie sits at his huge new steel dining table, the evil box on the table in front of him, head in his hands. \n(The room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a chance to unpack.) The TV is on in the background. It's a financial channel. We see MRS. HANK ATWOOD is giving a statement. \nMRS. HANK ATWOOD There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger. None whatsoever. My husband is having some tests, this is a difficult time, and I would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney... \nShe motions at the gentleman next to her. --Who is also Eddie's attorney, MORRIS BRANDT. The one who was so helpful with the police. The one who held his jacket. \nBitter amusement in Eddie's eyes. At least he knows. The APARTMENT BUZZER buzzes. Eddie freezes. Looks at the door. It BUZZES again. \nEDDIE (V.0.) It wasn't downstairs security, alerting me to a visitor. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) It was my inner door. Someone was in the building, ten feet away, right now. \nEddie walks to his phone, picks it up. Pushes the button, puts it to his ear. It's dead. \nHe pushes the \"on\" button again and again. Nothing. The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie rushes to the door, opens the COAT CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR. \nGennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor. Nothing. Eddie flicks the switch again. It's dead. Someone, somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it. \nThe buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie backs away from the door. We HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. He lunges for his briefcase, pulls out his CELL PHONE. \nTHE CELL PHONE - CLOSE \nIt reads \"No Signal.\" BAM! The first slam on the door begins. BAM! The second. The door holds, but Eddie begins to back away in horror. \nBAM! \nWe slowly FADE TO BLACK. And FADE IN ON: \nEXT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S TERRACE LEDGE - NIGHT \nEDDIE (V.O.) And so... here I am. \nAnd now we pick up Eddie where we left him, standing on the ledge. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) I knew they would kill me, slowly and horribly. But this choice would at least be mine. \nWe now hear the ZZZZZZZZ! of some major power tool drilling at the door, punctuated by more BAMS! -- one way or another they're going to get in. Eddie takes a breath, tries to jump. He can't. \nEDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) So, my foggy brain tried to remember... where one tablet of MDT... might be. \nWe PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes... We are still REWINDING in Eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep MDT... nothing... nothing... nothing... We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on Eddie's dining table. Then go forward --no, wait!-rewinding, stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL. Pushing in on the sugar bowl. \nEddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes intense. \nEDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was possible. And possible was enough. \nINT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEddie is tearing through boxes as the POUNDING and DRILLING become deafening... he rips open a box labeled \"Kitchen\" - it's full of BOOKS. Mis-labeled. JUMP CUTS as he rips open other boxes... his hands frantically scattering CDs, cutlery, cans of food... The door begins to give. Under the deafening DRILL: \nMORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on the other side... \nEDDIE'S HAND \npokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside, revealing at the bottom of the bowl- \nONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him. \nYes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down. \nEddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as he steps, he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he's scattered... he FALLS backwards... his HAND hits the side of the coffee table... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe MDT TABLET goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they advance into the room... THE MDT TABLET... flies... flies... towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the grate. \nEddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the terrace... for his suicide leap... \nThug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the two Thugs. \nGENNADY I told you I want more. You don't listen. Maybe you think I'm joking... \nHe reaches into his coat pocket... \nGENNADY (CONT'D) But I'm down to this last one. \n...and pulls out a syringe. \n", "test2_id": 229, "test3_input": "REUBEN John Steadman's in there. \nEDDIE Who's that? \nREUBEN --Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're your biggest contributor, give him his two shitty little minutes. \nEddie sighs, capitulating. Puts his hand on the door. \nEDDIE Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research? \nREUBEN Pharmaceuticals. \nEddie shoots him a look. \nINT. A LARGE, CASUAL OFFICE - DAY \nEddie comes in to find JOHN STEADMAN, 50's, well-dressed and gentlemanly, waiting. \nSTEADMAN Mr. Morgan. \nEDDIE Nice to see you. \nHe shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd. In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye that Eddie doesn't recognize. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) We appreciate everything you've done for us-- \nSTEADMAN Well, you've done most of it for yourself. Senator Morgan. \nHe says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. And suddenly, we know he's right. Eddie will win. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) I mean, everything from here's a technicality, isn't it, Eddie? \nAgain, that smile. Eddie doesn't know what this guy is about. And nobody calls him \"Eddie\" any more. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) I think we both know where it's heading... (A BEAT) If... you can maintain. \nEDDIE Maintain? \nSTEADMAN Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you. \nEddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he said? \nEDDIE What are you saying? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSTEADMAN We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week. \nEddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is he really talking to someone who makes MDT?! \nEDDIE Have you been watching me from the beginning? \nSTEADMAN No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us. \nEDDIE Who's \"us?\" \nSteadman just smiles, waves the question away. \nSTEADMAN You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting. \nEDDIE How did it get on the street? \nSTEADMAN Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it. \nMeaning, they took care of Vern. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) It will never again be on the street. It will never publicly exist. Obviously I don't need to detail the advantages for you. \nA long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit. \nEDDIE And what about for you? Why don't you take it? \nSTEADMAN We don't have to. You'll take it for us. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nEDDIE And in return...? I do what. \nSTEADMAN Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first. \nEDDIE And later...? What will you be \"bothering\" me with? \nSTEADMAN Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable. \nEddie takes that in. \nEDDIE And if I don't like your ideas? \nSTEADMAN Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light. \nEddie knows now. They own his ass. \n", "test3_true": "EDDIE Luckily I can do that myself. \nSTEADMAN Well, no, ah, that won't be the case.

Even amused. \nSTEADMAN We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement. (BEAT) Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving... \nHe heads for the door. Eddie remains still. \nEDDIE Tell me something. \nSteadman stops, looks back at him. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Did I kill that woman? \nSteadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask. \nSTEADMAN Do you really want to know? \nEddie thinks. No, he doesn't. \nEXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY \nEddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep in thought. \nSTEADMAN It's not so bad, is it? \nEddie doesn't answer. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind- drag of compromise? \nA black LIMO waits at the curb. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the Constitution could stand a little tweaking... \nThey descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo door for Eddie... \nBut Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Eddie? \nEDDIE After you. \nSTEADMAN (CORDIAL) No, \"Senator\". You first. \nEddie gestures for him to get in. \nEDDIE Please. \nSTEADMAN All right then... \nHe gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled- down window, his face a cold mask. \nSTEADMAN (CONT'D) Oh, now. Don't underestimate us. \nEDDIE Don't underestimate your own creation. \nSteadman looks at him quizically. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) EDDIE (CONT'D) You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private? \nSTEADMAN You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making. \nEDDIE You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours. \nSTEADMAN You'll run out. You'll die. \nEDDIE Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it. \nA flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger. \n", "test3_id": 230}

FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                     28 \nLike any sane person, Maurice backs toward the door.       He bows and calls into the shadows... \nMAURICE Thank you. Really, I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality... (takes his coat and hat) ... And kindness. \nA flash of lightning briefly illuminates a BEASTLY SHAPE on the staircase. At the next flash -- THE SHAPE IS GONE. \n29   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                     29 \nMaurice rides Philippe away from the castle.        He notices the colonnade filled with rose bushes again. \nMAURICE Roses!   Yes... \nMaurice dismounts, checking to see that he hasn't been followed from the castle. He strokes his nervous horse, leaving him outside as he enters. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Can't go home empty handed... I promised Belle a rose, didn't I?      I think it's safe... \nWe catch GLIMPSES of A DARK SHAPE moving atop the colonnade. A taloned PAW. A swishing TAIL. \nPhilippe snorts, sensing danger. Maurice spies a single PERFECT WHITE ROSE among the others. \nCLOSE on the beast's EYES.     Enraged.   Wounded. \nMaurice reaches for it. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Ow! \nPricked by a thorn, he pulls his hand back -- then tries again. He PICKS the rose -- only to hear a booming ROAR from above. \nANGLE ON MAURICE -- terrified as the dark shape leaps down from the colonnade. Maurice drops the rose, stumbling and falling as a DARK SHADOW is cast over him. \nPhilippe breaks his harness, whinnies in terror and flees, charging through the castle grounds and out the ice gates. \n29A   EXT. VILLAGE PROMONTORY - DAY                            29A \nA first whisper of dawn as Philippe bursts out of the forest. He thunders down to the village. \n30    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   30 \nThe sun is fresh on the horizon, and Belle is already up. A whinny disturbs her. She looks up to find Philippe, thirsty and exhausted. \nBELLE Philippe? \nBelle puts strokes the horse's neck as he drinks deeply from the \ntrough. \nBELLE (CONT'D) What happened? Where is Papa?! \nBelle goes still. Notices Philippe's torn straps and tattered reins. In dread, her gaze darts to the woods. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Take me to him! \n31    EXT. WOODS - DAY                                             31 \nSunlight barely seeps through the thick branches lighting Belle's way as Philippe gallops past the FALLEN CANE TREE. \n32    EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - DAY                                   32 \nBelle races through the enchanted woods, coming upon Maurice's tipped over wagon. She sees the broken chest and scattered music boxes. \nWith a mix of apprehension and determination, Belle sets her jaw, and continues the gallop until the path brings her to... \n32A   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - DAY                                  32A \nBelle dismounts Philippe. Finding a THICK BRANCH, she wields it \nlike a club, then bravely crosses to the castle and enters. \n33    INT. FOYER - CASTLE - DAY                                    33 \nClub held high, ready to defend herself, Belle cautiously eases the door open and peeks inside. \nThe atmosphere of the castle presses in on Belle. Creepy DRAGON \nSTATUES on the staircase seem like they're watching. Eerie SHADOWS stretch down impossibly long hallways. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl. \n", "test1_true": "LUMI\u00c8RE But what if she is the one?   The one who will break the spell? \nBelle reacts.   Quickly moves towards the voices -- \nBELLE Who said that? Who's there? \nBelle reaches the spot where she heard the voices. No one there. Only a clock and candelabra. Suddenly, a COUGH echoes through the castle. Belle grabs the candelabra and climbs a long staircase. The clock shudders with dread. \n34    INT. PRISON TOWER - CASTLE - DAY                             34 \nBelle follows the cough up a labyrinth of stairs until she reaches the dark prison tower and a GRATED IRON DOOR. \nBELLE Papa!?   Is that you? \nBelle sees Maurice through a grate in the door.   He looks terribly pale and sick, coughing. \nMAURICE (O.S.) Belle?   How did you find me!? \nBelle puts the candelabra down and clutches his hands. \nBELLE Oh, your hands are ice.   We need to get you home. \nMAURICE Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you! \nBELLE Who?! \nThe beast roars. Belle spins quickly, swinging her club to strike, but the figure jumps onto another staircase. Belle searches the shadows. The voice circles her. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Who's there? Who are you? \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) Who are you? \nBELLE I've come for my father. \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) Your father is a thief. \nBELLE Liar! \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) HE STOLE A ROSE. \nIn Belle's wide eyes, we see her guilt. \nBELLE I asked for the rose.   Punish me, not him! \nMAURICE No, he means forever. Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower. \nBELLE A life sentence for a rose? \nTHE BEAST I received eternal damnation for one. I'm merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father's place? \nBELLE Come into the light. \nThe figure remains still. Belle grabs hold of Lumiere and thrusts the candle forward, illuminating a HIDEOUS HORNED FACE. Belle's eyes go wide as she clearly sees THE BEAST. The only part of him that seems human are his eyes. BLUE. \nDEEP. SOULFUL.   And flicked with pain when he sees Belle's revulsion. \nTHE BEAST CHOOSE! \nMAURICE Belle, I won't let you do this. I lost your mother. I won't lose you too. Now go! \nMaurice falls into a terrible coughing fit. \nBELLE Alright, Papa. I will leave. (to the beast) I need a minute alone with him. \nThe beast doesn't respond. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Are you so cold-hearted that you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? (off his proud grunt) Forever can spare a minute! \nIntrigued by her defiance, the beast moves toward her, reaching out with his massive paw. Belle closes her eyes, bracing herself for his retaliation. Instead, she hears -- CLANG. \nBelle opens her eyes to find herself eye to eye with the beast's chest. He has reached high above her head to pull down an iron lever, unlocking the door. \nTHE BEAST When this door closes, it will not open again. \n35   INT. PRISON CELL - CASTLE - CONTINUOUS                    35 \nBelle rushes in and embraces her father. \nBELLE I should have been with you. \nMAURICE Belle, listen to me. It's all right. Live your life. Forget me. \n", "test1_id": 2637, "test2_input": "In the jar, the ENCHANTED ROSE hangs in mid-air. The rose is wilting. Most of its petals have fallen. Rage evaporating, replaced by shame, the beast lowers his head... \n... as ONE MORE PETAL DROPS. \nThe image moves inside the jar. We see the beast through the glass as he leans down, peering in at the petal as it reaches the bottom and shrivels. As it does, we hear a far off RUMBLE, as if the foundation of the castle is trembling. \nEXT. CASTLE - NIGHT -- DAWN \nFrom a distance, we see stone statuary crack and tumble down from the castle walls... \n53   INT.

He hears the crash of falling debris. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Another petal fell... \nPLUMETTE Lumi\u00e8re, I grew three more feathers! And I just plucked yesterday. \nLumi\u00e8re moves to help, but his legs stiffen.    He holds his flame to his knee like a heating pad. \nLUMI\u00c8RE I know, darling -- Ow! I'm getting more metallic every day. \nSuddenly, Cogsworth begins making clock sounds. \nCOGSWORTH Oh, no! It's -- tick tock! -- happening again -- cuckoo! Pardon me. \nMRS. POTTS Everyone, calm yourselves.    We still have time. \nCHIP Mama, am I ever going to be a boy again? \nMRS. POTTS Yes, Chip.     You'll have your days in the sun again.

BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                       55 \nBelle looks down -- the rope is about 20 feet off the ground. Almost there. A KNOCK on the door. \nBELLE I told you to go away. \nMRS. POTTS (O.S.) Don't worry, dear. It's only Mrs. Potts. \nMrs. Potts bustles in on her cart with Chip. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Oh, aren't you a vision! How lovely to make your acquaintance. \nBelle tries to block her view of the escape rope, but Mrs. Potts is too sharp. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) It's a very long journey. Let me fix you up before you go. I have found that most troubles seem less troubling after a bracing cup o' tea. \nThe tea is poured into Chip, who wheels over to Belle. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Slowly now, Chip. \nBelle picks up Chip and brings him up to her mouth. Little Chip finds himself face-to-face with the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. She takes a sip. \nCHIP Pleased to meet you!    Want to see me do a trick? \nChip blows a huge bubble in his tea cup.     It pops loudly. \nMRS. POTTS Chip. (to Belle) That was a very brave thing you did for your father, dear. \nMadame Garderobe's doors swing open. \nGARDEROBE Yes.    We all think so. \nBELLE I'm so worried about him.      He's never been on his own. \nMRS. POTTS Cheer up, my poppet. Things will turn out in the end. You'll feel a lot better after dinner. \nBELLE But he said, \"If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all.\" \nMRS. POTTS People say a lot of things in anger. It is our choice whether or not to listen. Coming? \nAnd Mrs. Potts is out the door.      Belle looks to Garderobe. \nGARDEROBE Go. \nINT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT \nThe door opens.

If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her, he will blame me. \nLumiere jumps up onto the sink, navigating sudsy dishes as CHAPEAU scrubs them. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can't fall in love if she stays in her room. (looks at a smudged dish) Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot! \nLumi\u00e8re tosses the dish back in the sink, skipping onto a passing tea trolley. Cogsworth climbs up in pursuit. \nCOGSWORTH You know she will never love him. \nLUMI\u00c8RE A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times. \nLumi\u00e8re leaps onto the table, and uprights a champagne glass. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Stand up straight!

Off me while I work! Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg! \nCOGSWORTH Not so loud! Keep it down! \nLUMI\u00c8RE Of course, of course.

DINING ROOM - CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER                  57 \nTo Cogsworth's horror, Lumi\u00e8re guides an ambulatory HARPSICHORD into the room. This is CADENZA, our neurotic Italian maestro. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Maestro Cadenza, are you ready? \nCADENZA (coy) It has been so long since I've performed! I can barely even remember how... \nBut with an abrupt flourish, Cadenza plays show-offy scales on the ivories until -- PLUNK. \nCADENZA (CONT'D) Another cavity. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She's counting on you to help us break this curse. \nCADENZA Then, I shall play through the dental pain! \nCOGSWORTH (whispers to Cadenza) But Maestro. Play quietly. Please. \nCADENZA Quietly? Sotto voce? Of course. Are there any other tasteless demands you wish to make upon my artistry? \nCOGSWORTH No, that's it. \nMrs. Potts leads Belle to the end of the long dining table. \nMRS. POTTS There you are, dear. \nLumi\u00e8re LEAPS onto the table. Floating at a high window, Plummette uses a silver platter to turn a shaft of moonlight into a SPOTLIGHT.

And now, we invite you to relax. \nBelle sits down in a chair, which moves in, bringing her closer to the table. Lumi\u00e8re motions up to Plumette to steady her shaky spotlight. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Let us pull up a chair... as the dining room proudly presents... \nCadenza plays a dramatic scale as a table cloth UNFURLS, and Lumi\u00e8re jumps up and LANDS in a pose. Cadenza ends his scale on the wrong note. Lumi\u00e8re shoots him a look, Cadenza plays the right note, and Lumi\u00e8re turns to Belle and smiles. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) ... your dinner. (sings to Belle) Be our guest, be our guest \nThe napkins on the place settings rise up and twirl.   Chapeau offers Belle a napkin. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Put our service to the test Tie your napkin `round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest! \nSpinning quickly, Chapeau presents the following to Belle: \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres Why we only live to serve Try the grey stuff, it's delicious \nBelle reaches out to try it, but it's gone before she can. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Don't believe me?

A feather duster. A candelabra. A tea pot and teacup. A harpsichord. \nLEFOU Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted? \nGASTON Don't lose your nerve, LeFou. \nGaston looks into the mirror.

LeFou brings his face down to the tea pot and teacup. \nLEFOU You must be the talking teacup.       And you must be his grandmother. \nMrs. Potts' EYES open.   Furious. \nMRS. POTTS Grand-mother? ATTACK! \nLeFou jumps back. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE as the furniture comes alive. Chairs kick the shins of several villagers. Plumette feathers villagers' faces furiously, causing them to have sneezing fits. As other villagers funnel in, the \"Lend-a-Hand\" lights outside the door bonk several of them on the head. They're alive after all. \nChapeau spins Gaston around and is about to land a blow when GASTON GRABS LEFOU and puts him in the line of fire. LeFou becomes a human punching bag as Cadenza approaches and rears up on his hind legs.

Oh, I believe this is yours. \nMaurice casually hands the wagon's padlock to Monsieur d'Arque -- just as Belle rides past on Philippe!

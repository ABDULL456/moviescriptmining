{"train": "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST \nWritten by \nStephen Chbosky & Evan Spiliotopoulos \nBased on the 1991 Animated Film \"Beauty and the Beast\" Screenplay by Linda Woolverton \nAugust 10, 2016 \n1   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                1 \nA MAGNIFICENT CASTLE. Resplendent, bespeaking great wealth and power. The grounds and stonework immaculate. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Once upon a time in the hidden heart of France, a handsome young Prince lived in a beautiful castle... \nRACK FOCUS to a single RED ROSE clinging to a rose bush on a stormy spring night. A WEATHERED HAND plucks the rose. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Although he had everything his heart desired, the Prince was selfish and unkind. \n2   INT. BALLROOM ENTRANCE - CASTLE - NIGHT                    2 \nTIGHT ON THE PRINCE being groomed by his servants. (We do not see their faces.) A FRENCH MAID paints an exotic animal mask on the Prince's face with a feather brush. A TALL VALET drapes the Prince with an elaborately bejeweled coat. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) He taxed the village to fill his castle with the most beautiful objects... \nThe MAID dusts his wig with powder - \nMAID Poof poof... \n- while a MAJORDOMO holds a POCKET WATCH, indicating that they are running late. \nMAJORDOMO Master, it's time. \nWith a haughty wave, the Prince instructs his FOOTMAN to bring more light. \nFOOTMAN Oui, ma\u00eetre. \nA CANDELABRA is lifted to the preening Prince as he looks at himself in an ornate HAND MIRROR. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ... and his parties with the most beautiful people. \n3   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   3 \nThe ornate room is filled with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE from all corners of the world, each on display for the Prince's pleasure. A circle of eligible maidens bow their heads. \nSeated in a throne chair dominated by a majestic COAT OF ARMS, the Prince snaps his fingers impatiently at an ITALIAN MAESTRO, who smiles, revealing comically rotten teeth. \nThe maestro sits at a harpsichord and motions to his wife, a LARGE DIVA holding a TINY BICHON FRIS\u00c9. As the music begins, the Prince steps forward. \nThe diva fills the room with a voice as big as her frame. The Prince performs a ROUNDELAY with several debutantes: \nDIVA Oh how divine Glamour, music and magic combine See the maidens so anxious to shine Look for a sign that enhances Chances She'll be his special one \n5   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   5 \nThe dance speeds up. The Prince connects momentarily with a beautiful woman -- but quickly moves on when his eye catches someone even more dazzling: \nDIVA What a display! What a breathtaking thrilling array (coos to the dog) Every prince, every dog has his day Let us sing with passion, gusto Fit to bust - oh Not a care in the world \nKNOCK KNOCK. The Prince stops. Then a gust of wind blows open the windows. Sconces flicker and go dark. The figure enters in silhouette, hobbling on a CANE. \nFurious, the Prince grabs a lit candelabra from the Footman. He rudely pushes through the crowd, sweeping people from his path. He crosses to the windows, finally revealing -- \nAN OLD BEGGAR WOMAN shivering from the rain. She looks to the Prince with hope and offers him -- A RED ROSE. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Then, one night, an unexpected intruder arrived at the castle, seeking shelter from the bitter storm. As a gift, she offered the Prince a single rose. \nThe PRINCE'S HAND waves her off.    The woman begs on her knees. The Prince motions to the staff. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the Prince turned the woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. \nThe majordomo and footman approach to usher her out.   The woman lowers her head as if to cry -- \nNARRATOR (V.O.) And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's outward appearance melted away to reveal... \nSuddenly, the old woman's cape and hood cocoon.    AN ERUPTION OF LIGHT as she transforms into... \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...a beautiful Enchantress. \nThe wind picks up inside the room.   Frightened, the Prince falls to his knees. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) The Prince tried to apologize but it was too late. For she had seen that there was no love in his heart. \n12   EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   12 \nBelle hears the tinkle of a sweet MUSIC BOX tune wafting out of her father's basement workshop. \n13   INT. CELLAR WORK ROOM - BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                13 \nBelle descends into to her father's dusty work room. Sunlight spotlights MAURICE hunched over his workspace. Belle quietly watches as he sings along with the music box theme. \nMAURICE How does a moment last forever? How can a story never die? It is love we must hold on to Never easy -- but we try \nMaurice tinkers with gears on the box, which depicts an artist in a Parisian garret, painting his wife's portrait as she holds a red rose above their baby. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Sometimes our happiness is captured Somehow a time and place stand still Love lives on inside our hearts And always will (seeing Belle) Oh, good, Belle, you're back. Can you please hand me the -- \nBefore he can say the word \"screwdriver\" it's in his hand. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) And the -- \nTweezers.   Then Belle hands him a small hammer... \nMAURICE (CONT'D) No no I don't need -- \n... just as a spring pops off. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Actually yes, that's exactly what I need. \nHe goes back to tinkering. Belle gazes at other music boxes, each a small work of art, depicting famous landmarks from around the world. \nBELLE Papa, do you think I'm odd? \nMAURICE My daughter? Odd?     Where did you get an idea like that? \nBELLE I don't know. People talk. \nMAURICE Oh. People. This village may be small, small-minded even, but small also means safe. \nMaurice can see this line of argument doesn't do much for his daughter. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Even back in Paris, I knew a girl who was so different, so daring, so ahead of her time that people mocked her until the day they found themselves imitating her. \nBELLE Just tell me one more thing about her. \nMaurice turns to the music box as if to change the subject. But looking back up to Belle's eagerness, he relents. \nMAURICE Your mother was... fearless. Fearless. \nWith that, Maurice closes his music box. \n14    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   14 \nAs Maurice carefully loads his music boxes onto his wagon, Belle tends to the family's old glue horse, PHILIPPE. \nMaurice climbs into the wagon, and smiles down at his daughter. \nMAURICE What would you like me to bring you from the market? \nBELLE A rose like the one in the painting. \nMAURICE You ask for that every year. \nBELLE And every year, you bring it. \nMAURICE Then I shall bring you another. You have my word. Come on, Philippe! \nBELLE I'll see you tomorrow! \nMAURICE Tomorrow!    With the rose! \nAs Maurice rides away, Belle's warmth gives way to concern. \nBELLE (to herself) Stay safe... \n14A   INT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - TACKROOM - DAY                    14A \nSurrounded by design sketches, Belle's workbench features a small model of her `washing machine' prototype. Belle places the miniature barrel in position... fastens a rope to a leather strap... shaves chips off a block of soap... collects the soap chips in a small sack... and rushes out. \n15    EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - LAVERIE - DAY                   15 \nA young WASHER GIRL watches as -- \nBelle tosses clothes and some soap chips into an empty BARREL and rolls it into the fountain! It bobs on its side. Tying the other end of the strap to the mule's harness, she sets him walking around the circular laverie... \nWASHER GIRL What are you doing? \nBELLE I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston. \nGaston keeps the gallant smile plastered as she shuts the door in his face. \n20   EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - SUNSET                                 20 \nBelle watches Gaston leave.   She opens the door. \nBELLE Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless... \nShe turns away from the home she thinks she will never escape. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Madame Gaston, can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No sir, not me, I guarantee it (MORE) \nBELLE (CONT'D) I want much more than this Provincial life... \n21   EXT. VILLAGE PROMONTORY - SUNSET                                21 \nBelle races up the hills to the outskirts of town. When she reaches the highest point, we circle around to reveal the town spread out beneath her. \nBELLE I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got planned \nAs the last rays of light fade we RISE to reveal a forest in the \ndistance, where the skies begin to rage. A swirling wind and a streak of... \n22   EXT. WOODS - EVENING                                            22 \nLightning. The sky flashes.     The wind picks up.   Worried, Maurice urges Philippe on. \nMAURICE The woods are lovely, aren't they Philippe...? I only wish I recognized them. Do you know where we are? Because I don't. \nAs the woods get darker, a WITHERED TREE that looks like an ELDERLY PERSON'S CANE is struck by lightning. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Whoa! \nThe tree splits in two, one half falling into the road, revealing... a HIDDEN PATH. Philippe whinnies nervously. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Hmm... yes, we can go this way. Walk on! One path closes, another one opens. \nThey leave the blocked road and head down the path.    Maurice looks down to see a light snow cover on the ground.    Philippe snorts. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) It's all right boy, it's just a bit of snow... in June. \nAnd they descend into -- \n23   EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - EVENING                               23 \nWe have entered another world. A light, whirling snow descends on Maurice, dusting his coat. The clippity-clop of hooves echo in stillness. \nSuddenly, A WHITE WOLF roars out of the bushes, barely missing them. Gaze darting, Maurice notices WHITE WOLVES running on an icy ledge above him. The wolves keep pace, massing to overrun him. \nMAURICE Go, Philippe! Hurry! \nMaurice urges his horse on, but his rickety cart starts to buckle. A HARNESS IS LOOSE. \nThe wolves leap in front of the cart, which comes undone, tipping over on its side. The chest of music boxes smashes open on the ground. Maurice is launched up onto a ridge -- and finds himself face-to-face with the snarling and scarred ALPHA WOLF. \nTerrified, Maurice turns and begins sliding down the snowy ridge \n-- towards a trio of wolves waiting below. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Philippe! \nAs Maurice drops from the ridge, Philippe appears beneath him -- \nand Maurice lands on his back! \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Go!   Go! \nPhilippe rides. PAWS crush twigs -- SLAVERING JAWS -- EYES mad with hunger -- a gleam of FANGS -- Philippe gallops. Maurice races toward the CASTLE ICE GATES -- which churn open as the wolves draw near. \nMaurice and Philippe speed through the gates as the wolves skid to a stop, their HOWLS turning to YELPS OF FEAR. \n24   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - EVENING                                24 \nMaurice stares in open-mouth awe at THE BEAST'S CASTLE. A grey edifice seemingly growing out of stone and reaching to troubled skies. It feels like a place hiding its face from the world. \nMAURICE (to Philippe) Oh Philippe, you saved my life... They'll have to get their dinner somewhere else. \nANGLE ON MAURICE -- as he draws near the castle, he notices a colonnade filled with WHITE ROSE BUSHES. Just beyond, he sees the door to the STABLES swinging in the wind. A LAMP has been lit inside. As if inviting a tired traveler. \nMaurice strokes Philippe's neck. \nMAURICE It's all right. \nAnd bolts from the table. \n28   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                     28 \nLike any sane person, Maurice backs toward the door.       He bows and calls into the shadows... \nMAURICE Thank you. Really, I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality... (takes his coat and hat) ... And kindness. \nA flash of lightning briefly illuminates a BEASTLY SHAPE on the staircase. At the next flash -- THE SHAPE IS GONE. \n29   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                     29 \nMaurice rides Philippe away from the castle.        He notices the colonnade filled with rose bushes again. \nMAURICE Roses!   Yes... \nMaurice dismounts, checking to see that he hasn't been followed from the castle. He strokes his nervous horse, leaving him outside as he enters. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Can't go home empty handed... I promised Belle a rose, didn't I?      I think it's safe... \nWe catch GLIMPSES of A DARK SHAPE moving atop the colonnade. A taloned PAW. A swishing TAIL. \nPhilippe snorts, sensing danger. Maurice spies a single PERFECT WHITE ROSE among the others. \nCLOSE on the beast's EYES.     Enraged.   Wounded. \nMaurice reaches for it. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) Ow! \nPricked by a thorn, he pulls his hand back -- then tries again. He PICKS the rose -- only to hear a booming ROAR from above. \nANGLE ON MAURICE -- terrified as the dark shape leaps down from the colonnade. Maurice drops the rose, stumbling and falling as a DARK SHADOW is cast over him. \nPhilippe breaks his harness, whinnies in terror and flees, charging through the castle grounds and out the ice gates. \n29A   EXT. VILLAGE PROMONTORY - DAY                            29A \nA first whisper of dawn as Philippe bursts out of the forest. He thunders down to the village. \n30    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   30 \nThe sun is fresh on the horizon, and Belle is already up. A whinny disturbs her. She looks up to find Philippe, thirsty and exhausted. \nBELLE Philippe? \nBelle puts strokes the horse's neck as he drinks deeply from the \ntrough. \nBELLE (CONT'D) What happened? Where is Papa?! \nBelle goes still. Notices Philippe's torn straps and tattered reins. In dread, her gaze darts to the woods. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Take me to him! \n31    EXT. WOODS - DAY                                             31 \nSunlight barely seeps through the thick branches lighting Belle's way as Philippe gallops past the FALLEN CANE TREE. \n32    EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - DAY                                   32 \nBelle races through the enchanted woods, coming upon Maurice's tipped over wagon. She sees the broken chest and scattered music boxes. \nWith a mix of apprehension and determination, Belle sets her jaw, and continues the gallop until the path brings her to... \n32A   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - DAY                                  32A \nBelle dismounts Philippe. Finding a THICK BRANCH, she wields it \nlike a club, then bravely crosses to the castle and enters. \n33    INT. FOYER - CASTLE - DAY                                    33 \nClub held high, ready to defend herself, Belle cautiously eases the door open and peeks inside. \nThe atmosphere of the castle presses in on Belle. Creepy DRAGON \nSTATUES on the staircase seem like they're watching. Eerie SHADOWS stretch down impossibly long hallways. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl. \nBELLE Forget you? Everything I am is because of you. \nMAURICE I love you, Belle.    Don't be afraid. \nBELLE I love you too, Papa... \nShe pulls him close. \nBELLE (CONT'D) I'm not afraid. (whispers) And I will escape, I promise. \nMAURICE What?! \nWith that, she pivots and swings her father through the door just as the beast slams it shut. Maurice trips to the ground, giving the beast a second to turn to Belle. They lock eyes. \nTHE BEAST You took his place. \nBELLE He is my father. \nTHE BEAST He's a fool. So are you. \nThe beast turns and drags Maurice away. \nBELLE Don't hurt him! \nThrough the latticework, Belle sees the beast and her father disappear down the corridor. She rushes to the window and watches the beast carry her father down the spiral staircase of the prison tower. \nMAURICE Belle!   I'll come back!    I promise! \nOnce she is alone, Belle cannot help herself.      She slumps to the floor and the tears come. We FADE OUT. \n36   OMITTED                                                        36 \n37   OMITTED                                                        37 \n38   OMITTED                                                        38 \n39   INT. CELL - PRISON TOWER - DUSK                                39 \nBelle huddles in the corner.     The cell door swings opens. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (O.S.) Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle, but I have been sent to escort you to your room. \nBelle wipes her tears and stands.    She grabs a small stool, ready to strike. \nBELLE My room?   But I thought -- \nLUMI\u00c8RE (O.S.) What? That once this door closes it will not open again, RARRR? I know, he gets so dramatic. \nBelle bounds out of the cell, raising the stool to hit a grown man. Instead, she sees... a candelabra wave at her. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) `Allo. \nBELLE AHHH! \nLike seeing a mouse, Belle bashes the candelabra. It grunts as it clatters on the stone floor. The candles extinguished. \nWHOOSH -- the first candle relights. WHOOSH -- the second. Illuminated by the two arm candles, Belle makes out EYES and a rudimentary \"FACE\" in the design. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (recovering) Oh, you are very strong.    That's a great quality! \nBELLE What are you? \nThe arms light the main candle to reveal a rakish smile. \nLUMI\u00c8RE I am Lumi\u00e8re. \nBELLE And you can talk. \nCogsworth appears, out of breath. \nCOGSWORTH Of course he can talk, it's all he ever does! Now Lumiere, as head of the household, I demand that you put her back in the cell at once! \nOfficially freaked out now, Belle retreats to her cell, in search of a better weapon. \nLUMI\u00c8RE What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth: a man or a mantle clock? \nThey turn back to Belle, re-emerging from the cell. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Ready, miss? (to Cogsworth) Trust me. \n40   EXT. ROOFTOP WALKWAY - CASTLE - EVENING                    40 \nHolding Lumi\u00e8re, Belle follows Cogsworth across a stone walkway high above the grounds. Her eyes dart, looking for an escape route. Instead, she sees how vast the castle and woods are. \nGARDEROBE Finally. A woman. Pretty eyes. Proud face. Perfect canvas. Yes! I will find you something worthy of a princess. \nBELLE But I'm not a princess. \nGARDEROBE Nonsense! Now, let's see what I've got in my drawers. \nGarderobe's doors open and a few moths fly out. \nGARDEROBE (CONT'D) Oh, how embarrassing. \nGarderobe places a large HOOP over Belle's head, and proceeds to create an outfit using fabric and her pinking-shear hands. FROUFROU, a piano stool, runs in, barking like a dog. \nGARDEROBE (CONT'D) Come here, Froufrou. Come help mama! \nFroufrou tugs at the fabric, helping Garderobe complete the outfit -- which is garish and too too much, all wrong for Belle. \nGARDEROBE (CONT'D) Perfetta! \nLumi\u00e8re and Cogsworth put on a game smile. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Mm.   Subtle. Understated.    I love it! \nWith a deep bow and a whistle for Froufrou, Lumi\u00e8re drags Cogsworth out. Plumette and Froufrou follow. Garderobe calls out after her beloved dog. \nGARDEROBE Froufrou, send my love to the maestro! \nThe door closes. Belle is alone. Garderobe instantly falls asleep with a big SNORE. Belle has one beat of... where the hell am I? She ducks down, then crawls out from underneath the enormous dress, which remains standing. \nBelle looks around the room with one thing in mind: escape. She quickly moves to the window. Opens it. She looks down at the 100 foot drop leading to the grounds. \nBelle turns back to the room, and gazes at the dress.   An idea taking shape. \n43   EXT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     43 \nA LAMPLIGHTER is hard at work outside as we hear fiddle music coming from the inn. \n44   INT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     44 \nAmidst the animal heads, antlers, and drunken villagers, there is an even sadder sight -- GASTON. He drowns his sorrows in ale while LEFOU listens. \nGASTON Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? \"I will never marry you, Gaston.\" \nLEFOU You know, there are other girls. \nThe village lasses perk up.   \"Yes!   There are other girls!\" \nGASTON A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits. \nThe lasses deflate. \"Awww!\" LeFou decides it's time to cheer up his best friend/boss. Thus begins \"GASTON.\" \nLEFOU Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston looking so down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's fa-vor-ite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why \nLeFou gives a nod (and a large tip) to the FIDDLE PLAYER in the corner, who nods back, and begins to play... \nLEFOU (CONT'D) No one's slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston For there's no man in town half as manly Perfect, a pure paragon! You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on! \nLeFou hops onto the bar, squeezing himself between TOM, DICK, and STANLEY. \nTOM/DICK/STANLEY Who plays darts like Gaston? Who breaks hearts like Gaston? \nLEFOU Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston? \nGASTON (confidence growing) As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating \nLeFou hails a BARMAID and buys everyone a round of drinks. The villagers raise their mugs and cheer. \nLEFOU/VILLAGERS My what a guy, that Gaston! \nGaston stands, and clasps LeFou in gratitude... \nGASTON I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou \nLEFOU Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you! \n... only to find himself in an uncomfortably tight hug. \nLEFOU (CONT'D) Too much? \nGASTON Yep. \nVILLAGERS No one fights like Gaston Douses lights like Gaston! \nLEFOU In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston! \nMaurice approaches.   So grateful. \nMAURICE Thank you, Captain.   Thank you. \nGASTON Don't thank me, Maurice.    Lead us to the beast. \nMaurice exits.   Gaston follows, gesturing to LeFou. \nLEFOU (finally getting it) Ohhh. \n46   INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT                                46 \nThe staff is excited as they scramble to get ready for dinner. CHIP, the 8 year-old tea cup, rides his saucer around like a skateboard. He circles his teapot mother MRS. POTTS, a no- nonsense yet loving governess. \nCHIP Mama, there's a girl in the castle! \nMRS. POTTS Yes, Chip.     We know. Slow down. \nCHIP Is she pretty? Is she nice?     What kind of tea does she like? \nMRS. POTTS We'll find out soon enough. Slow down before you break your handle! \nBut Chip doesn't slow down. Before Mrs. Potts can chase, CUISINI\u00c8R, the frustrated French chef-turned-oven, pours hot water into her to prepare tea. \nCUISINI\u00c8R Heads up, Mrs. Potts! \nShe flushes and reacts with pleasure as if stepping into a warm bath. \nINT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - SAME \nThe beast enters the dining room and sits at one end of a long dining table. He looks at his place setting, surprised to find flatware and crystal. Confused, he looks up. \nTHE BEAST'S POV rises to find another place setting at the other end of the long table. When he notices the romantic candles, he swats his own place setting off the table in anger. \n47   INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - SAME                                 47 \nA voice bellowing from the dining room causes Lumiere and Cogsworth to turn. \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) LUMI\u00c8RE! \nCogsworth balks with terror. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Be calm, let me do the talking. \nA fuming beast storms in, and looks down at the assembled staff. Lumi\u00e8re is as good a liar as Cogsworth is not. \nTHE BEAST YOU'RE MAKING HER DINNER!? \nLUMI\u00c8RE We thought you might appreciate the company. \nCOGSWORTH Master, I can assure you that I had no part in this hopeless plan. Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her a suite in the east wing -- \nTHE BEAST YOU GAVE HER A BEDROOM!? \nCornered by the beast, Cogsworth has no choice but to... \nCOGSWORTH No no, he gave her a bedroom. \nLUMI\u00c8RE That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. (turns to Cogsworth) Good thinking, Cogsworth! \nCOGSWORTH What?! \nTHE BEAST That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard! \"Charm the prisoner.\" \nLUMI\u00c8RE You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human. \nTHE BEAST She's the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? \nMRS. POTTS Oh, you can't judge people by who their father is, now can you? \nIt's a loaded statement. The staff cringes, ready for his retaliation. Instead, a grunt, and then -- \n48   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT      48 \nKNOCK. KNOCK. The beast stands at Belle's door while his servants stand by his side to play Cyrano. \nTHE BEAST You will join me for dinner!     That's not a request. \nMRS. POTTS Gently, master. The girl lost her father and her freedom in one day. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Yes. The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death. \nMRS. POTTS Exactly. \nBELLE Nothing. \nTHE BEAST DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE!? YOU COULD HAVE DAMNED US ALL! GET OUT! GO! \nBelle runs.   The beast turns and covers the rose, panicked and protective. \n65,66   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                               65,66 \nLumi\u00e8re and Cogsworth play chess on an upper landing, with Froufrou resting between them. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Checkmate.     Again. \nCOGSWORTH Because you cheated.     Again. \nBelle appears, racing down the west wing staircase. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Mademoiselle... what are you doing? \nBELLE Getting out of here! \nCogsworth jumps onto the chess board as Lumiere hops to the floor. \nCOGSWORTH Stop! \nLUMI\u00c8RE Go go, Froufrou! \nFroufrou jumps up and starts after Belle. \nCOGSWORTH Yes Froufrou, stop her! \nBelle barrels down the main staircase, Froufrou in close pursuit. \nMrs. Potts enters from the kitchen, wearing a tea cosy. \nMRS. POTTS You don't want to go out there! \nAt the top of the stairs, Cogsworth sounds a whistle.     In quick cuts, WINDOWS drop and SHUTTERS close. \nBelle hits the bottom of the grand staircase and runs towards the door -- only to watch it bolt itself locked. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Stop her! \nFroufrou runs in front of Belle to block her exit, and growls. \nCOGSWORTH Who's a good dog? \nThen suddenly, his growls turn to playful yaps, as he stands on his hind legs and pants playfully. \nCOGSWORTH (CONT'D) What? No, it's not playtime!      Bad dog! Bad dog! \nMRS. POTTS What part of `stop her' don't you understand, dog?! \nFroufrou spins and scrambles outside, scooting through the low postern door within the great front door. In his excitement, he's provided Belle with an escape! \nBelle snatches her cloak from a bewildered Chapeau, and shimmies out through this same `doggie door.' \nLUMI\u00c8RE Please, don't go! It's dangerous! \nMrs. Potts rushes forward but it's too late.      A look of dread settles on her face... \nMRS. POTTS Oh my... \n67   OMITTED                                                       67 \n68   OMITTED                                                       68 \n69   EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - NIGHT                                  69 \nHOWL. Philippe's hooves hit the snowy landscape.   Belle races through the woods. She looks back to see if the beast followed her. She only sees a glimpse of the castle. She thinks she has escaped. Surely, she has escaped. \nWOLVES HOWL NEARBY. \nANGLE ON PHILIPPE'S MUDDY HOOFPRINT -- a WOLF'S PAW smashes down over the print -- the wolf howls -- \nANGLE ON BELLE -- out of the corner of her eye, she sees SHAPES OF A DOZEN WHITE WOLVES flitting through the trees, closing in on her. \nBelle forges on -- the wolves are not bothering to hide anymore, they've emerged from the trees to take down their prey -- closing in fast -- \n-- Belle pushes through the undergrowth to find she has reached a FROZEN POND. Philippe doesn't hesitate. He gallops onto the ice, and across the pond. The sound of ice CRACKING under his hooves is deep and low. And increasing. \nPhilippe's hooves slide on the ice.   The wolves close in. \nPhilippe makes it across the pond onto land.   But before Belle can feel any relief -- \n70A   EXT. REMOTE FOREST ROAD - NIGHT (LATER)                      70A \nMaurice is now tied to a tree. Gaston secures the knot and walks to the carriage. Darkness has come over Gaston. \nGASTON If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me. \nLEFOU For the sake of exhausting all of our options, do we maybe want to consider a less gruesome alternative? \nGaston climbs into the carriage. \nGASTON Are you coming? \nLeFou looks back to Maurice, an apology in his eyes.   He climbs into the carriage. \nGaston and LeFou ride off, leaving Maurice to die. \n71    INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT                71 \nThe beast lies in his old human bed. Belle dabs a large gash on the beast's arm. The beast bares his fangs and lets out a roar. \nTHE BEAST ROOOOAARRRR! Ow! That hurts! \nBELLE If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much. \nTHE BEAST If you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened. \nBELLE Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away. \nThe household staff anxiously watches the battle of words. \nTHE BEAST Well you shouldn't have been in the west wing. \nBELLE Well you should learn to control your temper. \nThe beast is momentarily silenced. Belle looks down at the wound she has been dabbing. It's worse than she thought. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Try to get some rest. \nThe beast's breath slows to a low rumble as his eyes slip shut. \nMRS. POTTS Thank you, Miss. \nLUMI\u00c8RE We are eternally grateful. \nBELLE Why do you care so much about him? \nMRS. POTTS We've looked after him all his life. \nBELLE But he has cursed you somehow. (off their silence) Why? You did nothing. \nMRS. POTTS You're quite right there, dear. You see, when the master lost his mother, and his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad and twisted him up to be just like him... we did nothing. \nBelle notes their shame just as we HEAR the first notes of a beautiful melody coming from the ballroom downstairs. This is the beast's lullaby -- \"DAYS IN THE SUN.\" \nLUMI\u00c8RE Let him sleep. \nAs the staff and Belle exit, the beast stirs. We move from his face, shivering in a fever dream, to discover -- \n71A   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT              71A \nThe YOUNG PRINCE gazes down sadly. \nYOUNG PRINCE Days in the sun When my life has barely begun \nWe move around to reveal that he is looking at the pale body of THE QUEEN on her deathbed. \nYOUNG PRINCE (CONT'D) Not until my own life is done Will I ever leave you \nBehind the prince, a figure approaches: his FATHER. Cruelty written on his face. Placing his large hand on the boy's shoulder, he pulls him out of the room. \n72     INT. CASTLE - BALLROOM/FOYER - NIGHT                      72 \nIn the gloomy ballroom, Cadenza plays the beautiful melody. \nCADENZA Will I tremble again To my dear one's gorgeous refrain? \nThe melody drifts through the ballroom until we find Lumi\u00e8re and \nPlumette, dancing: \nLUMI\u00c8RE & PLUMETTE Will you now forever remain Out of reach of my arms? \n72AA   INT. CASTLE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           72AA \nBELLE (O.S.) Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore -- \nHe opens his eyes to see that Belle isn't reading, she's reciting from memory. He joins in -- \nTHE BEAST And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. \nBelle looks up, surprised. \nBELLE So you know Shakespeare? \nTHE BEAST I had an expensive education. \nBELLE Actually, \"Romeo and Juliet\" is my favorite play. \nTHE BEAST Why is that not a surprise? \nBELLE Sorry? \nTHE BEAST All that heartache and pining and -- (a beastly shudder) There are so many better things to read. \nBELLE Like what? \nThe beast smiles. \n77   INT. LIBRARY - CASTLE - DAY                              77 \nThe beast has lead Belle into the biggest grandest private library in all of France. The chamber is vast and lined floor to ceiling with books. \nTHE BEAST Should be something here you can start with... \nHe turns to see Belle, speechless. \nBELLE It's wonderful. \nTHE BEAST Oh. Yes, I suppose it is... Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours. \nThe beast starts to leave.     He is stopped by -- \nBELLE Have you really read every one of these books? \nTHE BEAST Not all of them. Some are in Greek. \nBELLE Was that a joke?   Are you making jokes now? \nTHE BEAST Maybe. \nBelle shakes her head but is also charmed.    The beast turns and strides out. \n78    INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                            78 \nThe beast eats at the table, reading a book which sits on a stand. He looks up to see Belle sit at the other end with three \nbooks. She picks up her spoon and starts to eat. The beast plants his face in the bowl. Looks up a second later having inhaled the soup, half of which is dripping from his fur. Belle \nattempts a smile. \"SOMETHING THERE\" begins. \n78A   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - WOODED GLEN - DAY                     78A \nBelle and the beast cross a stone footbridge. She reads aloud to the patient, who moves tentatively, favoring a wounded leg. \nBELLE The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolled \nThe beast stops.   Belle, savoring the words, keeps walking. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glass \nBelle notices that she's walking alone.   She turns back, sees the beast staring out soulfully: \nBEAST I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time. \nAs she follows his gaze, we reveal a splendidly desolate landscape. The very thing Belle has just described, now spread out before her. \nBEAST (CONT'D) Is there more? \nBelle smiles, pleased that for a moment at least he's become a fan of poetry. She reads: \nBELLE But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: \"Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be.\" \nBelle meets the beast's eyes.   Both suddenly aware of hidden meanings in the poet's words. \n79   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - DAY                                  79 \nIn the fresh snow, Belle brushes Philippe's coat. The beast looks at Belle -- she nods -- and he pets the horse. Philippe reacts skittishly, causing the beast to withdraw. Belle takes his hand and places it on Philippe. Then, as she turns away -- \nThe beast nods, a bit shyly. \nTHE BEAST All right.     I felt like a change. \nBELLE I never thanked you for saving my life. \nTHE BEAST Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. \nBelle laughs. A quiet charged moment, which ends with the SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the servants in the castle. Belle and the beast can't help but smile. \nBELLE They know how to have a good time. \nTHE BEAST Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies. \nBELLE Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a \"funny girl,\" but I don't think they mean it as a compliment. \nTHE BEAST I'm sorry.     Your village sounds terrible. \nBELLE Almost as lonely as your castle. \nHe turns to her with a melancholy smile.       Then, an idea. \nTHE BEAST What do you say we run away? \nBelle is surprised by the suggestion. \n85   INT. LIBRARY - CASTLE - NIGHT                                     85 \nThe beast unlocks a desk cabinet. In it, resting on velvet, its gold-leaf cover faintly glimmering with magic, is a LEATHER BOUND BOOK covered in a thick layer of dust. \nTHE BEAST Another little \"gift\" from the Enchantress... \nThe beast cracks open the book to reveal AN ANTIQUE WORLD ATLAS. No countries. Just land and sea. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) A book that truly allows you to escape. \nBelle moves closer to find the pen and ink drawing is alive. Waves lap the beaches. Green trees sway in invisible wind. \nBELLE How amazing. \nTHE BEAST It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you. \nThe beast offers his hand and Belle takes it.    He gently moves her hand to the book. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) Think of the place you've most wanted to see. First, see it in your mind's eye. Now feel it in your heart. \nBelle nods -- this isn't a difficult decision. The moment her hand hits the page, we ENTER it, SPINNING through celestial flares -- which blur and recombine -- as the lights of Paris. We descend over the city and into... \n86   INT. ARTIST'S GARRET - MONTMARTRE - NIGHT                      86 \n... the top floor of a windmill in Montmartre. \nTHE BEAST Where did you take us? \nBELLE Paris. \nThe beast looks out of a window and sees glittering lights. \nTHE BEAST Oh, I love Paris. What would you like to see first? Notre Dame? The Champs- Elys\u00e9es? No? Too touristy? \nHe turns to find Belle silent.   Her eyes brimming with tears. \nBELLE It's so much smaller than I imagined. \nThe beast watches Belle walk through her childhood home... the artist's garret that Maurice recreated in his signature music box. Abandoned years ago, the room is crumbling. Belle finds the remains of her father's easel. A tarnished wall mirror. Her own broken crib. \nBELLE (CONT'D) This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived (MORE) \nBELLE (CONT'D) Now I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone \nBelle notices something tucked into a corner of the crib. She pries it loose. It is a BABY'S RATTLE carved into the shape of a rose. The beast focuses on it. \nTHE BEAST What happened to your mother? \nBELLE That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask... \nAs she speaks, the beast notices something on a chair.   The dark, pointed mask of a plague doctor. He looks up. \nTHE BEAST Plague. \nThe revelation lands on Belle's face.   She looks around. \nIN QUICK TIGHT SHOTS --- \nGaston signals to Tom, Dick, and Stanley -- and Maurice turns to see them block the exit. Gaston places his large hand on Maurice's shoulder -- and squeezes. Maurice winces. \nGASTON (CONT'D) Everything's going to be fine. \n89   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - EVENING              89 \nThe beast sits in a tub -- far too small for him.   There's shadow-play on the curtain. \nBEAST I saw her in the ballroom, and I said, well, you're making this so beautiful, we should have a dance tonight. I never thought she'd actually say yes! What was I thinking?! \nLUMI\u00c8RE No, Master, it's perfect! The rose has only four petals left. Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel. \nThe beast stands, appearing above the curtain, sopping wet. \nTHE BEAST I feel like a fool. She will never love me. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Do not be discouraged. \nThe beast shakes his coat dry like a dog.   The spray extinguishes Lumi\u00e8re's candles. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) She is the one. \nTHE BEAST I wish you'd stop saying that! \nCUT TO: \nThe beast plops into his a seat in front of the mirror. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) There is no one. \nLUMI\u00c8RE You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight... \nPLUMETTE Yes, and when the moment's just right... \nTHE BEAST But how will I know? \nCOGSWORTH You will feel slightly nauseous. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Don't worry, master, you'll do fine. \nMRS. POTTS Just stop being a coward and tell Belle how you feel. And if you don't, I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your life. \nLUMI\u00c8RE In the dark. \nPLUMETTE Covered in dust. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Dark and very very dusty. \nOff the beast, taking this in -- \nCUT TO: \n89A   A brief MONTAGE, as the castle staff give the beast a very 89A bad makeover. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Start with the hair! Women love nice hair. \nMRS. POTTS I'll take the fingers and toes! \nCOGSWORTH Chapeau, brush those teeth! \nChapeau wields scissors and a brush as Mrs. Potts pours hot water into Chip. The beast is pushed and pulled, primped and snipped. His fingers are dipped into Chip, his nails buffed by Mrs. Potts' steam, as Lumi\u00e8re climbs onto his horns. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Dip dip, snip snip... \nPlumette powders the beast's face -- \nPLUMETTE Eyes closed, poof poof! \nLUMI\u00c8RE And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance... \nChapeau places one of the Prince's old wigs on the beast. Plumette pecks his cheek with a beauty mark. The beast spins in \nhis chair to see himself in the mirror, and -- he's totally ridiculous. The staff, dejected, takes in its handiwork. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) OK, I can fix this! \n90   INT. BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - EVENING                   90 \nGarderobe finishes dressing Belle. \nGARDEROBE Beautiful.     But something is missing. \nGarderobe looks up. There's dust around the gilding that glows in the moonlight. A moment of inspiration. \nTHE BEAST You must go to him. No time to waste. \nBelle looks at the beast as she has never done before -- with gratitude and appreciation. She moves to return the mirror. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) No. Keep it with you. And you'll always have a way to look back on me. \nBELLE Thank you. \nShe rushes out. \n94A   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                              94A \nBelle runs down the grand staircase towards the door. She stops, seeing Chapeau. He bows to her, silently, sadly. Choking back tears, she is gone. \nChapeau looks up to the landing, and sees Mrs. Potts standing there, watching. Heartbroken. \n94B   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE                   94B \nThe beast unclasps his beautiful coat and lets it fall to the ground. Cogsworth enters, eager for news. \nCOGSWORTH Well, master, I may have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork. True love really does win the day! \nTHE BEAST I let her go. \nCOGSWORTH You... WHAT!? \nLumi\u00e8re and Plumette enter behind Cogsworth, followed by Mrs. Potts. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Master... how could you do that? \nTHE BEAST I had to. \nCOGSWORTH But why? \nThe beast doesn't answer. \nMRS. POTTS Because he loves her. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Then why are we not human? \nCOGSWORTH (angry) Because she doesn't love him!    And now, it's too late. \nPLUMETTE But she might still come back -- \nTHE BEAST No. I've set her free. I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you. \nHe turns away, unable to face them. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) Now go.     Our time is almost past. \nThe staff retreats.    As \"EVERMORE\" begins, the beast pulls on a dark cape. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) I   was the one who had it all I   was the master of my fate I   never needed anybody in my life I   learned the truth too late \n95   INT./EXT. TURRETS - CASTLE - NIGHT                          95 \nHe steps onto the balcony of his lair. From his POV, we see Belle mounting Philippe on the castle grounds below. \nTHE BEAST I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear \nBelle sets off and the beast begins to climb the castle turrets. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she runs away She will still torment me, calm me, hurt me, move me come what may \nThe beast climbs higher and higher, to keep Belle in sight as she gets further and further away. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself she'll walk right in And be with me for evermore \nThe beast climbs, Belle riding, until he reaches the highest turret of the castle. \nTHE BEAST (CONT'D) I rage against the trials of love I curse the fading of the light Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach She's never out of sight Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she fades from view She will still torment me, be part of everything I do Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself she'll walk right in And as the long long nights begin I'll think of all that might have been Waiting here for evermore \nThe beast stands at the edge of the turret as Belle finally disappears through the castle gates. \n96   EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - SQUARE - NIGHT                  96 \nA horse-drawn asylum wagon thunders into the square where Maurice is surrounded by taunting villagers. The eerie driver, MONSIEUR D'ARQUE, steps out as Tom, Dick and Stanley throw Maurice into his cage on wheels. Villagers approach the wagon like 18th century rubberneckers. \nGaston leans into the wagon. The gathering crowd is just loud enough to mask a private plea to Maurice... \nGASTON Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free. \nMAURICE Never. \nJEAN Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite! \nCLOTHILDE He'll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free! \nGASTON So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me! \nGaston grabs a TORCH from a villager and tosses it into a barrel of pitch. Flames rise to the sky. \nGASTON (CONT'D) Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride \nGaston lights Clothilde's torch, then clasps the shoulder of Monsieur d'Arque, who watches helplessly as his asylum wagon horses are commandeered by the mob. \nGASTON (CONT'D) Say a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home `Til he's dead, good and dead... KILL THE BEAST! \nSome villagers seize shovels, pitchforks, axes. Some light torches in the pitch. Others wrench a boar's head PIKE STAFF from outside the country inn. Pere Robert tries to calm the frenzy but the force of the mob pushes him back. \nMOB Light your torch, mount your horse! \nGASTON Screw your courage to the sticking place \nMOB We're counting on Gaston to lead the way \n97    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                          97 \nGaston and LeFou crash into the woods at a full gallop. \nGASTON Call it war Call it threat You can bet they all will follow For in times like this they'll do just as I say \nLeFou's doubts are growing: \nLEFOU There's a beast Running wild there's no question But I fear The wrong monster's released \nMOB Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord and here we go! \nGaston holds up the mirror. \nGASTON Show me the castle! \nIN THE MIRROR -- Gaston sees the hidden path to the castle. \n100   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                100 \nPlumette's head rests on Lumi\u00e8re's shoulder.    Mrs. Potts nuzzles Chip. \nLUMI\u00c8RE At least he has finally learned to love. \nCOGSWORTH A lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return. \nMRS. POTTS No. This is the first time I've had any real hope she would. \nANGLE ON CHIP -- he hears a distant sound -- the rumble of MARCHING BOOTS -- puzzled, he hops to the window embrasure -- \nCHIP Did you hear that, mama?    Is it her!? Is she coming back?! \nThe staff and Froufrou jump up, excited, and move to the window. They see torches in the distance. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Could it be? \nThey look through the glass, distorted with frost, as the mob moves through the garden. Lumi\u00e8re warms the windowpane with his flame to see more clearly. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Sacrebleu!     Invaders. \nMRS. POTTS Ruffians! \nCOGSWORTH Well, there you go. So much for true love. Man the barricades, and hold fast! \nThey hop down from the embrasure. \n102   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                              102 \nLumi\u00e8re, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Plumette and Chapeau stand at the front door, forming a sad barricade. \nCASTLE STAFF Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle -- Unafraid although the danger just increased \nCADENZA Move aside! \nCadenza crab-walks in from the ballroom, standing vertically and propping himself against the door. The others gather around him. \n103   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                            103 \nThe mob hauls their boar's head battering ram up to the door. \nMOB Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come, we're fifty strong And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the beast! \nThe castle staff has now vanished, their barricade dismantled. A series of bolts on the door slide open one by one, top to bottom. The door unlocking itself... \n110   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                              110 \nThe battering ram smashes the door one last time -- \nMOB Kill the beast!     Kill the beast! \nThe door swings open easily and the mob tumbles inside, to find: \n111   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                111 \nIt's EMPTY. Met by eerie silence, Gaston and the mob cautiously enter. The door barely hangs on its hinges. \nVillagers hold up torches. The flickering light reveals FURNITURE. Chairs. A coat rack. A feather duster. A candelabra. A tea pot and teacup. A harpsichord. \nLEFOU Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted? \nGASTON Don't lose your nerve, LeFou. \nGaston looks into the mirror. ANGLE ON LeFou -- he notices Mrs. Potts. Brings his torch close to study her. \nANGLE ON THE MOB -- among them, Jean the potter stares at the eerie castle foyer -- \nJEAN This place seems familiar... like I've been here before... \nGaston approaches the west wing stairs.    LeFou brings his face down to the tea pot and teacup. \nLEFOU You must be the talking teacup.       And you must be his grandmother. \nMrs. Potts' EYES open.   Furious. \nMRS. POTTS Grand-mother? ATTACK! \nLeFou jumps back. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE as the furniture comes alive. Chairs kick the shins of several villagers. Plumette feathers villagers' faces furiously, causing them to have sneezing fits. As other villagers funnel in, the \"Lend-a-Hand\" lights outside the door bonk several of them on the head. They're alive after all. \nChapeau spins Gaston around and is about to land a blow when GASTON GRABS LEFOU and puts him in the line of fire. LeFou becomes a human punching bag as Cadenza approaches and rears up on his hind legs. His shadow falls across Gaston, who dives out of the way -- leaving LeFou exposed. \nLEFOU Gaston! \nCadenza comes crashing down on LeFou, squashing him flat. Gaston looks down at his friend. \nLEFOU (CONT'D) (weak, muffled) Gaston... help... \nGaston looks from LeFou to the enchanted mirror, then to the grand staircase. \nGASTON Sorry, old friend.   It's hero time. \nGaston rushes up the staircase.   Lefou passes out. \n112   INT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - NIGHT                          112 \nMonsieur d'Arque paces in the square, when he notices the door to the asylum wagon is ajar. He runs to the wagon and flings open the doors, only to find it empty. D'Arque slams the doors shut -- and there's Maurice, smiling beside him. \nMAURICE Hello.    Oh, I believe this is yours. \nMaurice casually hands the wagon's padlock to Monsieur d'Arque -- just as Belle rides past on Philippe! As she charges out of the village gates, she tosses her ball gown to the ground. \nMaurice waves to her proudly, then turns back to d'Arque. \nMAURICE (CONT'D) She's very headstrong. Do you have children? \nOff d'Arque's confusion -- \n113   OMITTED                                                     113 \n117   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                 117 \nLeFou, bruised but alive, opens his eyes, sits up -- when Plumette furiously begins feathering his face. \nPLUMETTE (laughs) No one to protect you now, eh?! \nLeFou swats -- and Plumette flies away, laughing. \n119   INT. TURRET STAIRCASE - CASTLE - NIGHT                      119 \nGaston finds himself at the landing of two staircases. Unsure which one leads to the beast, he holds up the mirror, which illuminates the right way. Gaston bounds up them. \n120   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                 120 \nChip rapidly fires saucers at attackers, counting them off as he dispatches them with glee. \nCHIP One!   Two!     Three!   Four!   Five! \nGARDEROBE (shock becomes rage) I'm coming, my love! That's it!     The fat lady is singing! \nGarderobe belts out a deafening high note and throws her massive girth off the balcony, sending Clothilde and the villagers below scattering. She lands with a graceful THUD. \nCADENZA Bravissima! \nBefore the villagers can retaliate, Cadenza's \"teeth\" shoot out of his mouth like machine gun rounds. BAM BAM BAM! \nLumi\u00e8re runs around with gunpowder trail, creating a line of firecracker explosions that send villagers scattering. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Watch your toes! \nIn the chaos, we find Agathe, moving quietly through the villagers and up the stairs. What is she up to? \nAs villagers pour out the doors, Lumi\u00e8re and Cogsworth meet at the base of the stairs. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Bon voyage! Safe trip home! \nCOGSWORTH And stay out! \n127   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                   127 \nBelle rides Philippe towards the castle.     She kicks his flanks and they double their speed. \n129   EXT. HIGHEST TURRET - CASTLE - NIGHT                          129 \nGaston steps slowly up onto the beast's turret. The beast senses his presence, turns. They lock eyes. Gaston cocks his pistol. \nGASTON Hello, beast. I am Gaston.    Belle sent me. \n130   INT. TURRET STAIRCASE - CASTLE - NIGHT                        130 \nBelle races up the stairs to the turret. \n131   EXT. HIGHEST TURRET - CASTLE - NIGHT                          131 \nWith no hope left, the beast turns away from Gaston, whose finger tightens on the trigger. \nGASTON Were you in love with her? Did you honestly think she'd want you? \nHe fires.   The beast drops over the edge. \nOn the turret below, his claws make contact with the slanted rooftop and break his fall. He hugs the rooftop, heaving. \nGaston looks down over the edge of the turret. He pulls his crossbow and reaches back over his shoulder to draw an arrow from his quiver -- but there's nothing there. \nGaston spins to see Belle, and his arrows gripped in her hands. \nGASTON (CONT'D) Belle? \nBELLE Where is he?! \nWith that, Belle snaps Gaston's arrows over her knee, and tosses them away. Gaston grabs her arm. \nGASTON When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall! \nBELLE NEVER. \nShe pulls away -- and uses this pivot to grab the barrel of Gaston's pistol. They struggle. \nWith Gaston on the back foot for a split second, Belle yanks the \npistol hard. Gaston, not letting go, swings with it, and seeking balance on a loose stone, he drops off the side of the turret! \nGaston's reflexes are quick. He lets go of the pistol, grabbing \na gargoyle and swinging himself down through a window of the turret. He lands on the spiral staircase. \nGaston's pistol, in the meantime, clatters down, coming to rest on the landing of a stone footbridge below. \n132   EXT. CASTLE - VARIOUS TURRETS - NIGHT                       132 \nWounded, the beast climbs around the lower turret. All around him, turrets quaver and crack. The castle is imploding. \nGASTON (O.S.) I'm coming for you, beast! \nGaston continues down until he reaches the bottom of the spiral staircase. He drops to a window box below, and jumps sideways onto another. \nThe beast makes a second leap, onto another parapet.   Tiles slide away beneath him as he scrambles to hang on. \nBelle reaches the landing at the bottom of the spiral staircase, and leaps down onto another adjacent landing. She looks out, trying to see the beast through the turrets. \nThe beast swings around a third parapet and leaps onto another. He's now as far as he can get from Gaston. \nAs villagers stagger away in defeat, Lumi\u00e8re turns to Plumette, takes her in his arms, about to give her a V-Day kiss. \nLUMI\u00c8RE We did it, Plumette.   Victory is ours. \nPlumette is silent in Lumi\u00e8re's embrace. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Plumette...? Oh! My dear Plumette... \nCogsworth helps Lumi\u00e8re lower Plumette to the ground. Opposite them, Garderobe stands beside Cadenza, reunited at last. \nGARDEROBE Oh, maestro! You were so brave! Goodbye, my love... \nHer arms retract -- as the footlights inside her dim and die. \nCADENZA Darling!   No, don't leave me! \nCadenza sobs. We move along the few keys he has left until they freeze into silence. We TILT UP to the music stand. No hint of a face. Froufrou emerges from the foyer, pawing at his master and mistress, then goes still. Nothing more than a piano stool now. \nMrs. Potts frantically approaches Cogsworth and Lumi\u00e8re. \nMRS. POTTS CHIP! CHIP! Have you seen Chip!? He ran off! Oh, where is my little boy -- \nLumi\u00e8re and Cogsworth watch in horror as Mrs. Potts' face disappears into the painted ornamentation of the tea pot. \nCHIP Mama! \nLumi\u00e8re turns to Cogsworth, panicked that Chip might see what's happened. \nCOGSWORTH Oh no. \nJust as he leaps up, his features fade away and gravity takes over. The saucer plummets, shattering. But Chapeau catches Chip in mid-air -- and lovingly places him, inanimate, onto the trolley cart beside Mrs. Potts. \nChapeau straightens himself nobly, and becomes a coat rack. All around Cogsworth and Lumi\u00e8re, the staff goes still. \nCOGSWORTH (CONT'D) Lumi\u00e8re... I... TICK... can't... CHIME... speak... \nLUMI\u00c8RE It's all right, Cogsworth. \nCOGSWORTH I... can't... TICK... Lumi\u00e8re, my friend... TOCK... it was an honor to serve with you. \nThe only sound Cogsworth makes is `tick tock, tick tock.' Lumi\u00e8re is alone. Surrounded by objects. \nLUMI\u00c8RE The honor was mine. \nLumi\u00e8re does a final twirl and stiffens.      He is a candlestick. \n136   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               136 \nANGLE ON THE BELL JAR. The final rose petal drops -- just as a HOODED FIGURE appears. We move up to reveal: AGATHE. \nBELLE (to the beast) Please, don't leave me.    Come back. \nTIGHT ON BELLE -- her lips touch the beast's forehead in a kiss. \nBELLE (CONT'D) I love you. \nHearing these words, Agathe smiles benevolently and places her hand on the bell jar -- which explodes and releases a wave of rose petals, whirling into the air. \nA golden light begins to emanate from Agathe. It encircles the beast and he too begins to rise. Belle gets to her feet, watching as the beast is lifted and enveloped by the swirling aurora, and then buffeted gently back down to reveal -- \nTHE PRINCE \nHe lands on his feet and looks down at his hands, his arms, his chest. He turns -- and sees Belle. \nPRINCE Belle... \nSlowly he steps toward her, and she to him. \nIn silent disbelief, Belle runs her fingers through his hair. She looks into the Prince's blue eyes. It is him. Tears of grief turn to tears of joy as they lean in for their first kiss. \n137   EXT. CASTLE - DAWN                                            137 \nMagic explodes outwards. And with it, the dawn breaks. The castle transforms like someone is giving it a wash of gold. The magic spreads across the balcony as the sun rises on the terrace, traveling down the castle facade -- creepy stone gargoyles turn into noble statuary -- \n138   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - DAWN                                  138 \nAs the light passes over, an upside-down FROUFROU transforms back into a tiny BICHON FRISE basking in the sun. He leaps up and chases his tail (still a tassle), then trots over to CHAPEAU \nand relieves himself on his leg -- which changes into a human foot. \nChapeau transforms back into a VALET and shoos the dog   away with his walking stick. As the dog weaves through his    legs, the valet loses his balance and bumps into the trolley   cart holding Mrs. Potts and Chip. It starts to roll toward    the stairs. \nThe valet backs into Garderobe, who waddles in and out of sunlight, changing from wardrobe to human to wardrobe again. Cadenza's face comes alive as he sees the wardrobe falling onto him. As it crashes, the wardrobe's doors fly open, sending out a flurry of garments. We follow them back to the ground, where the human DIVA now lies on top of the human MAESTRO. \n", "test1_input": "As the boys scramble into school, Belle steps on the stones over the duck pond -- revealing GIRLS forced into \"woman's work\" chores, washing clothes in the circular laverie.

Another fishmonger, the shrewish CLOTHILDE, accosts him: \nCLOTHILDE I need six eggs \nThe FARMER points out the price.

CHURCH VESTRY - DAY                                   10 \nBelle escapes into the peace and serenity of a country church. Jolly PERE ROBERT looks up as she enters. \nPERE ROBERT Well! If it isn't the only bookworm in town. So where did you run off to this week? \nBELLE Two cities in Northern Italy.    I didn't want to come back. \nBelle hands \"Romeo and Juliet\" to Pere Robert, who dutifully returns it to the shelves of the town's \"library\": a COUPLE DOZEN BOOKS in total. She remains hopeful. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Have you got any new places to go? \nPERE ROBERT I'm afraid not. But you may reread any of the old ones that you'd like. \nBELLE Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big. \nHe smiles.    Belle picks up a new book and smiles back. \nPERE ROBERT Bon voyage. \n11   EXT.

VILLAGE PROMONTORY - DAY                            11A \nLooking down on the village is GASTON, a dashingly handsome war hero clad in a dazzling gold breastplate. The only thing bigger than his muscles is his ego. Strapped on his saddle is a musket and the spoils of his hunt: rabbit, fox, and fowl. Riding beside him is Gaston's long-suffering aide-de- camp and devoted best friend LEFOU. \nThrough his spyglass, Gaston spots Belle. \nGASTON Look at her, LeFou. My future wife. Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best. \n", "test1_true": "GASTON I know.

LeFou shoots them a look, whispers: \nLEFOU It's never gonna happen, ladies. \nNoticing Belle crossing the market, Gaston starts off in pursuit.

Shall I join you this evening? \nBELLE Sorry, not tonight. \nGASTON Busy? \nBELLE No. \nA mortified smile and Belle is off.   LeFou approaches. \nLEFOU So.   Moving on? \nGASTON No, LeFou. It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey. \nGASTON (CONT'D) That's what makes Belle so appealing. She hasn't made a fool of herself just to gain my favor. What would you call that? \nLEFOU Dignity? \nGASTON It's outrageously attractive, isn't it? \nGaston looks at the village lasses standing outside of the tavern. They all give him the eye.

How lovely to make your acquaintance. \nBelle tries to block her view of the escape rope, but Mrs. Potts is too sharp. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) It's a very long journey. Let me fix you up before you go. I have found that most troubles seem less troubling after a bracing cup o' tea. \nThe tea is poured into Chip, who wheels over to Belle. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Slowly now, Chip. \nBelle picks up Chip and brings him up to her mouth. Little Chip finds himself face-to-face with the most beautiful girl he has ever seen.

Belle reaches up and grabs one. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) And a dinner here is never second best Go on unfold your menu (MORE) \nLUMI\u00e8RE (CONT'D) Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, be our guest \nLUMI\u00c8RE AND COGSWORTH Be our guest! \nCogsworth shushes Lumi\u00e8re, and Lumi\u00e8re jabs him back.   One by one the kitchen doors swing open, presenting: \nLUMI\u00c8RE Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flamb\u00e9! \nThe fish pie explodes! A piece of cod hits Cogsworth in the face, knocking him over. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret! \nFlute glasses fill up with champagne and then break into a Bob Fosse homage. Belle grabs a glass, but Lumi\u00e8re snatches it before she sips. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared! \nLumi\u00e8re coaxes the flatware to its feet. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining! \nThe flatware hold out a napkin, into which Lumi\u00e8re jumps, like a \ntrampoline. He is launched into the air, swinging between chandeliers a la Cirque du Soleil. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks \nCHANDELIER CANDLESTICKS And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet! \nLumi\u00e8re falls and lands back in the middle of the champagne flutes. They rise up around him. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest (to Cogsworth) If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Oui our guest Be our guest, be our guest! \nCogsworth steps back as Lumi\u00e8re again takes center stage in a Martha Graham inspired solo. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving \nBelle reaches again for food but is stopped by Lumi\u00e8re's melodramatic histrionics. He wraps himself in a napkin for the full Martha Graham effect. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) He's not whole Without a soul to wait upon \nLumi\u00e8re does a `tragic walk' down the table. Reaching the end, he slides down to the floor on the tablecloth, then gathers it around his neck and continues on. \nBelle tries to stab a bite as the food moves past her, as if on a conveyer belt. Sliding past her, Cogsworth wobbles. \nOn the floor, snow swirls around Lumi\u00e8re. We pull out to see several \"ETTES\" flinging salt at him to create the effect. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Ah, those good old days when we were useful Suddenly, those good old days are gone \nReaching the end of the table, plates dive and spin into neat piles -- \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Too long we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills \n-- while Cogsworth lands on Lumi\u00e8re's lap below. Chapeau scoops \nthem both up and drops them back on the table before Belle. \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy \nLumi\u00e8re playfully pokes Cogsworth in his pot belly -- then takes a flying leap! \nLUMI\u00c8RE (CONT'D) You walked in, and oops-a-daisie! \n58   INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT                               58 \nMrs. Potts hops along the edge of the sink basin. \nMRS. POTTS It's a guest, it's a guest! Sakes alive, and I'll be blessed! Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I've had more napkins freshly pressed! \nShe ascents to the top of a tiered, circular pastry table, as napkins twirl around her. Desserts appear and circle Mrs. Potts. Then tea cups enter on the outer circle, moving in the opposite direction. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) With dessert, she'll want tea And my dear, that's fine with me! While the cups do their soft shoeing, I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing! \nFrom overhead, a la Busby Berkeley, we reveal desserts, teacups, napkins, the floor, everything circling in opposing directions. Mrs. Potts descends, jumping onto her tea trolley -- and notices a smudge of icing on Chip. \nMRS. POTTS (CONT'D) I'll get warm, piping hot Heaven's sake, is that a spot? \n", "test3_true": "MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Clean it up, we want the company impressed! \nThe trolley rolls through the doors -- \n59   INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                           59 \n-- and up to Belle.   Mrs. Potts pours a cup into Chip. \nMRS. POTTS We've got a lot to do -- Is it one lump or two? For you our guest! \nLUMI\u00c8RE She's our guest! \nMRS. POTTS She's our guest! \nFinally, unable to resist, Cogsworth joins in, pushing Lumi\u00e8re out of the spotlight. \nCOGSWORTH, LUMI\u00c8RE, MRS. POTTS She's our guest! \nPlumette and her \"Ettes\" descend on a chandelier, which is lowered by Lumi\u00e8re. They dance; a Beyonc\u00e9 homage. \nALL Be our guest! Be our guest! Our command is your request! It's years since we had anybody Here and we're obsessed! \nLumi\u00e8re ties the chandelier rope around Cogsworth, who falls over, causing the light to spin. Plumette dives into a massive punch bowl, leading her \"Ettes\" into an Esther Williams moment. \nALL (CONT'D) With your meal, with your ease, Yes indeed, we aim to please \nSplashes from the punch bowl launch us into a \"Singin' in the Rain\" moment, with Lumi\u00e8re dancing under the fountain. The grand finale is pure Bollywood, punctuated by explosions of candy-colored powders. \nALL (CONT'D) While the candlelight's still glowing, Let us help you, we'll keep going -- Course by... COURSE! One by one! Til you shout \"Enough, I'm done!\" Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest Tonight you'll prop your feet up But for now let's eat up... Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest! Please! Be our guest!! \nAs the table clears itself, whooshing back into the kitchen, Lumi\u00e8re whirls toward Belle, finally presenting her with -- \nLUMI\u00c8RE Pudding?! \nOverwhelmed, she laughs. \n60   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                  60 \nMrs. Potts (on her trolley cart) escorts Belle from the dining room. \nBELLE Surely you're as trapped here as I am. Don't you ever want to escape? \nMRS. POTTS The master's not as terrible as he appears. Somewhere deep in his soul, there's a prince of a fellow, just waiting to be set free. \nBelle takes this in, a valuable piece of the puzzle.   She looks up at the massive staircase. \nBELLE Lumiere mentioned something about the West Wing... \nMRS. POTTS Never you mind about that.   Off to bed with you, poppet. \nBELLE Good night. \nMRS. POTTS Nighty-night. Straight to bed! \nMrs. Potts moves off as Belle climbs the stairs toward her room. At the top, she hurries up the staircase leading to the west wing. \n63   INT. STAIRCASE - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT                  63 \nBelle sticks to the shadows.   She walks up to a massive wooden door -- slightly ajar. \n64   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               64 \nFurniture lies in rubble, curtains are shredded -- evidence of the beast's temper. Wary, Belle investigates when -- \nSHE GLIMPSES EYES PEERING AT HER OFF TO THE SIDE. \nWith a start, Belle wheels to find -- the eyes belong to a royal portrait. The subject seems to be a TEENAGE BOY but his face has been SLASHED BEYOND RECOGNITION. \nOnly the eyes survived. Bright blue. Engaging. Resembling the eyes of THE BEAST. She realizes that this is the \"prince of a fellow\" Mrs. Potts was referring to. \nBelle leans in to study the painting. A ROYAL FAMILY stands by the castle. The FATHER's image has been slashed. The QUEEN remains pristine. Kind. Beautiful. \nBelle moves past a large four-poster bed, its faded coverlet gray with dust, like no one has slept in it for years. On the floor, she sees a makeshift bed made of straw, torn bits of fabric and crumpled blankets: the resting place of a nocturnal carnivore. \nBelle turns and sees the glow coming from the GLASS JAR by an open window leading to the balcony. Inside the jar -- THE ENCHANTED ROSE. \nMesmerized, Belle approaches the rose. She lifts the jar, leaving the rose unprotected. She reaches out to touch the rose. A shadow cuts across Belle's face. \nTHE BEAST WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?    WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT!? \nThe beast bears down on Belle, backing her up.   She puts down the bell jar. \n", "test3_id": 2639}

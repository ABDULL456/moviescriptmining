A MONTAGE, with abbreviated SCENES DISSOLVING one into another of Marian supervising a thorough, top-to-bottom cleaning of the clubhouse: 
One Disciple sprays Easy-Off in a blackened oven. Another empties ashtrays. Yet Another vacuums. Still others pick up wrappers from under the couch, while Marian wags a reproving finger at them. One Disciple tosses the contents of an ashtray under the couch while Marian isn't looking.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER - 
Marian ladles chili into all of their bowls in a series of JUMP CUTS.

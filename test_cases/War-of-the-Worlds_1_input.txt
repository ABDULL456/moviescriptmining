I want to go inside. 
RAY 
It's okay. 
RACHEL 
I want to go inside. 
RAY 
Okay, you go ahead. 
The friend's baby starts to cry... 
FRIEND 2 
That's enough weather for me. (begins walking inside) 
RACHEL 
I don't want to go by myself. 
BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house. BAM! The lighting continues. BAM! 
RAY 
Kind of fun, ain't it? 
RACHEL 
No. 
RAY 
Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of July. 
RACHEL 
No it's not. 
Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING continues. 
INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day 
Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes Rachel scream. 
RAY 
It's okay. You're fine. 
RACHEL 
It hit right behind our house. 
RAY 
Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there again because lighting doesn't strike twice in the same place. 
BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump. 
RAY 
Oh, SHIT! 
They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor under the table as the lighting goes on. 
RACHEL 
Where's Robbie? 
RAY 
I don't know. 
RACHEL 
Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you okay? 
BAM! The lighting continues. 
RAY 
Where's the thunder? 
RACHEL 
Why won't it stop? 
Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all is silent.

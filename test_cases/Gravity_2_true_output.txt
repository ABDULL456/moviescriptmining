Nothing... only static. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside the Station... Do you copy? 
She drifts along the module, listening intently through the headset. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Come on Matt. Talk to me. (NOTHING) Tell me where you are. (NOTHING) Give me your position... 
No voices. Just static. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Where are you? Give me a visual... tell me what you see. 
Nothing. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Oh, come on. You've been yammering nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up? 
She waits ONE SECOND, TWO SECONDS- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Come on Matt, talk to me! 
The signal cuts in and out, but remains indecipherable. There is something unnerving about it. 
She drops her head and continues drifting toward the porthole, listening as the STATIC SPUTTERS. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Say something... Anything. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me about the hairy guy. What happened? Waiting for him to respond, and in a softer voice, completely RESIGNED- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this. 
She bumps against the PORTHOLE, and glances out- 
The Earth glimmers brightly. A third of the hemisphere is in complete darkness. Her FACE REFLECTED in the glass is SUPERIMPOSED over the EARTH. 
Her eyes glisten briefly, but she fights it back. Then she pulls herself together, and begins reporting- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Houston in the blind. 
The way Matt would have done it- 
RYAN (CONT'D) This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS... All communication with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio transmission is absent. Visual is nonexistent. (A BEAT) To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole survivor of STS-157. 
Ryan hovers by the porthole, looking hopeless. 
All is silent save for the RADIO static and the hum of the Space Station. 
Outside the Aurora Borealis performs its ghostly dance over the Earth's Northern Hemisphere. 
SILENCE. Only the hum and the static, when- 
An ALARM CHIRPS, RED LIGHTS FLICKERING across the module. 
Ryan twists, swimming back to the control panel, studying a FLASHING grid of LEDS: 
GRAPH OF THE STATION- 
...where a blinking light indicates the Japanese Module IS ON FIRE. 
RYAN (CONT'D) What now? AND THEN- 
The Destiny Lab begins blinking. 
THE FIRE IS EXPANDING 
She pushes herself toward the hatch, swimming through the few pieces of paper still hovering as she exits into the- 
UNITY NODE 1. 
The ALARM'S STACCATO is blasting in synchrony with the emergency lights blinking across the station. 
SMOOTH BLUE FLAMES ribbon eerily across the skin of the Destiny Lab. They are spreading, expanding with a dense cloud of SMOKE. 
Ryan enters and snatches a FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall of the module, and- 
She points the nozzle at the fire and SPRAYS. 
With no gravity to hold her down, the force of the spray SENDS HER FLYING BACK and- 
SHE CRASHES AGAINST A WALL. The fire extinguisher bangs against her face and CUTS HER LIP. 
The impact is so strong that it almost knocks her out. Her eyes fill with tears but she reacts. 
There's no time to lose. She fastens her feet to a strap on the floor, and-

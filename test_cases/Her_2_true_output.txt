EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DUSK 
Slightly in the future, the city's been developed even more with massive office, apartment and mall complexes. It's a city designed for comfort and ease. The LA basin is more crowded and dense, resembling Shanghai, with buildings as far as the eye can see. Construction cranes loom overhead. Close on Theodore walking through the commuter crowd.

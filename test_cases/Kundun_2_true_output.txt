"Religion is poison." 
MAO TSE TUNG Well, let me walk you to your car. 
Tenzin Gyatso slowly gets to his feet.  We must see on his face that he realizes it has all been lies.  All the kind words and promises, it must all be lies. 
He is unable to raise his face to Mao's.  All he sees before him are those shinny shoes, those exquisitely shaped, glistening hands. 
EXT.  MAO'S OFFICE  NIGHT 
Outside this building, a black car is waiting.  It is bitterly cold. 
Mao - wearing no hat, no coat, and coughing - opens the door for the boy. 
The Dalai Lama shakes the man's hand. 
MAO TSE TUNG Take care of your health. 
Tenzin Gyatso gets into the car and Mao slams the door. 
INT.  CAR  NIGHT 
As the car drives away, Tenzin Gyatso turns to see the Chairman, still standing in the cold, still waving goodbye. 
Then, Tenzin Gyatso looks straight ahead and says: 
TENZIN GYATSO He will betray us. 
The view pulls back. The Lord Chamberlain sits beside the young man. 
LORD CHAMBEPIAIN Did you ever doubt it? 
TENZIN GYATSO I had relinquished doubt. 
EXT.  TENZIN GYATSO'S HOUSE IN AMDO  DAY 
The Dalai Lama and members of his retinue stand in front of his old house in the village of Taktser, Amdo Province. 
The young man smiles as he enters the courtyard.  He pauses to look at the prayer flag, flapping in the breeze. 
He opens the front door. 
INT.  HOUSE  DAY 
A family of relatives inhabits the house.  They bow to His Holiness as the young man makes his way to the kitchen. 
INT.  KITCHEN  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso steps into the kitchen - he might have to bend his head under the low ceiling.  He laughs his wonderful laugh. 
Immediately, a woman approaches with a cup of tea. 
But the hand of a Chinese official reaches out, takes the tea and returns it to her.  It is not permitted. 
The woman looks confused.  Tenzin Gyatso is humiliated. 
EXT.  HOUSE  DAY 
A group has gathered outside the house. 
Tenzin Gyatso goes toward them as they prostrate.  When they have finished, he reaches out his hands to take theirs. 
He says to one old woman: 
TENZIN GYATSO Are you happy? 
The OLD WOMAN says, with tears in her eyes: 
OLD WOMAN I am very happy and prosperous under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman Mao Tse Tung. 
It is a horrifying announcement. 
The Dalai Lama touches her head.  She weeps and clutches his hands. 
The young man looks up, over her head, to Kyeri, the protectress mountain of this small village. 
We hear loudspeakers, blaring, in the background - trumpeting propaganda about Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army. 
Tibetan horns blow.  It sounds like a warning. 
CLOSE on a newspaper.  It is a Chinese newspaper and the picture on the front page shows a row of severed, Tibetan heads. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso puts the paper down.  He removes his glasses and turns to his advisor - the grand Lord Chamberlain. 
TENZIN GYATSO I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.

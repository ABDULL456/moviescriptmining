NAOMI Omigod, he's choking!     Jordan, do something!! 
Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE -- Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size. 
Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue... 
Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) He's not breathing! 
Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery.         Nothing. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Save him! 
Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest, breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts. 
JORDAN (V.O.) This stupid sonovabitch! All Donnie ever did was fuck me up and now I had to save his life `cause I took a CPR class when the baby was learning to swim. Just for the record, I want it noted: not for a second did I even think about letting him choke to death, even though it would've saved me an awful lot of headaches. 
Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost completely blue. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN He won't come back! 
NAOMI Don't let him die! He has children! 
One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again, Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.            * 
FADE TO BLACK. 
BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 (V.O.) Jordan Belfort? 
196A   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY                         196A (LATE SUMMER `95) 
Jordan opens his eyes. Through his HAZY POV, we see Violet, the maid standing over him with two OLD BROOKVILLE POLICE OFFICERS as Naomi attends to Donnie in the background. 
JORDAN Yes? 
BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

Jordan exits the house with the Police Officers.        The Lamborghini is TOTALLED, an absolute wreck. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Wow. Maybe I hadn't made it home okay. 
201    EXT. HEGEMAN'S ROAD - NIGHT     (LATE SUMMER `95)                201 
FLASHBACK. Nodding out, Jordan drives the Lamborghini like a maniac, careening off parked cars and trees. 
JORDAN (V.O.) It was an absolute miracle I wasn't killed, and an even bigger miracle I hadn't killed anyone. The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
201A   INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (LATE SUMMER `95)                     201A 
A MAN steps up to get his mug shot taken, but it's Brad, not Jordan. FLASH. Turn to the side. FLASH. 
JORDAN (V.O.) But they couldn't arrest me, the cops had no proof I'd been behind the wheel. Meanwhile, Brad did a                     * few months in jail for contempt                      * because he wouldn't rat Donnie out. They never found his gun, though, so they finally had to let him go.

Jordan watches an INSTRUCTOR lead Skylar on a pony. Nearby Naomi holds newborn PARKER. Manny Riskin and Max stand beside Jordan. 
MANNY RISKIN You're a lucky guy, Jordan. Legally I've never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do. Christ, you're lucky to be alive much less not in jail. 
JORDAN I don't believe in luck. 
MANNY RISKIN That's what all lucky people say. It's time, Jordan. Let me make a deal with SEC. Before your luck runs out. 
Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back. 
JORDAN What kind of terms? 
MANNY RISKIN You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations -- stock manipulation, high pressure sales tactics, ticky-tack shit like that. You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time. 
JORDAN And Stratton?    What happens there? The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
MANNY RISKIN You'd have to walk away. Let Donnie take over. (that one hurts) Now the FBI's a different animal. They can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing. But with you on the sidelines, my guess is your best friend Agent Denham'll be left standing around with his dick in his hand. 
Jordan digests that. 
MAX You beat them, Jordan. You won. Sail into the sunset with your wife and kids while you can. 
MANNY RISKIN God knows you'll never have to work again. 
As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR THE ROAR OF A CROWD...

The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage. 
JORDAN I'm sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately, about me, about the future of this firm, and that's what I'd like to talk to you about today. (a few beats, then) Five years ago when I started Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come when I'd be moving on. It's truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here.

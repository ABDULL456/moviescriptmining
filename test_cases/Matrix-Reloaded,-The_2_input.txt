MORPHEUS arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part. He stands  and grins down at NEO. 
MORPHEUS 
"So, you can smack me around, Neo?" 
NEO 
"Oh yeah. Anytime." 
MORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into  the booth. He stands before them. 
TRINITY 
"Hows Tank?" 
MORPHEUS 
"Hes on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son shes lost in this war." 
His comments set a sober tone. 
MORPHEUS 
"The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But, thats not giving us a rest." 
TRINITY 
"Let me guess. Weve been ordered back out anyway." 
MORPHEUS 
"Yes. This is another special op. Im in command, Niobe and Trinity are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon." 
FLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch. 
MORPHEUS 
"We dont know exactly what hes capable of. He may be just tapping his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from him, as he does from us." 
CHOI 
"Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?" 
MORPHEUS 
"Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi." 
DUJOUR 
"Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents to death." 
CHOI 
"Oh my God thats so funny. My point is, dont we need some r-and-r? Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five, right? Shit. Im glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus..." 
MORPHEUS 
"You dont have to go, Choi. Volunteers only." 
TRINITY 
"Hes got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?" 
MORPHEUS 
"We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our entry. And Neos." 
CHOI 
"Fuck. Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do." 
MORPHEUS 
"He is the One." 
DUJOUR 
"You havent lost the faith, have you Choi?" 
CHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down. 
CHOI 
"Well, these are the times that try mens souls. Heres to victory." 
EXT. TUNNEL 
The FREEDOM hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises through  the murky  depths. It  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the cave. 
A quartet of  SQUIDDIES slips by.  We follow as  they worm their  ways through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble cockpit by mere feet. 
FREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi  at the controls. 
INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT 
They watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance.

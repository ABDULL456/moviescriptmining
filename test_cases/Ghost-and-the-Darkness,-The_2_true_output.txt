THE GHOST, unharmed and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST. It stares at Patterson. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND THE GHOST- 
-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau- 
-THEN THE GHOST ROARS- 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run- 
REDBEARD Shoot for chrissakes!- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward him. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the clearing and as he reaches it- 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson- 
-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket- 
-and it's safe and free and gone. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked. 
The low point of his life. 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard. 
SAMUEL Did you ever see a lion that size? 
REDBEARD Not even close. (Now he moves to Patterson) What happened? 
PATTERSON (a whisper) ...misfire... it jammed... 
REDBEARD Has it ever done that before? 
PATTERSON ...don't know... 
SAMUEL It's Hawthorne's. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. Trying for control. 
REDBEARD You exchanged weapons? (Patterson nods) You went into battle with an untried gun? (Patterson nods) 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's going to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to happen. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet. 
CUT TO 
REEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, his voice is surprisingly quiet. 
REDBEARD They have an expression in prizefighting: "everyone has a plan until they're hit." (beat) You've just been hit... (beat) ...the getting up is up to you... (And he turns, moves off and) 
CUT TO 
THE NEW HOSPITAL. 
Nearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is supervising men and material that are being transferred. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to the center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the sick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now. 
Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO EXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his face. 
REDBEARD (to the Orderlies) Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now. (They understand- now to Samuel and Hawthorne) You two will sleep beautifully in your tents. (beat) And stay there. 
SAMUEL And where will you sleep beautifully? 
REDBEARD (smile) Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- (beat) -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. (And on that-) 
CUT TO 
THE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.

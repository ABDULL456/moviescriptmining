11 INT. JASON'S ROOM 
SUZANNE He's my husband. 
JASON 
(SOFTLY) I know, Mom. 
SUZANNE -- I still love him. 
JASON Whatever. She walks out. 
12 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Alex stands under water as hot as he can stand, parboiling himself. Eyes squeezed shut, he lets out a long breath. His life demands more energy than he has anymore. He soaps himself thoroughly. 
13 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Suzanne hears the front DOOR SLAM. Jason's DUCATI STARTS UP and ACCELERATES away. Alex comes out of the bathroom in a towel. 
SUZANNE 
(FONDLY) Lie down, I'll give you a back rub. She stumbles slightly against the bed, catches a bed post for balance, flops back on the bed with a laugh. 
SUZANNE -- maybe I'd better lie down. He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television. Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her best. 
SUZANNE I liked the twin nurses. There was kind of a story. Alex brings the remote control back to bed. 
ALEX You'll like this one better. 
(CONTINUED) 
13 CONTINUED: He hangs his towel on a doorknob, slides into bed, starts the tape, which begins with sweat-slick dancing girls at Carnival. To Suzanne's astonishment, it turns out to be a travelog. 
SUZANNE Rio? 
ALEX I've been so busy. We could sneak away for a week.. Would you like that? 
SUZANNE If we really go. Last time I packed, we went nowhere. 
ALEX 
(SLEEPILY) Last time was different. 
SUZANNE (watching the tape) The beaches -- I thought we had a beach. I read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes, to keep thieves away from the guests. They can look at every inch of your body through the scope. (with a low laugh) Do you mind that I like that? Alex? He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
14 EXT. BOAT - DAWN 14 
On the flying bridge of an old fishing boat, Jason eases the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The SWELLS SLAP harder against the wooden sides. The boat dips and dances to the music of the water. Jason swings down the ladder. He sets up his linis to troll. The starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten around its rim. Jason leans on the transom and stares at the flat, silvery wedge of wake. He breathes out a word. 
JASON :. Bite... 
(CONTINUED) 
14 CONTINUED: Nothing happens. He doesn't move. Then the top of one of the rods shivers slightly, goes still. Jason delicately fingers the rod like a blind man reading Braille, to feel for vibration. A smile pulls at his mouth. He steps behind the rod. The fish hits. 
JASON 
(CALLING OUT) Henryl Fish ont The line screams out. Jason's ready. He sets the hook. 
JASON Time to go to work, man! C'mon. A tall, black drifter appears from-below, still yawning, scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's weathered his head for some time. 
HENRY Who we got? 
JASON Let's find out. He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean, they both recognize the fish at the end. 
HENRY Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out of the good stuff. Damn. He spits over the side. Jason grins. 
JASON This one's got more to worry about than you do. He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.- 
HENRY Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I want to know the sucker's good and dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat. You got a barb on that hook? . 
JASON Oh, yeah. Jason braces for the fight. 
15 EXT. DOCK - MORNING 
Jason and Henry are cutting the shark with the speed and dexterity of professionals. 
HENRY The Gulf, man, that's the place. And what makes you think fifty-fifty is right? My boat. My gas. 
JASON My skill. (slicing off the fins) ... My fins.

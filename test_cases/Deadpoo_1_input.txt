Ajax squats down and picks up TWO STEEL-HAFTED FIRE-FIGHTING AXES, each with an ULTRA-SHARP BLADE on one side of its head and an EQUALLY SHARP CLAW on the other. 
Deadpool raises a KATANA and HURLS it NOT at Ajax, but the PUNCH-BOWL. The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYING it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny BREATH. She TUGS on the frayed RESTRAINT. 
AJAX I hear you grow back parts. When I get done... parts will have to grow back you. 
DEADPOOL Good one.

A big BOOMING sound from below and then the deck of the carrier shakes as if from a mild earthquake. Ajax and Deadpool look at each other. Shrug. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Let's dance. (beat) And by dance I mean try to kill each other. 
69   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS                                       69 
BAM!   Below, COLOSSUS delivers a HAYMAKER from hell itself. 
Angel Dust FALLS, then RISES, RIPS OFF the WING of a PLANE, and BLASTS Colossus with it... first like a BASEBALL BAT, then like a GOLF CLUB, then like a COUNTY FAIR MALLETS you use to try to ring a bell. CLANG! 
A battered NTW RACES toward Angel Dust. Angel Dust swings the wing, but NTW BASEBALL SLIDES UNDER it and EXPLODES up into her chin. 
Angel Dust is lifted off her feet into the side of the carrier, BUCKLING some of its supports. NTW rolls aside. 
70   EXT. FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                       70 
And now, we get what we've been long been waiting for: 
THE FINAL CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE between DEADPOOL AND AJAX. AXES vs. KATANA, TEN STORIES UP... 
AJAX TAKES a MIGHTY, ROARING SWING with an AXE. 
DEADPOOL Yowww! 
STEEL SINGS as AXE and KATANA meet again and again.        THRUSTS. PARRIES. SPARKS FLY! 
THUNK! Deadpool's BLADE passes through Ajax's THIGH and pins him to a piece of wreckage. 
CRACK!   Ajax tags Deadpool's head with the FLAT of an axe. 
SNAP! Ajax BREAKS the sword's blade with an AXE, not feeling anything as he slides his leg off the sword. 
GASP! VANESSA grits her teeth, pulls against the restraints. The thick nylon begins to tear as she saws it against the katana blade.

CLANG! AJAX wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel. Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck, barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings. 
Finally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool hollers. 
Deadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his TATTOO bleeds from a HOLE in its FOREHEAD. 
Deadpool GRITS his TEETH and YANKS the AXE from Ajax's grasp. A spinning KICK sends the second axe flying after the first. 
Now they're completely unarmed. 
AJAX Fine.   Fists. 
DEADPOOL Sounds like your last Saturday night. (smiles) The sense of humor survived. 
AJAX and DEADPOOL TRADE VICIOUS PUNCHES.        It's HAGLER vs. HEARNS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
Inspired, VANESSA strains against the torn nylon. RRRRIPPP! Her right wrist TEARS FREE. She uses her freed hand to start unlatching her other restraints. 
DEADPOOL throws short, blinding PUNCHES - rat-a-tat-tat - into AJAX's jaw. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Since you can't feel it? (holds up an INCISOR) I just knocked out your tooth. 
AJAX snarls, drives a SHOULDER into Deadpool, then MOUNTS him and BLUDGEONS his face with HAMMER-LIKE FISTS. 
DEADPOOL is starting to LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS when he turns his head to one side and spies the PUNCH-BOWL. 
We RACK FOCUS to VANESSA locking eyes with him from inside. Hers is an inspired... and INSPIRING look of LOVE. 
We hear a REPRISE of JOHN DENVER's `I WANT TO LIVE.' 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool      Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 70   CONTINUED: (2)                                                         70 
VANESSA pushes against the sealed door of the punchbowl with all her might. With a squeal of metal the latch breaks, the twisted metal flying off the lid as it slams open. 
Vanessa grabs the KATANA, jerks it free with another mighty effort. Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain, YANKS out the katana, and THROWS Vanessa aside violently. 
But it's all the opportunity Deadpool needs. He SURGES with energy and throws an THUNDEROUS UPPERCUT, BLASTING Ajax off. 
JOHN DENVER I want to liiiiiive! 
71   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                 71 
Below: WHOOSH, BAM! Angel Dust ducks an exhausted Colossus's punch and KICKS him THROUGH another STEEL SUPPORT. Colossus COLLAPSES. The carrier GROANS.

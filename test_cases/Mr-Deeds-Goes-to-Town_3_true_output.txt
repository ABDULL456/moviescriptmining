The turmoil is general, with bailiffs running to quiet them. The Judge pounding his gavel, incensed. 
BAILIFF'S VOICE 
Order! Order! 
JUDGE 
(when quiet reigns) 
In the interest of Mr. Deeds, I have tolerated a great deal of informality. But if there is one more outburst, I shall have the courtroom cleared. 
LONGFELLOW 
Your Honor혰 
JUDGE 
(surprised) 
Yes? 
LONGFELLOW 
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth. 
JUDGE 
Take the stand! 
There is a general stir of excitement - and whispering. 
326. CLOSE SHOT - BABE 
Her eyes sparkle happily. 
327. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND CLIENTS 
The clients look up at Cedar, concerned. Cedar comforts them with a confident grimace. 
328. MED. SHOT 
To include Longfellow, Judge, and others around them. Longfellow hesitates. 
JUDGE 
Proceed. 
LONGFELLOW 
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I혰 
329. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND 
Longfellow continues: 
LONGFELLOW 
About my playing the tuba. Seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that. If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays the tuba, then somebody better look into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba players running around loose. Of course, I don't see any harm in it. I play mine whenever I want to concentrate. That may sound funny to some people - but everybody does something silly when they're thinking. For instance, the Judge here is an O-filler . . . 
330. WIDER ANGLE 
Front of courtroom. 
JUDGE 
A what? 
LONGFELLOW 
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil. 
(points to desk) 
I was watching you. 
The Judge looks down at a paper in front of him. 
INSERT: OF A PRINTED DOCUMENT 
Of some sort. All the O's and P's and R's have the white spaces pencilled in. 
331. CLOSEUP - JUDGE 
As he looks up from the document. He is a trifle self-conscious. Laughter comes from the courtroom. 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
That may make you look a little crazy, Your Honor, just sitting around filling in O's - but I don't see anything wrong 'cause that helps you to think. Other people are doodlers. 
JUDGE 
Doodlers? 
332. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM 
LONGFELLOW 
That's a name we made up back home for people who make foolish designs on paper when they're thinking. It's called doodling. Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth? People draw the most idiotic pictures when they're thinking. Dr. Von Holler, here, could probably think up a long name for it, because he doodles all the time. 
Dr. Von Holler, who is in the middle of some doodling, flinches. A roar of laughter comes from the spectators. Longfellow reaches over to where Dr. Von Holler sits and picks up a piece of paper. 
LONGFELLOW 
(to Dr. Von Holler) 
Thank you. 
(returning to the stand) 
This is a piece of paper he was scribbling on. 
(scrutinizes it) 
I can't figure it out. One minute it looks like a chimpanzee - and the next minute it looks like a picture of Mr. Cedar. 
(hands it to him) 
You look at it, Judge. 
The Judge, with a serious mien, takes the paper. 
INSERT: OF PAPER 
It is a doodle face. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
Dr. Von Holler is somewhat uncomfortable. 
LONGFELLOW 
Exhibit A - for the defense. 
(after a pause) 
Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it, Your Honor? But I guess that's all right if Dr. Von Holler has to doodle to help him think. That's his business. Everybody does something different. Some people are혰 
(demonstrates) 
ear-pullers - some are nail-biters혰 
(pointing) 
That Mr. Semple over there is a nose-twitcher. 
333. CLOSE SHOT - SEMPLE AND HIS WIFE 
He looks up, startled, his nose twitching more violently than ever. The courtroom rocks with laughter. 
His wife, in her nervousness, pulls at her fingers. 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
And the lady next to him is a knuckle-cracker. 
Mrs. Semple quickly drops her hands in her lap, as the courtroom again fills with laughter. 
334. CLOSE SHOT - COBB 
He swings a key-ring around his forefinger. Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might get to him, and he hastily palms the keys and shoves them in his pocket. 
335. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEWSPAPER REPORTERS 
One is leaning forward, listening intently - biting the end of his pencil. The one next to him nudges him and silently points to the pencil in his mouth. The reporter gets the idea and, smiling sheepishly, yanks it out of his mouth. 
336. MED. CLOSE SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM 
LONGFELLOW 
So you see, everybody does silly things to help them think. 
(in conclusion) 
Well, I play the tuba. 
337. CLOSE SHOT - MAC 
As he bursts forth. 
MAC 
Nice work, toots! 
The crowd echoes him with shouts and laughter. 
338. CLOSE SHOT - JUDGE 
He glares off scene at Mac, reprimandingly. 
339. CLOSE SHOT - BABE 
She is amused at the embarassment Longfellow has caused them all. 
340. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND HIS CLIENTS 
They squirm uncomfortably. 
341. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND 
Longfellow in chair - Judge at bench, b.g. 
JUDGE 
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home? 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined. 
342. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM 
Featuring Longfellow. Cedar, who cannot stand it any longer, jumps to his feet. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, this is becoming farcical. I demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with side remarks and confine himself to facts! Let him explain his wanderings around the streets in underclothes, his feeding doughnuts to horses! 
JUDGE'S VOICE 
Proceed. 
LONGFELLOW 
Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look kind of bad, don't they? But to tell the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember them. I guess they happened, all right, because I don't think a policeman would lie about a thing like that, but I was drunk. It was the first time I was ever drunk in my life. It's probably happened to you, some time. I mean, when you were younger, of course.

GEORGES 
Impossible, this has to be an error.     Are you responsible for this data? 
BERGER 
Well, actually Patience Price brought the matter to my attention -- 
GEORGES 
Yes, yes, I'm familiar with Ms. Price. Obviously her bookkeeping is as sloppy as her appearance. 
BERGER 
Sir, she's a very reliable employee -- 
GEORGES 
I've heard enough, Berger. In the future, double- check your figures before you waste my time -- and then put it in a memo. 
WITH BERGER 
BERGER 
(on phone) In all fairness, Mr. Avenal, I think -- 
BEEP. He's talking to a dial tone.      Berger hangs up, frustrated and chagrined. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY 
START on a JEWELRY DISPLAY, a ritzy DIAMOND NECKLACE. SALLY's face appears in the window, beaming. 
SALLY 
Wow... sorry, Patience, I just found a new best friend. PATIENCE, beside her, WHISTLES appreciatively, then moves on. 
PATIENCE 
I'm sick of drooling over things I'll never have. The two are WINDOW-SHOPPING, passing a SHOE STORE, boots and high-heels... A WESTERNWEAR SHOP, belt buckles, WHIPS... 
SALLY 
Oh, you're a ray of sunshine. Tell you what, let me take you clubbing this weekend -- 
PATIENCE 
I'm not sure I'm fit to be seen in public. 
SALLY 
You will be in that dress.   I've had my eye on it for weeks. SALLY points at a MANNEQUIN in the window of a trendy boutique, garbed in a dramatic, sexy outfit -- a short bodice, a tiny skirt, plenty of plastic skin showing. 
PATIENCE 
Sally, that is not a dress, it's a rumor of a dress. It's barely forensic evidence of a dress. 
SALLY 
It's a genuine Gaultier knock-off -- 
PATIENCE 
It's not me. 
SALLY 
But don't you ever wanna be somebody else? 
PATIENCE 
I just wish I could be ten years old again -- it didn't matter what I wore as long as I could climb a tree in it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SALLY 
Your tomboy days are over. 
PATIENCE 
That's my bus, Sal, see you later. PATIENCE trots toward a BUS, SALLY calls after her. 
SALLY 
This weekend, Patience. I swear, I'm gonna make you have fun if it kills you... As Sally moves on, CAMERA LINGERS ON the window of A LINGERIE STORE, scantily-clad MANNEQUINS, including one in BLACK UNDIES and a CAT MASK. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
DAVE BERGER, the accountant, dressed casually, gets out of a CAB and heads into his modest home. 
INT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Berger SNIFFS the air quizzically as he lets himself in. He moves toward the KITCHEN. In the kitchen DOORWAY, he fumbles for a LIGHT SWITCH, flicks it on and -- 
EXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
KA-BOOM!     The WINDOWS BLOW OUT with a HUGE EXPLOSION. ACROSS THE STREET, a BLACK MERCEDES pulls from the curb, HEADLIGHTS OFF, and ACCELERATES away.

The tiger backs off as Pi approaches - curious and annoyed. Pi uses the stick to probe into the tiger's territory, testing his limits; Richard Parker gets angry, batting at the stick. Pi looks away, tries again, then turns to face Richard Parker, who growls, angry and begins batting at the stick. 
PI NO! 
Pi gives the tiger a stern glare. RP stops, stares back, then backs off. 
PI (CONT'D) Good. 
Pi reaches into a pouch behind his back, taking out a piece of fish. He places it on the end of the stick and reaches out, offering it to Richard Parker, who sniffs the air. 
Pi puts the fish on the bench. Richard Parker eats the fish, then backs up, growing calmer. 
Pi takes out another fish, reaches out to tap the bench, then tosses the fish on the bench. Richard Parker takes the fish, eats. 
Pi tosses the next piece near the edge of the tarp and taps, encouraging Richard Parker to follow his direction. 
PI (CONT'D) Go Richard Parker. Go. Go on home; I'll leave you alone. I'll respect that. I promise. Go, c'mon. 
Richard Parker stares at Pi. Pi raises his arms and yells, chasing Richard Parker around the bench and under the tarp. 
PI (CONT'D) Yes! 
Pi sits, the battle over. 
137   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DAY                            137 
The sun is high. Pi raises the adjustable canopy he has rigged on his raft and sits beneath it. He feels the wind on his face and watches Richard Parker lounge in the stern of the lifeboat. Pi smiles, for a moment genuinely happy. 
He uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil, then begins writing in the margins of his survival manual, which are covered with journal entries... 
`LIFE IS GOOD' MONTAGE - Pi's raft has transformed again. Fish strips dry on lines; he has fashioned new tools, rigged an elaborate water collection system out of turtle shells, and a collapsible shade umbrella. 
- Pi trims his fingernails, a fish bone toothpick in his mouth. 
PI (WRITING - V.O.) I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness. That a pile of tools - a bucket, a knife, a pencil- might become my greatest treasures. Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace. In times like these, I remember that he has as little experience of the real world as I do. We were both raised in a zoo by the same master. Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together. Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now. My fear of him keeps me alert. Tending to his needs gives my life purpose. 
138   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                             138 
A school of dolphins, hundreds of them, pass in the distance, the blue sea roiling. 
PI Dolphins, Richard Parker! 
Just beyond the school of dolphin, something else catches Pi's attention on the horizon - a freighter, much like the Tsimtsum, is within a few miles of their position.

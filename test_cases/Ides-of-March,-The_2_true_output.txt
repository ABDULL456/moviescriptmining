GOV. MORRIS Are you fucking kidding me...I'm gonna give Secretary of State to a guy who wants to cut the top ten floors off the UN? Paul when we started this campaign I said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
PAUL Governor, if you lose Ohio, and they get Thompson's delegates...Then they get North Carolina...then they get the lead. A lead you can't beat. But if we walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give him a cabinet post, then we take North Carolina. His state. Then Pennsylvania. Your state. And then it's simple math Mike. Take his endorsement and the race is over. 
GOV. MORRIS Paul, I respect you...respect your opinion...but I'm never gonna do it...so I suggest we find a way for me to win Ohio. 
They sit there looking at their shoes. GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) Anything else? 
Off their looks we- 
CUT TO: INT. MORRIS HEADQUARTERS - CINCINNATI - LATE AFTERNOON 
We're mid action. Everyone is there. Phones...emails...people running in and out. STEPHEN, BEN, MOLLY...sleeves rolled up. PAUL is in a closed room but we can see him on the phone. 
STEPHEN (On the phone) Do we have any other senators that can go to bat for us? House members won't do. 
BEN (Whispering to him) Or a Congressman from Ohio maybe. 
STEPHEN Right...but we need a Senator...one from Ohio would be nice. We push the camera through the room, edging closer to PAUL. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MOLLY (TO STEPHEN) This is all the car rental companies in Northern Ohio...they've booked every single van for Tuesday... 
STEPHEN Fuck...Jess, I'll call you back... (To Molly) All of them? Goddamit! 
BEN (On the computer) Here's what I have so far...Independents don't seem to be biting, but Republicans are...or say they are. STEPHEN They're not gonna tell a pollster that they're gonna vote Democratic...I don't even know how to read these polls. 
MOLLY I called and we can get a hundred vans out of Covington and Newport Kentucky. 
STEPHEN We don't need the fucking vans...we just don't want Pullman to have them... 
We keep pushing in on PAUL until we can hear him talking to a reporter on the phone. - During this conversation he types on his laptop. 
PAUL No, No that's not what I'm saying...we were the underdog before we got into this and we continue to be the underdog...well the numbers...we knew the numbers would get closer the closer we got to Tuesday...I'm not lowering expectations...have you ever heard me say that we had Ohio locked?... Then at least give me the courtesy of printing that in your column. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOVERNORS SUV - NIGHT 
We see The SUV drive down the highway. 
INT. GOVERNORS SUV - NIGHT We're in the second row of seats of the Governor's SUV. CINDY'S head on his shoulder. They are very comfortable and easy with each other. The Governor is writing a speech on a legal pad.

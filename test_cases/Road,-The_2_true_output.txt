MAN. (CONT'D) Oh you bastard! You bastard! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The MAN claws the blankets from the upturned trolley aside and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has fallen from his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of reach. He spots the flare gun and seizes it, resting it on the trolley and aiming carefully at the empty window. When the lone ARCHER appears again he squeezes off a shot and the flare goes rocketing up towards the window in a firey arc, ablaze with color, clean through the window. They can hear the ARCHER SCREAMING inside and see the colored light still flaring from the window. 
BOY. Oh Papa! 
MAN. Stay just like you are. He gets up and runs limping across the street, the arrow still embedded in his leg. 
INT. WOODEN STAIRS - EVENING 
He limps up the stairs of the old warehouse as quickly as he can, flare gun at the ready, arrow in his leg. 
INT. WAREHOUSE FLOOR - EVENING 
He bursts into the main room and trains the gun. At the far end a WOMAN is sitting with the prone form of the ARCHER. The floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still in flames. 
ARCHER'S WOMAN. You son of a bitch! 
MAN. Who else is up here? 
ARCHER'S WOMAN. You fucking asshole! The MAN looks down, his leg is bleeding heavily now and the arrow is still sticking out. 
MAN. Where's the bow? 
ARCHER'S WOMAN. I don't have it. 
MAN. Why are you following us? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ARCHER'S WOMAN. We're not following anybody. You were following us! The MAN stares at the WOMAN, looking her up and down, she looks sick and thin and desperate. He looks at the ARCHER, lying there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt, still smoking. The WOMAN covers his face with the blanket and the MAN doesn't know what to say, ashamed. He goes. 
EXT. CAFE - DAY 
POV - again from a distance, as if a third party is watching, we watch the BOY and the MAN hobble into a CAFE. 
INT. CAFE - DAY 
One wall of the CAFE is merely a pile of rubble, opening out to the sea. The opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush green woods. The MAN tries to pull the arrow out but just pulls the wooden stem out. He takes off his bloodied trousers and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the arrow head, made from a SPOON, buried inside. 
MAN. See if you can find the medical kit from the boat. Quickly. The BOY rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands it over. He stares as the MAN slowly extracts the spoon, wincing in agony. The MAN dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit and searches through the kit for a needle. He finds a suture needle in a sterile envelope, rips it open with his teeth and, using the light coming in through the parlour windows he threads some silk thread into the needle. He starts to suture up the wound, grimacing in pain as the BOY watches in silence, until eventually offering: 
BOY Does it hurt? The MAN just looks at him in disbelief - beat. 
MAN. Yes! It hurts! 
BOY. What does it feel like? The MAN eyes the BOY, amazed at this inopportune chat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. At least you're talking to me now. 
INT./EXT. CAFE - (CAMP 17) - NIGHT 
They have a campfire in the cafe by the jetty and sit overlooking the bay, through the missing wall, silent until: 
MAN. Do you want me to tell you a story? 
BOY. No. 
MAN. Why not? 
BOY. Your stories aren't true. 
MAN. They don't have to be true. They're stories.

ROSE Justice, that's what he wants, justice for everybody and especially for niggers. And I think that's real nice of him because black people don't have a very good life, you got to admit that, to be a nigger is sometimes practic'ly fatal, but the wife don't understand all of that, she thinks niggers are just so much dirt, which anybody ought to know better if they been on their ass their ownselves -- and that is the cause of his profound unhappiness, Buddy, that no-good-mean wife with all her Southern prejudice against niggers and everything! 
It is a very long speech and delivered with a non-stop vitality that leaves Buddy a trifle groggy. Slowly, he shakes his head, as enter Mother. 
MOTHER The Doctor is here. And Brother, supper is ready. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
A SHOT of the Hillyer family minus Rose eating dinner in the dining room. The meal is almost finished, Daddy cutting apple pie. 
DADDY Is that Doctor still up there, Brother. 
BUDDY Yeah, he's still up there. 
DADDY What's taking the rascal so long? 
MOTHER Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University. 
DADDY I don't care where the polecat studied. 
MOTHER Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit. (shakes her head sadly as Buddy surreptitiously puts his napkin on table) Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do. 
BUDDY (a half audible murmur) Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom. 
MOTHER Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble -- (notices Buddy slipping out) Brother, you ought to hear this. 
BUDDY I'll be right back. 
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he slips out during following speech. 
MOTHER First, those clothes she wears. They're too provocative. I've talked to her a lot about it and I think she understands... 
INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT 
CUT TO a shot of Buddy as he goes down the hall, eyes narrowed. 
ON Buddy posted in the doorway of the living room. He has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and is staring sternly up the stairs. 
CUT TO A POV SHOT of Dr. Martinson with his black bag in hand and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs. The man is slinking, has quilt written all over him. As he goes down the stairs he glances to one side, sees Buddy and frowns. The man gives a sudden nervous start of fright as we hear Daddy's voice loud on the TRACK. 
DADDY (O.S.) Everything all right, Doctor? 
CUT TO A POV shot of Daddy at the rear of the downstairs hall, napkin in hand and hands on hips. He is staring sternly at the doctor. 
CUT BACK TO the Doctor. He glances nervously again toward Buddy. 
ANOTHER POV SHOT of Buddy. Looks just like Daddy, hands on hips. 
ON Dr. Martinson, as he looks back at Daddy. 
DR. MARTINSON Oh, yes. Yes. Just fine. A few more days... a little more rest... she'll be perfectly healthy. 
ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy as he walks forward down the hall toward Buddy. The CAMERA PICKS UP Buddy and both of them grimly stare after the fleeing doctor. 
DADDY (in a low, conspiratorial tone) What do you think, Brother? 
BUDDY I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again. 
DADDY He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son. (puts a hand on Buddy's shoulder) Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY 
A SHOT of Mother and Rose and the children in the kitchen. We see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. Rose has on a new and modest little dress that Mother evidently has made for her. 
MOTHER You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear. 
ROSE (less than enthusiastic) Yeah, it's kinda nice. 
MOTHER You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do. 
ROSE (smiles at Mother) Well, you're real sweet to make it for me. (puts an arm around Mother's shoulder) There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more. 
MOTHER Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation. 
ROSE (a little shrug) I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home. 
Rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there in panties and bra, oblivious of Buddy and the children. She has about as much modesty as a small child herself. 
ROSE (CONT'D) (rather sadly) Besides, there ain't no Mr. Right out there. Or if there is I can't find him, all I find is a pile of Mr. Wrongs. I ain't goin' out no more.

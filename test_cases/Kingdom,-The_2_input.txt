Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a gift for you. 
Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a marble... 
Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things. Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al- Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (in Arabic) Let me help you up, Old Man... 
The old man nods a `no.' 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (in Arabic) GIVE ME YOUR HANDS! 
Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al- Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his eyes, lifts his chin with his hand. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (dazed, starting to realize) ...Hamza. 
The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under arrest. 
ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi. 
NASSAR You are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your God. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I am no traitor to my God. You are. 
Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15 year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM. Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather with him. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   130. 
Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son... not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick: 
RONALD FLEURY ...Don't... 
The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims it at the boy's chest. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) ...drop it, Son...please... 
...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another round into the chamber. 
Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger. 
Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing, the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear. 
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in Haytham's eyes. 
A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room. 
Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding... 
Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi. 
Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) You got him. You got him... You got him.

KINGDOM 8/18/06   131. 
WIDE ON THE CRIME SCENE. 
From the air as choppers hover and SOLDIERS swarm. 
SMASH TO: 
142    INT. CONVOY - SAUDI ARABIA                                142 
One last convoy heading out of town. Fleury, Leavitt, Janet, and Sykes: battered war scars, million mile stares. 
143    EXT. PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE - LATER                        143 
Our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a C-130 touches down. 
Haytham enters: came to say good-bye. The team's first smiles -- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward, he shakes Janet's hand. 
HAYTHAM (in Arabic) Thank you. 
JANET MAYES Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham. 
Haytham says good bye to Leavitt and Sykes. Comes to Fleury. Hands him a beautiful wooden prayer bead necklace. 
HAYTHAM May peace be with you. 
FLEURY May peace be with all of us,   my friend. 
The two men shake hands.

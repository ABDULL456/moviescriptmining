He discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying. PUNK #1 (to Punk #2) Start the bike. Punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle.   Peter stops him. PETER But I'm telling you, I've got the real package in my pocket. PUNK #2 (to Punk #1) Watch it, the cops! Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the action. GRATON (to his partner) Terrific! I bet these morons screw up everything. One of the COPS gets out of his car and comes over to the Punks and Peter. Peter is scared stiff. PUNK #1 (whispering) If you called the cops on us, pal, you're a dead man. COP #1 All right, what's that doing on the back of the bike? No one answers. COP #1 You wouldn't by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle, would you? PUNK #1 Of course not, Officer. We'd never do something like that. 
COP #1 So why did you strap it on in the first place if you had no intention of driving with it? PUNK #2 So it wouldn't fall off. COP #1 Very funny. As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around the basket and takes it off the motorcycle. PETER No, really, Officer, they weren't gonna drive off with it -- They were just watching it for me while I was doing a quick errand. (to the Punks) Thanks, guys. Punk #1 gives him a dirty look. COP #1 All right, let's see some identification, everybody. The punks exchange a glance.   Suddenly Punk #1 shouts: PUNK #1 Go! They take off running in different directions. Cop #1 charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's still in the car: COP #1 Watch the guy with the basket! Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand. Peter stiffens with fear. COP #2 Freeze! All right, asshole, let's see some I.D. PETER (urbanely) Listen, Officer, let's stay calm now. I haven't the slightest intention of running. I am not a criminal. I'm an architect. COP #2 (calming down 
a little) Your I.D., let's see it. PETER I'm terribly sorry, Officer, but I don't have any identification on me. I just came down with my baby to run a quick errand. I haven't committed any crime. COP #2 All right, let's go, in the car. I'm taking you down to the station. PETER Oh, c'mon, that's impossible -- you see I have a baby. I have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes, I can't go anywhere. I live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and I'll get you my license immediately... You can even come with me if you like... COP #2 All right, lead the way. They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket. Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed. Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show- ing him his badge. GRATON (angry) Inspector Graton, Narcotics. It just so happens I was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns I lost them, probably forever. Thanks a lot! COP #1 How could we know? GRATON Forget it. Listen, your partner went in here with the guy and the baby. He lives up on the tenth floor. I can't go in because if he sees me, my cover is blown. So could you please try not to lose this one, okay? He's someone who's 
gotta be watched very closely. I've called for backup and it's on its way. 
60   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                      60 
The elevator doors open, Peter and Cop #2 exit. PETER (key in hand) This is it. Please come in... can I get you a cup of coffee or something? COP #2 No thanks.   I'll just wait out here. Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house, carrying the basket. As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael who was just coming to meet him. MICHAEL Hey, what's happening? What were those cops doing... Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them. Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe. PETER Michael... Michael... we're in deep trouble. The package... The package... MICHAEL Yeah?   What? PETER There's a cop on the doorstep... He didn't see you... He mustn't see you... We're in deep trouble, Michael... MICHAEL Tell me what... PETER The package  they came for wasn't the baby, it  was dope, drugs, a shitload of  dope! We were stopped by some cops  down on the street. 
MICHAEL But did the cops see the dope? PETER No, it's right here. 
He takes out the package. MICHAEL Shit! PETER We'll get twenty years if the cops find this on us! Climb down the fire escape and hide it... anywhere! Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when Peter stops him. PETER Hey, whatever you do,   don't lose the goddamn dope, we   gotta be able to return it to   those dealers or we're dead. Those    guys are serious. MICHAEL Don't worry. He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back. MICHAEL Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil for her bottle. Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal- let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. Peter holds his license out  for them to see. PETER Here's my license. COP #1 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment. The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now. They want to ask you a few questions. PETER Narcotics squad? What do they want with me? I don't even use aspirin! 
61   INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY                                     61 Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the supermarket, whistling.

FOX It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor. 
BLAKE And here's the important part. 
FOX As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation. 
BLAKE The bomb's a time bomb. 
FOX And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news. 
BLAKE Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought. Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox. 
CAPTAIN JONES Could you disarm it? 
FOX I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it. 
CAPTAIN JONES We'd have to let the Pentagon know. 
SPECIAL FORCES 2 They'll be monitoring our 
FREQUENCIES - 
CAPTAIN JONES We have no choice. Let's move away from this location, then call it in. 
INT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER 
Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose. Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator. 
INT. OFFICES ABOVE TELLSONS - CONTINUOUS 
Blake flies out of the elevator. 
BLAKE Fox, somebody sold us out! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor. 
FOX Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries jump out of the elevator, firing high. 
MERCERNARY 
DOWN ON THE FLOOR! Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground. 
INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS 
Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other Special Forces Men are down. Bane enters, midges Jones with his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones looks up at him, defiant. 
CAPTAIN JONES I'll die before I talk... 
BANE I'm on your schedule, Captain. 
Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth. 
MERCERNARY There were people living upstairs. 
Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead. 
BANE Give them over for judgement. (Indicates bodies.) Hang them where the world will see. 
INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY 
Wayne stares at the TV: the Special Forces bodies hang in the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the screen. 
INT. SAME - LATER 
Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue. 
PRISONER He says the leap to freedom is not about strength. 
WAYNE My body makes the jump. 
BLIND PRISONER 
(CRACKED ENGLISH) Survival is the spirit. The soul. 
WAYNE My soul's as ready to escape as my body. 
BLIND PRISONER Fear is why you fail. 
WAYNE I'm not afraid. I'm angry. 
Wayne throws punches...focused. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY 
Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts climbing, determined. He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock - it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head. A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up at Wayne, hanging upside down. 
SKINNY PRISONER Shouldn't you get him down? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful. 
PRISONER He'll keep. As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we - INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well, looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him. 
THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.) And why do we fall? 
INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT 
Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there. 
BLIND PRISONER 
(CRACKED ENGLISH) You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. This makes you weak. 
WAYNE Why? 
BLIND PRISONER How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner. 
WAYNE I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it. 
BLIND PRISONER Then make the climb. 
WAYNE How? 
BLIND PRISONER As the child did. Without the rope. (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find you again. Wayne considers this.

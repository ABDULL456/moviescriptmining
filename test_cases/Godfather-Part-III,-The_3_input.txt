CUT TO: t N T. CIA BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY As Tony, in civilian clothes, passes through the inner- checkpoint with his legitimate credentials. 
CUT TO: 
ZNT. MOREHOUSE'S OFFICE - DAY Morehouse and Palmateer are in the office. Their atti- tudes are. less than cordial as Tony enters. 
MOREHOUSE Come in Adams, sit down. I've called Stu in on this -- 
(GLANCES AT 
WATCH) Though I'm afraid I can't give you much time. I've got a brief- ing with the Z-orty Committee at noon. 
TONY what I have to say won't take long. 
(THEN) And I think we 111 all be happier if it's not on tape. Morehouse pauses a moment then openens a drawer and switches ofd his tape machine. 
MOREHOUSE Sow's your health? I understand you got a crack on the head? 
TONY I'm fine now. 
MOREBOUSE you were up at your father's place in Tahoe? T::at d s rig 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : 
MOREHOUSE Has he changed much? 
TONY Not as much as I' d. expected. 
MO 2 CUSZ I remember him very well -- from the Senate hearings on crime. Heat little man. Very polite, spoke in a soft, reasonable voice. He sat there with two million dollars worth of legal talent at his elbow and told the United States Government to go piss up a rope. 
(SMILES) You had to admire the pretentious little bastard. 
TONY We're wasting each other's time with this, Mister Morehouse. 
' M OREHOUSE All right, Son. This is your party. You've got five minutes. 
0 (THEN) But before we start, I'm not going to listen to a lot of recriminations about that cveration. Your people blew it, pure and sim le. It was totally mishandled. A mistake from beginning to end. 
TONY The big mistake was that I'm still alive. 
`SOREROUSE Come again? 
TONY 11 you'd managed to get rid of me down there - or in Vegas -- you' d be all right. silt it's too Late now. You've lost your chance. 
HOREZOUSE I don't know what the hell you're talking about. (C 0 di': I?It ) 
I 
CONTINU 
TONY If anything should happen to me -- anything at all -- you can find out. The full story will be all over the six o'clock news. 
MOREHCQSE I'd like to hear your conception of the full story.. 
TONY You were running a no-lose operation. if we succeeded, you were rid of Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone family was set up to take the blame. Your hands were clean. I was the only one who could dispute your story and I wasn't supposed to come back. I've found out that my res- ignation from the Navy was processed and accepted a full week before I went down here --- 
MOPEEOUSE Stu? 
PALMATE= Well, yes, Sir. His resignation did 
E go through, but it was a snafu -- a Yeoman's mistake, that's all. 
MOREHOUSE A clerical error. 
TONY And I don't buy it. 
MOREBOUSE don't give a shit if you buy it or not. And I'll tell you some- thing else, Mister Adams, or what- ever your fucking name is, I don't react favorably to blackmail. 
TONY It's not blackmail. It's a simple statement of fact. If anything happens to me or if the Corleone Family is damaged iz these Senate Hearings, then the whistle blows and the whole zdmin .st_ation aces. 
(CONTINUED) ? 
MOREHOUSE And what makes you think T. give a shit about what happens to the Admin- istration? Morehouse grins without humor. Tony's eyes flicker. Morehouse has told something that Tony needed to know. Morehouse is up and coming around the desk, as he continues. _ 
_14ORE8OVSE Whatever I did was done under dix- ect orders from the President of the United States, and I. will. so testify in open hearing. if that upsets some of you= guinea gumbarrs in Nevada, then so be it. The days are over when your father and his like could corrupt and intimidate this Nation.

KIRK Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently? 
SAAVIK It is still regulation, Admiral. 
She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops. 
SAAVIK (continuing) May I speak, sir? 
KIRK Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems. 
SAAVIK I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating. 
KIRK You earned it. 
SAAVIK I did not think so. 
KIRK You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru. 
SAAVIK I failed to resolve the situation. 
KIRK There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character. 
SAAVIK May I ask how you dealt with the test? 
KIRK (amused) You may ask, Lieutenant. 
She stares. 
KIRK (continuing) That was a little joke. 
SAAVIK Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical... 
KIRK We learn by doing, Lieutenant. 
She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the elevator starts. 
KIRK (continuing) You want my advice? 
She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle it. 
SAAVIK Yes. 
KIRK Take the test again. 
The lift stops and the doors open. 
BONES Who's been holding up the damn elevator? 
He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely. 
SAAVIK Thank you, sir. 
Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the ceiling. 
BONES Has she changed her hairstyle? 
Kirk says nothing. 
BONES (finally) Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale -- 
UHURA'S VOICE Admiral Kirk -- 
KIRK Kirk here. 
UHURA'S VOICE I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus. 
KIRK In my quarters, Uhura. 
UHURA'S VOICE Yes, sir. 
Awkward silence. 
BONES It never rains but when it pours -- 
KIRK As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds. 
The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close. 
BONES (annoyed with himself) Sorry. 
53   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                        53 
Featuring VIEW SCREEN: A scramble of interference and noise. A piece of Carol's VOICE breaks through now and again as we PULL BACK revealing a frustrated Kirk. 
KIRK Uhura. Can't you augment?

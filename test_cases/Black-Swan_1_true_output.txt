Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her. Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms through the sleeves. 
ERICA (CONT'D) (NOTICING SOMETHING) What's that? 
NINA What? 
ERICA There. 
Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small SCRATCH MARK. 
She shrugs and shakes her head. 
Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles. Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt. 
Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her head. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Sweet girl. 
Erica releases her and Nina begins eating. 
5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5 
Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at her faint reflection in the train's window. 
Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track, snapping her awake. 
In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music playing through iPod earphones. 
Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way. Mirroring her. 
Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl. Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point. 
The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face, but her view's obscured. 
The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she doesn't see the girl.

7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7 
Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street. 
She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags, wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts. 
She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE. 
Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to the STAGE DOOR. 
8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8 
Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5 SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters. 
Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors. 
In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip. 
VERONICA Can't believe she's back. 
GALINA Of course she is. 
VERONICA She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her anymore. 
SOLOIST 1 No one comes to see ballet period. 
VERONICA That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet. 
GALINA He needs to try something new. 
VERONICA No, someone new. 
SOLOIST 1 Like who? 
VERONICA Like someone who's not approaching menopause. 
They snicker. 
NINA I think it's sad. 
VERONICA What's sad? 
NINA Beth's such an amazing dancer. 
GALINA So's my grand-mother. 
NINA Fonteyn danced into her 50's... 
VERONICA (ROLLING EYES) Yeah, we know. 
Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to soften the toe.

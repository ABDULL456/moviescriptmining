DOC (pointing to the poster) It doesn't look like that. 
CAROL What do you mean? You've never been there. 
DOC I've been there every day for the last four years. 
She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her ironing. 
DOC (CONT'D) What's Beynon got set up? 
CAROL Small town, small bank, big money. 
She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him. 
DOC Where did you get those? 
CAROL I've been doing my homework. 
DOC Just like old times? 
CAROL Better than old times. 
DOC I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch. 
CAROL I made a mistake. I'll never make another one. 
DOC (after a moment) Where did you get them developed? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROL Assumed name... Houston. 
DOC Good. 
RAFTER A MOMENT) 
How much is the score? 
CAROL Half a million. 
DOC That Beynon's got a long arm. 
CAROL (after a moment) What do you want for dinner? 
DOC Whisky and a peach. 
She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles at her and begins sampling. 
CAROL (as Doc eats a peach with a sharp knife) How does it taste? 
DOC Just the way I remembered. 
Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently. 
DOC (CONT'D) You been okay? 
CAROL Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel. 
DOC How's Estelle? 
CAROL Fatter... some things never change. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Boring. 
CAROL Nothing's been boring since you found me. 
DOC (carefully) That's not all of it. 
CAROL No. It's been a long time. 
A pause. He continues stroking her arm. 
DOC You go out much? 
CAROL After four years and now the question comes up. 
DOC Couldn't handle it then. Now I can. 
CAROL (with warmth and a smile) I'm still here, Doc. 
He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward the stairs. 
INT. BEDROOM 
THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she stares vacantly expectant. 
Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping Doc drop the garment down to her waist.

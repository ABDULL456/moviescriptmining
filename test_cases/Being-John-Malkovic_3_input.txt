The waiter jots it down on his pad. 
WAITER MALKOVICH Malkovich. 
Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a '40's style big band of Malkoviches. 
SINGING MALKOVICH Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich... 
Malkovich flies through the back door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DITCH - DAY 
Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet. 
CRAIG So how was it? 
MALKOVICH That... was... no... simulation. 
CRAIG I know. I'm sorry... 
MALKOVICH I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see. 
CRAIG Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... 
MALKOVICH This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. 
CRAIG With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood. 
MALKOVICH It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court! 
Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike. 
CRAIG (calling after him) And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court? 
Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car. 
MOTORIST Hey, Malkovich! Think fast! 
Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car and hits him on the head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She looks haggard. 
LOTTE Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. 
CRAIG Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine. 
LOTTE You fell in love with her first. 
CRAIG Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage. 
LOTTE You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway. 
CRAIG (beat) That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. 
LOTTE Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before. 
CRAIG Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole. 
LOTTE I need a shower. 
CRAIG I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster." 
LOTTE You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man. 
CRAIG I love you so much. 
She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear. 
CRAIG (CONT'D) But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny. 
MAXINE (O.S.) J.M. Inc. Be all that someone... 
LOTTE We have to meet.

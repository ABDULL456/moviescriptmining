PINO I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals. 
VITO Some are OK. 
PINO My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies. 
SAL Do your friends put money in your pocket?  Pay your rent?  Food on ya plate? 
Pino is quiet. 
SAL I didn't think so. 
PINO Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst. 
SAL So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.

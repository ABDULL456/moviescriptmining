JEFF I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just play. 
CABLE GUY Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up. 
The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes. 
CABLE GUY Let's get it on! 
STEVEN Are you any good? 
CABLE GUY Feed me under the boards and you'll find out. 
Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands. 
CABLE GUY (doing the traveling hand signal) Traveling! That's traveling! 
RICK Yeah, whatever you say Chip. 
Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him. 
CABLE GUY All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it. 
Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court. 
CABLE GUY Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm open! 
Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process. The ball goes in. 
CABLE GUY (does the foul hand signal) And one! That's definitely a foul! (to Jeff) You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants. 
STEVEN (to Cable Guy) What are you doing? 
CABLE GUY Don't play from fear Steven. We can take these guys. 
MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V. 
a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down. b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick. c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick. d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard. 
CABLE GUY Take it to the hole! 
Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in. 
CABLE GUY Hey, are you okay? 
He pulls Steven up. 
STEVEN Yeah. I'm fine. 
CABLE GUY Let's switch. I'll cover Rick. 
The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare. 
Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball. 
RICK (enraged) What the hell was that? That's it. I've had enough. 
Everyone begins to exit the court. 
JEFF Thanks for bringing your "friend". 
The Cable Guy runs up to Rick. 
CABLE GUY Good game. (slaps Rick on the butt) You were tough out there. Your play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that. 
RICK (dismissive) Yeah. 
He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players. 
STEVEN What are you doing? 
CABLE GUY It was payback time. I was protecting you. 
(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) 
STEVEN You ruined the game. 
CABLE GUY I don't appreciate your tone Steven. That's not the way friends speak to each other. 
STEVEN What are you talking about? I don't even know you!

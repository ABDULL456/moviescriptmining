GELLER I don't know! I don't know! The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet. She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away from it. 
CASHIER Leave that rotting piece of meat here. It's done its job. Let it die. 
GELLER But my game! My game's inside it. I don't want my game to die. The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect- board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him, speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else out. 
PIKUL Allegra, listen to me. I think we're still inside the game. I think your real pod's out there somewhere, somewhere safe. I think it's OK to let go of this one, this pod. It's not the real one. A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump. 
CASHIER Everybody out! now! The three of them scramble out into the fiery night. 
EXT. CALEDON SKI-CLUB COMPOUND - NIGHT 
The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins to implode as they scurry by it. As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire. There are people trying to fight the fires, running r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is impossible to tell. 
EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT 
The cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill. 
CASHIER Up here. We can see everything from here. 
PIKUL What is it that we're seeing? 
CASHIER 
(GLEEFUL) The victory of Realism. And you were part of it. 
GELLER 
(DESOLATE) The death of eXistenZ. And we were part of it. The cashier turns on her with his gun. He snaps out his old clip and slams home a new one. He cocks the gun. 
CASHIER There's just one more thing. 
PIKUL 
(HORRIFIED) What are you doing? We're on your side. 
CASHIER 
(FIERCE) How could you be? How could Allegra Geller, the world's premiere game designer, be on our side? (off their bewildered 
LOOKS) Oh, Y93.' We know who you are. You can't hide inside a game forever. 
PIKUL Something's slipped over the edge, here, Allegra. Something's all wrong. 
CASHIER 
(SMILES) There. You see what I mean. You see the problem. 
The cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller, but before he can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching to the ground. From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese restaurant. 
VINOKUR I tried to find you. Thank God I got here in time. (pause; waggles the gun) My dog brought me this.

INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT 
Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not unlike a cemetery. All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way... 
Outside, the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en route to real work. Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come out to play. He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair, watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV 
NEWS (re: Hancock) .the trains seemed imminently bound for a catastrophic collision when this... this superguy... 
ROHEIM 
(IMPRESSED) Man. I bet he gets laid. Horus - he looks terrible. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the community, the Longfellow's apartment building... and Mary's bedroom. From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She disrobes down to bare back... And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back towards his face intense.

EXT. SOMEWHERE - NIGHT - DREAM SEQUENCE 
A foreign TERRAIN of trees, of lakes so clear and blue. They pass below us as we soar through air and mist... the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery... but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to song. SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke, women and children in hysterics... 
we quicken to a frantic pace, slicing through the growth. Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path, splitting trees and earth... . we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering continues... until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris settle... and we see the remains of a lake, a,lake full of BLOOD... of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam... WOMEN and 
CHILDREN... DEAD... . we SCREAM! 
INT. RED EYE MOTEL - NIGHT 
Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified, eyes cracked with red veins. He is soaked. The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the adjacent motel room -.the wall behind Hancock's bed trembles to the rhythm of each pelvic thrust... He clasps.-his ears - tormented.

INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM -DAY 
Roheim in his usual state of sleep. His lips mutter dialogue from an unseen dream. 
ROHEIM Olga... He snaps out of it... 
ROHEIM (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUING) .bitch. Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the area around him. He spots Horus - slumped in a chair, in a thinking posture. Horns seems lost in his own blank stare. 
HORUS (without looking) Another dream?' 
ROHEIM I was talking again, huh? 
No response. 
EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY 
A deserted street at this early hour. On the curb and by themselves - Horus and Roheim, ruminating. 
ROHEIM . that look on her face, you know the look, when she's almost there... makes you feel like a man. 
(BEAT) Then everything gets blurry and all of a sudden, it's not my arm that's around her and it's not my hand that's touching her and it's not even me, my body. Some guy, this good-looking guy... he looks like the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And so... the Marlboro Man's running his fingers through her hair. And he's... banging her... and her knees... by her ears, you know? (beat; cringing) And that look on her face. That look. 
HORUS Roheim. 
ROHEIM 
(CONTINUING) Bitch. 
HORUS Come on. 
ROHEIM (gets up) Walk with me.

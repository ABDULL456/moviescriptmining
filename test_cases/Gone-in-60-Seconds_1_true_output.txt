Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ... 
MEMPHIS Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him... 
CALITRI I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ... 
Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet.. 
CALITRI (cont'd) It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to Russia. Think Kip'll be interested? 
MEMPHIS You don't want to even sniff at that -- 
Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she is smashed-to-shit. 
CALITRI Well, that certainly won't do. 
MEMPHIS What do you mean -- ? 
CALITRI Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ... 
MEMPHIS You got no choice. It's over. 
CALITRI Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ... 
Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ... 
CALITRI (cont'd) What are you doing -- ? 
MEMPHIS Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not gonna let you get into my Kool Aid... 
And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw drowning out the sounds of combat ... 
Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye 
ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ... 
Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ... 
He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into the floor ... 
Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ... And Atley is there ... 
ATLEY JACKSON Jesus, man ... What'd you do? 
MEMPHIS My version of "take this job and shove it..." 
ATLEY JACKSON Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life? 
But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious Calitri ... 
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Now you done it. And with you gone - who'll save Kip the next time ... ? 
MEMPHIS This is all about there not being a next time, Atley -- 
And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the dead weight ... Dragging the don over to 
THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and Butz are there - 
ATLEY JACKSON Hello, boys -- ! 
DIGGER Hey! What happened? Did they make it 
ATLEY JACKSON They did not. A tragedy. 
DIGGER Mr. C. around? 
ATLEY JACKSON He's napping. He said to take it away... 
Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the van... 
DIGGER That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by. 
MEMPHIS Absolutely. 
And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis 
ATLEY JACKSON Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right? 
MEMPHIS Point-five ... 
And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ... 
ATLEY JACKSON Get outta here, Memphis -- 
And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley... 
MEMPHIS Thank you... 
Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley watches him go ... 
ATLEY JACKSON Hoo-boy. 
EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK 
Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's "Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on the back window. It's being driven by Kip... 
MEMPHIS What are you doing here? 
KIP I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ... 
MEMPHIS Where'd you find this one? 
KIP Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --

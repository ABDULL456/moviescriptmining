DUKE OF CORNWALL My Lord King Uther, let us feast together. To my castle. Lord Merlin, you must join - 
But Merlin is nowhere in sight. 
INT. TINTAGEL CASTLE - HALL - NIGHT 
Drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty rhythm. Armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing. She is very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent. 
Uther sits at the long table beside the Duke of Cornwall with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights. The table is stained with wine and littered with bones and half-eaten fruit. 
Uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer. 
DUKE OF CORNWALL I would wish you such a wife, Lord Uther, as my Igrayne. So innocent, but in bed, a furnace... 
The Duke rises and goes to his wife, be-striding the center of the hall and Igrayne weaves circles of dance around him. He gloats with pride. 
The words escape his lips: 
UTHER I must have her. 
Lot spins to face him. 
LOT What? You're mad! What about the alliance? 
UTHER (oblivious) I must have her. 
LOT And risk all you've won? This castle commands the sea gate to the kingdom. 
Uther is not one for politics, and Lot's words sail past him. The King lusts for Igrayne. 
A bell is struck not far away. The music ceases and the hall falls silent. The great door creaks open, revealing the dawn light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it. Muffled by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the Te Deum. Those who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, helped up. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN 
The monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle. Thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in the thick walls onto stone floors. Otherwise, it is dark. Each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, some crossing themselves. 
Uther is among them. He stops in a dark alcove, breathing heavily, waiting. 
As the lovely Igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of sight of the others. 
In a shaft of pale light Uther clasps Igrayne to his breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body. So violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an impaled butterfly. 
UTHER You will be mine. Wife and queen, bed and crown. 
His face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour her tender whiteness with his kiss. She doesn't answer; she can't. Even Uther understands this and lets her go. 
IGRAYNE (a fierce whisper) I want no other crown and no other bed than those I have. 
Her gown and her fragile skin torn on the spikes of his armor, Igrayne backs away and joins the procession. 
Uther trembles with unreleased passion. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN 
Igrayne enters the candlelit chapel from which issues the chant, calling the castle to worship. She rushes to her husband's side, kneeling next to him and whispering. The Duke of Cornwall looks back at Uther, hatred in his eyes. 
EXT. WAR CAMP - BEFORE TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAY 
Uther is in a towering rage. Sword drawn, he stalks among the biers of fallen knights. Squires and clerics keep a healthy distance. The sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling thunder. Beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out of the sea stands the impregnable Tintagel Castle, seat of the Duke of Cornwall, now under siege. 
UTHER (bellowing in all directions) Merlin! Where are you!? 
Just then a knight rides up and dismounts. It is Ulfius, a lieutenant. 
UTHER Have you found him? 
ULFIUS No-- 
But he cannot finish. He is taken aback by the sudden appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a beggar's pan. 
HAG What a hurry you were in this morning, good sir. You forgot to give this old woman a coin. 
ULFIUS I saw you half a day's gallop from here. I asked you if you had seen Merlin. I returned here straight away. How did -

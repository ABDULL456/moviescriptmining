MUMFORD (V.O.) ...And being a Collection Agent was definitely not in my genetic make- up... 
His POV STOPS, letting the Collection Agents go, on another fellow, with the disreputable, cocksure demeanor of a private dick, who is lolling near the water cooler, watching the altercation with amusement. He is GREGORY, an IRS INVESTIGATOR. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator. 
SKIP (V.O.) Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was -- 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
BACK TO PRESENT. Skip is leaning intensely toward Mumford. 
SKIP -- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service? 
MUMFORD Everybody has a story, Skip. 
SKIP Sounds like you have several. 
MUMFORD What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy... (Yul Brynner accent) ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs. 
SKIP An IRS investigator with a drug problem? 
MUMFORD It wasn't the best situation. 
SKIP Did you carry a gun? 
MUMFORD Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS. 
EXT. ALLEY, REAR OF DRY CLEANING FACILITY - MAGIC 
MOVING POV as Mumford follows GREGORY down the gloomy alley to a corner where they can spy at the scene beyond. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I got teamed with one of the top guys, a fanatic named Gregory. He always got his man, whether they deserved it or not. He was a "closer" and everybody admired that... 
WHAT THEY SEE: The DRY CLEANING BOSS, a Middle-Eastern fellow, is standing at the back door of his place paying his Asian employees in cash as they leave. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) He'd make the case and the Collection guys would come in and clean up. Our specialty was... sleazy skulking... 
Gregory turns to look at camera (Mumford) with a devilish grin. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) We were a good team. I was a dope addict and Gregory was insane. 
INT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT 
MUMFORD'S POV as he supports a drunken Gregory as they stagger down the sidewalk to a row house. Holding Gregory up on the other side, is CANDY, Gregory's pretty wife. They wrangle Gregory up the front steps. Gregory stumbles inside and Mumford retreats down the steps, his eyes still on the front door. Candy appears there and stares down at Mumford, who stops where he is. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife. 
SKIP (V.O.) Holy shit! 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mumford settles back in his chair as Skip shakes his head, astounded. 
MUMFORD (announcer-like) "Get to know your therapist." 
SKIP You were messed up, man. 
MUMFORD (dry) But look at me now... 
SKIP Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career -- 
Skip stops, remembers the truth, realizes. Mumford smiles. 
SKIP At least you pulled yourself out... 
MUMFORD Things got a lot worse. 
SKIP You and Candy...? 
INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY 
MUMFORD'S POV from his bed. Candy finishes dressing across the room. She looks at camera, her face full of the pain of leaving. 
EXT. FIRESCAPE/ROOF, BUILDING IN CITY - DAY 
MOVING POV as Mumford follows Gregory up the ladder and onto the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial neighborhood.

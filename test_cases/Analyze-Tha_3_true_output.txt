faking.   Nobody sounds like that. BEN (suggestively) That's not entirely true. LAURA Okay, sometimes you do sound like that. The O.S. MOANING kicks up another notch. Laura rolls over and jams her pillow over her ears. Ben growls, exasperated. 
CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - SAME TIME Michael's girlfriend is gone. He has his bedroom door open a crack and he's standing there holding a small tape recorder and smiling broadly. WOMAN (O.S.) (high-pitched now) Ah, ah, ah, ah...! CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME Agents Cerrone and Miller sit in a sedan with a small, sophisticated-looking microphone trained on the Sobel house just down the street. They hear the high-pitched MOANING. Miller gives Cerrone a look. CERRONE Oh, come on.    Nobody sounds like that. CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Ben takes a deep breath and knocks sharply on the guest room door. The heavy MOANING STOPS. After a moment, Vitti appears wearing only a bathrobe. Ben can see the beautiful SHEILA sitting naked on the bed. VITTI What? BEN (indignant) I have a 17-year-old son. VITTI So let him get his own fuckin' girl. 
BEN Can I talk to you, please? VITTI Actually, I'm right in the middle of someone. Sheila starts to light a cigarette. BEN Miss? Excuse me.     There's no smoking in this house. 
CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - SAME TIME Michael freezes, about to light a cigarette himself. CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER Ben comes down the stairs with Vitti. BEN What do you think you're doing? 
VITTI Minding my own fuckin' business, like you should be doin'. BEN Well, it's a little hard with the live sex show going on in the guest room. VITTI I've been in prison for two and a half years. What am I supposed to do? BEN Go to a hotel. VITTI That's what I wanted to do, but you told me I had no choice -- it was either here or Sing Sing. BEN I'm not trying to punish you. These aren't my rules, but I have a responsibility here. Besides, I thought you might like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long. 
VITTI Yeah, that's what I've been jerkin' off about for eight hundred consecutive nights -- a nice home- cooked meal. (making a jerking motion) Ohhhh, tuna casserole. BEN That girl is not staying here.

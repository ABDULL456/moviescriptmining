{"train": "KILLING ZOE \nWritten by \nRoger Avary \nFADE IN: \nINT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY \nRain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport. \nAside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song \"Batonga\". \nThen, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside. \nHe settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat. \nZED Hotel Mondial. \nCAB DRIVER Le Mondial.  Tres bien. \nHe starts driving. \nCAB DRIVER Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause du 14 Juillet. \nHe drives for a while. \nCAB DRIVER [Do you mind the radio?] \nZed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du Bois. \nCAB DRIVER [Do you want me to turn the radio off?] \nZED (realizing he's being asked a question) I don't speak French. \nThe driver turns around. \nCAB DRIVER (in broken English) Ah.  American? \nZED That's right. \nCAB DRIVER That's good because I speak a little English. \nZed nods. \nCAB DRIVER I asked if you mind the radio.  Music. You know. \nZed shakes his head \"no\". \nCAB DRIVER (with a smile) Super cool. \nZed adjusts his watch. \nZED What time is it? \nCAB DRIVER Time, time, time.  I don't know. Daytime. \nZed forgets the adjustment for now. \nCAB DRIVER Are you in town for business? \nZED Yes. \nCAB DRIVER It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big rooms. \nHe looks at Zed in the rear view mirror. \nCAB DRIVER Do you know Paris? \nZED I've been here once before.  When I was younger. \nThe cab driver smiles. \nCAB DRIVER Those were the days. \nThey drive for a while. \nCAB DRIVER Married? \nZED I beg your pardon? \nHe is asleep. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY \nZed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in. Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside of it is a black steel briefcase. \nThe shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it. \nOn the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M. Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY \nZed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his face and cascade down his body. \nHe opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits some out with a spurt. \nThen he stops, attentive, listening for something. \nHe turns the shower off. \nThen he hears it again, the knocking on the door. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY \nZed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his way toward the knocking. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nZed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped around his waist.  He opens it. \nIn the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with. \nZOEY Bonjour. \nZED (a little awkwardly) Bonjour. \nZed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city. \nZOEY Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel. \nShe turns to him, but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room. \nZOEY Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra porter un-- \nZED I...don't speak French. \nShe blows a bubble. \nZOEY It's okay. \nShe takes a seat on the bed. \nZOEY It will be one thousand francs for all night.  In advance. \nZed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her. \nZOEY We can do it now if you want. \nZED Well, let me just dry up. \nZOEY Okay, but it's not necessary. \nHe goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself. \nShe puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, \"Nosferatu\".  She smiles and sits back to watch. \nZED(O.S.) (from the bathroom) What's your name? \nZOEY Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like. \nZED(O.S.) My name's Zed. \nZOEY (smiling at this) That's funny.  We both have Z names. \nZed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His pants are on. \nZED What was that? \nShe notices his pants. \nZOEY And you make me feel safe.  That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm. \nZED I never really thought of it like that. \nZOEY Well, it's true. \nZed nods at this. \nZOEY Turn off the television. \nZed reaches over and turns it off from the console. \nZOEY So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much. \nZED Well, I like you too Zoe. \nZOEY Honest? \nHe nods. \nZOEY Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can orgasm.  Even with his own hand. \nZed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer. \nZED Well, I like your honesty.  You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with. \nShe doesn't like the sound of this.  She slaps him. \nZOEY I am not a prostitute! \nZed is a little surprised at this. \nZED Really?  Can I have my francs back then? \nZOEY I'm a student.  And to pay for the classes I became an escort.  It's my choice to sleep with you. \nZED I see. \nZOEY What?  You don't understand. \nZED No, I do. \nZOEY Hey, it's not easy. \nZED I didn't say it was. \nZOEY I'm here because I want to. \nZED Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go to? \nZOEY The Centre du Art, Paris. \nZED That's really interesting.  What kind of art do you study? \nZOEY Not any of the old shit. \nZED Oh. \nZOEY I have a day job too.  Three times a week. \nShe rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to Zed. \nZOEY But someday there will be only my art. \nZED What kind of things do you paint? \nZOEY I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects. Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with no narrative.  I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world.  Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny.  Those are left for me.  They belong only to me.  If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I would destroy it.  I don't care how much cash they would offer me.  It would be shit.  I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed.  They told too much about me.  And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself.  The way I'm telling you. \nShe looks back at him. \nZOEY What I do I do only for the objects. \nZED I'd like to see one of these. \nZOEY What?  So you could see the work of a whore? \nHe decides to put a stop to this once and for all. \nZED Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.  I didn't understand the difference. \nZOEY The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm. \nShe shrieks. \nZOEY [Let go of me you shit!!] \nHe drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nZed can't believe this. \nZED Eric. \nERIC (to Zed) Don't worry about her. (to Zoey in French) [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick!] \nShe bites his hand.  He yells in pain. \nERIC God damn it! \nHe kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door. \nERIC [Get the fuck out of here you fucking whore!] \nHe opens the door and throws her into the hall. \nINT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT \nNaked, Zoey falls into the hall. \nEric slams the door shut. \nShe is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds on the door. \nZOEY [Give me my clothes you asshole!] \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nShe is pounding on the door. \nERIC (looking at his hand wound) God damn it.  Look at my hand. \nZED (shocked at the whole incident) Jesus Eric. \nZOEY(O.S.) Ouvres!  Je veux mes habits! \nEric listens. \nERIC Oh shit.  Her clothes. \nHe picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at him. \nZOEY (almost too quick to understand) Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!? \nERIC La ferme! \nHe slams the door shut. \nThen he turns to Zed. \nERIC So tell me, what have you been up to? \nZed sits down on the bed. \nZOEY(O.S.) Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux! \nZED Eric, I liked that girl. \nERIC Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me. \nZED Because you were on a rampage. \nERIC Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores.  A girl like that will give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs? \nZED Because when you need to get off you don't want to have to date for months to do it. \nERIC Just use your hand like me. \nZED Sometimes you just need honesty...and security. \nERIC I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys. \nZED Okay, let me take a shower. \nERIC They all know who you are. (to the rest of them) Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres. \nOliver stands up and walks to the kitchen. \nOLIVER (with an English accent) Zed, would you like a beer? \nZED Thanks. \nOLIVER Don't think of it. \nCLAUDE (to Zed) Come.  Sit down. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter. \nOliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nZed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude. \nSuddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes. \nEric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles. \nCLAUDE (to Zed) Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to claim you. \nZed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder. \nCLAUDE Let me introduce you properly.  This is Enrique. \nThe monkey screeches. \nCLAUDE He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like...do we? \nAgain, the hideous creature screeches. \nCLAUDE (to Enrique) Tais-toi! (then to Zed) Do you like hash? \nThen Eric interrupts. \nERIC (jokingly) Don't sit next to that junkie. \nCLAUDE Ahhhhhh! \nClaude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks.  They laugh. \nERIC (to Claude) That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time he's out the door. (to Zed) Zed, come here. \nZed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer. \nOLIVER Here you go mate. \nZED Thanks. \nOliver sits down next to Claude. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed. \nERIC Don't ask me where we got this. \nZED Okay. \nERIC On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed. \nHe places his hand on the blueprint. \nERIC But this one.  BIP.  The Banque Internationale de Paris.  And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes? \nZed smiles. \nERIC We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this. \nEric pulls out a complex electronic schematic. \nERIC As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. (he hands it to Zed) The concierge, at this desk. (he points it out on the blueprint) We will take care of him.  Then we can close the bank.  No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed. \nZED (turning the schematic around) Are you sure he won't push the alarm? \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nEXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin. \nThe heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver. \nOLIVER (so high he's wobbling) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain. \nNo one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil. \nOLIVER (continuing) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He drifts between the two.  Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes. \nERIC [Cotton.] \nRicardo hands him a cotton ball. \nOLIVER (continuing) It's really quite brilliant you know. That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show. \nEric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture. \nERIC (to Oliver) [Here, shut up and hold this.] \nHe hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe. \nThen, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it. \nERIC [Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins.] \nThey all laugh at this. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture. \nJEAN Do you want heroin? \nZED No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow. \nJean and Claude laugh at this. \nJEAN No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right. \nJean snorts a line. \nClaude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head \"no\". \nCLAUDE Okay. \nJEAN (recovering from the snort) That's good. \nEric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing. \nEric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed.  Francois sits on the floor. \nEric rolls up his sleeve. \nERIC (to Ricardo in French) [Hold my arm.] (then to Zed) My vein is like a rock. \nRicardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in. \nHe withdraws the needle. \nRicardo lets go of his arm. \nEric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep. \nThen Jean takes another snort. \nPretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer. \nThen Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it. \nJEAN (to Zed) Try some.  It's called chasing the dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it for centuries. \nZED I don't think so. \nJEAN Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper. \nThey stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke. \nSuddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we... \nZed can't believe this.  He's not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard. \nZED Really? \nThen Eric sees something. \nERIC Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe. \nThey take a sharp turn. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CELLAR - NIGHT \nEric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar. Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing. \nAn old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club. Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics. \nON STAGE \na BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music. \nAT THE BUFFET \nIn the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and JOSEPHINE. \nEric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle and Josephine. \nEric hands them some money. \nZED'S TABLE \nEveryone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club. Oliver sits next to Zed. \nOLIVER So, how long have you known Eric? \nZED Well, Eric's mother is American. \nOLIVER Yeah, and his dad's French. \nZED They're divorced.  And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up.  So every six months he would come back to the states.  We were best friends.  Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It's been...years. \nOLIVER Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films. \nZED Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I was young. \nOLIVER Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius. \nHe starts laughing. \nOLIVER How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it? \nZed watches the players on stage and then nods. \nZED Yeah...I guess. \nOLIVER I love it.  It's really good, you know? Like real music.  It has a heart and culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence. \nZED Yeah. \nOLIVER Hungry cannibals'd like it. \nThen Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine. \nCLAUDE Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good. \nHe pours Zed a glass. \nOliver passes on the wine. \nOLIVER (to Claude) Non merci, c'est de la merde. \nCLAUDE (to Oliver) La ferme.  C'est du bon vin. (to Zed) The fucking English. \nZed sips some.  He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not. \nON STAGE \nSuddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music. \nThe band stands up. \nEric gives it a kick.  No response. \nERIC I guess it is dead. \nThey walk into the flat. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor. Hung up on the wall is a huge, French \"Dressed To Kill\" poster. \nSome Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing. \nSitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, RICARDO, and JEAN. \nSitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE and OLIVER. \nThey all turn as Zed and Eric walk in. \nERIC Hello. \nThey all return the greeting. \nERIC (to Zed) Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude.  Got it? \nZED I will. \nERIC They all know who you are. (to the rest of them) Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres. \nOliver stands up and walks to the kitchen. \nOLIVER (with an English accent) Zed, would you like a beer? \nZED Thanks. \nOLIVER Don't think of it. \nCLAUDE (to Zed) Come.  Sit down. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter. \nOliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nZed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude. \nSuddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes. \nEric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles. \nCLAUDE (to Zed) Easy.

(to Zed) Zed, come here. \nZed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer. \nOLIVER Here you go mate. \nZED Thanks. \nEric takes a big hit. \nERIC Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves.  Do you see? \nNo, Zed doesn't see. \nSuddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows. \nOLIVER (out the window) Fucking fags! \nERIC (also out the window) Suce ma bite?! \nRICARDO Perverts d'homosexuels! \nEric laughs. \nERIC (into Zed's ear) This is good to have you here.  We could not do this without you. \nZed nods. \nERIC Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.  That's good. \nZed nods, delirious. \nERIC You know I have AIDS.  From the needle. \nZed can't believe this.  He's not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard. \nZED Really? \nThen Eric sees something. \nERIC Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe. \nThey take a sharp turn. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

That's fucking genius. \nHe starts laughing. \nOLIVER How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it? \nZed watches the players on stage and then nods. \nZED Yeah...I guess. \nAt the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager. \nEric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck. \nERIC (to the guard) [Drop the gun!] \nHe doesn't. \nERIC [Drop your gun now and nobody dies!] \nAfter a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the floor. \nERIC [Good boy.] \nThey descend down the stairs into the sub lobby. \nOliver takes his gun. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nFrancois, Ricardo, and Jean have finished herding everyone behind the teller windows.  Claude is on his way downstairs. \nCLAUDE [I'm going to check things out downstairs.] \nRICARDO (to the people) [Now!  On the ground!  Face down!] \nThen, for effect, he kicks a man. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY \nClaude comes downstairs with his gun raised. \nCLAUDE [All clear down here?] \nEveryone turns. \nERIC [Take these two upstairs.  And chain the gate to the sub lobby shut.] \nOliver pushes the sub lobby guard #2 and the sub lobby assistant toward Claude.  Then he hands him a chain. \nClaude can barely maintain his enthusiasm. \nCLAUDE [The phones and video are down!  We're locked up tight!] (then in English) We fucking did it! \nHe takes the two upstairs. \nEric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager. \nERIC [Any others I should worry about?] \nBANK MANAGER [No.] \nERIC (to Oliver) [Well, just to be sure--] \nThen, from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard. All eyes turn to it. \nOliver walks up to it and kicks the door in.  The stodgy customer is kneeling in it.  He instantly holds his hands high. \nOLIVER [Freeze motherfucker!] \nEric walks up, gun in hand. \nERIC [Who the fuck are you?] \nSTODGY CUSTOMER [Please don't shoot me!] \nOLIVER [On the ground!] \nHe does. \nERIC (to the bank manager) [Making a deposit I hope.] (he smiles to Oliver) [Bring him with us.] \nThey all make their way down through the sub lobby hall. \nINT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY \nThey're herding the men through the hall. \nEric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and fires two shots into the bank manager's face. \nThe bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the floor. \nERIC Fucking idiot. (then to the stodgy customer) [You seem like a nice man.  Tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family.] \nHe starts nodding his head. \nSTODGY CUSTOMER Oui. \nERIC (to Oliver) [Take him upstairs.] \nOliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people. \nEric rips off his mask. \nERIC Don't you ever conflict with me during work again!  Do you hear!? \nZed off his clown mask. \nZED You didn't have to shoot any of them! \nERIC (patronizing) Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were in charge now.  Nobody told me. (his temper flares) If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour. \nHe charges into the reserve vault area. \nINT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY \nThey enter and Eric walks up to a bathroom door. \nZED Eric.  It's just that we've gone from being thieves to murderers. \nERIC Oh fuck it doesn't matter!  Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank. \nZED I thought the death penalty was abolished in 1980? \nERIC Ohhhh!  That's what they tell you!  But who cares?  I need to take a piss. \nEric enters the bathroom. \nERIC (on his way into the bathroom) Why don't you open the vault? \nZed looks at the bathroom door close.  After a fuming pause he turns and walks back toward the Poseidon vault door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nFrancois peeks through the venetian blinds of the windows to the outside. \nFRANCOIS [Looks clear.] \nIn the meantime, behind the teller windows guarding the people who are laying on the floor, Jean and Ricardo are in the middle of a conversation.  Oliver is sitting on the counter, having just brought the stodgy customer upstairs. Also here now are the sub lobby assistant and the sub lobby guard #2. \nJEAN [What do you mean you're not sure if the alarm went off or not?] \nRICARDO [I mean I'm not sure.] \nJEAN [Well, either it did or it didn't.] \nRICARDO [And I'm not sure.] \nJEAN [Well, do you think it did?] \nRICARDO [I just fucking told you, I don't know.] \nJEAN [Take a guess.] \nRICARDO [It didn't.] \nJEAN [You're sure?] \nRICARDO [No.  It's just a guess.] \nJEAN [Well what kind of a fucking guess is that?  You're saying it could have.] \nRICARDO [Yes.] \nJEAN [Well that's fucking great.  Why didn't you just kill that asshole to begin with. I knew I should have been the one to kill him.  You're always so damn slow.] \nRICARDO [Shit these masks are really hot.] \nRICARDO [\"Okay, okay,\" gasped the proprietor, \"I'll see what I can do.\"  So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. \"She's yours for fifty francs,\" said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.] \nZoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it.  His fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it. \nHer eyes widen. \nRICARDO [After a little while, he came across a piece of egg.  \"That's funny,\" he thought to himself, \"I don't think I had egg for breakfast.\"  But he spat it out and kept eating away.  Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth.  \"I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week,\" he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn.  \"What is this?\" he said, \"I think I'm going to be sick.\"] \nThe concierge security guard unsnaps the safety.  Zoey knows he's going to make his move. \nRICARDO [\"Ya know,\" says the whore, \"that's what the last guy said.\"] \nBefore they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the .38 and fires three shots. \nTwo of them hit Ricardo in the chest.  He falls to the ground. \nThe other hits Francois in the arm. \nIn an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group of people huddled on the floor. \nEveryone is screaming and trying to get away. \nMachine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard killing him dead. \nUnfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, killing them all. \nPeople are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the ceiling. \nCLAUDE [No one fucking moves!] \nJean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people. \nJEAN [Shit!  What happened!?] \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY \nZed looks up hearing the commotion. \nEric comes running out of the bathroom and into the storage/elevator area. \nERIC What is it?  What's going on? \nZed gets up to go upstairs. \nZED I don't know. \nERIC No!  You stay here. \nEric runs upstairs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nFrancois is on the ground holding his arm.  He keeps rolling back and forth in pain. \nRicardo is dead. \nJean, Claude, and Oliver are waving their guns around ready to kill someone any second. \nJEAN [Nobody fucking moves!  Nobody fucking moves!] \nClaude motions to the dead security guard. \nCLAUDE [The gun!  Somebody get it!] \nOliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time waving his gun at people. \nOLIVER [Don't fuck with me!  Don't fuck with me!] \nHe grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip. \nEric storms in.  He isn't wearing his mask. \nERIC [What the fuck is going on!?] \nZoey notices Eric, she remembers him. \nOLIVER (pointing at the dead man) [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!] \nWOMAN TELLER (answering phone through tears) Banque Internationale de Paris. \nShe pauses, then hands the phone to Eric. \nWOMAN TELLER [It's for you.] \nEric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor. \nHe puts the receiver to his ear. \nERIC (into phone) [Hello.] (pause) [Who is this?] \nEric motions to Oliver to check the windows. \nOliver runs over and peeks out the blinds. \nOLIVER Oh my God!  The police! \nERIC (into phone) [What do you want?] \nEric looks around at the dead bodies. \nERIC (into phone) [We're all fine in here.] \nOliver is pacing back and forth wildly.  He starts loading extra ammo into his weapon. \nERIC (into phone) [No.  I'll tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig.  You send anyone near this building and I'll kill the first person I lay my hands on.  I've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in.] (pause) [Just stay put.  We'll call you when we're ready.  In the mean time, have a nice day.] \nEric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook. \nCLAUDE [The silent alarm must have gone off after all!] \nERIC [Shut the fuck up!  The alarm didn't do shit.  For all we know your idiot shooting brought them here.  Anyhow it doesn't matter.  Nothing has changed.] \nJEAN [My God!  The police!  What are we going to do?] \nERIC [Nothing.  We don't have to do anything. The plan stays the same, just slightly different.] \nThen Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock.  Eric smiles and winks.  Then he turns to Jean with a whisper. \nERIC [If the police decide to come in...kill them.  And if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else.  This place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale.] \nThen he takes off downstairs, smiling.  Jean is a little stumped. \nINT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY \nAs Eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault area a look of intense concentration washes over his face. You can see that a trillion calculations are being made in his brain...the question is:  are there any answers? \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY \nZed is drilling now with a hand drill.  He removes it and blows into the hole.  Shavings come out. \nEric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling. \nZED (turning to Eric) What's going on? \nERIC Nothing.  They were just scaring them. \nZED Well, did you tell them to stay quiet? \nERIC Yes.  They're assholes.  Just having fun. \nZed looks into the hole. \nHe has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring. \nZED Fucked up my drill bit. \nERIC It's okay.  You can buy another one. \nZed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the two prongs into the hole. \nZED Cross your fingers. \nEric does. \nThe volt meter's needle jumps. \nZED Perfect. \nZED I can get through that lock in a minute. \nERIC Then do it.  We don't have all day. \nZed enters the Poseidon vault. \nINT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY \nZed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get him into the main vault. \nEric is right behind him. \nZed takes a twirl at the combination lock. \nZED Dime store brand.  Three minutes max. \nERIC Good. \nThen, there's a gunshot.  The bullet comes from the Calibre vault through the window and almost hits Zed. \nZed falls backwards onto the floor. \nZED Fuck! \nERIC Merde! \nThen there's another gunshot. \nThe bullet ricochets through the vault. \nZED Jesus Christ! \nScrambling on their hands and knees Zed and Eric crawl out of the Poseidon vault. \nINT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY \nThey take cover. \nAnother shot is fired into the vault. \nZed and Eric look into the vault. \nZED Another security guard? \nERIC Must be. \nZED I think I stained my pants. \nERIC Me too. \nOliver comes running in with his gun ready for action. \nOLIVER What is it?!  I came down to see how things were going and heard shots! \nERIC Some asshole in the vault. \nOliver takes cover and cocks his gun. \nOLIVER We've got guns.  Why don't we just storm in and blast his fucking ass!  It's three against one!  Let's give it the old-- \nERIC Quiet! \nOLIVER I'm just trying to be helpful. \nERIC Just let me think. \nOLIVER You don't have to snap at me. \nEric peeks into the vault. \nERIC (calling into the vault) [Hey you.  Nice shooting.  Play time's over.  Why don't you throw out your gun?] \nVAULT GUARD #1(O.S.) (calling from main vault) No! \nOliver and Eric look at each other and smile. \nERIC [Come on.  We don't want to kill you.] \nVAULT GUARD #1(O.S.) [You'll have to!] \nERIC (quietly to Zed) What is this guys problem? (then to the guard) [Come on!  You're making me impatient.  I don't have all day.] \nOLIVER Right. \nZed crawls through the opening. \nOLIVER I'll be at the other vault waiting for you to call to me. \nINT. CALIBER VAULT - DAY \nThe main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it were blown up from the inside.  On the floor is the still smoldering body of the security guard.  The room is incredibly smokey. \nZed squeezes through the opening. \nThen, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke with a brick sized bar of pure gold. \nERIC Look at it!  We're all rich! \nThe smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked onto it. \nEric starts laughing. \nERIC We're rich! \nZed looks at him like he's crazy. \nERIC We're rich! \nZED We're not out of here yet. \nERIC Yes but we're rich! \nZed takes a seat at the vault door.  The backside of a vault door looks like an incredibly intricate clock.  Zed removes the Plexiglass shielding. \nERIC I'm going to show the others. \nHe squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold. \nZed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using his voltmeter to test electrical points. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nClaude is talking to Jean. \nCLAUDE [What?  You think we may actually get out of this?  You're fooling yourself.] \nJEAN [Why are you such a pessimist?] \nCLAUDE [Are you kidding me?  Look at this mess.] \nJean surveys the mess, the crying people. \nCLAUDE [This is nothing.  Imagine the police outside.  We're dead men.] \nEric walks in from the rear stairs.  In his hand is a brick of gold. \nERIC [Jean, Francois, Claude...look at this.] \nThey see the gold. \nJEAN [You did it!  You got in!] \nERIC [Zed is opening the vault now.  This is a taste.] \nEric holds the bar of gold up for all the people to see. \nERIC [Look at this and tell me I'm not brilliant.] \nWOMAN CUSTOMER (crying) [You're a monster!  And you'll never leave this place alive!] \nEric shoots her with his Uzi. \nERIC (to the hostages) [None of you are worth half of this single bar.  Remember that.] \nFrancois, Jean, and Claude look at each other. \nCLAUDE [Eric...can I speak with you?] \nERIC [Of course.] \nCLAUDE [In private.] \nERIC [With her.] \nASSISTANT MANAGER [Yes.] \nERIC [That's sweet.] (to Zoey) [You have quite a reach my lovely.  Is he one of your clients?] \nHe pushes Zoey to the ground. \nERIC [It's a deal.] \nASSISTANT MANAGER [Thank you.] \nERIC [Don't mention it.] \nHe grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to the main entrance. \nCLAUDE [Eric!  What are you doing?] \nERIC [Clearing up the \"how full of shit am I\" question the cops are asking themselves right now.] \nThe assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but Eric simply forces him along. \nEveryone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire from outside.  They all scream. \nEric walks back into the bank, he picks up the phone. \nERIC (into phone) [Hello.] (pause) [Yes.  I'll hold.] (then to Claude) [I'm holding.] \nAfter a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end of the line. \nERIC (into phone) [Hello.] (pause) [You don't know the fucking half of it. So just shut the fuck up and listen.  Try any more stunts and I'll fucking really go crazy.] (pause) [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it I'll kill some more people.  Hear?] (pause) [No.  None of that.  We won't trade. That never works.  Not in the movies, not in real life.  Understand?  We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city.  And you're not going to follow us.] (pause) [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane?  Us?  No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you.  You're really pissing me off.  You think I'm a fucking amature?] \nHe covers the mouth piece. \nERIC (to Claude) [I fucking hate cops.] \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY \nZed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door.  He glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a calculator. \nThen, there is a groaning sound. \nZed, terrified, spins around. \nAnother groaning sound.  The vault security guard isn't dead. His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much alive. \nVAULT GUARD #1 [I'm going to die...] \nZed can't believe what he's seeing. \nHe moves over to the body, leaving his work behind. \nVAULT GUARD #1 [I'm going to die...please hold my...hand.  I don't...want to die...alone.] \nZed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it.  He gives it a nudge with his foot. \nThe body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever. \nZed kneels down next to the body. \nZED Are you still there? \nNothing. \nZed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and checks for a pulse. \nNothing. \nZed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches. He has wired a battery to two leads.  He takes out a wire cutter and snips a wire. \nThere is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as the vault unlocks. \nZed calls to Oliver from the passage. \nINT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY \nOliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub lobby teller. \nZED(O.S.) (distant, calling from the vault) Oliver, now!  Open the vault! \nFrancois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator via the back office. \nINT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY \nEric caresses his hand across the bars of gold. \nERIC (to himself) [Smoother and more giving than the most selfless human being.  You're beautiful.] \nFrancois runs in. \nFRANCOIS [Eric!] \nERIC [Jesus, what now?] \nFRANCOIS [The police are coming in!  We're doomed!] \nERIC [Get a hostage.] \nFRANCOIS (frantic) [They don't give a fuck about the hostages!] \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nJean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud. \nThen he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his head. \nJEAN [Don't make me!] \nA single bullet passes through his torso.  As Jean falls to the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling. \nOliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man. \nFrom behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold of Claude and wrestles him to the ground. \nThe other customers start to flee for cover. \nOliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and Claude.  It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the upper hand.  Oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine gun fire at them...killing them both. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY \nZoe walks up the stairs out, not only are they locked but a cloud of tear gas is pouring into the downstairs sub lobby. \nSuddenly, Zed stumbles in. \nZed is like a zombie.  Then he notices Zoe in the stairwell. They lock eyes. \nZED (almost delerious) Zoe... \nShe steps down into the sub lobby, machine guns crackle in the background.  She runs up to him just as he slumps to the ground. \nZOE (holding him) My Zed.  They've hurt you. \nShe dabs a cloth to his cut face.  He holds it on. \nZOE (trying to comfort him) You're going to be okay.  In many countries scars on the face are a symbol of heroism.  To proudly display a flaw like a badge...is to wear a badge of truth. \nHe takes her hand. \nZED Be serious Zoe...I can stick my tongue through my cheek. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nThe police are now laying it on heavy.  Francois comes out of the office. \nFRANCOIS Oliver!

ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nEXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin. \nThe heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver. \nOLIVER (so high he's wobbling) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain. \nNo one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil. \nOLIVER (continuing) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He drifts between the two.  Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes. \nERIC [Cotton.] \nRicardo hands him a cotton ball. \nOLIVER (continuing) It's really quite brilliant you know. That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show. \nEric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture. \nERIC (to Oliver) [Here, shut up and hold this.] \nHe hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe. \nThen, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it. \nERIC [Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins.] \nThey all laugh at this. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture. \nJEAN Do you want heroin? \nZED No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow. \nJean and Claude laugh at this. \nJEAN No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right. \nJean snorts a line. \nClaude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head \"no\". \nCLAUDE Okay. \nJEAN (recovering from the snort) That's good. \nEric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing. \nEric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed.  Francois sits on the floor. \nEric rolls up his sleeve. \n", "test1_true": "Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in. \nHe withdraws the needle. \nRicardo lets go of his arm. \nEric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep. \nThen Jean takes another snort. \nPretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer. \nThen Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it. \nJEAN (to Zed) Try some.  It's called chasing the dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it for centuries. \nZED I don't think so. \nJEAN Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper. \nThey stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke. \nSuddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we... \nFOCUS DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nRicardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights. \nA car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the streets. \nThe Patrick Hernandez song \"Born To Be Alive\" is blasting away on the radio. \nERIC There.  That's Notre Dame. \nBut before Zed can even look it has past by. \nRICARDO Do you like French cars? \nAll Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour. \nZED (answering Enrique's question) Yes. \nRICARDO I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to seventy-five.  Very nice. \nERIC Up here you can see the Eiffel tower. \nZed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric. \nZED Is tomorrow really Bastille day? \nERIC Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history.  And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo. \nThe drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers. \nEXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT \nThe two cars are franticly racing through traffic. \nINT.

You'd never be able to spend it.  And forget about exchanging it. \nOLIVER That's true. \nZED No sir.

Her years as a prostitute have taught her to ignore pain. \nShe grabs hold of the gun hand. \nERIC (groaning) [You fucking bitch!] \nA few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's foot red. \nEric lets go and falls to the ground. \nClaude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to what's going on. \nZoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it.  She showers the room with bullets.  She starts to run toward the back office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude, Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages. \nThen, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up. \nEric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot. \nERIC [Bitch!] \nCUT TO: \nINT.

He's concentrating on Zed. \nERIC Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much?  She's really fucked with your mind. \nZED Eric...what are you talking about? \nEric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the knife.  He turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his ear. \nERIC Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke. The attention.  They have no idea of who they're dealing with.  They have no idea what kind of men we are. \nZED (thinking Eric is a madman) What kind of men are we? \nEric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek. \nERIC You can no longer be in our club.  You forfeit your cut of the pie. \nZed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat. \nZED What about our friendship? \nERIC Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me. \nHe slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade.  Zed falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll. \nERIC Never let a girl come between two men. \nHe walks down the hall toward the gold. \nERIC Now let's try to get out of here. \nEric walks into the back office.  The others look at each other. \nSuddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires. \nIn the background the distinctive sound of European police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank. \nAlso, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a bullhorn. \nFRANCOIS [The police!

What do you say to that Zed? \nHe swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade. \nEric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor. \nZed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face. \nEric reaches for the knife. \nZed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric. \nZoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair. She plunges her nails into his face. \nERIC Fucking bitch! \nZed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath. \nThen, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes. \nZed lets out a shrill scream. \nEric starts elbowing Zoey in the face. \nThe three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony. \nThen, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room.  His body is a mass of bullet wounds. \nOLIVER Ox!  Where is thy yoke!? \nHe clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near Zoey, Zed, and Eric. \nThe sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman could posses.  He rolls over and throws Zoey off him. \nThen, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it. \nEric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun. \nHe gets to his feet and cocks the pump action. \nERIC Fuck both of you. \nThen he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs. \n", "test3_true": "ERIC Au revoir. \nHe aims to kill Zed. \nZOEY No! \nThen, all of the French policemen, decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs. At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their guns. \nFRENCH POLICEMAN #1 [Stop!] \nEric stops. \nIt becomes quiet. \nThen, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun kick. \nERIC I give you little kiss.  Ciao. \nHe squeezes the trigger and... \nCLICK \nThe police open fire with their French made assault machine guns and fill Eric with bullets.  Instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red. \nThe wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed. \nAn IMAGE overcomes Eric. \nEric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of Zed. \nZed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey. \nZoey runs up to him and holds him. \nThe police all charge into the secondary vault area and secure the downstairs. \nZoey is crying as she holds Zed. \nThe police have their guns aimed at the two of them. \nZoey looks up. \nZOEY (to the policemen) [I work here.  This man is a customer...he needs medical help.] \nThey take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if he's okay. \nFRENCH POLICEMAN #2 [How bad do you think his wounds are?] \nThe other policeman, unable to tell because of Eric's blood, simply shakes his head. \nFRENCH POLICEMAN #1 (to Zoey) [Are you alright?] \nZoey starts to cry. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nZoey and Zed, bandaged up, are being aided by all of the French policemen as they walk through the bank. \nSmoke is still clearing, but the bodies of customers and bank robbers alike litter the area. \nPARAMEDIC's, wearing all white, try to help the injured, they assist Zed and Zoey. \nFRENCH POLICEMAN #1 (to Zoey and Zed) [There's an ambulance outside.] (he looks around) [My God.  What a Bastille Day.] \nZed's attention is caught by two OTHER POLICEMEN carrying a body bag. \nFRENCH POLICEMAN #3 (to French policeman #1) [This one's the ringmaster.  We need an I.D.] \nNo longer interested in Zoey or Zed, he goes to check out the body. \nZOEY The hospital? \nZED No. \nZOEY Come on.  I have a car. \nZoey puts her arm around Zed and helps him out of the bank...never to return. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n", "test3_id": 1307}

{"test1_input": "KILLING ZOE \nWritten by \nRoger Avary \nFADE IN: \nINT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY \nRain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport. \nAside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song \"Batonga\". \nThen, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside. \nHe settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat. \nZED Hotel Mondial. \nCAB DRIVER Le Mondial.  Tres bien. \nHe starts driving. \nCAB DRIVER Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause du 14 Juillet. \nHe drives for a while. \nCAB DRIVER [Do you mind the radio?] \nZed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du Bois. \nCAB DRIVER [Do you want me to turn the radio off?] \nZED (realizing he's being asked a question) I don't speak French. \nThe driver turns around. \nCAB DRIVER (in broken English) Ah.  American? \nZED That's right. \nCAB DRIVER That's good because I speak a little English. \nZed nods. \nCAB DRIVER I asked if you mind the radio.  Music. You know. \nZed shakes his head \"no\". \nCAB DRIVER (with a smile) Super cool. \nZed adjusts his watch. \nZED What time is it? \nCAB DRIVER Time, time, time.  I don't know. Daytime. \nZed forgets the adjustment for now. \nCAB DRIVER Are you in town for business? \nZED Yes. \nCAB DRIVER It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big rooms. \nHe looks at Zed in the rear view mirror. \nCAB DRIVER Do you know Paris? \nZED I've been here once before.  When I was younger. \nThe cab driver smiles. \nCAB DRIVER Those were the days. \nThey drive for a while. \nCAB DRIVER Married? \nZED I beg your pardon? \n", "test1_true": "ZED No. (then after thinking about it for a while) Why? \nCAB DRIVER Well, if you need a wife for the night... (searching for the right words in French) Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter. (then back to his broken English) For business.  I give you my number. Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you were young. \nHe lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together, then he crosses them. \nCAB DRIVER Know what I mean? \nZed smiles at this and nods. \nCAB DRIVER Speaks the language of love.  Take you to heaven and back.  You just tell me and I set it up. \nZed shakes his head and laughs. \nCAB DRIVER What you laughing at?  You let Moises set it up.  She treat you right.  She treat you fine. \nZed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY \nA long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag. \nZed is right behind him. \nThey come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nThe door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, walks into the room. \nHe puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and proceeds to show him the room. \nSitting on the bed is a large air freight package. \nBELLBOY (in broken English) Your package...It arrived in the last night of before last night. \nHe points to the telephone. \nBELLBOY Ah...telephone, for the room service. \nHe motions toward the bathroom. \nBELLBOY The toilet. \nHe opens the closet door. \nBELLBOY To hang the clothes. \nHe points to a control console next to the bed. \nBELLBOY From here you can operate the television. \nThen he pauses at the door before he goes out. \nZed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, he starts fingering through it. \nThen, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which bills to give him. \nBELLBOY (after getting what he wanted) Merci. \nHe starts to leave. \nZED Oh, wait. \nThe bellboy turns around. \nZED What time is it? \nBELLBOY (confused) What time is it? \nZED (pointing at his watch) Time. \nBELLBOY Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures moins dix. \nThe bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door. \nZed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, and takes a seat on the bed. \nObviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table. \n", "test1_id": 1305, "test2_input": "ZED Okay.  When is Bastille day? \nERIC Tomorrow. \nZED Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow? \nERIC But of course. \nZED It's impossible. \nERIC It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what to do. \nZED I don't know what to do. \nERIC You don't need to know shit.  Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest. \nZED I haven't even seen the bank. \nERIC Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we live life.  It's better that way.  Okay? \nZED (unsure) Okay. \nERIC Good.  Now we do heroin! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nEXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin. \nThe heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver. \nOLIVER (so high he's wobbling) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain. \nNo one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil. \nOLIVER (continuing) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He drifts between the two.  Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes. \nERIC [Cotton.] \nRicardo hands him a cotton ball. \nOLIVER (continuing) It's really quite brilliant you know. That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show. \nEric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture. \nERIC (to Oliver) [Here, shut up and hold this.] \nHe hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe. \nThen, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it. \nERIC [Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins.] \nThey all laugh at this. \nINT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture. \nJEAN Do you want heroin? \nZED No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow. \nJean and Claude laugh at this. \nJEAN No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right. \nJean snorts a line. \nClaude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head \"no\". \nCLAUDE Okay. \nJEAN (recovering from the snort) That's good. \nEric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing. \nEric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed.  Francois sits on the floor. \nEric rolls up his sleeve. \n", "test2_true": "Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in. \nHe withdraws the needle. \nRicardo lets go of his arm. \nEric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep. \nThen Jean takes another snort. \nPretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer. \nThen Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it. \nJEAN (to Zed) Try some.  It's called chasing the dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it for centuries. \nZED I don't think so. \nJEAN Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper. \nThey stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke. \nSuddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we... \nFOCUS DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nRicardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights. \nA car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the streets. \nThe Patrick Hernandez song \"Born To Be Alive\" is blasting away on the radio. \nERIC There.  That's Notre Dame. \nBut before Zed can even look it has past by. \nRICARDO Do you like French cars? \nAll Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour. \nZED (answering Enrique's question) Yes. \nRICARDO I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to seventy-five.  Very nice. \nERIC Up here you can see the Eiffel tower. \nZed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric. \nZED Is tomorrow really Bastille day? \nERIC Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history.  And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo. \nThe drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers. \nEXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT \nThe two cars are franticly racing through traffic. \nINT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nJean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is they're going to. \nClaude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice. \nCLAUDE [Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat them!] \nFrancois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke. \nEXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT \nJean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and cuts off Ricardo. \nINT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nRicardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric. \nRICARDO [Shit!  That bastard.] \nERIC (to Ricardo) Watch it!  Don't crash my car. \n", "test2_id": 1306, "test3_input": "Zed takes the dolly and starts wheeling the platen of gold out.  Oliver helps him. \nOLIVER This is unbelievable.  Look at all of this.  It's wonderful to touch. \nZED Just help me steer this out. \nThey maneuver out of the Calibre vault. \nINT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY \nThey come out of the Calibre vault with the huge platen. \nOLIVER Do you think we should get some cash also? \nZED What for? \nOLIVER Well, you never know. \nThey start maneuvering the platen toward an elevator. \nZED Money is too easily traceable.  You'd never be able to spend it.  And forget about exchanging it. \nOLIVER That's true. \nZED No sir.  Your best bet is to get these bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea. \nOLIVER Eric knows someone in Portugal. \nZED Or Portugal. \nThey get into the banks private freight elevator. \nINT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY \nZed closes the door and pushes the button to go up to the ground floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nEric is dragging Zoey by the hair toward the door when she grabs his groin and starts squeezing. \nEric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the Uzi into her face. \nBut she won't let go.  Her years as a prostitute have taught her to ignore pain. \nShe grabs hold of the gun hand. \nERIC (groaning) [You fucking bitch!] \nA few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's foot red. \nEric lets go and falls to the ground. \nClaude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to what's going on. \nZoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it.  She showers the room with bullets.  She starts to run toward the back office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude, Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages. \nThen, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up. \nEric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot. \nERIC [Bitch!] \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY \nZed is waiting for the elevator to arrive. \nZED Do we have a covering of some kind? \nOLIVER A what? \nZED You know.  Something to cover this with. It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold. \nOLIVER Oh, it won't matter.  The police know what we're up too. \nZED Police?!  What do you mean they know what we're up too? \nOLIVER You don't know?  We've been discovered. But Eric has them under control. \n", "test3_true": "ZED No I didn't know!  How many police? \nOLIVER The building is surrounded. \nThe elevator doors open onto the ground floor to the sound of automatic gunfire.  Zed walks out into the back office. \nINT. BANK - BACK OFFICE - DAY \nSuddenly, from the back office, Zed sees Zoey blasting away an Uzi and running toward the rear stairwell.  Eric is in the lobby limping around.  The other gang members are ducking from her fire. \nThen, her clip runs out. \nShe sees Zed, their eyes lock.  An IMAGE overcomes Zed.  She runs down the stairs to the back. \nERIC Kill her!  Kill her! \nOliver aims his gun to fire and Zed pushes it up.  Oliver's gun discharges into the ceiling.  Oliver and Zed begin to struggle. \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nZed and Oliver collapse out of the back office and into the lobby.  They tumble onto the floor.  Eric hobbles over to them, his gun aimed at Zed. \nERIC What the fuck are you doing!? \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY \nZoe is near tears.  She drops the empty machine gun to the floor and starts walking toward the sub lobby. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY \nEric leans down to talk to Zed.  Oliver and Jean are watching.  Francois and Claude are more worried about the tear gas. \nCLAUDE [They're trying to smoke us out Eric!] \nFRANCOIS [What do we do!?] \nEric waves them off with a brush of his hand.  He's concentrating on Zed. \nERIC Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much?  She's really fucked with your mind. \nZED Eric...what are you talking about? \nEric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the knife.  He turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his ear. \nERIC Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke. The attention.  They have no idea of who they're dealing with.  They have no idea what kind of men we are. \nZED (thinking Eric is a madman) What kind of men are we? \nEric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek. \nERIC You can no longer be in our club.  You forfeit your cut of the pie. \nZed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat. \nZED What about our friendship? \nERIC Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me. \nHe slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade.  Zed falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll. \nERIC Never let a girl come between two men. \nHe walks down the hall toward the gold. \nERIC Now let's try to get out of here. \nEric walks into the back office.  The others look at each other. \nSuddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires. \nIn the background the distinctive sound of European police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank. \nAlso, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a bullhorn. \nFRANCOIS [The police!  They're entering the building!] \nSuddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the smoke. \n", "test3_id": 1307}

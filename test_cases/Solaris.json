Maybe its power isn't that God-like.  I mean, we have God-like power relative to an insect, but that doesn't mean we can move the Earth around at will. Maybe it's like a spider web, waiting for something to show up. (beat) We intercepted some brief fragments of what must be an everlasting monologue with itself.  Of course it was beyond our understanding. (beat) I've come to hate it here.  There's only one way out of its reach, for us.  Humans. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Also under the sheet, next to Gibarian: The Young Girl. \nGIBARIAN (from a video) I thought I'd been behaving normally, rationally.  But a sign of insanity is the inability to think about more than one thing. So if I am consumed by the idea that I am insane and can't think of anything else, then I am insane.

What he is staring at is Rheya, who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away. \nThis continues until she gets off the train.

I thought of it when I saw you on the train. \nRHEYA My Thomas is a little rusty. \nHe leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles. \nRHEYA Not a very happy poem. \nKELVIN You didn't look very happy. \nRHEYA I wasn't. \nKELVIN And tonight? \nRHEYA Better. \nHe nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans over and whispers in his ear.

She has an odd look in her eyes. \nWe are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but failing -- not to watch. \nRHEYA You want to fuck her? \nKELVIN Stop it. \nRHEYA You behave as though you want to fuck her. \nKELVIN Rheya.  Not here. \nRHEYA And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman? \nKELVIN Let's go home. \nRHEYA You go home. \nKELVIN I am.  Please come with me.

Sad. \nRHEYA How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this? \nKELVIN I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is asleep.  Alone. \nAfter a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and something tells him that's not a good sign. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LAB \nRheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss. \nKelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire, but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nKelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a passing room. \nSNOW What happened? \nKELVIN She drank liquid oxygen. \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems very detached. \nAn uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually not going to wake up. \nKELVIN She's dead. \nSnow says nothing. \nThen: \nHer finger twitches. \nBarely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little, as though cold. \nSNOW She'll come back, don't worry.  But then what?  My theory is she can only live here, that she will die if she leaves this ship. \nKelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little harder; it's feeling like a seizure now. \n", "test2_true": "KELVIN Get out -- \nSNOW Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?

Is that polygamy?  And even if you could take her home, how would you get her through?  You think they're not going to notice her? \nRheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks dispassionately on the two of them: \nSNOW I never get used to them, these... \"Resurrections\". \nHe leaves. \nRheya continues her process of \"waking up\" -- it's violent, even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then slowly returns to normal. \nKelvin puts his hand on her forehead. \nShe gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin. \nIt takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him; she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead. \nShe begins to cry. \nRHEYA What am I?

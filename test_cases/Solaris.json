{"train": "Solaris - by Steven Soderbergh -  October 4, 2001 draft \nSOLARIS \nby \nSteven Soderbergh \nOctober 4, 2001 \nFirst, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain. \nThen: \nA MAN'S VOICE I'm not a poet.  I've never moved anyone with my words. (beat) Maybe that's why they chose me. \nEXT.  WOODS - DAY \nA mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain continues to fall. \nMaybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light (or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - MORNING \nStill, the sound of rain is heard. \nA MAN \n40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us. \nHe has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant expression, he has not slept in ages. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nLess like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through. \nThe Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no particular hurry. \nThe sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened -- spraying muddy debris in its wake. \nSeconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop. \nTHE MAN \nStops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still. \nThe car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the Man, who remains motionless. \nWhen the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional. \nWELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT Dr. Kelvin? \nThe Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS KELVIN, stares back at him. \nCUT TO: \nKelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign of life. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nEmpty. \n(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any angle.) \nKelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM \nRansacked. \nKelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to replay. \nVIDEO \nGibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but extremely fatigued. \nGIBARIAN Hi, Chris. (a light smile) I'm so glad you came. (beat, the smile fades) I still have a little time, and I want to tell you something.  To warn you.  By now you know about me, or if you don't, get Snow or Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't matter. (beat) I didn't lose my mind.  You should be able to tell from this video. I'm not mad. (beat) If it happens to you, remember that it isn't madness. (beat) You should know, I'm in favor of destroying Solaris.  I know that's... illegal.  And unethical. And irresponsible.  But it's the only way to make it stop. \nA long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video, which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen. \nGIBARIAN (addressing whoever made the noise) Cut that out.  Do you hear me? \nGibarian switches off the video. \nThe computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and overlays a readout indicating the file has ended. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nEmpty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. Kelvin moves toward it. \nINT.  ROOM \nA FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down, his expression wary and alert. \nKELVIN Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? I'm Kelvin. \nA long beat.  Snow just watches him. \nSNOW Yes.  We heard. \nKelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils. \nKELVIN What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian? \nSNOW He's dead. \nKELVIN How? \nA beat. \nSARTORIUS In the lab.  With her, probably. \nKELVIN Her?  Who are you talking about? \nSartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his door.  He struggles to keep his composure. \nSARTORIUS His last wish was to be buried on Earth.  In dirt, he said.  \"I want to buried in dirt.\"  What a clown. \nSartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is on the other side of his door. \nKELVIN They shouldn't let people like you into space. \nSARTORIUS Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is. I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home. \nKELVIN Listen -- \nSARTORIUS We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him. \nSartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius' room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR - DAY \nKelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that stops him: \nA NUDE WOMAN \nBlack, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead. \nKelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the time he gets there, she is gone. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SNOW'S ROOM \nSnow is lying on his bunk. \nKELVIN Is there anybody else here? \nSNOW (sits up a little) Why, who did you see? \nKELVIN Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message. \nSNOW Who was it? \nKELVIN She was real.  Where did she come from? \nSnow looks at him but doesn't respond. \nKELVIN Tell me.  I won't think you're insane. \nSNOW Oh, that's a relief. \nSnow lies back down. \nKELVIN Where did she come from? \nA beat. \nRHEYA We're taking a flight? \nKELVIN Yes. \nHe opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. She is unsure. \nKELVIN Go ahead.  I'll close the door behind me. \nShe stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya. \nHe walks across the docking bay to the control room and begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned. \nKELVIN \nIn agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off into space. \nRHEYA \nHer face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a brutal finality. \nKELVIN \ncollapses to the ground, shattered. \nINSERT: \nA woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY. \nANOTHER INSERT: \nA pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left unattended for too long... \nANOTHER INSERT: \nA rain-streaked window. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself inside out. \nA voice calls over the intercom: Snow's. \nSNOW Was her breakfast conversation that bad? \nKELVIN Shut up. \nSNOW I told you, try to stay calm. You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch. \nKELVIN What was it? \nKelvin rises and goes to wash his face. \nSNOW Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition. \nKELVIN And professionally? \nSNOW I'm not sure. (beat) It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens.  Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night. (beat) Who was she? \nSNOW We're not even sure it will let us leave. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER VIDEO \nThis time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end. \nGIBARIAN Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power isn't that God-like.  I mean, we have God-like power relative to an insect, but that doesn't mean we can move the Earth around at will. Maybe it's like a spider web, waiting for something to show up. (beat) We intercepted some brief fragments of what must be an everlasting monologue with itself.  Of course it was beyond our understanding. (beat) I've come to hate it here.  There's only one way out of its reach, for us.  Humans. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LAB \nKelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet, next to Gibarian: The Young Girl. \nGIBARIAN (from a video) I thought I'd been behaving normally, rationally.  But a sign of insanity is the inability to think about more than one thing. So if I am consumed by the idea that I am insane and can't think of anything else, then I am insane. (beat, smiles) You ask questions at the end of your life, the sort of questions people who are content don't ask. (beat) Maybe life just can't be solved. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SPACE \nA shot hovering over the surface of Solaris. \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is lying down, looking at the door. \nAfter a beat, he turns out the lights and rolls over. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nTime has passed.  Kelvin is asleep. \nRHEYA leans into frame and kisses him. \nWithout even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily. \nKELVIN Rheya... \nRHEYA I want you inside me right now. \nThey make love.  It's even better than before. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin and Rheya are asleep. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  TRAIN - DAY \nKelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya, who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away. \nThis continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the train pulls away. \nINT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe immediate aftermath of the preceding scene, but at home now. \nRheya crying as she embraces Kelvin. \nRHEYA I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry. \nHe is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - MORNING \nRheya, in a chair, remorseful, Kelvin is dressing. \nKELVIN You're better when you take them. \nRHEYA I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better. \nKELVIN All right.  How about I feel better when you take them? \nA beat. \nRHEYA Right. \nThey look at each other and understand; she will take the pills. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - MORNING \nRheya, on the floor, dead.  Her hand outstretched, a repeat of an image we saw earlier. \nRain streaks the kitchen window. \nThe bottle of pills nearby. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PROMETHEUS \nRheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches. \nKELVIN What do you remember? \nRHEYA What do you mean? \nKELVIN Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends? \nRHEYA (thinking) Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember. It's like filling up. \nShe looks out the portal at Solaris. \nRHEYA Is it a planet? \nKELVIN Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe.  An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything. \nRHEYA Is it intelligent? \nFinally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the door. \nRHEYA \nIs revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself in the process. \nKELVIN Rheya... \nConfused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and carries her to the bed. \nRHEYA What happened? \nKELVIN You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why? \nRHEYA When I saw you were gone I got scared. \nHe puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where he gathers all the first aid materials he can find. \nReturning, he blanches. \nRheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in front of us. \nShe looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face. \nRHEYA Chris, what's wrong with me? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LAB \nKelvin runs Rheya through a battery of tests and studies the results. \nRHEYA Am I all right? \nA beat. \nKELVIN Yes. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM \nSnow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin. \nSNOW He won't do it. \nSARTORIUS Why do you say that? \nSNOW He won't. \nKelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange glances. \nKELVIN This is my wife, Rheya. \nShe looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly, and the feeling seems to be mutual. \nSARTORIUS We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about... \nSNOW We want to talk freely. \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nKelvin holds the dead Rheya. \nKELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS) \nSqueezing her. \nKELVIN I should have believed you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nRheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting. \nRHEYA I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them. \nKELVIN It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires. \nShe knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't matter. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except for the glow of the screen. \nSNOW You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that -- \nKELVIN -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating. \nSNOW If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- (meaning Rheya) -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here? \nKELVIN Not necessarily. \nSNOW Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen! This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up. \nKELVIN Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody. \nSNOW Who are you trying to convince? \nKelvin just looks back at Rheya. \nSNOW It will end badly.  As inevitably as the rising of a bubble. \nKelvin doesn't respond. \nSNOW Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius has some new ideas, about making it stop. \nKelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep. \nCUT TO: \nKELVIN It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice. \nRHEYA It was obvious from the way he first looked at me. \nA beat.  He holds her. \nRHEYA Do I really feel like... I am...? \nKELVIN Yes.  Yes. \nRHEYA I'm glad. \nA beat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SOLARIS \nTurning, slowly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThen years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed. \nKELVIN Everything you pursue, you end up becoming disinterested in.  The fact that you're good at everything you try makes it worse.  You have a degree in animal science, you could be a terrific vet. You drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist. Then it was politics, which seemed best of all, you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to achieve your goal.  And they didn't even know they were being arranged.  But you got bored with it, like you do with everything. \nShe just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a common observation and she's past being defensive about it. \nKELVIN I don't know what it's really like, to not know what you want to do. To not have anything that you love to do more than anything else. \nA beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her cigarette at the moment. \nRHEYA (sarcastic) Imagine my frustration. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nOn the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep. \nShe rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious, something we haven't seen before. \nKelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression: \nKELVIN What's wrong. \nRHEYA You don't love me. \nKELVIN Stop. \nA beat.  She looks down. \nRHEYA I have to talk to you... I... I don't know where I came from. (up at him) Do you know? \nHe doesn't respond. \nRHEYA If you know but can't tell me now... will you ever be able to? \nKelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle of a heated discussion. \nSNOW Gibarian was under enormous -- \nSARTORIUS Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here. \nKELVIN Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants? \nSARTORIUS Yes. \nKELVIN That's fantastic. \nSARTORIUS Why did you agree to come here? \nA beat. \nSARTORIUS Too tired to answer? \nLooks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin. \nSARTORIUS I'll bet.  Is this what they sent you here to do?  You've lost it, you've gone native. \nKelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come. \nRHEYA (to Sartorius) You're the coward. \nKELVIN Don't debate him; he'll say anything. \nRHEYA (still, to Sartorius) I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do. \nSARTORIUS Prove it. \nRHEYA These \"guests\" are a part of you, of your subconscious.  Chris loves me. \nSARTORIUS YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to understand that if you can understand anything! \nKelvin is within an inch of his face. \nKELVIN Get out of here. \nSlowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear: \nSARTORIUS Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A facsimile.  And she's seducing you all over again.  You're sick.  You think of fucking her as research for humanity.  It's just fucking. \nKelvin backs away. \nSARTORIUS There's nothing grandiose about it. You've jumped out of a plane and you're trying to sew a parachute together while you fall. \nSartorius turns... \nSARTORIUS It'd be hilarious if it weren't so damn sad. \nAnd leaves. \nA beat. \nSNOW We didn't even get to hear his new ideas. \nSnow wanders toward the door. \nRHEYA That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying. \nKELVIN For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now. \nShe realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now, anyway. \nRHEYA I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. (beat) I can't explain it. \nKELVIN Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before.  It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. \nRHEYA But that's what happened before. \nKELVIN Not this time. \nHe kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says nothing.  Then: \nRHEYA Do you want to stay here? \nKELVIN Do you? \nRHEYA If you're here. \nThey kiss again... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him. \nOffscreen, we hear the door open. \nSomeone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through the frame and sits. \nAfter a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling to clear.  When it does: \nKELVIN Gibarian. \nGIBARIAN Leave the light off. \nA beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings. \nGIBARIAN I wish you'd come a little sooner. I might not have had to kill myself. \nHe smiles, looking at Kelvin. \nGIBARIAN You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian. Just a new incarnation. \nKELVIN What do you want? \nGIBARIAN You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth. \nKELVIN Can it work? \nGIBARIAN It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours?  Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates. \nKelvin registers this. \nGIBARIAN What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort. \nKELVIN That won't happen again.  We're different. \nRHEYA How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know. There is no \"You\" from before. \nShe sits, frustrated.  Sad. \nRHEYA How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this? \nKELVIN I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is asleep.  Alone. \nAfter a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and something tells him that's not a good sign. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LAB \nRheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss. \nKelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire, but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nKelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a passing room. \nSNOW What happened? \nKELVIN She drank liquid oxygen. \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems very detached. \nAn uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually not going to wake up. \nKELVIN She's dead. \nSnow says nothing. \nThen: \nHer finger twitches. \nBarely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little, as though cold. \nSNOW She'll come back, don't worry.  But then what?  My theory is she can only live here, that she will die if she leaves this ship. \nKelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little harder; it's feeling like a seizure now. \nEXT.  SOLARIS \nTurning slowly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin and Rheya, in bed. \nRHEYA Do you think I can get pregnant here? \nA long beat. \nKELVIN We'll know soon enough. \nINSERT: \nThe first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time we hear what she is saying: \nRHEYA I can't be a mother. \nShe pulls back. \nKELVIN That's good to know. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nKelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya. \nRHEYA Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris. \nKELVIN You should have told me. \nRHEYA It wouldn't have made any difference. \nKELVIN Thank you. \nRHEYA Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this. \nKELVIN Neither did I. \nRHEYA You never said you wanted one. \nKELVIN I never said I didn't. \nRHEYA Chris -- \nKELVIN I can't stay here. \nRHEYA Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it. \nKELVIN Then you won't make it. \nHe leaves, brushing past her. \nCUT TO: \nRheya and Kelvin. \nRHEYA What do I have to do to stop it? \nKELVIN I want you here. \nRHEYA You're lying. \nKELVIN You exist here.  I keep telling you. \nRHEYA That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya. \nKELVIN Who are you, then? \nRHEYA I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago. \nKELVIN Yes, you are -- \nRHEYA Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the... (beat) I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin.  There was something else. An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours? \nKELVIN Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine. \nRHEYA But then I would be dead now. \nA beat. \nKELVIN Is that really what you want? \nRHEYA I want to stop taking those pills. \nKELVIN I wish you wouldn't. \nRHEYA They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight. \nKELVIN I think they help. \nRHEYA I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy? \nKELVIN You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters -- \nRHEYA I can't -- \nKELVIN It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were. (beat) Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me. \nRHEYA Am I really her? \nKELVIN I don't know anymore.  All I see is you. \nThey kiss. \nKELVIN Stay with me. (beat) Stay with me. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY \nTen years ago.  Kelvin and Rheya standing on a street corner. They seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious conversation.  It is raining. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin in bed, on the Prometheus.  Still feverish. \nRheya is mopping his brow. \nINT.  KELVIN'S CABIN (EARTH) \nKelvin in bed, feverish. \nRheya is there, wiping his forehead. \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nOn the Prometheus.  Kelvin looks over to Rheya. \nKELVIN Where did you go before? \nRHEYA When? \nKELVIN Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor. \nRHEYA You must have been dreaming. \nShe begins to cry. \nKELVIN What's the matter? \nShe just shakes her head. \nKELVIN Rheya? \nFrom Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying. \nThen he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to someone we cannot see. \nThen he looks further to the right, and there she is again, staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the edge of the bed in order to be near. \nKELVIN \nSweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear. \nKELVIN (V.O.) I'm losing my mind. (beat) I'm breaking apart. \nINT.  CABIN - DAY \nKelvin sits in his chair, as he did at the beginning, with the three officials from DBA behind him. \nOnly now the three officials are Snow, Sartorius, and Gibarian. \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS) \nKelvin, transfixed. \nCount to five.  Then: \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS) \nKelvin is in his bed, still feverish. \nKELVIN (V.O.) I thought it was over. \nHe looks around the room.  He is alone. \nA flashing light on his computer demands attention. \nON THE COMPUTER \nA video message from Rheya. \nRHEYA Don't blame them.  I begged them to do it.  It's better this way. (beat) I'm sorry. (beat) I'm sorry I tried to make you think I was human. (beat) I read my own suicide note.  I found it in your things.  I realized I was not her. \nShe looks away. \nRHEYA I know that you loved me, Chris.  I know that. (beat) I love you. \nKelvin breaks down. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nKelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem, the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke. \nINT.  PARTY - NIGHT \nThe first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and whispers.  This time we hear what he says: \nKELVIN \"Though they go mad they shall be sane.  Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again.\" \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nKevin holding Rheya. \nThe note on the floor. \nThe rain-streaked window. \nRHEYA (V.O.) \"Though lovers be lost love shall not.  And death shall have no dominion.\" \nKelvin wipes the hair from her face. \nKELVIN (V.O.) You killed her! \nSARTORIUS (V.O.) Not her.  It. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PROMETHEUS \nKelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius' door. \nSNOW I won't be making the trip. \nSARTORIUS Snow, get up here, now. \nSNOW I'm not Snow. \nThis stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and then at the monitor. \nSNOW I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow. \nSARTORIUS Fuck me.  I knew it. \nKELVIN When did this happen? \nSNOW Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though.  I think I made a mistake. \nKELVIN Jesus... \nSNOW But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it. \nKELVIN Maybe you can. \nSARTORIUS You want it coming back with us? \nSNOW You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions. \nSnow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius. \nSARTORIUS We do not have time to deal with this.  Get the diode sail into position and let me know when the bias drive and the induction ring are at zero point. \nKelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and shuts the monitor off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SPACE \nSilence. \nThe Prometheus moves away from Solaris. \nCLOSER ON SOLARIS \nAfter the ship has gone. \nA soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet. \nSlowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand. \nWithin a minute Solaris has disappeared. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY \nKelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain continues. \nHe watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving to and fro. \nKELVIN (V.O.) Earth. (beat) What did that word mean to me? (beat) I have returned.  Finally. \n", "test1_input": "INT.  TRAIN - DAY \nContinued silence, AND: \nRHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression indicates she's in a very raw emotional state. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nKelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN. \nHe is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The contrast with his older self is striking. \nBACK TO KELVIN \nAsleep on the ship.  After a beat: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP: \nRheya's LIPS. \nExcept the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car. \nA WIDER VIEW \nReveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now. \nShe is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness. \nKELVIN \nAwakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her. \nIf he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply. \nRHEYA \nStands and makes her way to Kelvin. \nWithout hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore each other and we see all of it happen and two things are obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they haven't done it in some time. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms. \nHe wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he rises to sit on the edge of the bed. \nA wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes. \nKELVIN Oh, God.  I'm awake. \nRHEYA Yes. \nHe looks at her. \nKELVIN Where did you come from? \nShe moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to do, forever. \n", "test1_true": "KELVIN How are you here? \nShe stops. \nRHEYA How do you mean? (beat) Chris, what's wrong? \nHearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words, perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream. \nHe stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him. \nRHEYA I love you. \nHe looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks down. \nRHEYA Do you love me? \nHe doesn't look up. \nKELVIN Yes. \nA beat. \nKELVIN I need to see Snow. \nRHEYA I'll go with you. \nKELVIN (rising) I'll just be a minute. \nShe bolts out of bed. \nRHEYA Don't. \nKELVIN Why? \nRHEYA I don't know.  I can't be alone. \nKELVIN I'll be right back. \nShe is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his arms on her shoulders to comfort her. \nKELVIN All right.  All right.  Here. \nHe hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water. \nRHEYA What are they? \nKELVIN To calm your anxiety. \nRHEYA To calm my anxiety. \nShe takes the pills and smiles. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOCKING BAY \nKelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are in space suits. \n", "test1_id": 1635, "test2_input": "She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the door. \nKelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and returns to bed.  The light goes out. \nRHEYA (V.O.) Yes, I remember that.  I went back to Lois' house and spent the night. Those were dark days. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PARTY - NIGHT \nKelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each other; they know something is happening between them, will happen between them. \nRHEYA I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff. \nKELVIN How old were you? \nRHEYA Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face. \nKELVIN What kind of look? \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nKelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya continues her story without a beat. \nRHEYA Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat. Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was.  I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal.  But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on. (beat) I guess that's part of the reason why -- \nKELVIN I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that. \nAnother beat. \nRHEYA I remember days of just thinking about you. \nINT.  OFFICES - DAY \nIntercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not present in their respective encounters with other people; they are distracted by the idea of each other. \nAnd they like it. \nRHEYA Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling. \nKELVIN I did too. \nINT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRheya on the edge of the bed, facing away. \nKELVIN I used to watch you undress. \nAs she does: \nKELVIN I never tired of watching you undress.  Every time, it was exciting.  Right until... to the end. \nA beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him leaving their apartment, angry. \nON THE PROMETHEUS \nA beat. \nRHEYA What happened to us, exactly? \n", "test2_true": "Rheya shakes her head. \nKelvin just watches her. \nRHEYA I remember... something burning. Coffee burning. \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nThe rain-streaked window. \nAn automated coffee maker has been left on, and the solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking. \nRheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen. \nRHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS) \nShe is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this. \nRHEYA You found me? \nHe nods.  It's coming back to her. \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nKelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying, but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is crying. \nRHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS) \nExperiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in front of her. \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nKelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him. \nRHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS) \nHer eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her. \nKELVIN I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. \nRheya is devastated, inconsolable. \nRHEYA Why did you say those things? \nKELVIN I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me. \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nRheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in her hand. \nKelvin kneels next to her. \nKELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS) \nWith Rheya still in his arms. \nKELVIN When you said you wouldn't make it... I didn't believe you.  Or I didn't take you seriously, which is worse. \n", "test2_id": 1636, "test3_input": "RHEYA What are you taking? \nKELVIN A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours? \nINT.  APARTMENT - DAY \nRheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills just beyond her hand. \nBACK ON THE PROMETHEUS \nKelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her. \nKELVIN What does it want? \nRHEYA I don't know.  Something. Anything. \nShe goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris. \nRHEYA It created me and yet I can't communicate with it.  It must hear me, though.  It must know what's happening to me.  Don't you think? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nSnow on the videophone to Kelvin.  Rheya is asleep in the background. \nSNOW I don't think it dislikes us.  I think it just noticed us.  It lives, thinks, and acts.  We are dealing with a living creature here, no question.  And it's done something we've never been able to do: create a perfect human body. Perfect except for the subatomic alterations, but... \nCUT TO: \nGIBARIAN \nOn his suicide tape: \nGIBARIAN If Solaris is inside our brain, and it knows everything, and we're only consciously aware of what 2% of our brain is up to at any given moment, it knows us better than we know ourselves.  It's not even close. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM \nRheya and Kelvin. \nRHEYA I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it. (beat) It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose. (beat) And us?  We would have to have \"an arrangement\".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that? \nKELVIN Please.  Don't. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

INT HALLWAY- EVENING 
Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK. 
MILO (LOUD) Godammit. Son of a bitch. 
The maid peeks out into the hall. 
MILO (to Cass) This is like the third card they've given me... 
CASS (playing along) Take it easy, honey... 
MILO Don't tell me to take it easy, now we have to go all the way downstairs again... 
Cass looks pleadingly at the maid. 
MAID What's the name? 
MILO Davenport. Room 2505. 
The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR. 
MILO You're an angel. 
Milo and Cass go inside. 
INT ROOM 2505- EVENING 
Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his heels. All is silent. 
CASS (WHISPERING) Wait a second: where's my gun? 
MILO (SAME) I don't know. Where is your gun? 
CASS I don't have one. 
MILO Then you've answered your own question. 
Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve. 
CASS Come on, give me something. You've got, like, a million weapons in the jacket. 
She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away. 
MILO Hey. These are not toys. You can't just give them to someone and have them know how to use them. 
CASS I seem to remember doing just fine with your taser gun. 
They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM. 
No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN KICKS THE DOOR IN... 
INT HALLWAY- EVENING 
Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the elevators... 
INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS 
Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room. The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom and peers in: EMPTY. 
Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees spots on the rug: 
CASS Oh, god, is that blood? 
MILO Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door. 
CASS I'm just trying to... 
MILO This could be a crime scene. There are clues all over this room that only a trained eye can find. And as I seem to recall, you were the one who was unable to figure this out by herself. 
Oooh. Cass grits her teeth. 
CASS (under her breath) He is unbelievable. 
MILO Who are you talking to, your imaginary friend Leslie? 
CASS (BLUSHING) Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary friends, despite what my mother believes. 
MILO Whatever. You wait by the door. And I'll handle this. 
CASS (PISSED) Fine. 
She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE. 
CASS So you're saying you don't want my help. 
MILO I'm saying I don't need your help.

HILLTOP - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT \nClay gallops up the hill to rein his horse in suddenly. \nMED. LONG SHOT \nhis ANGLE. Riding toward him are several horsemen. The horses move at a walk. One carries a double burden. Steve walks along behind. Clay spurs his horse and rides down toward them. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay, in the B.g., comes down the hill. The horsemen, seven of them, with Sheriff Gardner in the lead, followed by a deputy, carrying Elaine in front of him, file past camera. Steve, hands in his pockets, walks dejectedly in the dust cloud kicked up by the horses. \nMED. SHOT \nfeaturing Clay and Gardner. Clay reins in his horse beside Gardner, who also stops. The others rein in. Steve stops a short distance away. \nGARDNER Want to take her off our hands? \nClay rides closer. The deputy rides forward and lifts Elaine into his arms. Clay settles her in front of him. \nCLAY Who shot who? \nGARDNER Nobody. The light was bad. \nThere are two rifles in his saddle holster. He pulls Steve's out, hands it over. \nGARDNER Steve's! \nClay shoves it in his saddle holster. \nGARDNER What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night. \nCLAY I wouldn't know. Did you ask her? \nGARDNER All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'. \nCLAY Look of things, she doesn't. \nGARDNER Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her -- (motioning to Steve) And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov. \nHe wheels his horse and rides off, followed by the others Clay watches him go. Reluctantly Steve moves slowly up to stand near Clay. \nSTEVE There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head. \nCLAY (dryly) How'd you happen to miss? \nSTEVE They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim. \nCLAY Good thing you didn't. \nHe reins his horse around. \nSTEVE Clay -- \nClay looks back. \nSTEVE A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while. \nCLAY That's right, Steve. \nSTEVE Can I have my gun back? \nCLAY Sure.

West are the Sierras and clouds are piled in untidy heaps on the range. The dusty trail runs through rolling country. Pinon pine and brush clothe the slopes. The wagon and horses are the moving center of a white cloud of dust. \nFULL SHOT \nClay's party. Clay rides in the lead. The wagon follows and Steve is riding beside the wagon. Behind is the remuda, and the horses are straying off the road in search of grass. \nMED. SHOT \nwagon - (MOVING). Featuring Steve and Mary. Elaine lies under the seat and Helen sits beside her.

Steve stops his letters. looks off. The wagon moves up to Clay and stops. \nCLAY Get back to the horses. They're straggling. \nMARY He's learning his letters. \nCLAY Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country. \nSteve hesitates hoping he'll change his mind. \nCLAY (sternly) Do like I said. \nSteve wheels his horse and rides back. Mary looks over at Clay. \nMARY (dryly) Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street. \nCLAY (motioning) Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they? \nMARY (after a backward glance) They're stragglin'. \nCLAY His letters will keep. \nHe wheels his horse and rides after Steve. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSteve is driving the horses back into the road. Clay rides up to help him. The horses fall in behind the wagon. Steve takes up his position in the rear. Clay rides over beside him. \nMED. SHOT \nCLAY AND STEVE. (MOVING) \nCLAY Steve -- I want you to learn to read. I meant to teach you but I never seemed to find time. I figured when we got settled on the ranch we'd get around to it. \nThey ride in silence for a moment. \nCLAY It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job. \nSTEVE (flat) I won't again. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOne of the horses strays out of line and Clay rides out and gets the animal back in the road. Then he returns to Steve. \nTWO SHOT - (MOVING) \nCLAY This isn't like other trips we've taken. For one thing, we've got a wagonload of women. For another there's a guy wanderin' around hopin' to put a bullet in my back. \nSteve looks over at his brother and finds a wry grin. \nSTEVE Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him. \nCLAY I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months. \nSTEVE Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle. \nCLAY (nods; then, after a moment) You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high. \nSTEVE (offended) Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something... \nCLAY That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him. \nSTEVE Oh... that's the time you went away. \nCLAY (nods) I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story. \nSTEVE (looking off) Maybe you shoulda killed him. \nCLAY Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. (glances off) Looks pretty peaceful up ahead. \nSTEVE Yeah, it does. \nCLAY But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon? \nSteve smiles warmly at him. \nCLAY And while you're there you might as well find out what comes after K. \nDISSOLVE \nEXTREME LONG SHOT \nCavalcade.

Goodnight. \nShe enters the house. Clay looks after her, smiling faintly. He knows she is up to something but not what. \nINT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Save for the moonlight coming through the window, the room is dark. Mary enters softly, throws off her robe and slips into bed beside Helen. \nMED. CLOSE \non bed. Moonlight falls across the bed. Mary pulls the covers up. Helen turns her head. \nHELEN Did you make it interesting? \nMary snuggles down on the pillow. \nMARY I tried my best, but these things take time. \nHELEN And we're running out of that. \nMARY There's still tomorrow morning. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nMED. LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH window PAST Mary. The early morning sun fills the yard. Steve is in the corral harnessing the mules. Clay and Wyatt are taking Mary's and Helen's trunks out of the wagon. \nHELEN'S VOICE Those trunks look like ours. \nMary, who was in profile, turns. \nMARY They are. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHelen is seated at the table. Mary stands with her back to the window near the sink. \nHELEN How long do you think we'll have to stay here? \nMARY Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden. \nHELEN We don't want to go there. \nMARY No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora. \nHELEN Clay could save us an awful lot of time. \nMARY He certainly could. About a month. \nHELEN What are you waiting for? Do something. \nMary comes over to stand by the table. Her expression is thoughtful. \nHELEN (sharp) You're not giving up? \nMARY How many ways can a man say no. \nHelen rises. Her manner is determined. \nHELEN (crosses to door) Maybe I better start working on him. \nMARY You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least... \nCLOSE SHOT \nas she stops, apparently inspired by Mary's last remark. She looks out into the yard where Clay is working on the wagon. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING TOWARD Elaine's bedroom door. Helen crosses to Mary. \nHELEN (sweetly) If you can't bring him around, nobody can. \nShe puts her arm around Mary's shoulder. \nHELEN Go on. Have another try at him. \nMARY What's the use. \nHELEN (cajoling) Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses. \nAs she speaks she edges Mary to the door leading outside. \nHELEN A man has only so many no's in him. \nMary smiles at her, shrugs and exits. Helen looks after her. Mary's footsteps are heard going down the steps. Then Helen swings around and going to Elaine's door, opens it. \nINT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM \nMED. SHOT. Elaine is sitting up in bed. There is a small table by the bed and on it is a breakfast tray. Mrs. Wyatt sits by the bed. Elaine looks happy for the first time. Mrs. Wyatt is holding a cup to her lips. Helen enters and closes the door. \nHELEN Look at you, sitting up already. \nCrossing to the bed she takes the cup from Mrs. Wyatt. \nHELEN Let me do this while you get some breakfast. \nMRS. WYATT But I like to do it. \nHELEN You're worn out. \n", "test2_true": "HELEN Now don't argue. You've got two able- bodied girls to help you so take advantage of it. And don't let me catch you touching the dishes. \nShe closes the door behind Mrs. Wyatt and comes back, sits on the edge of the bed and holds the cup to Elaine's lips. \nHELEN Well -- it's going to be good for all of us -- having a nice long rest here. After all -- Sonora will still be there next month. Maybe we can rehearse a new number -- try it out on your folks. \nElaine tries not to show her panic at this suggestion. \nELAINE Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay? \nHELEN He won't take us. (then, hurt) Don't you want us around? \nELAINE Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small -- \nHELEN If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut. \nELAINE It isn't that -- \nHELEN Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here. \nELAINE But I want to stay. \nHELEN Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself. (then, brightly) Maybe that's what got you started in the first place. \nElaine pushes the cup away, sits up straighter. \nELAINE (distraught) I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong. \nHELEN Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did. \nELAINE (sobbing) Stop it -- stop it. \nHELEN (contrite) Darling -- now I've got you all upset. \nElaine buries her head in the pillow. \nELAINE Go away -- please. \nHELEN That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks -- \nElaine sits up and grabs Helen's arm. \nELAINE (fiercely) She mustn't -- don't you let her -- \nHELEN There, there. Don't you upset yourself -- \nELAINE (wildly) If she says anything to them I'll kill her. \nThe door opens and Mrs. Wyatt enters. She hurries over to the bed, pushes Helen aside, and takes the sobbing girl in her arms. \nELAINE (sobbing) I don't want to leave you, ever. \nMrs. Wyatt flares at Helen. \nMRS. WYATT What did you do to her? \nHELEN Nothing. The poor child's worried about Mary -- \nTurning, she goes to the door. \nHELEN I won't let her say anything -- \nShe exits. \nINT. KITCHEN \nMED. SHOT.

SHOT \nCLAY (puzzled) What's the matter? \nHearing his voice, Elaine lifts her head from her mother's shoulder. \nELAINE Don't let them stay here, Mr. Phillips. They'll spoil everything. \nClay looks from one to the other, frowning. Elaine tries to get out of bed. Her mother holds her. \nELAINE (wildly) Take them with you -- Mary's going to talk to dad -- she's going to keep talking and talking to me until maybe I won't want to stay here -- \nMRS. WYATT Please take them. \nCLAY I can't -- \nELAINE You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go -- \nCLAY (sharp) No they won't. \n", "test2_id": 1354, "test3_input": "ANOTHER ANGLE \nClay swims his horse toward Mary who is floundering in the stream. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary. The current sweeps her against a rock. Stunned -- she goes under. \nMED. SHOT \nClay swims his horse to her, reaches down and lifts her up in front of him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay's horse, with the double burden, fights her way out of the stream and scrambles up the bank to stop on level ground. \nMED. CLOSE \nClay and Mary. Clay, his expression anxious, stares down at the stunned Mary. He swings out of the saddle, holding her tenderly to him. The brush with death has made him realize how much she means to him. Gently, he puts her down on the sand, stoops beside her. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay and Mary in f.g. Steve swims his horse across and rides up the bank to dismount near them. \nCLAY Mary -- \nMED. CLOSE - DOWN ANGLE \nMary opens her eyes and sits up \nCLAY (anxiously) Are you all right? \nMary is humiliated, bedraggled and wet, still angry and fighting back tears. \nMARY (sharp) No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock. \nCLAY (nettlod at her tone) I suppose that's my fault. \nMary gets to her feet. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. Steve stands in the b.g. She looks out at the river. \nMARY (wailing) All my clothes -- \nCLAY That's right -- worry about your clothes -- \nANOTHER ANGLE \nto include wagon in river. Clay, suddenly furious, points to the wagon. \nCLAY What about my wagon. Of all the crazy fool things to do. You lose a man's wagon because you're stupid and then yell about your clothes. \nThis is the last straw. Mary turns her back, digs into her stocking and pulls out some bills. She hands them to him. \nMARY For the wagon. \nClay looks at Mary, then down at the money. \nMARY Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid. \nCLAY (furious) There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started. \nHe turns and sees Steve standing scowling at him. He takes the rest of his anger out on Steve. \nCLAY Don't just stand there. Go on back and get the packs on the horses. We've lost all the time we're going to because of a woman. \nClay strides over to his horse and swings into the saddle. Steve stands looking at Mary. \nCLAY Come on. Didn't you hear me? \nAs he plunges his horse into the stream: \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. RIVER \nFULL SHOT - the lower ford. Where the main road crosses the river, it flows gently, with sand banks on either side. Three horsemen appear around a bend in the trail and ride down to the riverbank. They are Lednov, McCall and Peters. Lednov's horse is limping badly. They ride into the river. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe horses swim to shore and flounder up the bank, Lednov's horse last. As the horse starts up the bank Lednov sees something o.s. and reins the horse in. \nMED. SHOT \nFROM Lednov's ANGLE. A piece of clothing floats down the river. Lednov rides down the bank into the water. He reaches down awkwardly and gets the piece of clothing, then turns and rides back up the bank. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe two others have turned and are watching him. He rides up to them, holding out one of Mary's undergarments. \nMCCALL We got company. Female company. \nLEDNOV (looking at the garment) Yeah, we sure have. \nHe turns to scan the river. \nANGLED PAST THEM - AT RIVER \nMary's trunk comes floating by. The three men look at each other, then Lednov turns his horse and starts up the bank of the river. The others follow. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. PEAKS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS \nEXTREME LONG SHOT. The long pine-covered approaches, and the glistening summit; the early snow covering the rocks with a thin layer of white. CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM the heights of the mountains, TO the narrow trail that winds among the trees. Clay passes, and behind him the pack-horses and the romuda. Following the remuda comes Mary. She is dressed in a pair of Steve's pants and wears one of his shirts under her own coat. \n", "test3_true": "Mary, as she swings with the movement of the horse. She is tired. She wears no makeup. But she looks as unaffectedly beautiful as we have ever seen her. \nMED. FULL SHOT \nthe trail. It turns steeply, doubling back, and new Clay is directly above her. He looks down at her, but she disregards his glance. We feel that he might speak, but her cold restraint prevents him. The wind whistles through the trees. The slow plodding noise of the horses becomes more distant. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. UPPER FORD - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT \nMED. FULL SHOT. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride slowly through the brush to where the trail enters the river. Downstream, wedged in the rocks is the wagon. The three men look at the wagon, then turn to look back along the trail. \nLONG SHOT \ntheir ANGLE. Fowler's campfire flickers through the trees. \nMED. CLOSE \nthe three men. They look at each other. Lednov motions in the direction of Fowler's camp. They start back along the trail. \nEXT. MEADOW - NIGHT \nFULL SHOT. The three men ride along the trail toward the camp. Through the trees the campfire flickers. \nEXT. FOWLER'S CAMP - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Fowler is putting the supper dishes up on the shelves beside the fireplace. The camp is cleaner than it was earlier in the day. It is evident that he has gone to great pains to make his visitor comfortable. \nA mirror has been tacked up on a tree, and under it is a wash basin. Fowler's rifle and shotgun are in a rack near the fireplace. Helen's trunk stands open near the lean-to. Helen, wearing a robe, takes some clothing from it, closes the trunk. \nHELEN You can put this out of the way, Jed. It's empty. \nFowler turns and smiles. Helen pushes through the curtains into the lean-to. Fowler puts the last of the dishes on the shelf, crosses to the trunk and moves it over to the side of the lean-to. Turning to go back to the fireplace, he stops. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFowler in the f.g. Lednov, rifle in hand, stands just inside the camp on the meadow side. \nFOWLER (turning slowly) What do you want? \nLednov moves slowly forward to stand near the table. He looks around him. Fowler starts slowly toward the fireplace. \nLEDNOV I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello. \nFOWLER Well, say it. \nTrying to be casual, Fowler moves closer to where the guns are racked. \nLEDNOV What's the matter -- restless? \nFOWLER Yes, people make me restless. \nLEDNOV Even women? \nFOWLER There aren't any women here. \nLEDNOV I suppose that's your wagon in the river. \nFOWLER Some people who went by this way lost it. (nervously) Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on. \nLEDNOV And you're all alone. \nFOWLER Yeah. \nHe has edged closer to the gun rack. Lednov seems unaware that he is near the guns. His interest is centered on the lean-to. He moves to the entrance, stands with his hand on the canvas. \nLEDNOV Suppose I take a look. \nFOWLER Go ahead. \nLednov pulls back the flap. His back is to Fowler, who starts quickly for the tree, only to stop as McCall comes out from behind it. \nMCCALL Looking for something? \nFowler drops his hands to his side. Lednov turns, grins at Fowler, and enters the lean-to. \nINT. LEAN-TO - NIGHT \nThe shelter is dark. Lednov strikes a match and looks around. The place is empty. There is a bunk, made up. On the left hand wall a curtain of gunny sacks covers the clothes hanging there. The match burns down to Lednov's fingers. There is a SOUND of a scuffle outside a blow, and a groan. Lednov drops the match and hurries out. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nLednov comes out of the lean-to. Fowler is sprawled by the table. McCall stands over him, rifle raised. \nLEDNOV Hold it, Mac. \nEXT. BACK OF LEAN-TO - NIGHT \nMED. CLOSE SHOT. Helen stands flattened against a tree. \nLEDNOV'S VOICE Get up. \nCautiously Helen starts moving away. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Fowler pulls himself to his feet. Mac stands near him. \nLEDNOV Come on. Where'd the women go? \nFowler sinks on a bench, his head in his hands. Lednov moves closer. \nLEDNOV When I ask questions, I like to hear answers. \n", "test3_id": 1355}

{"train": "ROUGHSHOD \nWritten by \nHugo Butler & Geoffrey Homes \nStory by \nPeter Viertel \nEXT. DESERT - DAWN \nFULL SHOT. The sun, spinning up from behind the dark rim of eastern hills, is bleaching the cloudless, morning sky. This is volcanic country, barren, desolate, forbidding. There is no sign of life, no sound. Then on a distant hill, a man appears, to be followed by two others. They walk steadily forward. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. NARROW CANYON - DAWN \nMED. SHOT. A dry watercourse threads its way through the cut in the treeless hills. The sun is not high enough as yet to drive night from the canyon. A man appears around a bend; another and still another. They are McCall, Peters and Lednov, clad in prison clothes, hatless, their heads closely cropped. As Lednov's face comes into a closeup, \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. HILL - DAWN \nLONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. A narrow valley lies below. Through it runs a cottonwood-bordered stream. Smoke curls up out of the trees. Horses graze in a small meadow near the creek. From O.O. comes the SOUND of heavy boots crunching across the dry, eroded earth. The three men file past camera to stop in the immediate F.g. and look down into the valley. They exchange glances and start down. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN \nMED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows. A bearded man, Cal Forster, and two young fellows in their late teens squat beside a campfire eating breakfast. O.s. there is the SOUND of movement. Lednov moves cautiously into the scene. He has a revolver in his hand. \nForster turns toward camera and fear comes into his expression. Lednov fires. Forster crumples near the fire. The two boys jump to their feet and reach for rifles. Lednov fires again and again. McCall and Peters come into the scene, both firing revolvers. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN \nMED SHOT - ANGLED ACROSS campfire. On the fire smoulders the prison clothes the convicts had worn. Smoke spirals up. In the B.B. Lednov, Peters and McCall, now wearing the clothes of the three Forsters, saddle the horses. CAMERA PANS AROUND and ANGLES DOWN. The bodies of Forster and his sons, now clad in underwear are sprawled by the fire. Forster's arm lies close to the smouldering clothing. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. CREEK - DAWN \nMED. LONG SHOT. Smoke climbs above the trees. Into the clearing ride the three convicts, to cross it and move westward. They disappear over the hill. A dust cloud marks their passage. CAMERA HOLDS ON the scene and over the shot comes the MAIN TITLE CARD: \nROUGHSHOD \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nLONG SHOT. A buckboard drawn by two horses comes along the road. Graham, a middle-aged rancher, is driving. As the horses trot forward and dust rises above the road, the NEXT TITLE CARD is shown. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. CREEK - DAY \nLONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Graham's buckboard moves down the road toward the clearing, as the TITLE CARDS follow and change. When the buckboard reaches the creek, the LAST TITLE CARD is ended. \nEXT. MEADOW - DAY \nMED. SHOT. Graham drives the horses through the creek and into the meadow. Through the trees the Forster camp can be seen. Graham glances over, then suddenly pulls on the reins. As the horses stop, he twists the reins around the whip stock, grabs his rifle from under the seat, leaps out and hurries forward toward the camp. \nEXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAY \nMED. SHOT. Graham hurries through the trees to stop in horror near the dead men. Then very slowly he moves forward to the smouldering fire. Stooping he lifts Forster's arm away from the fire, then picks up one of the prison coats and looks at it. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nMED. LONG SHOT. The surrounding hills are covered with scrub pinon pine and mesquite. Graham's buckboard, moving slowly up a hill, passes camera, which PANS WITH it. In the bed, covered by a tarp, are the three bodies. The narrow, one-way road climbs easily up the gentle hill. Beyond, a dust cloud rises. As Graham's buckboard nears the crest, a surrey appears and starts down. Graham pulls his team into the bank, trying to make room for the surrey. \nMED. SHOT \nThere are four women in the two-seated surrey, which is heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. Mary Wells, the loveliest of the four, is driving. She is more poised, more self-assured than the others. Her clothes, though a trifle showy, are attractive. She wears a large spectacular hat. Helen Carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside her. In the seat behind are Marcia Paine, placid, younger looking than her years, and Elaine Ross, a striking blonde with a pale haunted face. Elaine is obviously ill. Mary is riding the brake and holding the team back. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING PAST Graham. \nGRAHAM (annoyed) What in thunderation -- (calling) Wait a minute -- stop -- \nHe jerks on the reins and tries to make room for the surrey. A steep bank is on camera left. On camera right, the road drops off into a gulley. As the surrey comes up Mary reins the team in. The women all look frightened. Graham, trying to force his team to pull the vehicle up the bank, is too occupied to recognize the women at once. Having made just enough room for the surrey, he turns and looks at the women. \nGRAHAM All right -- (then surprised) What are you girls doin' way out here? \nMary looks ahead at the narrow road and the canyon to her left. \nMARY Until you came along we were going to Sonora. \nGRAHAM What do you know about that. Did you sell your place? \nMARY (dryly) Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. (pointing) Can I make it? \nGRAHAM Depends on how good you drive. \nHELEN She's a little out of practice. \nGraham jumps over the wheel. \nMED. CLOSE ON SURREY \nGraham reaches the surrey. \nSAM You want to get out of here before noon, maybe you should lend me a hand. \nClay, the cigarette dangling from his lips, moves over to the table, picks up a hammer and helps Sam hammer the rim on the wheel. Steve stands watching. \nCLAY Rate you're goin', we'll be here until winter. \nTogether they lift the wheel and plunge it into the tub of water. Steam rises to fill the blackened shed. \nSAM (amiably grumbling) Account of you, I miss out on the only excitement Aspen's had for months. \nCLAY You're too old to watch such goin's on. \nSTEVE And I'm too young. \nClay and Sam spin the wheel in the tub. \nCLAY That's right. \nSTEVE I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave. \nSAM I don't either -- when people are that good-lookin'. Maybe that's why -- they were too good-lookin'. (philosophically) But there'll be others along to take their place after a while when this quiets down. And everything will be fine until some busybody starts stirring up trouble. \nCLAY (mildly) Don't you ever run down? \nSAM (to Steve) Some people just have to run other people's lives. Now take Clay. You want to amble up the street and see the fun and what does he say? \nCLAY (good-natured) You stick to your blacksmithin' and let me take care of Steve. \nFrom O.s. comes the SOUND of the approaching buckboard and crowd. Steve hears the noise and moves to the front of the shed. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY \nMED. FULL SHOT - Steve's angle. Graham pulls his buckboard up, jumps out and hurries into the sheriff's office. Some kids run up to stand on the porch chattering excitedly. Members of the crowd straggle up. \nINT. BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY \nANGLED PAST Steve. Clay comes up to stand beside Steve. Sam joins them. Steve looks up at Clay hopefully. \nCLAY We'll both take a look. Anything's better than listenin' to Sam. (to Sam) Don't forget to shoe the mule. \nClay and Steve exit. Sam looks after them, shrugs disgustedly and goes back to the wheel. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY \nMED. SHOT - featuring buckboard. The crowd around the wagon stands in shocked silence looking at the bodies under the tarp. Clay and steve come up, glance in the buckboard and then at each other. Clay speaks to a man near him. \nCLAY Who are they? \nMAN Don't know. Graham brought 'em in. \nThe sheriff calls from O.s. \nGARDNER'S VOICE Clay, come up here a minute. \nANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING PORCH \nSheriff Gardner, who has seen Clay through the window, comes out of his office on to the porch followed by Jeb Graham and a young deputy. In his hand Gardner holds the burned prison jacket. Clay goes up the steps to the porch. Steve follows to the foot of the steps to stand watching. The crowd around the wagon gives its attention to the men on the porch. \nMED. SHOT \nGardner is neatly dressed with his star hidden under his coat. His deputy wears jeans, shirt, and leather jacket. \nCLAY Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner. \nGARDNER Graham's got something to tell you might interest you. \nGRAHAM (motioning toward wagon) Cal Forster and his sons. Somebody killed 'em. \nHe pauses to let that sink in. \nGRAHAM You know that cottonwood grove on Alder Crick? They must have been eatin' breakfast the way it looked, sittin' by the fire eatin' breakfast and when I got there nothin' but them lyin' dead in their underdrawers. No horses or guns or grub. \nCLAY (shocked) Forster never did anyone any harm. (puzzled) But what's that got to do with me? I came into town from the south. \nGardner holds out the burned jacket. \nGARDNER This was smoulderin' on the fire. \nClay moves over to glance down at the jacket. \nCLAY I still don't see. \nFrom his pocket, Gardner takes several communications, thumbs through them and passes one over. It is a telegram, of the period. \nGARDNER I got it day before yesterday. \nClay reads it. \nINSERT TELEGRAM OF THE PERIOD: \nSHERIFF GARDNER: ASPEN, NEV. BE ADVISED OF ESCAPE OF LEDNOV, PETERS AND McCALL CONVICTED MURDERERS SERVING LIFE TERMS. BELIEVED HEADED FOR CALIFORNIA. \nL.B. GROVE, WARDEN STATE PENITENTIARY NORTON, NEV. \nBACK TO SCENE. Clay hands the telegram back. \nGARDNER Now are you interested? \nClay nods. \nGARDNER You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours. \nCLAY Maybe he did. \nMED. CLOSE - DOWN ANGLE \nCLAY Let's say this is the penitentiary. \nHe reaches down into one of the barrels in front of the counter. The barrels are filled with beans, nails, dried apples, hardtack, etc. Clay takes a handful of beans and makes a trail ending in a little pile. \nCLAY Here's Alder Crick. \nHe puts another box of shells on the other side of the counter. \nCLAY And here we are in Aspen. \nHe runs a trail of beans away from \"Aspen\" toward the end of the counter. He runs another trail from \"Alder Crick\" to cross the Aspen trail. He puts another box of shells on the far end of the counter. \nCLAY That's Sonora. \nHe reaches down without looking and brings up a hardtack. \nCLAY motioning) Lednov gets out of jail and comes along here to Alder Crick. Then goes along here toward the Sonora road. \nClay drops the hardtack back from where the bean trails cross. \nCLAY That's Lednov! (tracing) We come along here. \nSTEVE (pointing) And meet him there. \nCLAY Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up. \nHe holds out his hand and Hayes hands him his change. \nCLAY So let's go. \nSteve tucks his gun under his arm. As he passes the counter, he picks up the hardtack and starts eating it. \nEXT. GENERAL STORE \nMED. SHOT - ANGLED TOWARD Sheriff's office. Up the street men are gathering around the sheriff's office. Some are mounted. Some are tightening their cinches. Clay and Steve come out of the store to look up the street. Steve munches the hardtack. \nSTEVE (motioning) Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov. \nCLAY Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me. \nSTEVE Why? \nCLAY He doesn't like me. What you eatin'? \nSTEVE Lednov. \nHe glances at the remaining piece of hardtack and then pitches it away. \nSTEVE I don't like him. \nClay laughs. As they start up the street, the sheriff mounts his horse and, followed by his men, rides forward. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT. A woman's hat lies on the rocky earth. It is a big, elaborate affair. O.s. there is the SOUND of hoofbeats, the SQUEAL of a wagon brake and the JANGLE of harness. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Clay's wagon coming down a very steep hill. Steve is driving, holding tightly to the reins and riding the brake. Seeing the hat, he yells to Clay. \nSTEVE Another one, Clay. \nClay rides over and, swinging down, picks it up. \nMED. SHOT \nANGLED DOWN hill. The road twists tortuously down. Near the bottom it swings sharply at right angles into a dry wash. The banks shut out further view of the road. Near where the road turns a trunk lies at the side. It has broken open and some of the contents are spilled out in the dust. Clay rides to it, reins in his horse and looks down. Steve, with difficulty, pulls the mules to a stop alongside. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nfeaturing trunk and wagon. Clay swings out of his saddle, starts tossing the clothes back in the trunk. Steve jumps down. \nSTEVE They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store. \nCLAY Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear. \nSteve holds up a petticoat close to his body and grins. \nSTEVE I'd look good doin' the ploughin' in this. \nClay takes it from him, puts it in the trunk and shuts the lid. Steve helps him hoist the trunk into the wagon bed. Steve gets back in the seat. Just as Clay is about to mount, he stops and picks up a small folding daguerrotype case delicately ornamented. He lifts his eyebrow, tucks the case into his pocket, then mounts and starts ahead around the bend. \nMED. LONG SHOT \nClay's ANGLE. Ahead, off the road in the wash is the surrey that passed Graham's buckboard at the fork. Clay spurs his horse forward. \nMED. SHOT \non surrey. The back wheel is broken and the bed of the surrey rests on the ground. The horses have been taken from the traces and stand dejectedly in the hot sun. A blanket is spread in the scant shade thrown by the surrey. On it lies Elaine and, sitting beside her, is Marcia. A damp cloth is spread across Elaine's forehead. A water bag hangs from the surrey. Elaine's head is pillowed on a dainty satin cushion. Helen and Mary have risen at Clay's approach and now stand by the road. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay gallops forward to pull up near the surrey. In the b.g. Steve drives the wagon around the bend. Clay dismounts. \nMED. GROUP SHOT \nClay drops his reins and hurries up. \nCLAY Anybody hurt? \nMARY No. We came down the hill a little fast and... (rueful) ...the wheel broke. (hopefully) Can you fix it for us? \nClay bends over Elaine. \nCLAY What's the matter with her? \nMARY (dryly) Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it? \nAs Clay turns from Elaine, Marcia joins the other two, their attention on Clay and the surrey. Left alone, Elaine is suddenly alert and no longer sick. She glances around, then unobserved slides out from under the shade of the surrey. \nANOTHER ANGLE \non rear of surrey. In the B.g. Steve pulls the wagon to a stop, jumps off, and comes running over. Elaine stands for a moment, searching the ground with her eyes. \nSTEVE Jiminy. You sure were lucky, just bustin' a wheel. \nHelen moves toward Clay. She smiles without humor. With this new diversion, Elaine, still unnoticed, starts away -- back toward where they dropped the trunk. \nHELEN (rubbing thigh) You think that's all we busted -- You should see... \nMARY (sees Elaine) Now where's she goin'? -- \nELAINE (half-turns without stopping) I -- lost something. \nCLAY It wouldn't happen to be this... \nElaine stops now and turns as Clay takes the folding daguerrotype case from his pocket. Elaine, her eyes wide and frightened, starts back as Mary takes the case from Clay and opens it. \nMARY Who's the old folks? \nELAINE (frantic) Give it to me! \nShe jerks the case from Mary's hands, snaps it shut, and stands staring at Mary with a strange mixture of fright, anger and hysteria. Mary glances around as if to say what- did-I-do? To cover the embarrassed silence, Clay kicks the unbroken back wheel. The spokes rattle. \nCLAY This must have been in the family a long time. \nElaine glances at him as though he had insulted her, turns and starts toward the blanket again. \nMARY (dryly) It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells. \nShe looks at him to see if the name registers. At the surrey side, Elaine is abruptly weak again. She leans against it for support. Mareia moves to her as she slides back down on the blanket, clutching the case. \nMARY And this is Helen Carter. \nCLAY I'm Clay Phillips. (motioning) My brother Steve. \nSteve tugs at his battered hat. \nSTEVE (shy) Pleased to meet you, ma'am. (brightly) We found your trunk. Were you doin' the drivin'? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMary and Helen come around the end of the surrey to where Elaine lies. Mary bends beside the sick girl and lifts the cloth from the girl's forehead. \nMARY Come on, Honeybunch. We're changing trains. \nThe sick girl sits up. She looks around her dully. \nMARY A nice, kind wrangler is letting us ride in his wagon... \nAssisted by Mary, Elaine gets to her feet. Mary puts her arm around her. \nMARY ...as far as the first ranch. From then on -- \nElaine stops. She looks fearfully up at Helen. \nELAINE What ranch? \nMARY What's the difference? \nShe tries to lead the girl toward the wagon. \nELAINE (fierce) Ask him what ranch -- \nMARY There's plenty of time for that. (sharp) Come on, now. You've got to lie down out of this sun. Stop worrying. I'll find out what ranch after a while. \nShe pulls the girl with her toward the wagon. \nMED. SHOT \non wagon. Clay, in the wagon bed, is stowing his gear in the back. Mary, supporting Elaine, reaches the wagon. Seeing the girls, Clay reaches down and gently lifts Elaine up. Mary climbs in beside him. \nMED. CLOSE \nwagon bed. Clay has unrolled a bedroll under the seat where there is a little shade. \nCLAY (kind) Stretch out under the seat, Miss. \nELAINE (desperate) Which ranch? \nCLAY How's that? \nMARY She's worried about where you're taking us. \nAs she speaks, Mary helps the girl down under the seat, then rises to face Clay. \nMARY (dryly) So am I. \nCLAY It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt. \nCLOSE SHOT \nElaine as she hears the name. She is shocked. \nCLAY'S VOICE They'll take you in until you can make other arrangements. \nTWO SHOT \nCLAY Get your rifle. \nSteve jumps up and hurries to the wagon. Clay continues kicking dirt over the fire. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT) \nLONG SHOT - ANGLES PAST horseman. The horseman, who has been approaching from the east, tops a rise and looks off at the camp. He is a shadowy figure in the palo dark. For a moment, as the fire still blazes, figures are visible in the camp. Then the fire goes out. The horseman dismounts, pulling his rifle from his scabbard. Moving to his horse's head he puts a hand on the animal's nostrils. He looks toward the camp for a moment then starts cautiously along the road. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT) \nMED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows PAST Clay and Steve. The brothers have taken up a post overlooking the road. The horseman walks cautiously toward them. He stops, listening. Then he drops his reins and comes forward stealthily. The horse stands. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nClay and Steve. Steve, finger on trigger gives Clay a questioning glance. Clay shakes his head. \nCLAY (calling) Hold it. \nANOTHER ANGLE \non road. The man, now seen clearly for the first time, stops. He is Jim Clayton, a man in his twenties, chunky, round-faced, stolid and not too imaginative. He wears the well-worn jeans and blue shirt of the farmer. Clay and Steve come out of the willows toward him. Both have their rifles ready. \nCLAY Drop your gun. \nClayton hesitates, then lets his rifle butt drop to the road. \nCLAYTON (mildly) Drop yours. I'm gunshy. \nCLAY Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp. \nCLAYTON A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone. \nClay and Steve lower their rifles. \nCLAYTON I found their surrey -- \nCLAY So did I. They were in it. \nCLAYTON She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around. \nClay moves closer and extends his hand. They shake. \nCLAY (very cordial) I'm glad you came along. (introducing) My brother, Steve. I'm Phillips. \nSteve shakes Jim's hand. \nCLAY I gave the girls a lift. Didn't know what else to do with them. Get your horse and come on. \nClayton turns back toward his horse. Clay and Steve wait for him. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT) \nMED. SHOT - ANGLED BACK ALONG the trail. Mary and Helen, tense and worried, stand at the edge of the camp, looking off. Marcia is with Elaine under the wagon. From o.s. comes the SOUND of men's voices. Clay, Steve and Clayton, leading his horse, come into view. \nCLOSE SHOT ON WAGON \nMarcia kneeling on the tarp by Elaine, is staring ahead. Suddenly her face lights up. She springs to her feet. \nMARCIA'S ANGLE \nClay, Steve and Jim are now close to Mary. \nCLAY (genial) Here's a man says he's looking for you girls. \nCLAYTON Hello, Miss Wells. \nHearing his voice, Marcia runs toward them. \nGROUP SHOT \nMarcia throws herself into Jim's arms. \nMARCIA Jim. \nMED. CLOSE \nClayton kisses her. \nCLAYTON I was roundin' up some stock. That's why I didn't come sooner. \nMarcia hugs him. In the B.g. Clay goes over to the fire, kicks the dirt off the embers and piles on wood. The fire flares up. \nCLAYTON What do you mean running off without a word. \nTWO SHOT \nMary and Helen. \nMARCIA'S VOICE I didn't know who to tell, it all happened so sudden, those people comin' and throwin' us out on the street. \nJIM'S VOICE Don't you think about it, darlin'. Don't you think about anythin' but us. \nHELEN (quietly) Looks like we lose a good piano player. \nCAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as Marcia and Jim come forward. The fire now burns briskly. Clay rejoins the group. \nMARCIA (happily) Jim came after me, Mary. \nMARY (dryly) I see he did. \nHELEN With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other. \nMARY (sharp) Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done. \nSTEVE Since I can remember, Ma'am. \nMARY But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling? \nCLOSE SHOT \nClay. He listens, perturbed. \nMED. SHOT \nMary and Steve. \nSTEVE It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then -- \nMARY Don't you even know your letters? \nCLOSE SHOT \nClay. He winces at! \nSTEVE'S VOICE No, Ma'am. \nMED. SHOT \nMary, Steve and Clay. Behind them, Clay rises and comes down nearer the fire. \nMARY Would you like to learn them? \nSTEVE I sure would. \nMARY Maybe I could start you out. \nSTEVE That'd be swell. (shyly) You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be. \nShe gives him a quick look of inquiry. \nSTEVE You're so nice. \nMARY Did someone say I wasn't nice? \nSTEVE Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street. \nCLAY (interrupting) Time to go to bed, Steve. \nSteve looks up, then rises reluctantly. \nSTEVE Good night, Miss Wells. \nMARY Good night, Steve. \nSteve exits. Mary looks after him, then up at Clay. \nMARY (soft) There's a nice boy. \nCLAY Yeah. \nMARY (sharp) That why you always took him on the other side of the street? \nClay kicks loose embers into the fire. \nMARY (sharper) Maybe I don't make the grade in some ways, but I know enough to teach a kid his letters. \nClay turns from the fire to stand above her. \nCLAY (quiet) He doesn't know his letters, no -- but he knows the names of animals... he knows what roots to eat when you're clear out of food... He knows the difference between a possum and a coon just by lookin' at the tracks... more than most trappers know... and he can tell whether she'll rain or shine tomorrow by smelling the air tonight. There's a lot of things he doesn't know, I hope he'll never learn. \nHe pauses, looking down. \nMARY Like what? \nCLAY (turning away) Like sticking his nose into other people's business. \nClay moves out of the circle of firelight to stop and pick up his rifle, tarp and blanket, then climbs the knoll. Mary stares into the fire, then rising she starts toward the wagon. \nEXT. KNOLL - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Clay reaches the top of the knoll and stands looking off. Below him the campfire burns low. Mary reaches the wagon. \nEXT. WAGON - MOONLIGHT - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT ANGLED PAST Mary TOWARD Clay. Mary stops, looking up. A match flares as Clay lights a cigarette. O.s. there is the SOUND of the bell mare's bell, the SOUND of horses moving restlessly. Mary turns, looks under the wagon. \nMED. CLOSE DOWN ANGLE \nElaine is gone. Helen is asleep. Mary drops to her knees on the tarp and shakes Helen in wakefulness. \nMARY Where's Elaine? \nHelen sits up and looks over at Elaine's side of the bed. \nHELEN She was here a while ago. \nMary straightens, moves down past the wagon, CAMERA PANNING WITH her. She calls softly. \nMARY (softly) Elaine! \nMED. CLOSE \nClay. He looks down toward the wagon as Mary calls Elaine's name again, this time louder. \nMARY'S VOICE Elaine. (then) Clay -- Elaine's gone. \nClay frowns, pitches his cigarette away and starts down toward the wagon. \nHe stops and looks off. Faintly O.s. is heard the SOUND of hoofbeats. \nSTEVE That oughta be -- (then sharp) Down. \nHe shoves the girl down. \nLONG SHOT \ntheir ANGLE. Over a hill comes a horseman to be followed by another and then a third. \nCLOSE SHOT \nSteve and Elaine. \nSTEVE Lednov -- \nExcitedly he swings the rifle to his shoulder and fires. \nEXT.

Faintly o.s. another shot echoes across the hills, then another and another. Clay spurs his horse and gallops off. \nEXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT \nClay gallops up the hill to rein his horse in suddenly. \nMED. LONG SHOT \nhis ANGLE. Riding toward him are several horsemen. The horses move at a walk. One carries a double burden. Steve walks along behind. Clay spurs his horse and rides down toward them. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay, in the B.g., comes down the hill. The horsemen, seven of them, with Sheriff Gardner in the lead, followed by a deputy, carrying Elaine in front of him, file past camera. Steve, hands in his pockets, walks dejectedly in the dust cloud kicked up by the horses. \nMED. SHOT \nfeaturing Clay and Gardner. Clay reins in his horse beside Gardner, who also stops. The others rein in. Steve stops a short distance away. \nGARDNER Want to take her off our hands? \nClay rides closer. The deputy rides forward and lifts Elaine into his arms. Clay settles her in front of him. \nCLAY Who shot who? \nGARDNER Nobody. The light was bad. \nThere are two rifles in his saddle holster. He pulls Steve's out, hands it over. \nGARDNER Steve's! \nClay shoves it in his saddle holster. \nGARDNER What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night. \nCLAY I wouldn't know. Did you ask her? \nGARDNER All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'. \nCLAY Look of things, she doesn't. \nGARDNER Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her -- (motioning to Steve) And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov. \nHe wheels his horse and rides off, followed by the others Clay watches him go. Reluctantly Steve moves slowly up to stand near Clay. \nSTEVE There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head. \nCLAY (dryly) How'd you happen to miss? \nSTEVE They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim. \nCLAY Good thing you didn't. \nHe reins his horse around. \nSTEVE Clay -- \nClay looks back. \nSTEVE A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while. \nCLAY That's right, Steve. \nSTEVE Can I have my gun back? \nCLAY Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size. \nFADE OUT \nEXT. TRAIL - DAY FADE IN \nEXTREME LONG SHOT. West are the Sierras and clouds are piled in untidy heaps on the range. The dusty trail runs through rolling country. Pinon pine and brush clothe the slopes. The wagon and horses are the moving center of a white cloud of dust. \nFULL SHOT \nClay's party. Clay rides in the lead. The wagon follows and Steve is riding beside the wagon. Behind is the remuda, and the horses are straying off the road in search of grass. \nMED. SHOT \nwagon - (MOVING). Featuring Steve and Mary. Elaine lies under the seat and Helen sits beside her. Steve is reciting the alphabet to a simple melody usually sung by children of six or seven. \nSTEVE (stumbles embarrassedly) Gee, I can't. \nMARY Why not? You went farther than that last time. \nrain -- the caravan. Clay leads it through a rain that has filled the ruts in the trail, soaked the horses to glistening black -- and obscures all view of the country through which they are passing. SOUND of rain falling is loud. Clay and Steve both wear slickers, gleaming from their shoulders to the rumps of their horses. Mary, a tarp around her shoulders, drives. Elaine and Helen huddle under a tarpaulin in the wagon bed. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nrain -- DOWN ANGLE -- wagon moving. Elaine sits up and, in her delirium, throws off the tarp. Helen tries to pull her down. \nHELEN (crying out) Elaine -- stop it -- \nCLOSE SHOT \nrain -- Clay. He wheels his horse at the SOUND of Helen's voice and rides back through the rain toward the wagon. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nrain -- wagon. Mary pulls on the reins and the mules stop. Twisting them around the whip-stock, she swings back into the wagon bed. She looks up at Clay. \nMARY She should be in bed where it's dry. \nIn her anxiety, her tone is accusing. Clay drops the reins, climbs into the wagon and bends down beside Elaine. He puts his hand on her forehead. \nMED. CLOSE \nrain - DOWN ANGLE - featuring Clay and Mary. \nCLAY (dryly) Yes, Ma'am, she should... \nHe starts fixing the tarp so it gives more protection to the sick girl. \nCLAY But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away. \nMARY Can we get a doctor at that ranch? \nCLAY (straightening) No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nrain. Clay vaults out of the wagon and mounts his horse. Mary rises and climbs back into the seat. She lashes the mules with the reins. The wagon jolts forward. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nrain - ANGLED ACROSS seat - (MOVING). Clay rides alongside. Then, without a word, he strips off his slicker, tosses it on the seat and rides off. Mary looks after him, then at the slicker. She hesitates, not wanting to take favors from him. Then she pulls the slicker around her. Taking the whip, she hits the mules. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS and CAMERA HOLDS. The team breaks into a trot. The cavalcade moves away from camera through drenching rain. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. WYATT RANCH - DAY \nLONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH gate in barbed wire fence. The ranch is nestled in a valley at the base of the Sierras. Green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white- washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around the house, which stands in a clump of trees. The wind has pushed the clouds back over the hills, but far off there is still thunder. The gate in front f.g. is of barbed wire. It is closed. On the fence post a board is tacked. Neatly lettered on the board is the name: \nED WYATT \nFrom o.s. comes the SOUND of horses moving restlessly and the creaking of saddle leather, as a man swings out of the saddle. Footsteps approach. A man's head and shoulders, back to camera, comes into scene. He unloops the strand of bailing wire and lets the gate fall open, then turns and we see his face. He is Lednov. His cheek and jowls have a dark growth of beard. He wears a black leather jacket and a wrangler's grey hat. The clothes Forster was wearing. As he moves back to his horse, CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS AROUND. \nHis companions, McCall and Peters, also wear black leather jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. They are mounted on matched roans. The horses are winded, lathered and dirty. It is obvious they have ridden hard. Lednov strides forward and as he reaches for the reins the horse shies away. Brutally he jerks on the reins. The horse rears. He snatches his hat from his head and whacks the horse across the nose. McCall rides over and grabs the reins. Lednov scrambles into the saddle. \nMED. SHOT \nANGLED TOWARD gate. Lednov rides forward through the gate. His horse is limping badly. The others follow. They do not stop to put the gate back up. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. TRAIL - DAY \nLONG SHOT. Clay's cavalcade moves forward along the trail. There are cloud patches overhead and faintly in the back country thunder rumbles. The mules pull the jolting wagons forward in a slow trot. Clay rides ahead. Steve and the remuda follow. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. WYATT RANCH - DAY \nFULL SHOT. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride into the yard and up to the horses' trough. The horses plunge their muzzles deep into the trough. As the men dismount, Wyatt, a sinewy little man, hurries from the direction of the barn. \nMED. SHOT \nat horse trough. Wyatt, smiling his pleasure, comes up as the three men dismount. \nWYATT (happily) My name's Wyatt. Certainly glad you boys dropped in. \nHe extends his hand to Lednov. Lednov ignores it. The three men are looking around them. Two work horses, fat and elderly, amble across the corral to nuzzle the roans through the fence. \nLEDNOV Those the only horses you got? \nWyatt is a little taken aback by Lednov's manner. \nWYATT Why, yes. They're all I need... \nLEDNOV Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him. \nWyatt frowns up at Lednov, angered by the order. \nLEDNOV Go on, we haven't got all day. \nMcCall and Peters move closer to Wyatt, who glances around worriedly. Realizing he better do as he's told, he goes to the roan and rubs his ears. \nWYATT Whoa, boy. Let's have a look. \nBending, he lifts the horse's hoof. Lednov, McCall and Peters watch him. He drops the hoof, straightens. \nWYATT He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him. \nLEDNOV Put on another one. \nWYATT That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like. \nLEDNOV Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told. \nSTEVE'S VOICE Yo -- \nMED. FULL SHOT \nThe wagon reaches the crest of the hill. Mary hits the mules with the reins. The mules break into a trot. Behind, the remuda comes into view. Clay sits his horse by the side of the trail and watches. \nEXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Mrs. Wyatt stands by the stove, watching the three men at the table. Wyatt sits in a chair by the stove. \nMCCALL I'll have some more of that coffee. \nLednov pushes his chair back and rises. \nLEDNOV We got to get movin'. \nMCCALL What for? \nLEDNOV Because there's a man I want to see. \nMCCALL He can wait. Let's stay here until morning. \nWyatt and his wife exchange frightened glances. That's the last thing they want. \nLEDNOV (rising) I said let's go. \nMCCALL (protesting) One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it. \nLEDNOV (fierce) I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him. \nWith the fingers of his right hand he automatically rubs his shoulder just above the heart. \nLEDNOV He gave me something once so I wouldn't forget. \nPETERS (rising) He says go, we go. \nGrudgingly, McCall gives in. They exit. Wyatt stares after them raging at his impotence. \nWYATT If they'd only left me a gun, I'd fix 'em. \nMRS. WYATT Hush, Ed. Hush. They might come back. \nEXT. CORRAL - NIGHT \nMED. FULL SHOT. The three men mount their horse, dig their spurs in and ride away. As they ride toward the gate, Wyatt comes out on the steps. \nEXT. TRAIL - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT. Here the trail passes through a narrow draw, then climbs a small rise which overlooks the gate. Clay's caravan jogs along the trail. \nEXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. The caravan climbs toward camera. CAMERA PANS AROUND to SHOOT DOWN TOWARD the Wyatt ranch. Through the gate ride Lednov, McCall and Peters. They stop for a moment then turn right and trot along the fence line. As they disappear, the SOUND of the caravan's approach is heard o.s. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. WYATT RANCH - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT) \nMED. FULL SHOT. Clay gallops into the yard and swings out of the saddle. The farmhouse is dark. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nANGLED THROUGH window, PAST Wyatt. Clay opens the gate and hurries up the steps and across the porch. \nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Clay raps on the door. \nCLAY Mr. Wyatt. \nWYATT'S VOICE Who is it? \nCLAY Clay Phillips. \nThe door opens. Wyatt comes out. He pumps Clay's hand. \nWYATT (calling) You can light the lamp. (to Clay) I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back. \nCLAY Three men on matched roans? \nIn the kitchen a match flares as Mrs. Wyatt lights the lamp. \nWYATT Yeah, how did you know? \nCLAY The whole state's lookin' for 'em. (dryly) And they're lookin' for me. \nMrs. Wyatt comes out to stand in the doorway. She shakes Clay's hand. \nMRS. WYATT You don't know how good it is to see you. \nCLAY Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for. \nHe turns and motions off. \nLONG SHOT \nANOTHER ANGLE. Clay, Wyatt and Mrs. Wyatt in f.g. The wagon is coming toward the yard followed by the remuda. \nCLAY I picked up some women on the road. \nTHREE SHOT \nClay, Mrs. Wyatt and Wyatt. O.s. the wagon and horses can he heard. \nTWO SHOT \nClay and Wyatt. Clay takes the makings from his pocket, rolls a cigarette, lights it. \nCLAY I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was. \nWYATT (quiet) All right, you didn't know. \nCLAY I can't take her with me. \nWYATT Nobody asked you to. \nO.s. Steve whistles the tune of the A B C song as he comes out of the barn. \nWYATT Just get those two out of here. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSteve approaches from the barn. \nCLAY You're not bein' quite fair. \nWYATT What's there to be fair about? \nTWO SHOT \nClay and Wyatt. Clay takes the making from his pocket, rolls a cigarette, lights it. \nCLAY I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter. \nWYATT (quiet) All right, you didn't know. \nCLAY I can't take her with me. \nWYATT Nobody asked you to. \nO.s. Steve whistles the tune of the A B C song as he comes out of the barn. \nWYATT Just get these two out of here. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSteve approaches from the barn. \nCLAY You're not bein' quite fair. \nWYATT What's there to be fair about? \nSteve comes up. \nSTEVE Hello, Mr. Wyatt. \nHe starts whistling again as he continues toward the wagon. \nMED. SHOT \nwagon. Steve picks up a couple of valises and some blankets and heads for the house, still whistling. In the b.g. can be heard the mutter of voices as Clay and Wyatt talk. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHelen is sitting at the table, eating a piece of bread and drinking coffee. Mary stands at the window. Steve is heard coming up the steps and across the porch. He pushes the door open and enters. \nSTEVE (cheerfully) Where do I put your things? \nMary turns from the window. \nMARY Back in the wagon. \nSteve stands with his arms full, looking at Mary. \nSTEVE Aren't we stayin'? \nMARY No. We're not stayin' -- \nShe crosses to him and smiles wryly. \nMARY Everything's all mixed up, so don't ask questions. \nSteve hesitates. \nMARY (soft) Go on, Steve. \nSteve exits. \nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT \nMED. CLOSE. Steve stops on the porch. He is puzzled, worried. He glances back then over toward the fence where Wyatt and Clay are talking. He shrugs and starts off toward the wagon. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Mary crosses to the stove. \nHELEN Sit down and eat, why don't you? \nMary lifts the stove lid and puts a stick in the firebox. \nHELEN It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of. \nMARY That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this -- \nHELEN Quit worryin' about Elaine. \nShe motions to the bedroom door. \nStraightening, she crosses the porch to pause momentarily close to Clay. \nMARY (softly) I hope you find her -- because, like I said, you've earned your dream. Goodnight. \nShe enters the house. Clay looks after her, smiling faintly. He knows she is up to something but not what. \nINT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Save for the moonlight coming through the window, the room is dark. Mary enters softly, throws off her robe and slips into bed beside Helen. \nMED. CLOSE \non bed. Moonlight falls across the bed. Mary pulls the covers up. Helen turns her head. \nHELEN Did you make it interesting? \nMary snuggles down on the pillow. \nMARY I tried my best, but these things take time. \nHELEN And we're running out of that. \nMARY There's still tomorrow morning. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nMED. LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH window PAST Mary. The early morning sun fills the yard. Steve is in the corral harnessing the mules. Clay and Wyatt are taking Mary's and Helen's trunks out of the wagon. \nHELEN'S VOICE Those trunks look like ours. \nMary, who was in profile, turns. \nMARY They are. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHelen is seated at the table. Mary stands with her back to the window near the sink. \nHELEN How long do you think we'll have to stay here? \nMARY Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden. \nHELEN We don't want to go there. \nMARY No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora. \nHELEN Clay could save us an awful lot of time. \nMARY He certainly could. About a month. \nHELEN What are you waiting for? Do something. \nMary comes over to stand by the table. Her expression is thoughtful. \nHELEN (sharp) You're not giving up? \nMARY How many ways can a man say no. \nHelen rises. Her manner is determined. \nHELEN (crosses to door) Maybe I better start working on him. \nMARY You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least... \nCLOSE SHOT \nas she stops, apparently inspired by Mary's last remark. She looks out into the yard where Clay is working on the wagon. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING TOWARD Elaine's bedroom door. Helen crosses to Mary. \nHELEN (sweetly) If you can't bring him around, nobody can. \nShe puts her arm around Mary's shoulder. \nHELEN Go on. Have another try at him. \nMARY What's the use. \nHELEN (cajoling) Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses. \nAs she speaks she edges Mary to the door leading outside. \nHELEN A man has only so many no's in him. \nMary smiles at her, shrugs and exits. Helen looks after her. Mary's footsteps are heard going down the steps. Then Helen swings around and going to Elaine's door, opens it. \nINT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM \nMED. SHOT. Elaine is sitting up in bed. There is a small table by the bed and on it is a breakfast tray. Mrs. Wyatt sits by the bed. Elaine looks happy for the first time. Mrs. Wyatt is holding a cup to her lips. Helen enters and closes the door. \nHELEN Look at you, sitting up already. \nCrossing to the bed she takes the cup from Mrs. Wyatt. \nHELEN Let me do this while you get some breakfast. \nMRS. WYATT But I like to do it. \nHELEN You're worn out. \nTurning, he exits. Mrs. Wyatt holds Elaine close. \nEXT. PORCH \nMED. SHOT. Helen stands on the porch in the sunlight. She glances back. Clay, his expression hard and angry comes out. He doesn't look at Helen but stalks down the steps toward the wagon. \nMED. SHOT ON WAGON \nSTEVE What comes after Z? \nMARY That's the end of the line. \nSTEVE (happily) Then I know my alphabet. \nMARY From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay comes toward the wagon. Helen stands on the porch. \nSTEVE And that's tough, isn't it? \nMARY Without someone to teach you, it's tough. \nClay appears behind her. Mary turns and smiles. \nMARY He knows his alphabet. \nCLAY That's fine. \nSTEVE I'll bet I'd be reading in a week if -- \nHe catches Clay's glance and his face falls. \nMARY Maybe Clay will take up where I left off. \nSteve gets some courage. He comes over to his brother and faces him. \nSTEVE I don't think it's fair -- \nHe pauses; Clay waits. \nSTEVE Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody. \nCLAY Finished, son? \nSTEVE (weakly) There's only two of them now. \nClay moves past them toward the corral. Mary looks after him, then turning, motions to Helen. Helen starts toward the wagon. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay's horse stands saddled at the fence. He vaults into the saddle, turns the horse. \nCLAY I'll round up the horses. Throw that junk in the wagon. \nHe rides off. Steve, delighted, runs to start loading the girls' things. Helen hurries into the scene. \nMED. CLOSE \nMary and Helen. Mary smiles at Helen. \nMARY (happily) You were right -- a man has only so many no's in him. But he had me worried -- that last one sounded so final. \nHelen nods, looking at Mary as though in admiration. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. WYATT RANCH \nLONG SHOT - the wagon, followed by the remuda and with Clay riding ahead moves slowly up the canyon back of the ranch. \nFADE OUT \nEXT. FOREST TRAIL - DAY FADE IN \nLONG SHOT - ANGLED WEST. The forest is fairly open, yellow pine, lodgepole and fir. To the West can be seen the bald red granite domes of the higher range. O.s. there is the SOUND of the cavalcade approaching. CAMERA PANS AROUND and ANGLES PAST. Toward camera, comes the cavalcade, climbing slowly. Far in the distance and down can be seen the waste of desert and the barren hills of Nevada. Clay, a rifle across his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. Steve rides beside Mary, who is driving. The remuda trails behind. Helen, lying in the wagon bed, cannot be seen. \nMED. TRUCKING SHOT \nANGLED PAST Steve. Steve has a copy of Leslie's Weekly open on the pommel. Helen lies full length in the wagon bed, occupying herself by giving herself a manicure with an orange stick. \nSTEVE It's a lot tougher than I figured. Knowin' my letters is one thing. But makin' sense out of words is harder'n trackin' weasel after rain. \nClay glances over at his brother. Mary sees him watching. Their eyes meet. She smiles. He doesn't return the smile. \nSTEVE -- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch! \nMARY There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see. \nHe sighs and scowls down at the page. He puts his finger on a word and starts to spell it out. \nSTEVE U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that? \nMARY Unicorn -- a kind of animal -- \nSTEVE What do they look like? \nMARY Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead. \nSTEVE Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada? \nMARY No. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay tightens the cinch. Mary moves up to stand beside him. \nMARY Are we leaving? \nCLAY It's too light yet. \nHe swings into the saddle, pulls the rifle out of the scabbard and lays it across the pommel. \nCLAY Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on. \nMARY (soberly) You're not going out to look for them? \nCLAY No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail. \nHe touches the mare with his spurs and trots down the hill. He disappears around a bend in the trail. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMary, in the f.g., is staring after Clay. Helen is watching her. Steve has risen and walks up behind her. He smiles at her. \nSTEVE Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him. \nMARY (turning) Oh, I wasn't worrying. (flustered) I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave. \nShe starts down toward the wagon, Steve walking beside her and CAMERA TRUCKING WITH them THROUGH the forest. \nSTEVE (softly) You were worryin'. \nMary glances over. \nSTEVE Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out. \nMARY And you've got me all figured out? \nSTEVE Sure. \nThey have passed Helen, playing solitaire on the canvas, and have reached the place where the grub box stands. Steve spreads a tarp for her. \nSTEVE I'll fix us somethin' to eat. \nMary sits down. Steve opens the grub box and takes out some plates, tinned food and hardtack. \nSTEVE Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you. \nMARY You were supposed to be reading words. \nSTEVE I was doin' both. Here. \nHe hands her a plate of food, takes another and goes over to Helen. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHelen looks up from her card game, takes the plate with a smile. \nHELEN Thanks, Steve. \nHe grins at her, turns and comes back to Mary who is watching him. \nMARY Better not let Clay catch you waitin' on us. \nSteve sits on the edge of the grub box and picks up his plate. \nSTEVE Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'. \nMARY But you're his brother. \nSTEVE He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers? \nMary shakes her head. \nSTEVE Yes sir, Clay's nice to be around. (the clincher) He don't chew much and when he does he spits outside. \nHELEN (dryly) You make him sound wonderful... Go on. Tell Mary more about him. \nSteve looks over at her, embarrassed, a little hurt by her tone. He rises, takes Mary's empty plate and his own and goes over to the little spring to wash them. Mary looks sharply at Helen. Helen shrugs. Mary rises and follows Steve over to the spring. \nMED. CLOSE ON SPRING \nSteve kneels by the little pool, washing the plates in the run off. Mary stops above him. \nMARY She was only teasin'. \nSTEVE (offhand) Oh, sure. \nMARY Let me do that. \nShe kneels beside him. Steve looks over at her. \nSTEVE I like to do things for you. Didn't you know? \nShe looks down at the water bubbling up into the little moss lined pool. \nMARY (softly) I know now. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. TRAIL - NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. O.s. there is the SOUND of the cavalcade moving. A wheel passes camera, then another. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the wagon passing in the moonlit darkness. Mary is driving. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMED. SHOT \nClay. He rides around the bend in the trail. He hears something. He reins the horse in. Some pebbles rattle down the cliff. He looks up. \nFROM CLAY'S ANGLE \nThe muzzle of a rifle is visible. Clay starts to bring his gun up. \nFOWLER'S VOICE Hold it! \nDOWN ANGLE \nClay lets his rifle rest across his knees. He looks up. Fowler, a well-set-up young man in jeans, blue shirt and worn jacket and wearing a battered hat, moves into scene. \nCLOSE SHOT \nClay. He is wary, puzzled as to the man's identity. For all he knows it may be one of Lednov's men. \nMED. SHOT \nClay and Fowler. \nFOWLER What are you doin' on this trail? \nCLAY Followin' it. Any reason I shouldn't? \nMED. LONG SHOT \nSHOOTING PAST Fowler. Into view comes the wagon and the remuda. Fowler lowers his rifle. He slides down the cliff to stand beside Clay. \nMED. CLOSE \nClay and Fowler. \nFOWLER My name's Fowler. I'm camped up a ways. \nHe extends his hand. Clay shakes it. \nCLAY Clay Phillips of Aspen. Been havin' trouble? \nFOWLER Nope. But I don't want any. \nCLAY Neither do we. That's why we took this trail instead of the main road, and drove all night. \nFOWLER You're welcome to use my camp. \nHe motions ahead, starts walking. Clay rides beside him. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MEADOW \nFULL SHOT. The river is beyond the meadow. In the pine forest at the edge of the meadow is Fowler's camp. The cavalcade is driving up to the camp. There are two horses tethered in the meadow. \nEXT. FOWLER'S CAMP \nMED. FULL SHOT. A tarp is stretched over the camp. There is a crude stone fireplace, a rough table and two benches. Shelves are nailed between the trees. In a small lean-to there is a bunk with Fowler's bedroll on it. Fowler stands watching Mary and Holen as they get out of the wagon. The horses sproad out across the meadow. Steve and Clay dismount. Both unsaddle. Helen, Mary and Fowler exchange glances. Then the two women walk toward the camp, which is behind a screen of trees. \nMED. CLOSE ON CAMP \nHelen and Mary enter the camp. \nMARY We might as well start a fire. \nHELEN Go ahead. (nodding off) Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it. \nShe goes off and across the meadow. Mary looks after her, shrugs and going to the fireplace, takes moss and twigs from the pile and puts them in. Clay, carrying saddle bags and canteens, enters. \nMARY Got a light? \nHe puts them down, goes over to the fireplace and kneels to light the moss. Mary has stepped back. \nCLOSE SHOT - LOW \nAs he lights the fire, the lower portion of Mary's body comes into the shot. Clay becomes aware of her closeness. He rises slowly. CAMERA ANGLES UP. Mary is standing facing him, almost touching him. They stare at each other without speaking. Both suddenly move togother. They kiss. There is a SOUND over shot and they step apart, looking off. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSteve has come into scene and is looking at them. He smiles with pleasure and surprise. \nSTEVE (innocently) Want the wagon unloaded, Clay? \nCLAY (upset) Just the grub box and bed rolls. \nSteve nods, smiles at both of them and goes out of scene. Clay and Mary face each other. Suddenly Clay swings around and goes out of shot after his brother. \nCLOSE SHOT - MARY \nShe looks after him, clearly in love, disappointed that they were interrupted. Then she turns to the fire. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nClay and Steve. CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of them as they walk toward the wagon. Steve has begun to whistle blithely. Clay looks sideways at him. Steve whistles even louder. They stop at the wagon. CAMERA HOLDS. Steve climbs inside and hands down the grub box. \nSTEVE I -- I think it'll be swell. \nClay puts the grub box on the ground. Steve tosses out the bed rolls, then jumps out. He grins up at Clay. \nMED. CLOSE \nClay, embarrassed, puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. \nCLAY When you get older you'll understand things better. Like women and men. Just because a man kisses a woman, doesn't always mean -- well, he can kiss her and not want to -- have her around all the time. \nShe holds his hand, smiling up. Clay hesitates, then desire for her is more than he can bear, so he takes her in his arms. They kiss, holding the kiss for a long while. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThey break. She lies looking up. He half lies, half sits beside her. \nMARY (a whisper) Tell me, darling. \nCLAY What? \nMARY What does a man usually tell a girl? \nFor answer, Clay kisses her again -- hard, ruthlessly. His hands crush her shoulders. Mary holds the kiss for a moment, then draws back, waiting for him to say the words she wants to hear. His hands pull her toward him. Mary wants the kiss -- but she also wants a declaration of love. She makes one last try to get it. \nMARY Tell me -- please -- \nClay's grip on her shoulders tightens. She searches his face with a glance -- stares into his eyes -- then pushes him away and sits up. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary. She is hurt by his silence. \nMARY All right you don't love me. So let it go at that. \nCAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. Clay's expression hardens. He drops his hands from her shoulders. \nCLAY What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean? \nMARY I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up. \nShe stands. He rises to face her. \nMARY I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen. \nCLAY If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy. \nMARY Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change. \nCLAY All right -- it's said! \nMARY Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it. \nTurning she starts down toward camp. \nMED. LONG SHOT \nANGLED PAST Clay. Below is the camp. Beyond the camp, through the trees, stands the wagon and Steve is hitching up the mules. Clay hesitates, then follows. \nCLOSE TRUCKING SHOT \nMary. Tears form in her eyes. She blinks them away, composing herself with an effort. \nEXT. CAMP \nMED. SHOT - Helen and Fowler in f.g. Helen sits at one side of the table, Fowler on the other. Helen holds the soft leather poke. In the b.g. Mary approaches. Behind her comes Clay. \nHELEN You're sure there's more where this came from? \nFOWLER Plenty more. (motioning) And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it. \nHelen pours the gold out in her palm as Mary comes up. Mary stands looking down. \nHELEN Pretty, isn't it? And all you have to do is shovel sand into a thing and the river does the work. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay enters the scene and goes over to pick up his saddle bags. \nMARY (quiet) Give it back to him. We're leavin'. \nHELEN Maybe you are. I'm not. \nShe reaches over and pats Fowler's hand. \nHELEN I'm stayin' here with Jed. \nMary looks from Helen to Fowler. \nFOWLER (shyly) I figure we'll get along just fine. \nHELEN Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about. \nMary stands looking down at Helen. Lovingly Helen pours the gold back in the poke. \nMARY I'm not raising horses or kids for anybody. I'm opening the slickest gambling house in California with a crystal chandelier, the biggest you ever saw -- \nClay, saddle bags in hand, straightens. Mary directs the rest of the speech at him. \nMARY -- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that? \nHELEN Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be. \nHelen juggles the poke in her hand. \nHELEN I'm sure of this. But not of you. (shakes head) You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house. \nMARY (furious) That's it then. \nFOWLER (the master) That's it. She's staying with me -- for keeps. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSteve has entered the camp and is standing looking at them open-mouthed. Mary moves over to Fowler and holds out her hand. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay swims his horse toward Mary who is floundering in the stream. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary. The current sweeps her against a rock. Stunned -- she goes under. \nMED. SHOT \nClay swims his horse to her, reaches down and lifts her up in front of him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay's horse, with the double burden, fights her way out of the stream and scrambles up the bank to stop on level ground. \nMED. CLOSE \nClay and Mary. Clay, his expression anxious, stares down at the stunned Mary. He swings out of the saddle, holding her tenderly to him. The brush with death has made him realize how much she means to him. Gently, he puts her down on the sand, stoops beside her. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nClay and Mary in f.g. Steve swims his horse across and rides up the bank to dismount near them. \nCLAY Mary -- \nMED. CLOSE - DOWN ANGLE \nMary opens her eyes and sits up \nCLAY (anxiously) Are you all right? \nMary is humiliated, bedraggled and wet, still angry and fighting back tears. \nMARY (sharp) No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock. \nCLAY (nettlod at her tone) I suppose that's my fault. \nMary gets to her feet. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. Steve stands in the b.g. She looks out at the river. \nMARY (wailing) All my clothes -- \nCLAY That's right -- worry about your clothes -- \nANOTHER ANGLE \nto include wagon in river. Clay, suddenly furious, points to the wagon. \nCLAY What about my wagon. Of all the crazy fool things to do. You lose a man's wagon because you're stupid and then yell about your clothes. \nThis is the last straw. Mary turns her back, digs into her stocking and pulls out some bills. She hands them to him. \nMARY For the wagon. \nClay looks at Mary, then down at the money. \nMARY Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid. \nCLAY (furious) There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started. \nHe turns and sees Steve standing scowling at him. He takes the rest of his anger out on Steve. \nCLAY Don't just stand there. Go on back and get the packs on the horses. We've lost all the time we're going to because of a woman. \nClay strides over to his horse and swings into the saddle. Steve stands looking at Mary. \nCLAY Come on. Didn't you hear me? \nAs he plunges his horse into the stream: \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. RIVER \nFULL SHOT - the lower ford. Where the main road crosses the river, it flows gently, with sand banks on either side. Three horsemen appear around a bend in the trail and ride down to the riverbank. They are Lednov, McCall and Peters. Lednov's horse is limping badly. They ride into the river. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe horses swim to shore and flounder up the bank, Lednov's horse last. As the horse starts up the bank Lednov sees something o.s. and reins the horse in. \nMED. SHOT \nFROM Lednov's ANGLE. A piece of clothing floats down the river. Lednov rides down the bank into the water. He reaches down awkwardly and gets the piece of clothing, then turns and rides back up the bank. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe two others have turned and are watching him. He rides up to them, holding out one of Mary's undergarments. \nMCCALL We got company. Female company. \nLEDNOV (looking at the garment) Yeah, we sure have. \nHe turns to scan the river. \nANGLED PAST THEM - AT RIVER \nMary's trunk comes floating by. The three men look at each other, then Lednov turns his horse and starts up the bank of the river. The others follow. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. PEAKS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS \nEXTREME LONG SHOT. The long pine-covered approaches, and the glistening summit; the early snow covering the rocks with a thin layer of white. CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM the heights of the mountains, TO the narrow trail that winds among the trees. Clay passes, and behind him the pack-horses and the romuda. Following the remuda comes Mary. She is dressed in a pair of Steve's pants and wears one of his shirts under her own coat. \nLEDNOV (calling; echoing) Next time I won't miss. \nCLOSE SHOT \nClay. He starts forward, face set with rage. \nLEDNOV'S VOICE (echoing) Watch the one with the white face. \nRecklessly Clay raises his rifle and fires three shots at Lednov's position. \nEXT. ROCKS \nMED. FULL SHOT as Clay fires, Steve starts running down. He crosses the creek. \nEXT. LEDNOV'S POSITION \nLONG SHOT - DOWN. Lednov sees Steve running. He swings his rifle away from the horses and tries to get the boy in his sights. Clay fires again. A bullet smacks into the tree. Lednov flinches. Then again he tries to center on Steve. \nEXT. MEADOW \nMED. SHOT. Steve runs, bending low, toward the rail fence. A bullet kicks up dirt near him. \nEXT. LEDNOV'S POSITION \nLONG SHOT - DOWN. Steve has almost reached the fence. Lednov fires. Steve stumbles and goes down. \nMED. CLOSE \nSteve. He lies still a moment, then painfully he crawls to the rails and with a great effort tries to tear the rails down. Lednov fires. The bullet whistles past. Steve pulls the fence down, crawls away from the opening. The horses, milling around the corral break through. Steve lies still, face down. \nFULL SHOT \nThe meadow, ANGLED PAST Clay. The horses scatter across the meadow. \nMED. SHOT \nClay, now the hunter, moves toward Lednov's position. Lednov fires. Clay runs and jumps into the creek. Sheltered by the bank he makes his way up the creek. \nMED. CLOSE \nLednov. He waits, his rifle ready. O.s. a twig snaps. Cautiously he looks ahead. There is silence. \nMED. SHOT \nhis ANGLE. A light wind runs through the great trees. Shafts of light filter through the trees, making patterns on the forest floor. The light is dim, deceptive. Lednov, rifle ready, searches for some sign of Clay. Then from another direction comes the SOUND of movement. Lednov swings his rifle in that direction, waits. The SOUND has stopped. \nCLAY'S VOICE I'm here Lednov. \nHis voice echoes across the hills. Lednov sights along his rifle at the direction from which the SOUND of Clay's voice came. Momentarily Clay is seen as he runs from one tree to another. Lednov fires. \nMED. CLOSE \nClay. Clay cautiously edges around the base of a tree. He picks up a stick, stops. \nCLAY Come on out. \nHis voice can be heard echoing across the hills. He tosses the stick. Lednov fires at the SOUND of the falling stick. \nLEDNOV'S VOICE Come and get me. \nAs his voice echoes across the hills Clay quickly moves into the open and fires. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nLednov crumples forward as his echoing voice fades out. Clay moves over to him to stand looking down. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MEADOW \nMED. SHOT. Steve sits propped up against the fence rail. His shirt is off and his shoulder is crudely bandaged. Clay, who has been putting the bandage on, stands and takes a sack of tobacco from his pocket. \nCLAY (rolling cigarette) How's that? \nSTEVE Kind of sore. \nCLAY You'll live. \nSTEVE (shyly) Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh? \nCLAY Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it. \nSTEVE So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life? \nCLAY (stares down at him, then) I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it. \nSTEVE Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China... \nClay looks at him for a moment, not angry, but not admitting he's wrong yet. \nDISSOLVE OUT \nEXT. SONORA - NIGHT (STOCK) \nEXT. SONORA STREET - NIGHT \nFULL SHOT - featuring hotel and doctor's office. The sheriff's posse, the bodies of Lednov, McCall and Wheeler slung across the backs of horses, and Clay's remuda, trot down the street. People come out of the hotel to watch the cavalcade pass. Clay and Steve are not with the posse. Clay's horse is tethered in front of the doctor's office which is next door to the hotel. \nEXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE \nMED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH window. Clay, back to camera, is holding a kerosine lamp. The doctor, a lanky, middle-aged man, is working over Steve, who is stretched out on a table. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE \n", "test1_input": "FOWLER They went on like I told you. \nEXT. FOREST - MOONLIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Helen cautiously moves away from the camp. \nLEDNOV'S VOICE How long ago? \nFOWLER Five, six hours. \nA twig snaps underfoot. Helen freezes. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Lednov is staring off in the direction of Helen. McCall moves to the edge of the lean-to, looking off. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nMED. CLOSE SHOT. Helen starts forward again, more cautiously than ever. She reaches a tree, turns to look back. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHelen, back to camera, is in immediate f.g. Through the trees can be seen the camp and the flickering fire. She turns, and then fright comes into her expression. \nREVERSE SHOT \nPeters stands in front of her. As he reaches out for her, she tries to get away. He grabs her, wrapping his arms around her. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. From o.s. comes the SOUND of Helen and Peters struggling. Fowler, hearing the SOUND, gets to his feet. Lednov and McCall turn on him. \nLEDNOV Sit down. (calling) All right, Peters, come on over here. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nMED. SHOT. Peters, carrying the struggling Helen, heads for the camp. \nEXT. CAMP - NIGHT \nANOTHER ANGLE. Fowler makes a futile dive for Lednov. McCall swings his rifle. Fowler goes down. In the b.g. Peters drags the struggling Helen around the lean-to into the camp. \nLEDNOV (to Fowler) So you were all alone. \nHe moves forward to meet Helen and Peters. Lednov reaches out for Helen. Peters pulls her away. \nPETERS (sharp) You keep your hands off. \nMcCall has taken his attention from Fowler and gives it to Helen. Unnoticed now, Fowler is struggling back to consciousness. He tries to pull himself up. McCall turns back and kicks him again. \nHELEN (yelling) Let him alone! \nShe rakes Peters' face with her fingernails, tries to fight free. Lednov reaches out and grabs her arm. Peters knocks his arm down. Free for the moment, Helen launches an attack on McCall, who is getting ready to boot Fowler again. She is on him like a cat, swarming all over him. He defends himself. Helen is yelling furiously as she fights McCall. \nHELEN Kick a guy, would you! You scum! You won't do any kickin' when they come back. \nLednov has reached her now. He wraps his arms around her and pulls her away from McCall. Helen tries to fight him. \nHELEN You dirty murderers... killin' people when they're sleepin'... \nLednov pinions her arms. \nLEDNOV How do you know who we are? \nHELEN Everybody knows -- \nLEDNOV (excited) Who brought you here? \nHelen doesn't answer. Lednov starts twisting her arms. \nLEDNOV You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back? \nHELEN (moaning) Stop it -- \nAs the pain increases she blurts out Clay's name. \nHELEN Clay Phillips. \nLEDNOV Where is he? \nHELEN Up the trail. \nIn a fury, Lednov crushes her arm. \nLEDNOV How far up the trail? \nHELEN (moaning) I don't know -- I don't know. \nHe hurls her from him. She goes back against the table. Fowler is trying to struggle to his feet. In blind rage, Lednov raises his gun and fires. Fowler crumples. Helen looks down, too horrified and terrified to scream. Lednov looks at her, then almost casually he shoots her. McCall and Peters stand watching as though frozen. \nPETERS (huskily) You didn't have to do that. \nLEDNOV (deadly) Why not? She might have got to Clay Phillips before I did. \nAS HE TURNS, \nFADE OUT \nEXT. OPEN RIDGE FADE IN \nMED. FULL SHOT - ANGLES east. Behind the ridge rises the range through which the pass to Nevada cuts its way. The trail which has dipped down into a canyon comes up to follow the ridge a ways and then drops down again. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride along the trail. Lednov, in the lead, stops suddenly and looks off. \nEXTREME LONG SHOT \n", "test1_true": "MED. SHOT \nMcCall, Lednov and Peters. Lednov motions to his men and they hurriedly ride forward into the shelter of some trees. \nMED. SHOT \nthe pack train. Mary, half asleep, slumps forward. Her horse has stopped. Steve rides up alongside and looks over at her, anxiously. \nSTEVE Are you all right? \nMary starts into wakefulness. She smiles at Steve. \nMARY For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora. \nSTEVE It's a long ways yet. (arrogantly, to Clay) I figure we ought to camp. She's tired. \nCLAY So am I and so are the horses. \nHe rides on ahead. Steve looks after him, annoyed, then follows with Mary. \nEXT. MEADOW \nClay leads the pack train out into the clearing and toward the road. A small creek threads its way through the meadow. Clay rides up to the creek and swings out of the saddle. He is taking the saddle off as the others ride up. \nCLAY (to Steve) Take the packs off. And run the horses into the corral. \nHe throws the saddle down, takes his rifle out of the scabbard. Steve doesn't move. \nCLAY I said take the packs off. \nHe starts off past Mary, glances up. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nMary leans wearily forward on the pommel, too tired to dismount. \nCLAY (gruffly) I figure we'll make better time, letting the horses rest for a spell. \nMary looks down at him. She is hoping he will reach up and lift her down. \nCLAY So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance. \nMARY If you want to go on, I can make it all right. \nCLAY Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses. \nHe turns a way abruptly and goes toward the road. Mary looks after him, disappointed. Steve comes over and helps her down. \nMED. SHOT \nSteve and Mary. Steve spreads a tarp on the grass. \nSTEVE You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat. \nMARY (sitting) Thanks, Steve. \nSteve goes back and starts unpacking the horses. Mary looks off in Clay's direction, then stretches out and pillows her head on her arm. Now the sun is coming up and driving the darkness out of the meadow. In the distance Clay can be seen climbing up on a rise. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nClay. He climbs up on an eminence and looks back toward the hills. \nLONG SHOT \nhis ANGLE. The open ridge. There is no sign of Lednov. \nANGLED PAST CLAY \nINTO the meadow. Steve has unpacked the horses. They graze inside the crude corral. Steve is collecting wood for a fire. Clay hurries down toward him. \nMED. SHOT \nSteve squats beside the pile of needles, twigs and pine cones. He strikes a match and sets the needles aflame. Clay hurries into the scene and roughly kicks the fire out. Steve rises. \nCLAY (angrily) If you want 'em to find us, why don't you go up on the hill and wave your shirt or fire your rifle. \nSteve is ashamed of his thoughtlessness and for a moment is apologetic. \nSTEVE I didn't stop to think, Clay. \nCLAY (short) You better start. \nClay turns and goes over to where the packs lie. He kneels beside the pack, rummages in them for hardtack and tinned food. Steve looks after him. \nCLOSE SHOT \nSteve. He is hurt and angry. Knowing he was in the wrong about the fire doesn't help matters. He'd like to go off in the woods and cry, but that's out of the question. Instead he follows Clay and stands above him. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nSTEVE Maybe you and me better split up when we hit Sonora. \nClay speaks without looking up. \nCLAY (mildly) All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires. \nSTEVE That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life. \nClay spreads the food on a tarp, sits down and starts eating a hardtack. \nCLAY Maybe you're not hungry, but I am. \nSteve stares down at him angrier, more hurt than ever. \n", "test1_id": 1353, "test2_input": "CLAY Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep. \nSTEVE I'll eat when I'm good and ready. \nCLAY Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old. \nSTEVE What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself. \n[As this scene continues, there is heard, faintly o.s. the SOUND of little bells, the kind that teamsters put on the hames of their horses. Over the hill, in the direction of Yosemite, a stage is approaching. It is coming slowly uphill. Soon it will be visible on the rise about a mile south of the meadow.] \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING TOWARD Steve and Clay PAST Mary. She is asleep. \nSTEVE You ain't even man enough to own up when you're wrong. \nClay rises and stands facing Steve. \nSTEVE Go on, hit me. \nCLAY Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told. \nSTEVE You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do. \nCLAY You keep your nose out of my life, young fella. \nSTEVE Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that. \nSteve's voice rises during this speech. In f.g. Mary stirs and opens her eyes. Then she sits up. \nCLAY I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it. \nSTEVE You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman -- \nMary has risen. She is listening to Steve. She is also listening to the bells. \nLONG SHOT \nher ANGLE. Over the rise comes the stage. It is still a long way off. \nSTEVE'S VOICE -- doesn't mean he wants to marry her. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nto include all three. The brothers still don't see Mary. \nSTEVE Well, if you didn't mean it, why did you kiss her? \nClay is ashamed but won't show it. He puts his hand on Steve's shoulder and pushes him. \nCLAY Shut up and eat. \nSteve swings for his chin. Clay ducks the blow, grabs Steve's wrist. Steve swings with his left, hitting Clay ineffectually. Clay pins Steve's arms to his side. \nMARY (sharply) Stop it -- both of you. \nShe walks toward them as Clay releases Steve and steps back. Steve puts his hands up, making ready for another round. \nMARY I won't have you fighting over me. \nCLAY (to Steve) I'm sorry. \nSTEVE You don't know what it is to be sorry. \nMARY (sharp) Steve -- \nSteve turns abruptly and moves away. He is on the verge of tears. \nMARY (to Clay) Mind sortin' out my things -- I'm leaving. \nShe motions off. Clay is suddenly aware of the approaching stage. He looks in that direction. \nLONG SHOT \nFROM his ANGLE. The stage drives along the road. \nMARY Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me. \nCLAY It's going to Sonora. \nMARY Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime. \nShe turns and starts going through the kyacks, looking for her things. Clay frowns down at her. \nMARY Because as you said, that's where I belong. \nMary's attention is on the kyacks. From where Clay stands near her he can see the trail leading down through open country toward the meadow. \nCLAY I said a lot of things -- some of 'em -- \nSomething o.s. catches his attention, then he pauses to look off. \nEXT. TRAIL \nLONG SHOT - his ANGLE. Up on the ridge there is the flash of sun on metal. \nEXT. RIDGE \nMED. SHOT. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride through the trees. \nCLOSE SHOT \nClay. He looks up anxiously, then turns. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to include Mary and she straightens and faces him, her back to the trail. \n", "test2_true": "CLAY (sharply) I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change. \nHe bends down and picks up her things. \nCLAY If you're gonna catch this stage, come on. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe stage has speeded up and is coming fast down the road. Mary looks up at Clay hurt and shocked by his sudden sharpness. She had hoped he wouldn't let her go. \nMARY I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand. \nCLAY Hurry up. \nHe starts off, Mary following. \nMED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT \nMary makes one last attempt to get him to change his mind. \nMARY (softly) I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there. \nCLAY Maybe they will. \nHe waves for the stage to stop. \nANGLED PAST STAGE \nThe driver sees Clay waving and pulls the horses in. The stage moves down to the edge of the meadow. \nMED. SHOT \nThe stage. It is a small one, a double-seated buckboard with one woman passenger and the driver an elderly man. On the side of the vehicle is painted: \"Yosemite-Sonora Stage Line\". The woman, middle-aged and rather drab, looks at Mary curiously. \nCLAY Mind giving a lady a lift into town? \nDRIVER (to Mary) Climb right in. \nHe jumps out of the stage and follows Clay, carrying Mary's belongings, around back of the stage. Mary gets into the stage beside the woman who moves over for her. \nANOTHER ANGLE \non back of stage. The driver opens the boot and Clay hands him Mary's belongings. He starts stowing them in the boot. \nCLAY Will you be seeing the sheriff? \nDRIVER Depot's right next to his office. \nClay starts scribbling a note. In the b.g. Steve has moved up beside the stage. He stands looking up at Mary. \nMED. CLOSE \nfeaturing Mary and Steve. \nSTEVE (shyly) Goodbye, ma'am. \nMary reaches down and takes his hand. \nMARY (quietly) Goodbye, Steve. Don't fight with him any more. \nSteve's expression hardens. He glances toward the back of the stage, then at Mary. \nMARY It's not his fault, just you remember that. It's mine. Don't ask me why because you couldn't understand now. Some day you will. \nClay and the driver come around the stage. Steve steps back. The driver climbs into the seat. Clay and Mary look at each other. \nMARY Goodbye. Thanks for the lift. \nCLAY Goodbye, Mary. \nMARY By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine. \nBefore Clay can speak, the driver snaps his whip and the stage jerks away down the road. Mary doesn't look back. Clay, in f.g., looks after it. Dust rises. It disappears around a bend in the road. Clay turns and starts across the meadow. Steve looks after Clay, hesitates, then follows. \nMED. CLOSE \nas Clay reaches the spot where the kyacks and saddles are thrown. Steve comes up to him. \nSTEVE You know what she asked me? \nCLAY I don't care what she asked you. \nSTEVE She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different... \nClay is looking off, hardly listening. \nSTEVE It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better... \nCLAY (sharply) You want to split up? -- \nClay's eyes are narrow, peering toward: \nEXT.

I don't want you around. \nTurning, he crosses to where Steve's horse stands. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. He loads the horse back, throws a blanket and saddle on and cinches up the saddle. Steve watches, angry and hurt. Clay steps back. \nCLAY There you are. \nMED. CLOSE \nthe two brothers. They stare at each other. Steve is on the verge of tears. Hurriedly, he swings into the saddle. \nMED. SHOT \nHe glances down to Clay and digs his spurs in and gallops after the stage. Clay's stern expression leaves his face.

Clay comes up to him as he's putting the bars back up. \nCLAY What did you come back for? \nSTEVE Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'. \nThe two brothers stare at each other. \nCLAY (softly) Is that the only reason you came back? \nSTEVE (gruff) Sure. What other reason would there be? \nCLAY (smiling) I just wondered. Let's go. \nEXT. MEADOW \nLONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Above the pines smoke rises. The horses graze inside the corral. In the shadowy forest by the creek, Clay's camp can be seen. A tarp has been stretched over the camp. Lednov moves into the right hand side of the frame and looks down. \nREVERSE SHOT \nLednov stands on a rocky hill looking down in the meadow. Behind him are McCall and Peters. They are screened from the meadow by the rocks. Lednov turns and starts off through the rocks to circle above the camp. The two men follow. All are on foot. \nEXT. ROCK \nLONG SHOT SHOOTING PAST Clay and along his rifle. Clay, hidden behind a wall of rock, is watching the trail where it comes down into the meadow. Something moves on the rocky hill above and to his left. He looks up, waiting. The movement stops.

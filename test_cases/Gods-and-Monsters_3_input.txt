CLAY This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times. 
DWIGHT Ooooh. 
Betty glares at Clay, who realizes he's gone too far. 
BETTY I bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous.  So he can get in the big guy's pants. 
DWIGHT Ooooh. 
CLAY What makes you say that? 
BETTY Just thinking out loud. 
CLAY Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself. 
BETTY All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are. 
CLAY Fuck you. 
BETTY Not anymore you don't.  Doll. 
CLAY (explodes) We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie. 
HARRY Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it. 
CLAY Good.  Fine. 
Harry reaches up, turns on a battered Motorola.  On the tv, a voice announces: "Tonight, Boris Karloff in 'The Bride of Frankenstein.'"  The titles come on.  Ending with the phrase "Directed by", which floats over a white blob.  The blob jumps forward to form letters: "James Whale." 
CLAY Right there.  What did I tell you? James Whale. 
The movie starts.  The Monster being roasted alive in the flaming wreckage of a mill. 
BETTY This looks corny. 
CLAY Go wash glasses if you don't like it. 
In a flooded crater under the mill, the Monster kills an old man.  He climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below. An owl blinks impassively. 
DWIGHT Not bad.  Two down and it's just started. 
Minnie, a hatchet-faced woman with fluttering ribbons, is now alone with the Monster. 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Whale and Hanna are in bathrobes and slippers, and there is a glass of milk and a plate of cookies on Whale's TV tray. On the tv, Minnie (played by UNA O'CONNOR) squeaks and whimpers and screams.  Whale laughs. 
WHALE Wonderful old Una.  Gobbling like an old turkey hen. 
But Hanna isn't amused.  She unclenches her arms to close the bathrobe over her throat. 
HANNA Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him? 
WHALE Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable. 
Minnie flees in a bowlegged jig up the hill.  Whale smiles again. 
INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT 
On the tv, Dr. Pretorius (played by Ernest Thesiger) delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation: "To a new world of gods and monsters!"  Dwight and Harry and Betty all laugh. 
BETTY These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny. 
CLAY (defensively) Maybe it's supposed to be funny. 
BETTY Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them. 
Suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice of Elvis Presley.  Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox, wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker. 
CLAY Hey!  Some of us are watching a movie! 
SAYLOR Go ahead.  Free country. 
Clay jumps from his stool.  Saylor sees him coming, steps aside. 
SAYLOR You want me to turn it down? 
Clay slams the heel of his hand against Saylor's chest.  The boy staggers backward.  Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the song.  Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender. 
SAYLOR Hey, I didn't know.  It's your favorite movie.  Sorry, okay? 
Clay returns to the bar and uprights the stool.  Saylor escorts his girl to the door.

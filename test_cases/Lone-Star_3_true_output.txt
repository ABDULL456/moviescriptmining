The door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis, standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis, sitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as they hear Sam step in-- 
REVERSE 
Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to the two men-- 
SAM Fellas. 
HOLLIS Hey, Sam. 
SAM Open late. 
OTIS I'm not open. We were just talking. 
SAM Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade. 
OTIS Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up. 
He sits a few stools away from Hollis-- 
SAM You two saw it, didn't you? You two saw it when Buddy killed him. 
Hollis and 0tis look at each other-- 
SAM Imonna find out one way or the other. 
HOLLIS Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met-- 
SAM Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy-- 
HOLLIS Buddy Deeds-- 
SAM Buddy Deeds was a murderer. 
He looks at the two older men for a long moment-- 
SAM That night in the cafe--he didn't stay long after you left, did he, Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone too far with Wade, maybe he figured he better not wait for the Sheriff to get behind him. So he stepped out to see if he could catch up--and you were here at the club that night, weren't you, O? 
Otis sighs, begins to speak softly-- 
OTIS I was here. 
CU OTIS 
He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we PAN away with his gaze-- 
OTIS (O.S.) I'd been running a game on the side after hours craps, draw poker on the weekends. Roderick didn't know about it. More important, Charley Wade didn't know about it, 'cause I didn't want to cut him in. I suppose I'd been drinking some, and I was pretty full of myself in those days--but hell, I just didn't expect the man so early-- 
Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are back in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the jukebox. They stop and look at the place-- 
THEIR POV -- CLUB 
MUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines from the back room. 
INT. BACK ROOM 
MUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front of him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing so well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the door-- 
CU OTIS 
MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in dealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up-- 
WADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV 
MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g., Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling his cold smile, cursing-- 
CU YOUNG OTIS 
MUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed-- 
EXTREME CU WADE'S EYES 
Cold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES-- 
EXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH 
Twisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES-- 
MEN, TABLE 
MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the side door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade starts walking toward him-- 
CU YOUNG OTIS 
MUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand over him-- 
WADE, YOUNG OTIS 
MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying-- 
YOUNG HOLLIS

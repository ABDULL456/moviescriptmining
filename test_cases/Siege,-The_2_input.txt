HUB Go, Floyd. 
As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face. 
CUT TO: 
AN ORDINARY HOUSE 
In an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR. Agent Rose climbs into the front seat. 
AGENT ROSE I've got two in the Plymouth, at least three inside, and see that guy walking his dog...? He did his business about an hour ago and they're still walking. 
IN ANOTHER CAR -- 
DANNY I had a dog like that once. 
FRANK It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're spies. 
DANNY The dog works for the CIA? 
Their radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub. 
HUB (V.O.) (over the radio) All units report in turn. 
We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock." 
HUB Let's roll. 
THE MAN WALKING THE DOG 
Is suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS. 
AGENT - MIKE Federal Agents. Hands behind your back -- 
A third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog. 
TWO UNMARKED CARS 
Fishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump in through the driver's window. 
AGENT - FRED -- Keep 'em where we can see 'em, thank you very much. 
THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE 
Is BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn. 
FRANK Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill. 
Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down, muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees: 
KHALIL 
Sitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger: 
ELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished basement is a palpable feeling of menace. 
As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock .9 at his head. Hub just stares him down. 
ELISE Ralph, spare us. 
The freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose face is badly bruised. 
ELISE I never touched him. 
HUB Really? I'm taking him into custody just the same. 
ELISE What are you going to charge him with? Jaywalking? (Hub stares at her) I don't suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first? 
HUB Not in this lifetime. 
ELISE You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? If you guys hadn't blown the surveillance, we'd have been able to follow the money. What do you think, Khalil, you would have led us right to your friends, wouldn't you? 
Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her. 
HUB What friends --? What have you got for me, Elise?... Enlighten me. (she stonewalls) Tell me now or tell me downtown. 
Still nothing. Hub calls out to his agents. 
HUB Get this guy out of here and book him. 
As the other agents approach Khalil: 
ELISE One phone call and he's mine again. You know the number. I have -- 
HUB You have "the right to remain silent," you have "the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law -- 
ELISE (overlapping him) Oh, come on... Do you have any idea what you're starting here, the kind of shitstorm you're about to -- 
HUB (overiding her) -- Kidnapping. Obstruction of Justice. Assault. 
As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent. 
HUB Cuff her.

JORDAN Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating. 
The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring. 
SEAFOX THUNDERS past.  Jordan plunges her free arm through the loop... 
And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat. 
Throwing a rooster tail a mile long, Seafox pivots on the water and heads back to base. 
MCCOOL Hoooooo-yah! 
NEWBERRY Go, go, go, go! 
SLUTNIK Uh-huh!  That's right!  Just like we always practice it! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  GUARD HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
Limousine leading, a parade of vehicles reaches the base entrance.  A man exits the limo to expedite matters with the BASE GUARD. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE Senator DeHaven is here for the graduation ceremonies. 
BASE GUARD What are all these other vehicles? 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE Just a small press corps.  Routine. 
BASE GUARD And that pickup truck at the end? 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE That?  That would be the all-woman America's Cup team. 
EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
C.O. (into microphone) Special Reconnaissance Class 118, you may now stand down. 
All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites, the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH.  What began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40. 
Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce, smiling through his fears.  Not far away sits Blondell. No one claps louder. 
Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates. Pyro finally manages to take her aside. 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO Lieutenant?  I was asked to give you this. 
It's a small case.  Jordan opens it to find a medal of bronze and blue enamel. 
JORDAN The Navy Cross... 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point. 
JORDAN I was looking for him earlier, but... 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy. 
JORDAN (knowing better) Just a coincidence? 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone. 
Jordan nods, understanding. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
DeHaven.  She's holding a press conference, trying to turn piss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job: 
DEHAVEN ... of course, we always prefer peace to war.  But if we're going to war, give women a piece.  Give them the choice to defend their country. And if the President doesn't like that idea -- if he wants to continue to deny women their equal rights -- then I'll be happy to step out back with him any time, anywhere... 
Jordan approaches.  Spotting her, the PRESS PLEADS for a photo-op with both women. 
DEHAVEN Jordan?  Jordan, dear... 
Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn, Jordan walks right past DeHaven... 
And joins Royce.  Together they turn and leave. 
C.O. Senator, perhaps this would be a good time for that lunch.  Will the America's Cup team be joining us?

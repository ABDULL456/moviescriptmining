HAL (V.O.) You want to come on in? 
Louise thinks for a minute. 
LOUISE I don't think so. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
HAL Then I'm sorry.  We're gonna have to charge you with murder.  Now, do you want to come out of this alive? 
The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going. 
Darryl comes in and immediately realizes Hal is talking to Louise.  Darryl looks attentively at Hal. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
LOUISE You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that. 
HAL (V.O.) Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas. 
Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this. 
A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up the phone. 
ANGLE OF THELMA 
She has her finger on the lever. 
THELMA Come on, Louise.  Don't blow it. Let's go. 
She walks away towards the car.  Louise is still standing there holding the phone.  Thelma stops and looks at her. 
THELMA Come on. 
Louise doesn't move. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Frustrated, Hal slams down the phone.  He looks over at the surveillance man who nods to say "we got it."  The whole room reacts excitedly.  Everyone in the room springs into action.  Max immediately picks up the phone and Hal watches him intently.  He mouths the words to Max -- "I wanna go" emphatically.  Max slightly shakes his head, still of the phone.  Hal goes charging over to Max. 
HAL Max.  You gotta take me there!  I'm... I'm the only one she's ever talked to.  I don't want anybody losin' their heads.  You know what happens. The volume gets turned way up and the next thing you know those girls are gonna get shot. 
Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst. 
MAX (calmly) Okay, Hal, okay. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY 
Louise is still standing there. 
THELMA Louise? 
LOUISE Yes, Thelma? 
THELMA You're not gonna give up on me, are ya? 
LOUISE What do you mean? 
THELMA You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know. 
LOUISE No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals. 
THELMA I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything. 
Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma. 
LOUISE Thelma, that is not an option. 
THELMA But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live... 
LOUISE I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show. 
They are both quiet for a moment. 
LOUISE He said they're charging us with murder. 
THELMA (making a face) Eeuww. 
LOUISE And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive. 
THELMA Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all? 
Louise STARTS the car.  They lurch into reverse then SCREECH forward as they tear off down the road. 
WIDE SHOT OF CAR 
as they fly down the road. 
THELMA Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?

The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper: 
CREATURE Could we ever have forgiven? 
The question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in shadow to the door. Pauses. 
CREATURE I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now. 
WALTON What kindness? 
CREATURE Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing. 
And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the night... 
EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT 
The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen mast, axes rising and falling in waves... 
EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT 
The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice. 
Walton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small campfire drifts past. 
Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it. 
Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men back away, preparing for the coming blaze... 
...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching. 
PILOT (softly) Christ. 
Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, denying his aim. 
WALTON It has a right to bear witness. 
Grigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. Men start backing toward the ship. 
WALTON Stand fast. All of you. 
The men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of flame. Walton moves forward... 
...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again. 
It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK! 
Ice cascading skyward. 
OLD SAILOR THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP! 
GRIGORI (whips toward Walton) TORCH THE DAMN THING! 
Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back. 
WALTON BACK TO THE SHIP! 
The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve... 
GRIGORI LEAVE IT! 
...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course across the ice, separating them from the torch. 
They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels. 
THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice. 
NO 
He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of cascading water and spinning fragments. 
THE NEVSKY 
The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side. 
WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see: 
THE CREATURE 
racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse. 
THE NEVSKY 
breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet into the icy water. 
THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice crashing down after him. Gone. 
WALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.

CUMBERLAND Book us a flight, Hale.  Time to take these cowboys down. 
CUT TO: 
WHISTLER (0.S.) Pack of Reds and some matches. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Whistler is buying a pack of cigarettes when he notices	-- 
A BLACK AND WHITE TABLOID 
on display nearby.  The cover story features a BLURRY PHOTO of Blade's recent melee with the vampires. 
Whistler picks up the tabloid, studying it.  Next to the photo is an ARTIST'S SKETCH OF BLADE.  The headline reads: "GUN TOTING PSYCHOPATH CAPTURED ON FILM!" 
Whistler nods to the CASHIER, hands over some more cash. 
WHISTLER I'll take this too. 
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Whistler exits the store, perusing the tabloid as he walks. We hear the WHIR of a camera's HIGH-SPEED MOTOR DRIVE and -- 
A SERIES OF DIGITAL SHOTS 
capture Whistler as he moves down the sidewalk. 
ANGLE ON AN FBI AGENT 
perched on a nearby roof, taking surveillance photos. 
FBI AGENT Subject is heading West. 
WHIP-PAN to a parked CAR, Cumberland and Hale seated within. 
CUMBERLAND Got him. 
Cumberland starts the car, starts following Whistler. 
WHISTLER (0.S.) Congratulations.  You're famous.  Just what we needed. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE ON the tabloid as Whistler slaps it down on a workbench. WIDEN to include Whistler and Blade. 
WHISTLER Somebody screwed us.  Your face is all over the papers, the television.  Media's eating it up. 
BLADE Like I care? 
WHISTLER You should.  Something like this -- (gesturing to the tabloid) -- taking out a human, even one working for the vampires -- far as the rest of the world's concerned, you're public enemy number one. 
BLADE Didn't realize this was a popularity contest. 
Whistler shakes his head, frustrated. 
WHISTLER Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's happening?!  The fuckers are finally getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires we have to worry about, we're gonna have to take on the rest of the world too. (beat, adamant) They've got us on the run.  These last few months we've barely been staying ahead of the curve. 
BLADE You worry too much, old man. 
WHISTLER I've been doing this since before you were born, Blade.  The moment you stop worrying, you're dead. 
Then Whistler's face softens for a moment. 
WHISTLER Since the day I found you, you've been like a son to me.  I taught you everything I know. (beat) But I'm tired.  You understand? 
EXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT 
It's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic. PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk. 
We move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER. 
VOICE (O.S) How about that one? 
SECOND VOICE (O.S.) No fatties.  They taste like Cheetos. 
THIRD VOICE (O.S.) What about that shrunken apple-head beeyatch-a-saurus over there? 
VOICE (O.S.) Fucking blow me, man!

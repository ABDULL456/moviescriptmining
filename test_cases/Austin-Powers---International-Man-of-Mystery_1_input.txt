Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack. Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss.  He keeps pulling out floss. 
More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon&emdash 
Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES at the guard loudly.  He turns around. 
AUSTIN Judo chop! 
Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of toothpaste into the guard's eyes. 
GUARD (screaming, rubbing his eyes) My eyes!  My eyes! 
Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends. 
AUSTIN Hold on, Vanessa! 
She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water. Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face. 
He and Austin STRUGGLE. 
The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water.  SEA 
BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head. 
VANESSA (shouting) Austin, watch out! 
Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender. 
AUSTIN Not a good time to lose one's head. 
VANESSA Indeed. 
AUSTIN That's not the way to get ahead in life. 
VANESSA Yes. 
AUSTIN It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. 
VANESSA Shut up. 
AUSTIN Fair enough. 
They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The name tag reads "JOHN SMITH." 
EXT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT - DAY 
It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad BUSTY WAITRESSES. 
INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT 
At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer. 
GUY 1 I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow. 
GUY 2 Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party. 
GUY 3 Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor.  There's a lot of love in this room. 
A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone. 
WAITRESS Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party. 
GUY 1 Hello? (pause) Yes, I have a friend named John Smith. (pause) That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army. (pause) What?  He's dead? (pause) Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you. 
He hangs up. 
GUY 2 (to Guy 1) Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that John?  Is he coming late? 
GUY 1 Guys, John's not coming. 
GUY 2 Why? 
GUY 1 He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass.

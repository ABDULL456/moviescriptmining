PARKER (To Onaha and Kyrano) I'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest 
nut must crack. 
VIRGIL (As all four of Alan's brothers walk over to ruffle his hair and congratulate him) Hey, way to go, 
sprout! 
JOHN That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the pool by Scott, 
John, Virgil, and Gordon who jump in after them) 
JEFF (answering his phone after it rings) Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, straightaway. Boys. 
Sorry, Penny. Duty calls. 
LADY PENELOPE Of course it does. And quite right too. 
Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms about to go on a rescue mission. The 
older four are looking at Alan. 
JEFF Thunderbirds are go! 
Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat 
LADY PENELOPE Fast as you can, Parker. 
PARKER Certainly, milady. 
Credits Roll with music by Busted playing in the background 
BUSTED Thunderbirds Are Go 
Spring breaks come around and there's more heroes to be found. 
There's something major going down on Tracy island, island. 
Weapons underground keeping our planet safe and sound 
If someone evils coming round they should be frightened (frightened) 
Cause now the boys are back in town. No strings to hold them down down. 
(Chorus) 
Don't be mad please, stop the hating just be glad that they'll be waiting, 
Friends we have aren't ever changing 
You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go. 
Kids are learning fast they know the t-birds kick some ass 
Be sure that there's no coming last cause you're on their side (their side) 
It always looks so cool when spaceships come out of the pool 
You know that you'd just be a fool to be a bad guy (bad guy)

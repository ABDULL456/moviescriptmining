RICK I gotta admit I never thought you'd be back after the great "Bowsprit Affair". 
TOD Me and Skipper had a meeting of the minds. 
CHARLIE How's that? 
TOD I begged. 
CHUCK (warming a little) What the "Bowsprit Affair"? 
RICK Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit. 
TOD Not just any 'local' girl. 
RICK The 'local' mayor's 'local' daughter. 
Tod smiles, reminiscing. 
CHARLIE Thing is, the net in the basket isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o wraps them up in the jib.  After the deed was done... 
RICK He says they did the deed... 
TOD Trust me, we did the deed. 
CHARLIE After the "alleged" deed was done, they fell asleep.  Big Daddy Lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears Casanova sawing logs. 
TOD Believe me, I needed the rest... 
CHARLIE He gets the whole crew on deck, gets us on the halyard, and orders the old "heave ho...". 
RICK Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o and the mayor's daughter, naked as pilot whales... 
CHARLIE (to Tod) I don't know who was more surprised, you or Big Daddy. 
TOD To tell you the truth, I think it was her father. 
At the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view. 
RICK Well gentlemen, there she is. 
The cab stops.  Besides many colorful fishing boats, is the ALBATROSS.  At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything in the harbor.  Her white hull glows like ivory and her twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck. Breathtaking. 
CHARLIE Home sweet hell on the water. 
EXT.  DOCK - DAY 
The boys pile out of the taxi.  What seemed like a pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up close.  The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover the hull.  Looks of disappointment. 
CHUCK What happened to it? 
A voice from behind turns Chuck. 
BILL She cleans up.  We'll have her ship shape before we shove off. 
This is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew and... first mate.  Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on the back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Viking giant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's English professor. 
Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at Tod and the others.  He speaks with the voice of Moses. 
LAWFORD "That this same child of honor and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. For every honor sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head.  My shames redoubled!  For the time will come... 
Chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins. Their eyes lock. 
LAWFORD ... That I shall make this northern youth exchange, his glorious deeds for my indignities." 
Then, the man is gone.  Haunting.  Only Chuck has seen him.  Tod smiles back at Lawford impishly. 
TOD Would you be addressing me, sir? 
LAWFORD I would. 
RICK What's that supposed to mean? 
LAWFORD (beat) Henry the IV part I Act I Scene ii. I suggest you read it. 
Lawford sneers and walks away.  It's all a show. 
CHARLIE It means Shakespeare.  B-o-r-i-n-g. 
BILL It means if he catches anybody basket-napping on watch this passage, he's gonna use their lizard for 'cuda' bait. 
RICK (lightly) Well that's a hell of a how-do-you- do. 
BILL Drop your gear, go below and pick yourself some bunks. 
Chuck and the others climb aboard. 
INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY 
Chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main cabin.  Other crew members are already unpacking. 
The sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of bunks on each side of the cabin.  In the middle of the room is a gimbaled table.  This is where the crew will eat and study. 
RICK Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg. 
Among the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub with soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and rodent-like. 
Robin approaches with a hand extended.  He carries a 8x10 photo of a young man in a football uniform. 
ROBIN I'm Robin. 
Chuck regards the photo.

RACHEL I guess. I mean, you seem pretty normal. 
SUE Thanks. i try. You visit your moat often? 
SUE Is that scary for you? 
RACHEL Why? 
SUE Well, children of schizophrenics sometimes live with the fear of it happening to them. At your age, it's perfectly normal to be afraid of turning out like your parents. 
RACHEL Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm ten times more likely to get it than most people. 
SUE You're right. I'm sorry. So. You've been in a series of foster homes since you were, what, four? 
RACHEL N 
SUE How's your foster family? 
RACHEL They're happy, - 'z-rig as they get their check every month. 
SUE What about your real father? 
RACHEL Never met the gentleman. My mom won't even tell me his name. RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the edge of the desk. 
SUE Rachel, in a way, you've lost your mother. And now you've lost a friend. Losing someone can be a very lonely, painful place to be. 
RACHEL 
(QUIETLY) You're right, I.lost my mom, I lost my, friend, the people who cared about me. But you only get paid to care. 
SUE I really do care. How can I show you that I do? RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG. 
SUE Rachel? But RACHEL's shut off, pushing down a storm of emotions. 
SUE You know, this room is a place where if you have feelings, you can talk about them. You can let them out. RACHEL shifts. SUE sees RACHEL's forearm near the coffee MUG. And, as if by proximity alone, it EDGES off the end of the desk -- And FALLS -- RACHEL catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits. 
RACHEL sorry. I must've knocked it. SUE, the color draining from her face. 
SUE I didn't... see you knock it. 
The DOOR swings open and the PRINCIPAL walks in, lays a computer printout on her desk. 
PRINCIPAL Sue, could you update the absentee lists, see who we have to call? 
SUE 
(DAZED) ure... sure. She turns, and RACHEL is gone. 
NT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY ERIC is at his locker, wearing his BULLDOG letter jacket. He closes his locker to find RACHEL approaching him, intimidated, but determined. She looks him in the eyes. 
RACHEL 
(LOW) know. I know what you did. A chill goes through him. Not saying a word, he turns, walks through the crowd, looks back. She's still rooted, staring him down. 
EXT. FREAK HALL - LUNCH 
ARNIE plays hackey-sack behind RACHEL, who sits on the steps. She looks up, sees a BULLDOG letter jacket standing over her. It's JESSE. 
JESSE Hi. How's Walter? 
RACHEL

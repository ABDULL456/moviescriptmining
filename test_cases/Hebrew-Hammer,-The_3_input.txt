He approaches FOREGROUND, and pulls out something from his jacket pocket. 
We see a CU of the same matchbook the elf gave him. "DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN." 
He lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. We hear the sounds of bursting flames. 
The Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past the camera. 
We pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
PUSHERMAN MONTAGE 
Curtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys in an a alley. The SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THIRDS as we see CU's of each character smiling. Stills are constantly replaced in time with the music. We see a still of MONEY BEING EXCHANGED, then HANDS BEING SHAKEN. Then a still of a VIDEOCASSETTE BEING PLACED INTO A VCR, A HASIDIC KID WATCHING THE TV, etc. The music continues as we...

INT. JEWISH HOME - DAY 
Maccabee, the same kid the Hammer gave the Hanukkah present to earlier in the film, sits glued to his television set. O.S. from the television we hear someone approximating Zuzu from the film 'It's A Wonderful Life' say... 
TELEVISION SET Papa, Papa! Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings! 
A JEWISH MOTHER calls to her son from O.S. 
JEWISH MOTHER (O.S.) Maccabee! It's time to light the menorah! 
Maccabee looks over his shoulder in disgust, and then CRANKS UP THE VOLUME on the film until all other sounds are drowned out.

INT. ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - NIGHT 
A second ADDICT JEWISH CHILD is glued to his TV set. Drool slowly makes its way down his chin. He gets up, and we FOLLOW him into the living room where we find his PARENTS. His father reads a newspaper, while his mother is absorbed in her knitting. 
ADDICT JEWISH CHILD Mom, dad. How come you made me Jewish? 
His parents look to one another in absolute shock.

INT. YET ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - DAY 
An ADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY backs his way through the front door into the kitchen. He's carrying an incredibly large CHRISTMAS TREE. 
We cut to a shot of HIS FAMILY, who watch this all go down as they sit at the kitchen table. 
The Adolescent Hasid finally gets the tree into the house, and turns to see the rest of his family staring at him, mouths agape. 
ADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY What? It's a Hanukkah bush. 
The family remains expressionless. 
The glass in his mother's hand, slips from her grasp and shatters on the kitchen floor.

One bathroom. \nBella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and Rene, on vacation, beaming with love. \nCHARLIE I'll just put these up in your room \nBELLA I can do it \nThey both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly. Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs. \n10 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY 10 \nAn antique rolltop desk sits in a corner. The room is filled with childhood remnants that have seen better days. As she unpacks her CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her. She sits heavily on the edge of the bed, tears threatening.. \nThen we hear a HONK outside. Bella runs across the hall and looks out the window to see \n11 OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up... 11 \nEXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nBella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of childish roundness in his face. The two of them help Jacob's father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair. \nCHARLIE Bella, you remember Billy Black. \nBILLY Glad you're finally here. Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming. \nCHARLIE Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill. \nBILLY Right after I ram you in the ankles. \nBilly takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella. \nJACOB I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids. \nBELLA Yeah... I think I remember.. (re: the dads) Are they always like this? \nJACOB It's getting worse with old age. \nCharlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella \nCHARLIE So what do you think of your homecoming gift? \nBELLA No way. The truck is for me? \nCHARLIE Just bought it off Billy, here. \nJACOB I rebuilt the engine and - \nBELLA It's perfect! \nShe beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her. She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her. \nJACOB Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but - \nHe hands her the keys as she climbs in. \nBELLA Maybe I can give you a ride to school. \nJACOB I go to school on the reservation. \nBELLA Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person. \nAs she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT \n12 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY 12 \nLoud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified. All eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in a PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers. She slinks toward school, as we begin \n13 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - A SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 13 \n-- Bella (never without her IPOD) makes her way thru kids who stare openly; a few brave ones say hi. They're all talking about her. This is her hell. -- Bella wanders the walkways looking for room numbers, lost. -- Constant stares at Bella, the outsider.. SERIES ENDS when a sweet, nerd-cute, motor mouth boy, ERIC, appears in her path. \nERIC You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on. \nBella just looks at him. Is he for real? \nBELLA I'm kind of the \u0093suffer in silence\u0094 type. \nERIC Good headline for your feature I'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page. \nBELLA I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all \nERIC Whoa, chillax. No feature. \nBELLA \n(relieved) Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class? \nHe leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes from them \n", "test1_true": "INT. GYM - DAY 14 \nThe boys' basketball team runs drills on half the basketball court. A girls' volleyball game occupies the other half. \nBella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it's radioactive. An energetic, athletic team captain, JESSICA, motivates the players. \nJESSICA Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack! \nUnfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella. She closes her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it. It flies off court \n-- and beans a basketball player in the head. He is MIKE NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. \nMIKE Ow! \nBELLA (hurries to him, \nembarrassed) Are you alright? I warned them not to make me play. \nMIKE It's only a flesh wound. \nMike grins and she smiles, relieved. A BELL RINGS, class over. \nMIKE You're Isabella, right? \nBELLA Just Bella. \nMIKE I'm Mike. Newton. \nHe looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her - Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. Subtle, but possessive as she nudges Mike. \nJESSICA She's got a great spike, doesn't she? \n(to Bella) So, you're from Arizona, right? Aren't people supposed to be tan down there? \nBELLA That's why they kicked me out. \nMike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does. Bella just feels uncomfortable with the attention.. \n15 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 15 \nFOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to a table. Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella. \nERIC Mike, you met my home girl Bella. \nMIKE Your home girl? \nJESSICA \n(to Bella) It's first grade all over again, and you're the shiny new toy. \nBella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, low key, insecure friend. \nANGELA Sorry, needed a candid for the feature \nERIC Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again. \n(to Bella) I got your back, baby. \nANGELA \n(disappointed) Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking. \nBELLA Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team \nANGELA -- Wait, that's a good one.. \nBut Bella's attention is now riveted to \nBELLA'S POV - THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE CAFETERIA \nThey swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS. Two guys, two girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes.. and all devastatingly beautiful. \nThey move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat at a table furthest from Bella's. Bella leans over to Jessica and Angela. \nBELLA Who are they? \nANGELA The Cullens. \nJessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode. \nJESSICA Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago. \nANGELA They kinda keep to themselves. \nJESSICA Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.. \nON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it. Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight lifter, but a playful glint in his eye. \nJESSICA ... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal. \n", "test1_id": 1284, "test2_input": "ANGELA Jess, they're not actually related. \nJESSICA But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird.. \nON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. \nJESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. I mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker. \nANGELA Maybe he'll adopt me. \nBella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter \nEDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him. \nBELLA Who's he? \nJESSICA That's Edward Cullen. \nSuddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems.. confused. Bella quickly looks away. \nJESSICA He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care. \n(she obviously does) Anyway, don't waste your time. \nBELLA I wasn't planning on it. \nBut Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair. \n16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16 \nA room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella and Mike enter. \nMike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes \nEDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as she passes Edward's table.. \nSLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts a piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his back as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. \nMr. Molina takes Bella's class slip. \nMR. MOLINA Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best you can till you get caught up. \nMr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when \nON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill.. \nBella knocks someone's book bag off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. \nMR. MOLINA \n(to the class, animated) \nToday we'll be observing the behavior \nof planaria, a.k.a flatworms. \nAs Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table \nMR. MOLINA We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms.. \nBella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible. \nBella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. Then she sniffs her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr. Molina hands Edward two petri dishes. \nMR. MOLINA ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won't die. \nEdward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. \nShe can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure.. \n17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17 \n-- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; he's gone. \n18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18 \nBella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees \nEDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 40's. He doesn't see Bella enter. \nEDWARD \nThere must be something open sixth \nperiod. Physics? Biochem? \nADMINISTRATOR \nNo, every class is full. I'm \nafraid you'll have to stay in \n", "test2_true": "Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and gestures for her to wait a minute. \nBut Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes. She backs to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear. \nEDWARD (to the Administrator) I'll just... endure it. \nHe strides out the door. Off Bella.. \n19 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 19 \nEdward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches \n20 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) 20 \n-- and closes the door. Her eyes well... but she fights it, getting mad. \nBELLA Jerk. \nAs she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH \nSMASH TO: \n21 ECU ON A SECURITY GUARD - IN THE DARKNESS 21 \nExtremely tight on his terrified FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound. INCLUDE \n22 INT. GRISHAM MILL - LATE AFTERNOON 22 \n--He's crouched in a dark corner. But then he sees a SHADOW move blindingly fast past him. He jerks around, then another SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He BOLTS! \nHe runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of the mill striating him. He moves as fast as humanly possible \nUNKNOWN POV - ON THE SECURITY GUARD FROM SEVERAL FLOORS BELOW \nUNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to \nTHE SECURITY GUARD \n-- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his shoulder with terror. UNKNOWN POV is closing in on him, but then he BOLTS out a door \n23 EXT. GRISHAM MILL (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON 23 \n-- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching over the side, into the air \n-- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing. A HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING.. \n24 INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON 24 \nON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie. He shares a table with Bella. INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 30's. She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her. \nSeveral LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie's oblivious. \nCORA \nCan't get over how grown up you \nare. And so gorgeous. \nBella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak. A bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella \nWAYLON \u0091Member me, honey? I was Santa one year. \nCHARLIE Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four. \nWAYLON Bet I made an impression, though. \nCHARLIE You always do. \nCORA Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. \n(to Bella) When you're done, I'll bring your favorite - berry cobbler. Remember? Your dad still has it. Every Thursday. \nBELLA (doesn't remember at all) That'd be great, thank you. \nCora shoos Waylon away. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella both reach for the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes for the ketchup instead. Silence as they eat. \nA burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to emphasize their discomfort. Bella tries to bridge the gap. \nBELLA So... you eat here every night? \nCHARLIE Easier than washing dishes. \nBELLA I can cook. \nHe looks up, as if confused by the concept. \nBELLA I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen. \nCHARLIE I remember.. \n", "test2_id": 1285, "test3_input": "BELLA He died? How? \nDR. CULLEN Animal attack. \nBELLA The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason? \nEdward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it. \nDR. CULLEN Most likely. \nBELLA So it's getting closer to town. \nEDWARD Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south. \nBELLA But that's \nDR. CULLEN (with a kind, reassuring \nsmile) Bella, you should go inside. Waylon was your father's friend. \nShe goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this. \n65 INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 65 \nBella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death. Deputies come and go in the background. Bella approaches Charlie. He looks up. \nBELLA Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon. \nCHARLIE Known him going on thirty years. \nHe's obviously torn up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do. And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat.. \nThen Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, then projects a confident manner. \nCHARLIE We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the meantime.. \nAs an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY. \nCHARLIE ... I want you to have this. \nBELLA That's probably not a good \nCHARLIE It'll give me some peace of mind. \nShe sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her purse. \nAs Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE \nA66 EXT.

BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT 66 \n-- as she turns on the LIGHT. She hears a SNAP! outside the window. She rises, digs into her purse for the PEPPER SPRAY Charlie gave her, and goes to the window. She looks out - all she sees is the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled. \nShe closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within reach. \nINSERT THE BOOK, \u0093QUILEUTE FOLK STORIES AND ART. \nAs she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS. Comical, menacing, haunting... then she stops on a photo of a white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth. THE INSCRIPTION reads, \u0093The Cold One. \nBella quickly goes to her computer and Googles \u0093Cold One \u0094 - several beer ads appear. Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, revealing a link to: \u0093The Cold One: Apotamkin\u0094 - \nINTERCUT BETWEEN BELLA AND THE COMPUTER SCREEN \nSeveral PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, paintings.

FOREST - DAY 68 Bella stands amid the trees, waiting. Then the SOUNDS OF THE FOREST abruptly drop out. A predator is near. Edward appears behind her. She doesn't turn around. A beat. \nBELLA You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time. \n(turns to face him now) You never eat food, or drink, or come out in the sunlight. And you said no to the beach trip only after you heard where it was. Because of the treaty. \nThis last registers with him. She steps closer to him. \nBELLA How old are you? \nEDWARD Seventeen. \nBELLA How long have you been seventeen? \nA long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM. He sees he can't hide anymore. Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it. \nEDWARD ... A while. \nShe inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE THEM FASTER \nBELLA I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are. \nEDWARD Say it. Out loud. Say it. \nAll sound suddenly DROPS OUT. We hear only her whisper.. \nBELLA ... Vampire \nThey seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her reality utterly rocked. \nEDWARD Are you afraid? \nBELLA No. \nEDWARD \n(angry) Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat? \nBELLA You won't hurt me. You're different. \nEDWARD You think you know me? \nHe glares at her. She holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes her by the hand. Starts walking. \nBELLA Where are we going? \nEDWARD Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what I really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun. \nBELLA No! The sunlight will kill you. \nEDWARD Myth. You need to see the truth. \nHe pulls her but she stumbles. \nBELLA Slow down. \nSuddenly, he's right next to her. \nEDWARD Are you afraid? \nBELLA No. \nEDWARD Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where I could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you. \nTheir proximity is intense, riveting both of them. \nBELLA I'm not afraid. \nEDWARD \nYou should be. \nHe abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms. \nEDWARD Hold on. \nThen he flings her onto his back... and starts running. \n69 EXT. FOREST - RUNNING - DAY 69 \nAs in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster.

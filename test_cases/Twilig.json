{"train": "TWILIGHT \nWritten by \nMelissa Rosenberg \nBased on the novel by \nStephenie Meyer \nSHOOTING DRAFT February 11, 2008 \nFADE IN: \n1 EXT. RAIN FOREST, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON - DAWN \nMoss-draped. Shadow-drenched. Tortured tree trunks twist upward, reaching for rare sunlight. \nBELLA (V.O.) I'd never given much thought to how I would die.. \nSuddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. \nThen, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast. \nUNKNOWN POV - MOVING \nTrees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying. Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey - \nA DEER \n-- running for its life as it darts through this maze of a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, about to emerge from the shadowy darkness - \nThe deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM! \nThe deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen. HOLD ON WHITENESS \nBELLA (V.O.) \nBut dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.. \n-- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of - \n2 ISABELLA SWAN, 172 \nEyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable, introverted, imperfect beauty. \nBELLA (V.O.) \n... So I can't bring myself to regret the decision that brought me here to die... \nThe background comes into focus as we realize we're now in - \nEXT. SCOTTSDALE, AZ - DAY \nBella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge. The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot. \nBELLA (V.O.) \n... The decision to leave home. \nShe stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until \nBLONDE #1 (O.S.) Bye, Bella! \nBELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET \nThree tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave. \nBLONDE # Good luck at your new school! \nThey ADLIB superficial good wishes, \"Don't forget to write;\" \n\"We'll miss you.\" Bella waves back, sweetly, but halfheartedly as she steps off the curb. \nBELLA Have a good.. \n--and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone. \nBELLA ... life. \nClearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as - \nBELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She thrusts a cell phone at Bella. \nRENE It won't work again, baby. \nBELLA You put it on hold. \nRENE I did? \nBELLA Look. You also called Mexico. \nANGELA Jess, they're not actually related. \nJESSICA But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird.. \nON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. \nJESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. I mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker. \nANGELA Maybe he'll adopt me. \nBella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter \nEDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him. \nBELLA Who's he? \nJESSICA That's Edward Cullen. \nSuddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems.. confused. Bella quickly looks away. \nJESSICA He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care. \n(she obviously does) Anyway, don't waste your time. \nBELLA I wasn't planning on it. \nBut Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair. \n16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16 \nA room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella and Mike enter. \nMike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes \nEDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as she passes Edward's table.. \nSLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts a piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his back as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. \nMr. Molina takes Bella's class slip. \nMR. MOLINA Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best you can till you get caught up. \nMr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when \nON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill.. \nBella knocks someone's book bag off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. \nMR. MOLINA \n(to the class, animated) \nToday we'll be observing the behavior \nof planaria, a.k.a flatworms. \nAs Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table \nMR. MOLINA We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms.. \nBella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible. \nBella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. Then she sniffs her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr. Molina hands Edward two petri dishes. \nMR. MOLINA ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won't die. \nEdward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. \nShe can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure.. \n17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17 \n-- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; he's gone. \n18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18 \nBella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees \nEDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 40's. He doesn't see Bella enter. \nEDWARD \nThere must be something open sixth \nperiod. Physics? Biochem? \nADMINISTRATOR \nNo, every class is full. I'm \nafraid you'll have to stay in \nThey both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner. \nCHARLIE How was school? Meet anyone? \nBELLA A few people... Do you know the Cullen family? \nCHARLIE (looks up sharply) Are people talking about them again? \nBELLA No... well, a little. \nCHARLIE Just \u0091cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like a lot of the hell-raisers around here. \nBELLA ... Okay. \nCHARLIE I just don't like narrow mindedness. \nAnd he returns to his food. Silence. \n25 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT 25 \nBella looks out at the fog as she talks on the phone. \nRENE (O.S. If spring training goes well, we could be living in Florida permanently. \nTELEPHONE OPERATOR (O.S.) Please insert 25 cents to continue. \nBELLA Mom, where's your cell? \nINTERCUT WITH: \n26 EXT. GAS STATION/GARAGE - NIGHT 26 \nRene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand. In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on the Subaru engine. \nRENE Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now. \nBella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone quarters. \nRENE \nNow, tell me more about your \nschool, baby. What are the kids \nlike? Are there any cute guys? \nAre they being nice to you? \nBELLA \n(a beat, lying) \nThey've all been really.. \nwelcoming. \nPUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as.. \nFLASH POP TO -EDWARD'S FACE, HIS COAL BLACK EYES, THE FURY.. \nSMASH TO: \n27 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL) 27 \nON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap. But her eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull in. She's waiting for Edward. \nJessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball nearby. They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, declining... and returns to watching for Edward. Her face tells us she's ready for a confrontation. \n28 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - SAME DAY 28 \nBella strides in... but stops, surprised to find her lab table empty. Off Bella, frustrated.. \nBEGIN A SERIES OF SCENES OVER SEVERAL DAYS: \n29 INT. CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY 29 \nBella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video on their phone. Bella gives it a cursory look, but is focused on the Cullen table --only four of them. Edward's seat is empty.. \n30 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DIFFERENT DAY 30 \nBella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to find Rosalie and Alice behind her. They study Bella, Rosalie with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity. Bella, uneasy, hurries out. \n31 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - DIFFERENT DAY 31 \nBella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part of this circle. \nShe now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to her friends, finally forgetting about him.. \nSERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to 32 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 32 It's neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella's given it her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs her book bag BELLA Dad, I'm heading out. 33 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING 33 ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight. BELLA Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck. BELLA Dad, I can drive myself to school. \nAs she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's watching her - UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on a \nShe slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens. \nEDWARD Prophase. \nBELLA (muttering) Like I said. \nHe writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort. \nEDWARD Enjoying the rain? \nBELLA Seriously? You're asking me about the weather? \nEDWARD It appears. \nBELLA No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. \nIs that a smile playing on his lips? For the first time, he seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating. \nBELLA \nWhat? \nHe shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out \nthe slides. She looks at him. And keeps looking.. \nBELLA'S POV - ECU ON EDWARD'S FACE \nHis cheekbones, his lips. So perfect, like a sculpture.. EDWARD \nAnaphase. She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. BELLA May I? \n(she looks through the lens) Anaphase. \nEDWARD Like I said. \nShe glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply holds out her hand for another slide. \nEDWARD \n(handing her the slide) If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental U.S. \nBELLA It's complicated. \nEDWARD I think I can keep up. \nHe actually seems interested. She looks into the microscope as \nBELLA My mother remarried. \nEDWARD Very complex. So you don't like him. \nBELLA Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough. \n(re: the slide) Interphase. \nCUT ON THE SCHOOL BELL: \n36 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 36 \nBella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of her. \nEDWARD \nWhy didn't you stay with your mom \nand stepdad? \nHe waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher her. She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled. \nBELLA \nAlright, Phil's a minor league \nbaseball player, so he travels a \nlot. My mother stayed home with me \nbut it made her unhappy. So I \ndecided to spend time with my \nfather. \nEDWARD But now you're unhappy. \nBELLA No... I -- I just.. \nBella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable. \nEDWARD \nCharlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them. \nBELLA It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way. \nCHARLIE Edward? Your boy? \nDr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart. Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows something. She presses. \nBELLA It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me. \nDR. CULLEN (smiles) As long as you're safe. \nINT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - DAY 39 \nCharlie and Bella exit the treatment area. \nCHARLIE I just have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom. \nBELLA You told her?! She's probably freaking. \nHe shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head, pulls out her cell phone. Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall.. \nBELLA'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN \nRosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground. Dr. Cullen plays intermediary. \nROSALIE This isn't just about you, it's about all of us - \nDr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie \nDR. CULLEN Let's take this in my office. \nRosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen. Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined. \nBELLA Can I talk to you for a moment? (off his nod) How did you get over to me so quickly? \nEDWARD I was standing right next to you. \nBELLA You were next to your car, across the lot. \nHe steps closer to her. His expression turns icy hard. \nEDWARD \nNo, I wasn't. \nShe won't be bullied. Steps closer to him. \nBELLA Yes. You were. \nEDWARD You're confused. You hit your head. \nBELLA I know what I saw. \nEDWARD And what, exactly, was that? \nBELLA You stopped that van. You pushed it away. \nEDWARD No one will believe that. \nBELLA I wasn't planning to tell anyone. \nThis registers with Edward. They're inches from each other, the tension thick. \nBELLA I just want to know the truth. \nEDWARD Can't you just thank me and get over it? \nBELLA \nThank you. \nA long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and without a doubt, attracted. \nEDWARD You're not going to let it go, are you? \nBELLA No. \nEDWARD (turns, walks away) Then I hope you enjoy disappointment. \nBELLA Why did you even bother? \nHe stops, a beat. Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. \nEDWARD ... I don't know. \nAnd he keeps walking. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth. \nBELLA (V.O. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.. \n40 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 40 \nJESSICA Guess who just asked me to prom! \nBella smiles. \nJESSICA I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird? \nBELLA No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together. \nJESSICA I know, right? \nGiddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela. Bella heads out the door that leads to \nEXT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - THE BUSES (CONTINUOUS)44 \n--where everyone's looking at the COMPOST \u0093WORM BOX\u0094, grossing each other out with the slimy creatures. As Bella backs away, Edward steps up. \nEDWARD Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends. \nBELLA \n(wounded) Too bad you didn't figure that out earlier. \n(MORE) \nBELLA (cont'd) You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret. \nEDWARD (snapping, angry) You think I regret saving you? \nBELLA I know you do. \nEDWARD (furious) You don't know anything. \nHis harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity. \nALICE The bus is leaving. (to Bella) Hi. Will you be riding with us? \nEDWARD No. Our bus is full. \nHe purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it. \nINT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 45 \nBella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry. She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen. \nCHARLIE Your mother called. Again. \nBELLA Your fault, for telling her about the accident. \nCHARLIE She always did know how to worry. \n(hint of sadness) But... she's changed, too. She seems happy. Phil sounds all right. \nBELLA He is. \nShe continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO. Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT - \n46 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - ON BELLA'S FACE - DAY 46 \n-- as she pushes through the doors. She glances over at the CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings. He doesn't look at her. Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, Jessica, Mike and Angela. She drops her book bag on a seat \nERIC La Push, baby. You in? \nBELLA Should I know what that means? \nMIKE La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We're all going after school. Big swell coming in. \nERIC And I don't just surf the internet. \nJESSICA Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board. \nANGELA There's whale watching, too. Come with. \nERIC La Push, baby. \nBELLA I'll go if you stop saying that. \n47 THE SALAD BAR STATION - MINUTES LATER 47 \nBella artfully designs an architectural salad. As she reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her \nEDWARD (charmed) Edible art.. \nStartled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin. He presents it to her with small smile. \nBELLA Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash. \nEDWARD I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be. \nBELLA What does that even mean? \nEDWARD It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me. \nBella gives him her best alluring smile. \nBELLA I can keep a secret.. \nJACOB \n(laughing) It's just an old scary story. Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves? \nBELLA Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? \nJacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue.. \nBELLA So the legend about the Cullens is.. \nJACOB Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like.. \n(in a spooky voice) \n\u0093enemy clan.\u0094 ... But they claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them. \nBELLA Didn't they just move here? \nJACOB Or just moved back. \nBELLA Riiiight. So what was this treaty? \nJACOB \n(whispering) If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces.. \nJacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. \nGIRL (O.S) AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!! \nBella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and starts back to the group. \nBELLA Wait... what were they really? \nJACOB (laughing) It's just a story, Bella. \nOff Bella, with more unanswered questions.. \n50 EXT. SHACK COMMUNITY ON THE RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON 50 \nA collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by wood plank sidewalks. FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman. \nHis old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his Walkman.. \nSuddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice. \nSTAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and realizes the dog's gone. \nWAYLON Jerry? \nWaylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from under a bush. \nWAYLON Come on, Jerry, you old mutt.. \nHe pulls at the leg. It's detached. He reels back, stumbling onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out \nON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely. \nWAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river. Ominous darkness. A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins \nA MAN - now stands on the bow. JAMES, 30, pale white. A vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike movements are always on the edge of a crouch. \nWAYLON H-how did you do that? \nJAMES Always the same inane questions.. \nWaylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA, 26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods. Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot. \nJAMES \u0093What do you want? \nVICTORIA \u0093Why are you doing this? \nLAURENT (sighs, slight French accent) ... James, must we? \nJAMES The question should be, \u0093will it hurt? \nVictoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE \nSMASH TO BLACK: \n51 FADE IN ON EDWARD'S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS 51 \nSNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips.. \n52 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON HER FACE - MORNING 52 \nAs she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought. She shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine \u0093Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.\u0094 An AD pops up, \u0093Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.\u0094 Bella, intrigued, clicks on it.. \nBELLA He died? How? \nDR. CULLEN Animal attack. \nBELLA The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason? \nEdward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it. \nDR. CULLEN Most likely. \nBELLA So it's getting closer to town. \nEDWARD Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south. \nBELLA But that's \nDR. CULLEN (with a kind, reassuring \nsmile) Bella, you should go inside. Waylon was your father's friend. \nShe goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this. \n65 INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 65 \nBella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death. Deputies come and go in the background. Bella approaches Charlie. He looks up. \nBELLA Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon. \nCHARLIE Known him going on thirty years. \nHe's obviously torn up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do. And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat.. \nThen Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, then projects a confident manner. \nCHARLIE We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the meantime.. \nAs an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY. \nCHARLIE ... I want you to have this. \nBELLA That's probably not a good \nCHARLIE It'll give me some peace of mind. \nShe sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her purse. \nAs Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE \nA66 EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - BELLA'S POV A66 \nTwo Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance. On it, Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under a sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle. Off Bella, chilled.. \nSMASH TO: \nFLASH POP TO EDWARD'S BLACK EYES \nFLASH POP TO EDWARD'S COLD WHITE HAND. \nFLASH POP TO THE FIVE CULLENS, SLOW MOTION, beautiful and white. \nFLASH POP TO WAYLON'S TWISTED WHITE FEET \nINT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT 66 \n-- as she turns on the LIGHT. She hears a SNAP! outside the window. She rises, digs into her purse for the PEPPER SPRAY Charlie gave her, and goes to the window. She looks out - all she sees is the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled. \nShe closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within reach. \nINSERT THE BOOK, \u0093QUILEUTE FOLK STORIES AND ART. \nAs she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS. Comical, menacing, haunting... then she stops on a photo of a white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth. THE INSCRIPTION reads, \u0093The Cold One. \nBella quickly goes to her computer and Googles \u0093Cold One \u0094 - several beer ads appear. Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, revealing a link to: \u0093The Cold One: Apotamkin\u0094 - \nINTERCUT BETWEEN BELLA AND THE COMPUTER SCREEN \nSeveral PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, paintings. Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring innocent maidens... it's all murder, blood, sexuality. \nTHEN SEVERAL WORDS LEAP OUT in quick succession: \n-- \u0093Speed.\u0094 \u0093Strength.\u0094 \u0093Cold skinned.\u0094 \u0093Immortal... Then finally: \u0093Blood drinker. \nAnd we LAND ON A PICTURE OF A HANDSOME MAN BITING A WOMAN'S WHITE NECK.. \nFLASH POP TO THE SAME PICTURE AS IT MOMENTARILY COMES ALIVE, BUT NOW IT'S EDWARD BITING BELLA'S NECK, BLOOD DRIPPING \nBACK ON BELLA - she reels back from the computer in utter disbelief. BELLA ... it's not possible.. Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all.. MATCH CUT: \nEXT. SCHOOL -LAWN -ON BELLA'S FACE -DAWN --THICK FOG 67 She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn. Her expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief. STAY ON HER FACE, TIME LAPSING AS: \nThe bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as she stands still, waiting.. \nBut she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead \nTHE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly- \nBella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree. All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she realizes she's alone. \nBELLA Edward? Where are you? \nShe rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into \n70 EXT. A MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 70 \nA perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery sunlight. HEAR a stream nearby. Bella looks around and finally sees \nEDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes a deep breath, and steps out of the shade \nEDWARD \nThis is why we don't show ourselves \nin sunlight.. \nAs the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He moves toward her. \nEDWARD This is what I am. \nHe nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but.. \nBELLA You're... beautiful.. \nHe realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again. \nEDWARD \n(appalled) Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. This is the skin of a killer. \nHis arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again. \nBELLA I don't believe that. \nEDWARD Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that.. \nHe's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by a tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands \nEDWARD As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off. \nHe abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against a tree trunk with explosive force. \nBella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. \nEDWARD I'm designed to kill. \nBELLA I don't care. \nEDWARD I've killed people. \nBELLA It doesn't matter. \nEDWARD I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you. \nBELLA I trust you. \nEDWARD Don't. \nBELLA I trust you, Edward. I'm here. \nShe takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone. \nBELLA Edward? \nShe looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, catching his breath. \nEDWARD You... took me by surprise. (collecting himself) I don't know how to... do this. \nHe moves back toward her. Slowly. \nEDWARD Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.. \n(shaking his head) But you - your scent, it's like a drug to me... my own personal brand of heroin. \nBELLA (realizing) Oh... I thought you hated me when we met. \nEDWARD I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself. \nHe reaches her again. \nBELLA I know you can. \nHe's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her face for clues. \nEDWARD I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes.. \n-- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain. The other's follow - \nBELLA I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know.. \nESME Of course. That was very considerate of you. \nEDWARD (re: Rosalie) Ignore her. I do. \nROSALIE Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us. \nBELLA I would never, ever tell anyone. \nDR. CULLEN (reassuring) She knows that. \nEMMETT The problem is, you two have gone public now, so.. \nESME \nEmmett. \nROSALIE No, she should know. \n(to Bella) The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly. \nBELLA ... Badly? \nThis hangs in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her. \nBELLA \n(realizing) Oh. Badly. Like, where I become a meal. \nEmmett chokes back laughter. Edward grins. Wraps his arm around Bella. Even Esme has to chuckle. \nRosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen. Emmett shrugs, goes after her. \nALICE (O.S. Hi, Bella! \nON THE BALCONY Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet of wildflowers. Jasper follows her. She bounces forward to kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers. \nALICE \nI'm Alice. You do smell good. EDWARD Alice. ALICE \nIt's alright, Bella and I are going to be great friends. \nBELLA (extending her hand) And you're Jasper, right? \nJASPER Pleasure to meet you. \nBut he shies away from her hand. \nALICE (gently encouraging) You won't hurt her, Jasper. \nHe isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead. \nEDWARD I'll give you a tour of the house. \nALICE (with meaning) I'll see you soon. \nEdward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides her up the stairs. As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden China, Asian scrolls. They reach \nTHE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels. Bella looks closer. \nBELLA Graduation caps? \nEDWARD A private joke. We matriculate a lot. \nBELLA What a nightmare, repeating high school. \nEDWARD True, but the younger we start out in a new place, the longer we can stay there. \nShe shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on.. \n85 INT. EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY 85 \nEDWARD ... and this is my room. \nBella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with the river beyond. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up. \nBELLA So you're obsessed with music. But.. (looking around) No bed? \nEDWARD No sleep. \nBELLA Ever? \nEDWARD No nightmares, no drool, no snoring. \nShe considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the titles. \nEDWARD Do you have any favorites? \n-- as Jessica head-butts the ball which hits him in the face. \nANGELA \nOh. My. God. Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen. Jessica and Eric SEE \nBELLA AND EDWARD -- arriving together. All eyes on campus are turning to them, filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy. BELLA Everyone's staring. EDWARD Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile.. \nCLOSE ON A GERMAN SHEPHERD 89 Moving fast, tracking. INCLUDE CHARLIE holding the leash EXT. FOREST - DAY --It's a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men. \nCHARLIE Guys, we got something \nThe Deputies hurry to Charlie. They gather around A FOOTPRINT. The dogs start pulling them in a certain direction. As the posse takes off at a sprint \nUNKNOWN POV - ON CHARLIE, FROM A DISTANCE We watch Charlie and the posse move away... REVERSE to find JAMES - ATOP A KNOLL, WATCHING THEM Laurent stands next to him. Victoria jogs up. \nVICTORIA They took the bait. \nJAMES By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg. \nVictoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt. Pulls him to her. VICTORIA I love when men chase me. \nHe grins, then starts taking off her clothes. They pull each other toward the woods with carnal lust. It barely registers with Laurent, who continues to watch the posse with concern. \n90 EXT./INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON 90 \nBella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her face in check... with minimal success. Outside the door, she passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES. \nMIKE Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen. \nShe shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in. \nBELLA Sorry I'm late. Biology project. \nCora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate of seafood in front of Bella. \nCHARLIE Ordered you the seafood combo. \nBELLA Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak. \nCHARLIE I'm healthy as a horse. \nCORA \n(concerned) Say Chief, boys want to know, you find anything down by Queets River today? \nCharlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too. He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm. \nCHARLIE The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on. \nCORA Hope they catch him fast. \nShe moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an easy rhythm now. \nCHARLIE Your friends are flagging you. \nShe turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles. \nCHARLIE It's okay you wanna join them. I'm just gonna turn in early anyway. \nBELLA Yeah, me, too. \nCHARLIE It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons. \nBELLA He's just a friend. \nCHARLIE None of the boys in town interest you? \nBELLA We're not really going to talk about boys, are we? \nCHARLIE Just... you should be around people. I leave you alone too much. \nBELLA \n(with genuine affection) I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a lot like my dad that way. \nCharlie smiles. These two have come a long way. Cora returns \nCORA Berry cobbler, two forks. \nShe sets it between them. Off them, both reaching for forks.. \n91 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT 91 \nBella, dressed for bed, looks out the window as she talks on the phone with Rene. Bella's euphoria still lingers in her eyes.. \nBELLA So spring training's going well? \nINTERCUT WITH: \n92 INT. CAFE - NIGHT 92 \nHe cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness. \nBELLA Be nice, okay? He's... important. \nCharlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she opens the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves. \nEDWARD Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward. \nEdward extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but grunts a hello, resisting him. \nEDWARD I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family. \nCHARLIE Bella's going to play baseball? \nBella's equally surprised, but hides it. \nEDWARD Yes, sir, that's the plan. \nCHARLIE Well. More power to you, I guess. \nEDWARD (looks him in the eyes) She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise. \nAs Edward exits... Charlie holds Bella back. \nCHARLIE (sotto) You got that pepper spray? \nBELLA \nDad. \n94 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 94 \nEdward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive. \nEDWARD \n(amused) Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school. \nBELLA No fair, reading Charlie's mind. \nAs they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat \nBELLA And since when do vampires like baseball? \nEDWARD It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why. \n95 EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - TWILIGHT 95 \nStorm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. \nEsme and Emmett come to greet Bella. \nESME Good thing you're here. We need a umpire. \nEMMETT (big crooked grin) She thinks we cheat. \nESME I know you cheat. Call \u0091em as you see \u0091em, Bella. \nWHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound. \nALICE It's time. \n-- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest. \nBEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME \nAnd it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward and Emmett take positions in the outfield. \n-- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER. \nBELLA (to Esme) Now I get why you need the thunder. \nThe ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing through the trees. Edward disappears after it. \nBELLA That has to be a home run. \nESME Edward's very fast. \nRosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate. WHAP! Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in. \nBELLA Yer out? \nEsme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe! \nJASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS. \nALICE Stop! I didn't see them.. \nThey all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The family instantly gathers at home plate. \nALICE They're traveling so quickly \n(dark with disgust) I just made this his most exciting game ever. \nBella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as.. \nTHE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD \nA jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until they reach \n97 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 97 \nTHE JEEP speeds wildly down the road. \nEDWARD The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there. \nBELLA \n(horrified) What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of us! \nEDWARD \n(calmly) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow. \nHe angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING \n98 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 98 \nCharlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated- \nBELLA I said, leave me alone! \nEDWARD Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please \nBELLA Get out! It's over. \nShe SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned. \nCHARLIE Bella? What happened? \nBELLA I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. \nBella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her \n99 INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99 \nBella slams the door behind her. REVEAL Edward's already there, pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against the door. \nBELLA (a pained whisper) I can't hurt him. \nEdward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK. \nINTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them. \nCHARLIE Bells. Did he hurt you? \nBELLA No, Dad. \nCHARLIE Then what? Did he break up with you? \nBELLA I broke up with him. \nCHARLIE I thought you liked him? \nBELLA That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home. \nEDWARD (whispering) I'll be in the truck. \nAnd he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into \n100 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STAIRS (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 100 \nBella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows. \nCHARLIE Your mother's not even in Phoenix. \nBELLA She'll come home. I'll call her from the road. \nCHARLIE You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning. \nBELLA I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise. \nShe heads down the stairs. Charlie follows.. \n101 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101 \nBella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels. She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her. \nCHARLIE \nBells, I know I'm not around much, \nbut I can change that. We can do \n(with bloodlust) We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces \nDR. CULLEN I don't relish killing another creature. Even a sadistic one like James. \nROSALIE If he doesn't get to one of us first. \nBELLA \n(horrified) This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me. \nROSALIE Too late. \nEdward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen \nEDWARD I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away \nDR. CULLEN No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you. \nALICE I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will drive her south. \n(facing him) I'll keep her safe, Edward. \nEdward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward. \nEDWARD (studies her, torn) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself? \nShe nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to \nEDWARD Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent. \nROSALIE \n(dropping the clothes) Why should I? What is she to me? Just a danger you've inflicted on us \nDR. CULLEN \n(spinning on her) Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's a part of this family now. And we protect our family. \nShe glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars \nAmid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together. \nBELLA If any of you get hurt because of me \nEDWARD We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you. \nHe pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. \nEDWARD You're my life now. \nThey drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME \n107 EXT. HIGHWAY, PACIFIC NORTHWEST - DAWN 107 \nThe sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame \n108 INT. MERCEDES - SAME 108 \nJasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat. Bella is in the back, her eyes red from crying. She talks on her cell phone \nBELLA \nMom, it's me again. You must have \nlet your phone die. Anyway, I'm \nnot in Forks anymore but I'm okay. \nI'll explain when you call. \nShe hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face - \nA SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT \n-- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash by us. Finally, we land in.. \n109 OMITTED 109 \n110 EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY 110 \nTREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead. \nEdward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone. \n111 OMITTED 111 \n112 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - DAY 112 \nEsme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the river. In the distance, below, they SEE \nTHEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has their scent, they continue over the hill's crest. \nBELLA No... we can't. (then) When will you get here? \nEDWARD In a couple hours. Then you and I will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting. \n(then, determined) Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again. \nOff Bella, her eyes welling.. \n118 EXT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - DAY 118 \nSEE Alice in the lobby, settling the bill. Jasper loads up the car out front. \n119 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY 119 \nBella gathers her things, then her phone RINGS again. \nINSERT CALLER I.D. -It reads \u0093HOME.\u0094 Bella answers - \nBELLA Mom, I'm so glad you got my - \nRENE (O.S. (panicked) Bella? Bella? Where are you? \nBELLA Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every \nHEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone. \nBELLA ... Mom? Are you there? \nThen Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine \nJAMES (O.S. Nice house you have here. Not the best on the block, but comfortable. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n120 INT. RENE'S HOUSE, PHOENIX - DAY 120 \nVERY CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and vicious smile. \nJAMES I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well. \nBella's eyes are wild with fear. \nJAMES I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address. \nRENE (O.S. Bella? Bella?.. \nBELLA Leave my mother out of this. \nJAMES You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that? \nBELLA I... don't think so. \nJAMES If your mother's life depends on it? \nBella is terrified, but there's no choice here. \nBELLA Where should I meet you? \nJames grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to the refrigerator with a magnet. It's the same photo Charlie has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor. \nJAMES The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake. \n(sniffs the air) She smells like you. Delicious. \nSTAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked. She starts flinging open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit. Useless. Then she remembers.. \nHer purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper spray Charlie gave her. She clings to it, her only protection now. \n121 OMITTED 121 \n122 OMITTED 122 \n123 OMITTED 123 \n124 OMITTED 124 \n125 OMITTED 125 \n126 OMITTED 126 \n127 INT./EXT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - TWILIGHT - DRIVING 127 \nBella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion. She slips out the opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the door. The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH. \nBELLA (taking a breath for courage) 8th and Palo Verde, please. \nThe taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW.. \nBELLA (V.O. \nI've never given much thought to \nAmused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it on film. \nJAMES Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well. \nHe advances toward her. \nJAMES Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it. \nHe inhales as if he can taste her already \nJAMES Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really. \nJames flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper spray. He tries to wipe it off. \nJAMES Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me. \nHe STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in agony. \nJAMES Tell Edward how much it hurts. \nAbruptly, the camera is in her face \nJAMES Tell him to avenge you. \nBELLA No! Edward, don't.. \nJames inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face \nVIDEO CAMERA'S POV - ECU ON JAMES' FACE \nJAMES Cut! The end. \nSuddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! \nHe rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column. \nJAMES You're alone... because you're faster than the others. But not stronger. \nJames SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks. \nEDWARD I'm strong enough to kill you. \nEdward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through a freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he and Bella are JERKED downward. \nJames YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks. \nJames crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND \nLooking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony. \nEdward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through the floorboards. \nON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins. \nBELLA'S POV - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of focus. \nHer eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when - \nSuddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle. Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like a baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. \nJames is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of her pain slices through Edward. In an animalistic fury, Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh .. \nWHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR. CULLEN --now standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder. \nEdward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and ALICE, dropping down from the balcony. \nEdward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far. He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and LUNGE at James like a pack of animals. \nDr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in pain. Edward dashes toward her - \nBELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out of focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip out the floorboards and build a fire ... it's like a funeral pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire.. \nBACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side. Dr. Cullen works fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her leg. But clearly her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. \nINTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: \nDr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh - \nDR. CULLEN Her femoral artery's been severed. She's losing too much blood \nBELLA It's on fire! My hand! \nEDWARD Venom - \nDR. CULLEN \n(working on Bella) \nYou have to make a choice. Either \nlet the change happen \n(lowering her voice) I think that boy is in love with you. \nBella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward. \nBELLA Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? I want to talk to him. Apologize. \nRENE I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby. But I\u0091ll go get him. \nRene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches her go. The door shutting behind her. Bella turns back to find Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. \nBELLA Is James - did you -- \nEDWARD We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off. \nShe closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him. \nBELLA I'm alive because of you. \nEDWARD (darkens) You're in here because of me. \nHer wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face. \nEDWARD The worst of it... was thinking I couldn't stop - \nBELLA But you did. \nEDWARD Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore.. \nBELLA What? No! I want to be with you! I don't want \nEDWARD \n(sitting next to her) Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.. \nHe wraps an arm around her. As she curls up in his arms.. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n135 EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - LATE AFTERNOON 135 \nAn AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests. We're back in the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest.. \n136 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEAUTIFUL LATE AFTERNOON 136 \nAt a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife. Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The front door opens and they look up to see \nBELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down. \nBELLA \nAlice lent me the dress. It was the \nonly thing that would fit over my \ncast. Is it too... \nEDWARD \nYou're perfect... I'll take good \ncare of her, Chief. \nCHARLIE Heard that before. \nEdward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back. \nCHARLIE (sotto) I put new pepper spray in your bag. \nBELLA \nDad. \nCHARLIE ... and... you look beautiful. \nFather and daughter share a smile.. \n137 EXT./INT. MANSION, VIEW POINT INN - TWILIGHT 137 \nEdward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones. \nBELLA \nI can't believe you're making me do \nthis. \nHe just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to.. \n138 EXT. MANSION BACKYARD (CONTINUOUS) - TWILIGHT 138 \nTHE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, dance and socialize. \n", "test1_input": "in the bathroom. \nBELLA (grimacing) That's right. One bathroom. \nBella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and Rene, on vacation, beaming with love. \nCHARLIE I'll just put these up in your room \nBELLA I can do it \nThey both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly. Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs. \n10 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY 10 \nAn antique rolltop desk sits in a corner. The room is filled with childhood remnants that have seen better days. As she unpacks her CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her. She sits heavily on the edge of the bed, tears threatening.. \nThen we hear a HONK outside. Bella runs across the hall and looks out the window to see \n11 OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up... 11 \nEXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nBella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of childish roundness in his face. The two of them help Jacob's father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair. \nCHARLIE Bella, you remember Billy Black. \nBILLY Glad you're finally here. Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming. \nCHARLIE Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill. \nBILLY Right after I ram you in the ankles. \nBilly takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella. \nJACOB I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids. \nBELLA Yeah... I think I remember.. (re: the dads) Are they always like this? \nJACOB It's getting worse with old age. \nCharlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella \nCHARLIE So what do you think of your homecoming gift? \nBELLA No way. The truck is for me? \nCHARLIE Just bought it off Billy, here. \nJACOB I rebuilt the engine and - \nBELLA It's perfect! \nShe beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her. She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her. \nJACOB Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but - \nHe hands her the keys as she climbs in. \nBELLA Maybe I can give you a ride to school. \nJACOB I go to school on the reservation. \nBELLA Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person. \nAs she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT \n12 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY 12 \nLoud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified. All eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in a PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers. She slinks toward school, as we begin \n13 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - A SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 13 \n-- Bella (never without her IPOD) makes her way thru kids who stare openly; a few brave ones say hi. They're all talking about her. This is her hell. -- Bella wanders the walkways looking for room numbers, lost. -- Constant stares at Bella, the outsider.. SERIES ENDS when a sweet, nerd-cute, motor mouth boy, ERIC, appears in her path. \nERIC You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on. \nBella just looks at him. Is he for real? \nBELLA I'm kind of the \u0093suffer in silence\u0094 type. \nERIC Good headline for your feature I'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page. \nBELLA I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all \nERIC Whoa, chillax. No feature. \nBELLA \n(relieved) Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class? \nHe leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes from them \n", "test1_true": "INT. GYM - DAY 14 \nThe boys' basketball team runs drills on half the basketball court. A girls' volleyball game occupies the other half. \nBella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it's radioactive. An energetic, athletic team captain, JESSICA, motivates the players. \nJESSICA Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack! \nUnfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella. She closes her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it. It flies off court \n-- and beans a basketball player in the head. He is MIKE NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. \nMIKE Ow! \nBELLA (hurries to him, \nembarrassed) Are you alright? I warned them not to make me play. \nMIKE It's only a flesh wound. \nMike grins and she smiles, relieved. A BELL RINGS, class over. \nMIKE You're Isabella, right? \nBELLA Just Bella. \nMIKE I'm Mike. Newton. \nHe looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her - Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. Subtle, but possessive as she nudges Mike. \nJESSICA She's got a great spike, doesn't she? \n(to Bella) So, you're from Arizona, right? Aren't people supposed to be tan down there? \nBELLA That's why they kicked me out. \nMike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does. Bella just feels uncomfortable with the attention.. \n15 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 15 \nFOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to a table. Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella. \nERIC Mike, you met my home girl Bella. \nMIKE Your home girl? \nJESSICA \n(to Bella) It's first grade all over again, and you're the shiny new toy. \nBella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, low key, insecure friend. \nANGELA Sorry, needed a candid for the feature \nERIC Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again. \n(to Bella) I got your back, baby. \nANGELA \n(disappointed) Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking. \nBELLA Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team \nANGELA -- Wait, that's a good one.. \nBut Bella's attention is now riveted to \nBELLA'S POV - THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE CAFETERIA \nThey swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS. Two guys, two girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes.. and all devastatingly beautiful. \nThey move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat at a table furthest from Bella's. Bella leans over to Jessica and Angela. \nBELLA Who are they? \nANGELA The Cullens. \nJessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode. \nJESSICA Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago. \nANGELA They kinda keep to themselves. \nJESSICA Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.. \nON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it. Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight lifter, but a playful glint in his eye. \nJESSICA ... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal. \n", "test1_id": 1284, "test2_input": "She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder. \nBELLA Look, just take my bag. \nFRAT BOY # We don't want your bag. \nShe takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively. But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly \nHEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up. The Frat Boys dive out of the way. The passenger-side door opens. It's Edward. She's too stunned to even move. \nEDWARD Get in. \nShe finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and rushes Edward's side of the car \nEdward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him. \n59 INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 59 \nBella continues to stare. She sees that he's seething with anger, hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched. \nBELLA What -- no, how did you find -- \nEDWARD (through gritted teeth) I should go back and rip their heads off. \nBELLA No. Bad idea. \nEDWARD You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking. \nBELLA And you do? \nEDWARD (covering) Not hard to guess. \n60 EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 60 \nJessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches. \nANGELA Where were you!? We left you a message. \nJESSICA We waited, but we were starving \nThen they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car. They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be charming. And they are charmed. \nEDWARD Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking. \nJESSICA I - we - understand. We were just... leaving, so \nThe two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them. \nBELLA Okay, well. Thank you. \nShe starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly \nEDWARD \n(abruptly) Maybe I should make sure Bella gets something to eat. \n(off Bella's surprised \nlook) ... If you'd like. Then I could drive you back myself. \nANGELA That's so... thoughtful. \nJESSICA Really thoughtful. \nBELLA (debates, then decides) I could eat. \nAs he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and a noiseless scream of excitement. \nEXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - DINING PATIO - NIGHT 61 \nBella and Edward sit on the deck. A dramatic waterfall shimmers behind them. \nA waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward. She exits. \nBELLA You're not eating? \nEDWARD I'm on a special diet. \nBELLA Like South Beach? \nEDWARD Not exactly. \nShe looks at him curiously as she takes a bite. \nBELLA So how \u0091bout some answers? \nEDWARD Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851. \nBELLA I didn't ask for the square root of pi. \nEDWARD You knew that? \n", "test2_true": "EDWARD I didn't. \nShe shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside - \nEDWARD (stops her, sincerely) Don't go. \nHe seems torn by some internal dilemma. Then finally.. \nBELLA Were you following me? \nEDWARD I feel very protective of you. \nBELLA So that's a yes? \nEDWARD Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help. \nBELLA (putting everything together) You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. Can you... read minds? \nEDWARD \n(shrugs) I'm thinking of getting a nine- hundred number. \nBELLA \n(trying to grasp) Alright, so you read minds... What am I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go. \nEDWARD I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours. \n(points at people inside) Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend (points at Bella) Nothing. It's quite frustrating. \nBELLA Why, what's wrong with me? \nEDWARD I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you? \nHe smiles, charmed by her. But his smile fades, that torn look returns. He holds onto the rail, looking out. \nBELLA What is it? \nEDWARD I... don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore. \nShe's surprised. And thrilled. \nBELLA Edward, you don't have to. \nHe's drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his eyes a beat, and turns back to the water. \nEDWARD (almost to himself) This is wrong. \nBELLA Edward \nEDWARD You're cold. We should go. \nHe walks away before she can ask any more questions.. \n62 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 62 \nEdward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway. \n63 INT. EDWARD'S VOLVO - NIGHT 63 \nBella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he seems to be wrestling with his own thoughts. Finally.. \nBELLA I think I'm warm enough now. \nShe reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their hands TOUCH. And hold a moment too long. An electric current connecting them. \nBELLA Your hand, it's still freezing cold. \nHe pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it... then her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS. As they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car pulls away. Charlie's cruiser is parked out front. \nBELLA \n(concerned) Dad's here late. Something must have happened. \nEXT./INT. FORKS - POLICE STATION (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 64 \nThe Volvo pulls up. Bella and Edward climb out. Edward then sees a second car next to the cruiser. \nEDWARD That's my father's car. What's he -- \nEDWARD AND BELLA'S POV: INSIDE THE DARKENED POLICE STATION \nIn a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr. Cullen study photographs and evidence. As they wrap up their discussion, Dr. Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the police station looking grim. \nEDWARD Carlisle. What happened? \nDR. CULLEN Waylon Forge was found in the woods out near his place. I just examined the body. \nEdward darkens. Bella is horrified. \n", "test2_id": 1285, "test3_input": "They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, covered in bright green moss. \nEDWARD ... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice. \nBELLA So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people. \nEDWARD Not the only reason. \nHe stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion.. \nEDWARD I don't want to be a monster. \nShe nods. Understands. He smiles. \nEDWARD We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying. \nThen abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river. \nBELLA Show off. \nEDWARD It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this. \nBELLA Can they all read minds, too? \nEDWARD No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future. \nBELLA \n(fishing) Really? Bet she saw me coming a mile away. \nShe notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening. \nEDWARD Her visions are very subjective. The future can change. \nHe cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and continuing their walk.. \n75 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (ANOTHER DAY) 75 \nWater sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck. A boom box PLAYS. He perches on top of the roof. \nEDWARD Come to my house tomorrow. \nBella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof. \nBELLA Your house? With your family? \nHe wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the truck's body. She's too flustered to register it. \nBELLA But... what if they don't like me? \nEDWARD \n(laughing heartily) You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you? \nBELLA I'm glad I amuse you. \nBut then his laughter dies, as he hears something. \nBELLA What is it? \nEDWARD A complication. \n... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up. \nEDWARD I'll pick you up tomorrow. \nHe heads to his car, eying the passengers in \nEDWARD'S POV - INT. BLACK CAR \nJacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense. Anxious. SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy. Jacob looks questioningly at his father. \nBella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange. She forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as \nBELLA Come to visit your truck? \nJACOB Looks good. You got that dent out. \nBILLY Actually, we came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again. \nJACOB (mortified) Great, Dad. Thanks. \nJacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE CRUISER pulls up. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. \nCHARLIE Pale Ale. \nBILLY (holds up a brown paper BAG) Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry. \nCharlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on the game as they all head inside \nBILLY Any luck with the Waylon case? \n", "test3_true": "(darkening) Found a footprint out at the crime scene today. A bare, human footprint. \nBilly seems disturbed but not surprised. Bella is horrified. \nBELLA A person did that? \nJACOB A crazy person, walking around barefoot this time of year. \nCHARLIE Spread the word out at the rez, will ya? Keep the kids out of the woods. \nBILLY Will do. (directed at Bella) Don't want no one else getting hurt. \nBella looks away from Billy, unnerved. \n76 OMITTED 76 \n77 OMITTED 77 \n78 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 78 \nBella floats near Edward, only their hands touching, but their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual.. \nSuddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD! Something has him, pulling him down.. SMASH TO: \nINT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - MORNING 79 -- as her eyes pop open... and relief sweeps over her as she realizes it was just a dream. But it haunts her.. \nEXT. OLYMPIC PENINSULA - ROAD - DAY 80 \nAERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long \nserpentine dirt road. FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits \nEXT. CULLEN HOUSE - DAY 81 A timeless graceful house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella climbs out, surprised. \nBELLA It's... wonderful. EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside. \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 82 Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house. Walls of glass look out on the river. Everything's open and white. Historical objects are tastefully placed throughout. \nHEAR Verdi's \u0093La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici\u0094 coming from another room. Bella is enraptured. BELLA It's so light and open. \nEDWARD Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide. \nWe then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen. Edward shakes his head. EDWARD I told them not to do this. \n83 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 83 \nVerdi's opera BLASTS Bella and Edward who enter to find the kitchen in full swing. Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and ESME prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti. \nEsme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an instant. Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested. \nEsme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth. Her heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the silent-movie era. \nESME \nBella. We're making Italiano for \nyou. \nEDWARD \nThis is Esme, my mother for all \nintents and purposes. \nBELLA Bon giorno? \nESME Molto bene! \nDR. CULLEN \nYou've given us an excuse to use \nthe kitchen for the first time. \nHit pause.. \nPAN across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the corner --they're watching an ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a TV. Emmett hits the DVD remote control. \nESME I hope you're hungry. \nBELLA Oh, absolutely \nEDWARD She already ate. \nBella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS. Rosalie has thrown down a bowl and now strides out \nROSALIE Perfect. \n84 INT. LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 84 \n", "test3_id": 1286}

It's my poem to you. 
DIRK 
It's great. It's so great, Amber. 
You're a director now. Shit. 
Have you showed Jack? 
AMBER

At that moment the PHONE RINGS, CAMERA WHIPS OVER to the phone. It rings again. Jack picks it up. DOLLY/ZOOM IN QUICK. 
JACK 
Hello? Colonel? Wait, wait, wait. 
Yes. Calm down. Calm down. Okay.

He slams the phone down.

109 INT. POLICE STATION - HOLDING AREA - NIGHT 
The Colonel is sitting in handcuffs, crying his eyes out. Jack sits across from him, speaking through the glass. 
COLONEL 
. . . she was fifteen . . . fifteen . . . I didn't 
know . . . Jack, you gotta believe me. 
JACK 
I believe you. 
COLONEL 
I told her not to do so much coke, but she 
wouldn't listen, she just kept doing it and 
doing it like she was a vacuum. Like she had 
a vacuum in her nose or something . . . . 
. . . next thing I know . . . she's got blood 
coming from her nose and . . . jesus . . . her, jesus -- 
JACK 
What? 
COLONEL 
It was coming out her ass, Jack. 
JACK 
Okay. It's gonna be okay. Just relax. 
The bail is a hundred thousand dollars. 
I don't have that kind of cash -- 
COLONEL 
-- I don't have any money left. 
JACK 
What do you mean? Nothing? 
The Colonel shakes his head a little, doesn't answer. 
JACK 
Well . . . what . . . how? 
COLONEL 
I spent it . . . I spent it. 
JACK 
The films . . . or . . . I mean? 
COLONEL 
I spent it, alright? This shit gets 
expensive. Between you shooting film, 
the coke, the limos, the houses. 
It goes, alright? I spent it. 
JACK 
Alright, okay. Don't worry. 
COLONEL 
I can't have this happen to me. 
I'm a good man, right? 
JACK 
Yes you are. 
COLONEL 
I didn't know -- I didn't know she was 
gonna die right there with me or I wouldn't 
have picked her up. 
JACK 
Right. You know; you've done nothing wrong. 
I mean, look; You were just there, right? 
You didn't . . . I mean . . . you didn't do anything. 
COLONEL 
They found something in my house, Jack. 
JACK 
What? 
COLONEL 
. . . something . . . 
JACK 
. . . what are you saying? What did they find? 
COLONEL 
. . . it's my fuckin' weakness, Jack. 
They're . . . so small and cute I can't help 
myself, Jack. I can't help it when they're so 
small and cute. I just want to watch, I don't do 
anything, Jack. I've never touched one of them . . . 
JACK 
Jesus Christ, Colonel. 
COLONEL 
You look at me like I'm an asshole, now. 
JACK 
. . . I . . . I don't . . . ? 
COLONEL 
I'm going to jail for a long time. 
JACK 
-- it's okay, Colonel. It's gonna be 
fine in the end . . . . I promise . . . 
COLONEL 
Are you promising me? 
Jack doesn't answer. 
COLONEL 
Take it back, Jack. Don't promise me anything. 
You can't help me. I'm done. I'm going to jail. 
I've done wrong and I'm going to jail for a long, long time. 
They hold a look for a moment. A few OFFICERS come and start to escort the Colonel away. He leans in, speaks sotto; 
COLONEL 
Listen to me, Jack: And I'm gonna tell 
you this for you. Am I your friend? 
JACK 
What? 
COLONEL 
Answer me, am I your friend? 
JACK 
Yes.

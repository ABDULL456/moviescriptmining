(TAKEN ABACK) What's up? What's wrong? She sees the hurt look in his eyes and softens. 
RACHEL What do you wane from me? 
JESSE I just wanted to, you know, see how you're doing. Over his shoulder she can see the stir his presence aC Freak Hall is causing among... 
THE PATIO GIRLS MONICA taps TRACY on the shoulder, who's checking her makeup in a compact mirror. 
MONICA Look at Jesse, talking to a burnout. TRACY turns, slips on a stylish pair of DKNY glasses. 
TRACY She's not very good in daylight is she? wonder where she keeps her coffin.

INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON a TV SET showing game highlights of last year's Bulldog game against the Carlin Cougars. 
WALSH (O.S.) All right, as you can see from last year's tape, the Carlin Cougars are a tough, physical team. So Friday, it's gonna be kill or be killed. COACH WALSH, a charmless John Wayne, stands near the TV. The BULLDOGS sit on benches before him. On the VIDEO -.- MARK misses an easy block. WALSH points. 
WALSH Here, we can see mark Sing kissing an opposing player good-bye. There are hoots of derision from the other PLAYERS. MARK nods. ERIC leans into MARK, speaks low. 
ERIC You didn't get the picture? 
MARK Bitch wouldn't give it to me. Stay frosty, no one else knows anything. It's still at the photomat, I'll get it. 
WALSH (O.S.) You two ladies back there gossiping? No, sir. 
WALSH (O.S. ) Excellent. Then you can give me fifty when we hit the field.

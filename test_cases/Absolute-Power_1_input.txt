SETH Luther Whitney -- (beat) -- one of the great thieves of the world. 
Seth.    The words pour out. 
SETH Been going nuts with this thing, up all night and I remembered your notion how it might be two burglars, and around dawn I thought, wait, what if it wasn't two burglars but what if it was one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two? (faster) Called a buddy at the Bureau -- they keep track of this stuff internationally -- he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the Sullivan job -- I'm tracing all six -- (beat) -- but Whitney's the only one lives in Washington. 
Laura.   Looking at Seth now.   Starting to get excited, too. 
LAURA Why haven't I ever heard of him? 
SETH Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years. 
LAURA (indicating mug shot) This his graduation picture from Harvard? 
SETH (waving her off) Ancient history -- he wasn't a jewel thief back then. Just a kid, just part of a gang, a three- time loser. But since he got out the last time, he's only worked alone -- (MORE)

SETH (CONT'D) (beat) -- and no one's touched him. (shakes his head) He gets questioned whenever anything big comes up. But nothing sticks. 
LAURA (really excited now) Seth -- we can make this stick -- I'll bet you anything this is our guy -- a local? -- can't ask for more --

LAURA                                   * -- what? -- 
SETH Whitney hasn't killed anyone in 45 years. 
Laura doesn't get it. 
SETH Korea. 
LAURA Big deal, so he's a veteran. 
SETH Not just a veteran -- a wounded veteran. (indicating folder) Got his combat record here. Battles, commendations,                                  * decorations up the kazoo.                                * Lives alone on his disability.                           * Says he does anyway.                                     * (glum)                                            * And I don't do war heroes...                             *

Luther -- it's a beautiful morning now and he's walking up the steps to the art museum. He seems in a terrific mood as he goes inside --

-- HOLD. 
Seth has been on the steps of the museum, watching him. Now quickly -- 
165   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                              165 
Luther, inside, peering back out at Seth. And he doesn't seem in as terrific a mood now. He hesitates, keeps on going.

Seth.   Outside -- and he knows Luther was watching.

El Greco. The usual group has gathered, sketching away. Luther is deeply engrossed in his labors. 
Seth enters the room, casually taking it all in. He approaches the group, ends up behind Luther who is intent on getting the hands right. 
LUTHER (not looking) Boy, you must be smart. 
SETH (really taken aback) Sorry? 
LUTHER Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me. (turns, smiles) You look just like your picture, Seth. I'm Luther Whitney. 
He reaches out to shake a surprised Seth's hand -- 
168   INT. MUSEUM - COFFEE SHOP - DAY                               168 
They walk in, go to  the food line. There is, throughout, a bantering tone.   Not that it matters, but these two, in a different world,  would like each other -- they're both, in their own ways,  deeply moral men. 
LUTHER So, do you want my confession now or after coffee? 
As Luther draws some coffee from an urn -- 
SETH (doing the same) Before I send you away for life, I should probably check out your alibi.

LUTHER Watched the Bullets game    with Red Bransford. Prison buddy     of mine -- runs a bar -- want to    question me about the game? I'm     probably lying. 
They each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet table in the corner as they head for it. 
SETH You been following the case? 
LUTHER (nods vigorously) I love true crime -- 
SETH -- F.B.I. feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the Sullivan job. (touches his notebook) I've got a list here; you're on it. 
LUTHER (nothing shows) I wish it was true. (shakes his head) Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night? (as Seth nods; Luther sighs) If only I could do stuff like that -- I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. meetings. 
Luther and Seth as they sit.     Seth smiles, looks at Luther.

TRACER 
SWAN'S VOICE You have exactly thirty minutes to release the girl where you found her. 
TRACER Twelve ... 
SWAN'S VOICE Thirty minutes. 
TRACER Nine ... 
WINTERS How do we know you'll keep your word? 
Click, dial tone. 
Winters flashes a look at the Tracer.   The Tracer yanks off his headphones in utter frustration. 
WINTERS (to his men) Okay, let's move! 
The room erupts into action. Benson and the SWAT Team are the first ones out the door... 
71   EXT.   ALLEY - DAY                                              71 
Hauntingly familiar. An unmarked police car pulls up and stops behind the machine shop. 
72   EXT./INT. ALLEY - CAR                                           72 
Harry sits behind the wheel.    Mary sits in the back, handcuffed to Pluchinsky. 
Pluchinsky unlocks the cuffs.   Mary's eyes flare 
PLUCHINSKY Get out and go to the machine shop - 
Mary steps out of the car. She glances around--then heads in the opposite direction of the Machine Shop. Pluchinsky curses. He starts to go after her, but realizes he'd better clear the area. He peals out. 
73   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               73 
Undercover Men in various disguises track her from cars, and on foot, communicating by hidden mics. A WINO eyes her carefully, lifts a bottle to his mouth and whispers... 
WINO She's out of the bag. 
Mary exits the alley onto the street, searching where to go. She turns down the street and moves fast, eyes darting about. 
74   EXT. STREET                                                     74 
The SWAT van is tucked into an alley... 
INSIDE THE SWAT VAN 
Winters, Benson and Team monitor the radio communication. 
WINO (O.C.) (on the radio) Position Four. Turning on Elm. 
75   EXT. ELM STREET - DAY                                           75 
Mary crosses the street, a Camero nearly clips her. She makes it safely to the sidewalk and passes a TRUCK DRIVER eating a hot dog. After she moves off... 
TRUCK DRIVER (speaks into sleave) Six.   She's crossing to Main. 
Mary looks around quickly, blends into a crowd coming out of a store and ducks inside. 
TRUCK DRIVER (cont.) She just went into a department store.    She's out of sight.

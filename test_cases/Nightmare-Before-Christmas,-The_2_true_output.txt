JACK Whoa!!!! 
What's This? Performed by Danny Elfman 
What's this? What's this? There's color everywhere What's this? There's white things in the air What's this? I can't believe my eyes I must be dreaming Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair What's this? What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong What's this? There's people singing songs 
What's this? The streets are lined with Little creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy Have I possibly gone daffy? What is this? What's this? 
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead

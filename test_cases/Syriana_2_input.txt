FRANKS Great. He eats some chips, offers some to another guy. 
FRANKS (CONT'D) Is it night there still? 
WILLY Morning. 
CUT TO: 
164 EXT. BEDOUIN TENT - MORNING 164 
The tribal leaders have bargained through the night. Outside the tents EVERYONE ELSE is waiting, including Bryan whose ear piece dangles to his Blackberry. 
BRYAN (INTO PHONE) 
(NOT EXCITED) We have a contract to establish a new petroleum exchange. No firm our size has pulled off anything like this. Bryan crosses to the CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVES. 
BRYAN (CONT'D) He's a visionary, like Faisal or Attaturk, and the people love him. By Monday, he'll be running the country. The Chinese seem unconvinced. Finally, the tent opens and the leaders file out. Prince Nasir addresses the crowd. 
PRINCE NASIR The Middle-East and the Arab people have seen empires come and go in six millennia. The Pax Romana, the Pax Ottomanica, the Pax Brittanica, were nothing more than invasions and occupations that ended... The Pax Americana will end, too. His wife and daughters proudly watch. 
PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) We have endless patience for history, but a man starving to death while sitting on a chair made of gold can no longer afford to be patient. The time for democratic, Arab self- determination has arrived. The crowd CHEERS. And as Prince Nasir, his family and supporters move toward the vehicles, find Nasir's BODYGUARD whispering into a cell phone -- 
BODYGUARD Silver Hummer -- 
(CONTINUED) 
164 CONTINUED: 164 As Nasir and Bryan enter a SILVER HUMMER. 
CUT TO: 
165 EXT. LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITY - MORNING 165 
The Liquefied Natural Gas facility has changed hands. The CHINA GAS AND ELECTRIC signage is now CONNEX-KILLEEN signage. The Chinese engineers are now American engineers. Native MUSICIANS entertain a small crowd of HARD HATS, local OFFICIALS and visiting DIGNITARIES. Someone BREAKS A BOTTLE across a huge colored pipe. The CHIEF ENGINEER signals. He throws a huge lever -- A POWERFUL WHISPER builds, hurtling through the pipes toward them and past them to the LNG CARRIER, a thousand- foot-long tanker, docked alongside. 
CUT TO: 
166 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 166 
The doors open. Sydneyand Bennettenter, wearing tuxedos. Sydney insertsa plasticcard allowing accessto the upper floors. 
SYDNEY His wife'll be there. Pat. Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. The elevator TONES on every floor. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) This is good. You done good. The watch the floors light up. 
167 INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT 167 
The door opens and PAT JANUS, 50's, Nancy Reagan suit and coif, opens the door. She takes in the men, smiling -- 
MRS. JANUS Sydney, how are you? And you must be Mr. Holiday? she shakes his hand. Gives Sydney both cheeks. They cross the large suite, one wall of which is floor-to-ceiling windows giving a dazzling view of mid-town Manhattan. 
(CONTINUED) 
167 CONTINUED: 167 In a sitting area, LELAND "LEE" JANUS, 60's, a vigorous pit-bull in tux shirt and bow-tie, turns from the TV -- 
MR. JANUS Syd! Bennett! Lee Janus! How're we doing? Janus is standing with his hand out -- 
MR. JANUS (CONT'D) Those number crunchers can get a little over-zealous, can't they, but Christ, when we write the GAAP rules like some kind of abstract painting. Stare at that liability hard enough and before long it'll turn into an asset. 
CUT TO: 
168 INT. CIA - TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT 168 
A small black and white image of a room full of GENERALS and SUPPORT STAFF moving silently around. PULLING back to reveal they're on a small monitor, titled, "US CENTRAL COMMAND, TAMPA, FLORIDA." The Division Chief, Franks, other Group Chiefs huddle over another, blank, MONITOR. ANGLE: ON THE BLANK MONITOR, suddenly, an image pops on -- desert seen from seven miles up. A wide shot of sand and more sand. The room lets out soft YEAHS as the image shifts, finding a distant highway cutting through it. 
WILLY (V.0.) Image from Predator. Seven miles up. Let's go in. God, I love the UAV's. 
FRED FRANKS (V.0.) What? 
WILLY Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. I love 'em. 
FRED FRANKS And it's quiet, right? 
(CONTINUED) 
168 CONTINUED: 168 
WILLY Baby cruises at eighty knots, about as audible as the clouds.

THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92          63. 94   CONTINUED:   (2)                                         94 O'CONNOR Good... TOMMY And if I vote against the labels, I get money from the frozen food guys. O'CONNOR Excellent! And don't forget the ranchers, because they get hurt if pepperoni sales go down! TOMMY (laughing in admiration) A pepperoni lobby. I love this town. O'CONNOR So which is it? TOMMY Fuck the cheese people. Thanks to them my office smelled like smelt for a week. O'CONNOR All right.    For. TOMMY So Tommy, tell me -- with all this money on every side, how does anything get done? O'CONNOR It doesn't!    That's the genius of the system! 95   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                95 A briefing in progress. Flip charts, ring binders, Celia, Ira, a couple of other Pro Bono types. Tommy is riveted by Celia. CELIA It comes down to a question of what is acceptable risk. Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats? More important, who gets to make the decision? Bureaucrats and big corporations, or the people whose lives depend on it? 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            64. 96   INT. TOMMY'S BOILER ROOM - DAY                             96 Tommy's staff shares one small office.   Everyone's on the phone. VAN DYKE Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson is calling. Can you take his call? Thank you. Please hold. Van Dyke puts him on hold, counts to three, gets back on the line. VAN DYKE I'm sorry, Mr. Willie, he just picked up another call. Listen, I know why he was calling -- he hasn't heard from you about his fundraiser... PAN TO Armando. ARMANDO ... That's right, Mr. Brown, on the thirtieth... A thousand a couple...A whole table? He'll be so happy to hear it. Thank you so much. (calling) Loretta! Put down nuclear power for ten g's. PAN TO Loretta, who chalks the figure onto a toteboard. LORETTA Cool. (into phone) Mr. Newburg? It's Miss Loretta, from Congressman Johnson's office, how you doin'? On Loretta's bulletin board is a map of the United States, with flags, pushpins, and air travel routes. LORETTA Say, the congressman's going to be out your way next week... Palm Springs, the Bob Hope Classic -- yes, a celebrity player. As long as he's on the coast, we were wondering whether you aerospace people might want to lay on a lunch so you can hear his views... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh... Lovely. Now what kind of contribution to his foundation you folks thinking about? 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              65. 97   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                    97 Celia continues her briefing. CELIA ...And in the 1988 study, it was up to eight per hundred-thousand. Um...am I losing you on these mortality rates? TOMMY No, I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? I mean, didn't the Merton Act cover most of this? 
CELIA (surprised) Hmmm, that's an excellent point. Let me see something... As she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we TRACK AROUND to a COMPUTER SCREEN on Tommy's desk -- it displays THE EXACT WORDS HE'S JUST SPOKEN. CELIA Wow...you're right. Maybe we can get them to amend Merton-Simmons. RACK FOCUS...reveals REINHARDT in b.g., sitting at another computer terminal. He is typing in Tommy's responses, which appear on Tommy's screen. TOMMY Well, for Merton to apply you have to show high contagion...sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod. In b.g., Reinhardt DIVES FORWARD to his keyboard and begins correcting his typo. Celia looks puzzled. TOMMY Common cold. (beat) Must have picked up a little dyslexia over the weekend. CELIA I see. Well, I must say I'm pretty impressed. TOMMY You're also impressively pretty. (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           66. 97    CONTINUED:                                                97 Celia is startled. Tommy is embarrassed...the dumb compliment he's just spoken was one Reinhardt typed on the computer screen. CELIA Oh come on... TOMMY You're right. Sorry.      Excuse me a second. (calls out) Arthur? Without explanation, he THROWS HIS PENCIL hard out of frame. 
REINHARDT (O.S.) Ow! 98    EXT. GULF STREAM JET - AIRBORNE - DAY                     98 A jet flies through the sky. 99    INT. GULF STREAM JET - DAY                                99 Tommy and handful of other Members listen to their GUN LOBBYIST host. GUN LOBBYIST Frankly, we    think the semi-automatic has gotten a    bad rap. That's why the American    Sporting Gun Users PAC put together    this trip. ON TOMMY AND DODGE enjoying champagne and hors d'oeuvres. 
100   EXT. DUCK BLIND - DAY                                     100 Tommy, wearing full L.L. Bean drag, wading with the other Members. Someone blows a shrieking DUCK CALL. A flock takes flight. Everyone in the group raises their weapons: AK-47s. A burst of GUNFIRE. Rambo time. We SEE the flock still flying. One duck drops at the feet of the hunters. TOMMY Must have had a heart attack.

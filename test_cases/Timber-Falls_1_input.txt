Sheryl checks her bag as well. She clips a blue hikers' towel to her waist. Mike checks his cell phone. No service. 
MIKE You getting anything? 
Sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no." 
MIKE I'll lock them in the car. 
SHERYL I'll take mine. 
MIKE Why? 
SHERYL Just to annoy you. 
MIKE Seriously...

SHERYL In an emergency, I'd rather have a phone that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up there. 
Huh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove compartment. 
Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack. Zips it shut. 
ANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain. Mike locks the door. 
MIKE Okay, we all set? 
SHERYL (Excited) Yup. 
MIKE Let's do this. 
Mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. Sheryl doesn't move. She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof. 
SHERYL Hey, Einstein. What do you think, leave the tent or maybe take it with us? 
Mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car. 
MIKE I was just seeing if you were paying attention. 
Mike comes back to the car for the tent.   Sheryl shakes her head and smiles. 
21   EXT.   BASE TRAIL #1 - DAY                                   21 
The mountain is breathtaking.    Nature at its best. 
Mike and Sheryl have begun their ascent. 
SHERYL It could be fun. 
MIKE Not a chance. High School reunions serve only two purposes... to try to (MORE) 
MIKE (cont'd) rehash so-called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super-model. 
SHERYL So what were you? 
MIKE Me?   I was a stoner. 
SHERYL So what does that mean? 
MIKE How the hell am I supposed to remember? I was high all the time. 
Sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass. 
Sweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. Sheryl doesn't have that problem. She's wearing a red bandana. 
MIKE Where'd you get that bandana? 
SHERYL It's cute, right? I stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday. Keeps the sweat out of your eyes. 
MIKE And when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe... 
SHERYL Oh...well...it was the last one... 
MIKE The last one? 
SHERYL Yeah... 
MIKE The entire Army-Navy store... sold out? 
SHERYL Completely. There was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute. 
Sheryl stifles a CHUCKLE. Mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him.

SHERYL Here... You big baby.

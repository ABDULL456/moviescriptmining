MARGE I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir?  Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of - 
JERRY Ma'am, I answered your question. 
There is a silent beat. 
MARGE ...  I'm sorry, sir? 
JERRY Ma'am, I answered your question. I answered the darn -  I'm cooperating here, and I... 
MARGE Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me.  I'm just doin' my job here. 
JERRY I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can... 
He trails off into silence. 
MARGE Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson? 
Jerry stares at her. 
MARGE ...  Mr. Lundegaard? 
Jerry explodes: 
JERRY Well, heck, if you wanna, if you wanna play games here!  I'm workin' with ya on this thing, but I... 
He is getting angrily off his feet. 
JERRY Okay, I'll do a damned lot count! 
MARGE Sir?  Right now? 
JERRY Sure right now!  You're darned tootin'! 
He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door and grabbing a pair of galoshes. 
JERRY ...  If it's so damned imporant to ya! 
MARGE I'm sorry, sir, I - 
Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes pinched in his hand. 
JERRY Aw, what the Christ! 
He stamps out the door. 
Marge stares. 
After a long moment her stare breaks.  She glances idly around the office. 
There is a framed picture facing away from her on the desktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding an accordion.  There is another picture of Jean. 
Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the ceiling. 
She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her. 
She fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard toward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation. 
She looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks. 
MARGE ...  Oh, for Pete's sake. 
Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the building. 
Marge's voice is flat with dismay: 
MARGE ...  Oh, for Pete's sake... 
She grabs the phone and punches in a number. 
MARGE ...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the interview.  He's feelin' the interview... 
Jerry makes a left turn into traffic. 
MARGE ...  Detective Sibert, please... 
POLICE OFFICER

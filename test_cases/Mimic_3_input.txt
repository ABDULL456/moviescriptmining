Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN, the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY. 
SUSAN (Laughs.  To Chuy.) That's wonderful!  What grade are you in? 
Chuy doesn't answer. 
ERNEST No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about. 
Ernest discreetly points to his forehead. 
MANNY (immediately) He's special. 
LEONARD He can imitate anything, you just watch him. 
PETER (Irritably, to Leonard) Excuse me, I'm talking to you. 
LEONARD No, you talkin' at me. 
Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and walks past Peter as if he were invisible. 
ERNEST (discreetly, to Susan) Is there some reward for this? 
SUSAN I guess that could be arranged. 
Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture. 
PETER For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me? 
LEONARD You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. 
Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow. 
Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm, heads off in another direction. 
Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of their steps. 
INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY 
Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes. 
PETER You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us? 
SUSAN I heard how you talked to him. 
PETER Oh, so I'm the bad guy now? 
Susan spares him an ironic look. 
SUSAN He was just doing his job. 
PETER Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus! 
At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by sunlight. 
PETER He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK 
A train blurs by. 
A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls. 
A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING. 
He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it. 
A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage. 
He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly. 
He touches it again... 
...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him reflexively. 
Ernest jumps back. 
Another SET OF LEGS emerges... 
Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes. 
ERNEST Chrissakes... 
He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP. 
Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated, toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim light, they almost seem like a single organism. 
ERNEST Guys, c'mon. 
The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts getting annoyed. 
ERNEST I told you to stick by the maintenance area. 
BAG LADY Nah... It's private property now. 
Ernest looks at her, confused. 
SKELETAL BUM He eats down there. 
ERNEST Who? 
HOMELESS MAN The Stickman. 
BAG LADY Long John.

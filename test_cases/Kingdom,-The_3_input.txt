COLONEL AL-GHAZI Sunrise. 
RONALD FLEURY What time is sunrise? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) When I knock. 
Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on, half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in. 
GRANT SYKES That's against fire code. 
JANET MAYES They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby. 
Silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage. 
ADAM LEAVITT (smiling) You alright, girl? 
JANET MAYES Watch it, boy. 
ADAM LEAVITT Just asking... 
JANET MAYES Unpack. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   57. 
Everyone hits their own bags first. 
FLEURY (to himself) Saudi slow roll... 
Fleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode. Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone. 
LYLA FLEURY (on phone) Hello? 
RONALD FLEURY Hey... How are you? How's my boy? 
LYLA FLEURY We're just fine. How are you? Where are you? 
RONALD FLEURY I'm here... (quick beat) Lemme talk to my boy. 
A BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Daddy? 
FLEURY What you doing? 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) I'm talking to you. What are you doing right now, Daddy? Right now? 
FLEURY I'm missing you. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Where are you? 
FLEURY I'm in Saudi Arabia. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Did you see Big Fran? 
A Beat... 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   58. 
FLEURY Yeah... I saw him... (PAUSE) I saw him. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Is he still tall? 
FLEURY Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall. 
Silence... as Fleury takes a beat to collect himself. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Daddy? Are you still there? 
FLEURY Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) You, too Daddy. 
FLEURY I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Bye, Daddy. 
Fleury begins unpacking. 
68   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM                    68 
Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street: waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab, suited SECURITY GUARDS exit. 
Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see massive, organized security. 
From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN - sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON SCHMIDT. 
Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on roof-tops, in machine-gun nests. 
Schmidt approaches Fleury. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06    59. 
SCHMIDT (big smile) You are in so much trouble. 
FLEURY Is that right?

CANADY (CONT'D) Course I'd never turn a friend for 
A PRICE 
EXT. ALLEYWAY 
BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody. A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in pain. Off down the alley and out of sight. 
INT. CID'S BEDROOM 
Sara lies with Cid, both asleep. Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears. Stiffens. The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake Cid. 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Sara rushes quietly down the stairs. Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing. She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes. 
JESSE Evenin ma'am. 
SARA Evenin. How can I help you? 
Joe is nowhere in sight. 
JESSE You can start by accepting my apologies re the hour, I hope I didn't catch you in supper. 
SARA No, that's fine. 
JESSE Yours was the last house on my list today, been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun. Thought I'd tick this off my list, not have to come back tomorrow. 
SARA What's this about? Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs. 
JESSE You alone here, ma'am? 
SARA My husband should be back from the city, any time now. 
JESSE Happy to hear. Could I trouble you for some water? 
SARA Course. I'll get some, you can take the glass with you. 
JESSE Actually ma'am, my business tonight, this ticking off the list business, it's gonna require me coming in. If that's alright. Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is now a few inches over the door jam. 
SARA Will you tell me what this is about? 
JESSE I will, yes. Can I come in? Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun. Possibilities whirling through her mind. 
JESSE (CONT'D) Ma'am? Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter. 
INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes in the kitchen, listening. 
JESSE (O.S.) I'm a deputized police officer, we're looking for an escaped criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen anyone through here the past two days, vagrants? 
SARA (O.S.) No, vagrants are always passing but nobody near the house. Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell if they're coming through the living room or hall. He hesitates. 
JESSE (O.S.) This man, here. 
SARA (O.S.) He's young. No. Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as they enter from the living room. Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph. 
JESSE We're looking for his father too, similar look and build but late 50s. May or may not be travelling together. This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega, of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk. Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're not sure. 
SARA No. She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take them. He notices the toys on the table. 
JESSE Keep em. Kids with your husband? 
SARA Yeah. Just one. 
JESSE How old?

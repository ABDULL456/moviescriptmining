CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos. Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters. Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs the air around Perseus. 
VIDALIA 
(WHISPERING) Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We should leave... now. 
PERSEUS I won't do anything rash. I've learned my lesson. 
VIDALIA This time you must do something rash. We all must. Kalibos leans close to Perseus. 
KALIBOS Tosharicana... demigod... expulsotat... Zeusl 
PERSEUS No... Perseus. PERSEUS WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD. The whole Expedition comes to life as                                                 -- THE LOTOPHAGI ATTACK, swift and brutal. Long arms thrash and rip at the Praetorians. Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES. Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a leather sack of sand. 
AMOUN Muster to me! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting. 
AMOUN Come on! You can pass through! Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks back at Kosmo in horror. Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him, sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside. Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle. The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no avail. 
AMOUN Only humans can penetrate the shield! Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm, thinking. 
PERSEUS Only humans... He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier. 
PERSEUS Drop the barrier!                                          r 
AMOUN No! It's too late for her! 
PERSEUS Drop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PERSEUS Take the barrier down or I'll go through it! 
AMOUN Have you learned nothing? If you break out now, we're all at risk. On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh. Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love. 
PERSEUS I've learned one thing for certain! Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian. 
PERSEUS Get down! Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               -- 
PERSEUS Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around the humans. They have only a moment to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses. 
DRACO Let's kill these freks! Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia. Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a look: "You're the one that I want." They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape. Perseus rolls out of the way. Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO! Bloody spittle flies from his tongue. Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia and careens toward her, head bloody. Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back with both feet, knocking him over the edge. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES. He slams into the dust, dead. Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the bloody puncture wounds. 
VIDALIA 
(SOOTHING) Okay... sshh... I've got you. A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans the horizon. 
DOWN BELOW Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long. The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted, looking around nervously. Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions. Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking all but their blue eyes. They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing SCIMITARS to cut them down. 
ATOP THE ROCKS in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing in. 
PERSEUS Vidalia... we need to help them... He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what 
SHE SEES: The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace -- King Acrisius. 
EXT. SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT 
A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs. 
INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT 
Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he cannot hear her --

Will my girl be all right? \n0 DOCTOR Oh, by morning she'll be knocking down Captain Kellerfs fences again. \nKATE Is there nothing we should do? \nKELLER \nDOCTOR (OFF CAMERA) 0 Main thing is the fever's gone. I've never seen a baby, more vitality, that's the truth -- Their voices and footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play- ful with the baby's face. \nKATE Hush. Don't you cry now, you've been trouble enough. Call it acute congestion, indeed, I don't see what's so cute about a con- gestion, just because it's yours? We'll have your father run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they don't know what they're curing even when they cure it. Men, men and their battle scars, we women will have to -- Helen, Helen Captain, Captain, will you come. (She screams) \n2. NIGHT. EXT. SIDE OF KELLER HOUSE. \nKELLER standing lamp in hand watching the doctor's buggy recede in the night. Suddenly from the house behind him comes a knifing scream. KELLER wheels, the scream comes again and the CAMERA follows KELLER's run with the lamp across the yard. \nKATE Look. \n(CONTINUED) \nc o.w- u UED She makes a pass with her hand in the crib, at the baby's eyes. \nI KATE (Cont'd) She can't see. Look at her eyes. She takes the lamp from him, moves it before the child's face. She can't seel \nYELLER \nHELENL His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth, to stop her own cry. \nFADE OUT \n5. DAY. INT. KELLEL HOUSE - TITLE SHOT. \n7. NIGHT. INT. LIVING ROOM KELLER HOUSE - TITLE SHOT. \nThere is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a WIDE SHOT we see HELEN, 7 years old, reaching up into tree. At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha, 7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face, blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and beyond her the other children watching. \n$. DAY. EXT. AFIELD - TITLE SHOT. \nA WIDE HIGH SHOT. We see the lonely expanse of field with 0 a low grass sprouting up, in the BG is the Keller house perhaps. Going slowly across the field is the figure of the child HELEN, Patty Duke. From in under CAMERA comes KATE, following her. \n10. CONTINUED smiles. She is flanked by the other two, in a litter of 0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN'S hands thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the dialogue is only background. \nMARTHA \n(SNIPPING) First Itm gonna cut off this doe- torts leg, one, two, now then -- \nPERCY Why you cuttin' off that doctor's legs? \nPERCY That's how I do, she keep pokint. her fingers in my mouth, I just bite 'em off. \n(CONTINUED) \n10.

KATE 0 now sees, comes swiftly to kneel, lifts HELEN'S hand to her own eyes in question. \nKATE Eyes? HELEN nods energetically. She wants the doll to have eyes. Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress. \nAUNT EV My goodness me, I'm not decent. \nKELLER Helen!

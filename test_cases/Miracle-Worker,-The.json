I've never seen a baby, more vitality, that's the truth -- Their voices and footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play- ful with the baby's face. \nKATE Hush. Don't you cry now, you've been trouble enough. Call it acute congestion, indeed, I don't see what's so cute about a con- gestion, just because it's yours? We'll have your father run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they don't know what they're curing even when they cure it. Men, men and their battle scars, we women will have to -- Helen, Helen Captain, Captain, will you come. (She screams) \n2. NIGHT. EXT.

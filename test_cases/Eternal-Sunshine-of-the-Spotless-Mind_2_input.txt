Later: Joel looks out at the ocean. 
Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He opens it and writes with a gloved hand. 
JOEL January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk. (thinks) It's cold. (thinks some more) The sky is gray. (thinks some more) I don't know what else to say.  Nothing happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily.  Like no time has passed.  After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again.  I guess that's good. 
He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes. 
JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) If I'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman I don't know.  I guess I'd better get back to Naomi. 
Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window. 
Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot. 
WAITRESS Coffee? 
CLEMENTINE God, yes.  You've saved my life! 
The waitress pours the coffee. 
WAITRESS You know what you want yet? 
CLEMENTINE (laughing) Ain't that the question of the century. 
The waitress is not amused. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) You got grilled cheese and tomato soup? 
WAITRESS Yeah.  We're having a run on it. 
The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up. 
CLEMENTINE (calling) And some cream, please. 
Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the title. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean. 
EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness. 
INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER 
Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally: 
CLEMENTINE (calling over the rumble) Hi! 
Joel looks over. 
JOEL I'm sorry. 
CLEMENTINE Why? 
JOEL Why what? 
CLEMENTINE Why are you sorry?  I just said hi. 
JOEL No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so... 
She looks around the empty car. 
CLEMENTINE Really? 
JOEL (embarrassed) Well, I didn't want to assume. 
CLEMENTINE Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car. 
JOEL Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi. 
Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel. 
CLEMENTINE It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't have to scream.  Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. (pause) But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something. 
JOEL No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really think of much to say probably. 
CLEMENTINE Oh.  So... 
She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from. 
JOEL I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here.  I didn't mean to --

PREW They don't. 
HOLMES Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt? 
PREW No, sir. I dint say -- 
HOLMES You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home. 
PREW I don't want it disbanded, sir. (DOGGEDLY) But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to. 
HOLMES It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is. 
Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to attention. 
HOLMES Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. (TO WARDEN) I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant? 
WARDEN (holds up papers) Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out. It's due TOMORROW -- 
HOLMES You make it out. Is that all? 
WARDEN (holds up more papers) No, sir! 
HOLMES Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back. 
He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up the papers. 
WARDEN He'd strangle on his own spit if I weren't here to swab out his throat for him. (TO PREW) Come on. I'll show you the Supply Room. 
Warden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following. 
INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his head approvingly at Prew. 
EXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND PREW as they come out of the Orderly Room. Prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately. CAMERA TRUCKS with him and Warden as they walk down the porch. 
WARDEN (one of his unexpected INTENSE BURSTS) Know what you did just now? (MORE) WARDEN(CONT'D) When you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad? You put your head in a noose. Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny. Otherwise, you better know how to soljer. 
PHEW I can soljer with any man. 
WARDEN This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty. 
PREW I'll take my chances. 
A convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the Orderly Room. KAREN HOLMES, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out. Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the Orderly Room. Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her. Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into the Orderly Room. 
WARDEN Since when is this place gettin to be the Royal Hawaiian? 
PREW Who's she? 
WARDEN His wife. Captain Holmes'. 
They resume walking. 
WARDEN You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor. And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. I only been in this outfit eight months myself but I learned one thing. My job is to keep him happy. The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better I run his Compny. So we know where we stand, don't we, kid? 
PREW I know where I stand. I don't believe that's the only way a man can get along. (MORE) PREW(CONT'D) A man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. It he don't, he's nothin... 
WARDEN Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. But not in our time, kid. Today you got to play ball. You got to divide it all by two. 
They have reached a Dutch door, top half open. A sign over it reads: SUPPLY ROOM. 
MEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM SUPPLY SERGEANT LEVA is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other. He is a foolish- looking man, about thirty-five. 
WARDEN Lava! Can't I once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands! 
LEVA (comes up to door) I can't do no better on what you people pay me. 
WARDEN Draw some supplies for this man. (TO PREW) That's G Compny barracks over there. Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. Save you makin four five trips. 
PREW (surprised, pleased) Okay. 
WARDEN I just hate to see energy wasted. Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin yours. 
Prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. The bang of the Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that direction. 
LONG SHOT KAREN HOLMES FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S ANGLE as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a 
sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter. 
LEVA Her and them sweaters. 
LONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering. 
WARDEN'S VOICE Army women... They're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. There's no pleasure in them... 
LEVA'S VOICE Yeah, but this one knows the score... Like I been tellin you. 
WARDEN'S VOICE (SARCASTIC) Is that right? 
LEVA'S VOICE Okay, not around here. But I was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes. When they was married only a year or two. I heard plenty about the lady then. Plenty.

MICHAEL (sings) I will feel a glow just Thinking of you... And the way you look.  Tonight. 
He stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile. 
MICHAEL Dance card filled? 
JULIANNE I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days. 
He holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance with her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching. 
MICHAEL (sings in her ear) With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart... 
She holds him closer.  Bites her lip. 
MICHAEL (sings) And that laugh That wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart. 
He stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms. 
MICHAEL Where did we first hear th... 
JULIANNE (straight back) The night we met. 
Right to his eyes... 
JULIANNE The night we fell in love. 
He doesn't know what to do with that. 
MICHAEL So we heard it... like, right that... that first... 
JULIANNE We danced to it.  Just like this. 
Just like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say... 
MICHAEL I won't lose you, will I? 
Her eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his. 
JULIANNE No.  Because I won't let you. 
INT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY 
Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress shirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through the Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors, silent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for the custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear... 
... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a glass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting for five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into her laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass. A comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her... 
WALTER I thought Michael was picking me up. 
JULIANNE I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials. 
Meaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then... 
WALTER Kim said, when he turned down the job, there was no friction. 
Julianne thinks back. 
JULIANNE Friction.  No. 
He smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing. 
WALTER I haven't caused... a problem, have I? 
JULIANNE Nobody has.  So far. 
Her bright grin.  His eyes linger on it. 
WALTER Well, you're a little early... 
JULIANNE I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office? 
INT.  WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city. Closes the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is practically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She is stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there. 
Talking to herself, her own desperate support network... 
JULIANNE (softly) You can do this. 
Sacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each other.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The screen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach water.  She pulls the paper from her pocket... 
... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type... 
JULIANNE (mumbling to herself) E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson, Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated, from... Walter Wallace. 
And stops.  Her heart is thumping. 
JULIANNE See, you can do it.  It's easy. 
Doesn't look easy.  Licks her lips. 
JULIANNE You do it fast, it's over.  Like it never happened. 
She sits.  And recites as she types... 
JULIANNE Ben.  I need a favor. 
Here we go.  This is it.  Types... 
JULIANNE My daughter's every happiness. And my wife's.  And, least of all, my own, are in your hands. 
Nods, okay.  Breathing hard.  Types... 
JULIANNE Knowing you value our friendship, and the... cooperative relationship between our companies... I am hopeful of your help. 
Touch, that.  Thinks.  It has to be.  Types...

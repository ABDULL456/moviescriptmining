{"test1_input": "They start together, and stop in deference to each other. They're a little flustered. But not Eve. \nEVE (to Margo) No, thank you. (to Lloyd) Yes. I've seen every performance. \nLLOYD (delighted) Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it? \nEVE I'd like anything Miss Channing played... \nMARGO (beams) Would you, really? How sweet- \nLLOYD (flatly) I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'. \nEVE Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards? \nMARGO Of course it is. \nLLOYD How'd hear about it? \nEVE There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'. \nLLOYD Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance? (Eve nods) Why? I'm curious... \nEve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes. \nEVE Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go. \nMARGO There are other plays... \nEVE Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards... \nLLOYD But you must have friends, a family, a home- \nEve pauses. Then shakes her head. \nKAREN Tell us about it - Eve... \nEve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her \"Eve.\" Then away, again... \nEVE If I only knew how... \nKAREN Try... \nEVE Well... \nBirdie comes out of the bathroom. Everybody looks at her sharply. She realizes she's in on something important. She closes the door quietly, leans against it. \nEVE Well... it started with the play before this one... \nLLOYD 'Remembrance'. \nMARGO Did you see it here in New York? \nEVE San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East. \nBIRDIE I'll never forget that blizzard the night we played Cheyenne. A cold night. First time I ever saw a brassiere break like a piece of matzos... \nEve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands. \nKAREN Eve... why don't you start at the beginning? \nEVE It couldn't possibly interest you. \nMARGO Please... \nEve speaks simply and without self-pity. \nEVE I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? \nLLOYD Not at all... \nEVE Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery. (she smiles) When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards? (Lloyd nods) That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him. (a slight pause) Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead... (Karen puts her hand on Lloyd's) ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am... \nShe finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes the bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes. \nBIRDIE (finally) What a story. Everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end... \nThat breaks the spell. Margo turns to her- \nMARGO There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect! (to Eve) I want to apologize for Birdie's- \nBIRDIE (snaps in) You don't have to apologize for me! (to Eve) I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'... \nEVE (nicely) You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan... \nBIRDIE Call me Birdie. (to Margo) As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed the first half for eleven years an' you know it! \nShe slams into the bathroom again. At that precise instant BILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room. He's youngish, vital, undisciplined. He lugs a beat-up suitcase which he drops as he crosses to Margo- \nBILL Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard- \nMARGO Thank you so much. \nBILL Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration? \nMARGO Show me a human and I might have! \n", "test1_true": "BILL The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me! \nKAREN (louder) Bill- \nMARGO Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two - lovers? \nBill grins suddenly, drops to one knee beside her. \nBILL (smiling) Only in some ways. You're prettier... \nMARGO I'm a junk yard. \nKAREN (yells) Bill! \nBILL (vaguely; to Karen) Huh? \nKAREN This is Eve Harrington. \nBill flashes a fleeting look at Eve. \nBILL Hi. (to Margo) My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard- \nMARGO (kisses him) Heaven help me, I love a psychotic. \nBill grins, rises, sees Eve as if for the first time. \nBILL Hello, what's your name? \nEVE Eve. Eve Harrington. \nKAREN You've already met. \nBILL Where? \nKAREN Right here. A minute ago. \nBILL That's nice. \nMARGO She, too, is a great admirer of yours. \nBIRDIE Imagine. All this admiration in just one room. \nBILL Take your mistress into the bathroom and dress her. (Birdie opens her mouth) Without comment. \nBirdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom. In a moment we hear a shower start to run. Eve gets up. \nKAREN You're not going, are you? \nEVE I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been... \nMARGO (rises) No, don't go... \nEVE The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving... \nMargo, impulsively crosses to Eve. \nMARGO Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk. \nEVE Well - if I'm not in the way... \nMARGO I won't be a minute. \nShe darts into the bathroom. Eve sits down again. \nKAREN Lloyd, we've got to go- \nLloyd gets up. Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door. She yells - the shower is going... \nKAREN Margo, good night! I'll call you tomorrow! \nMargo's answer is lost in the shower noise. Karen crosses to kiss Bill. She's joined by Lloyd. \nKAREN Good luck, genius... \nBILL Geniuses don't need good luck. (he grins) I do. \nLLOYD I'm not worried about you. \nBILL Keep the thought. \nThey shake hands warmly. Karen and Lloyd move to Eve. \nKAREN Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon- \nEVE I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee- \nKAREN Not just that way. As a friend... \nEVE I'd like that. \nLLOYD It's been a real pleasure, Eve. \nEVE I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night... \nLloyd shakes her hand, crosses to join Karen who waits at the open dressing room door. \n", "test1_id": 930, "test2_input": "INT. PANTRY - NIGHT \nIt's a good sized one. In the b.g., the caterers are packing dishes, glassware, etc. Margo crosses to a cupboard. She finds the bicarb. \nMARGO Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell... \nMAX The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise... \nMARGO Miss Caswell? (Max nods) What? \nMAX An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister... \nHe adds water to the bicarb. \nMARGO Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation... \nMAX (mixing) I feel right now like there's one burning in me. \nMARGO When's the audition? \nMAX A couple of weeks. \nMARGO I tell you what. Why don't I read with her? \nMAX Would you? \nMARGO Anything to help you out, Max. \nMAX This is real cooperation. I appreciate it. \nMARGO Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would- \nMAX All you got to do is name it. \nMARGO Give Eve Harrington job in you office. \nMax burps. \nMARGO You get quick action, don't you? \nMAX Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you... \nMARGO You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max. \nMAX But what could she do? \nMARGO She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure- \nMAX Well... \nMARGO Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track... \nMAX I don't know if this would be a wise move... \nMARGO Promise. \nMAX I promise. \nMARGO (happily) That's my Max. \nLloyd enters, looking for her. \nLLOYD There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go. \nMARGO Where is she? \nLLOYD Up in the room. \nMAX If you'll excuse me- (to Margo) I'll tell Miss Caswell... \nHe goes out. A pause. \nMARGO Who's left out there? \nLLOYD Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood. \nMARGO Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners. \nAnother pause. \nMARGO You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you? \nLLOYD Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better. \nMARGO When you do, let me in on it. \nLLOYD I will. \nAnother pause. \nMARGO How's the new one coming? \nLLOYD The play? All right, I guess... \nMARGO \"Cora.\" She's - still a girl of twenty? \n", "test2_true": "MARGO Don't you think it's about time it became important? \nLLOYD How do you mean? \nMARGO Don't be evasive. \nLLOYD Margo, you haven't got any age. \nMARGO Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent. \nLLOYD I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays... \nMARGO Spoken like an author. (abruptly) Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh. (smiles) That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off... \nLLOYD Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want... \nMARGO ... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred- \nLLOYD Just one person. Isn't that so? (Margo doesn't answer) You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play \"Cora\" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill. \nA pause. Margo closes the box of bicarb. \nMARGO Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty two. He looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now. I hate men. (she puts the box down) Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play. I'll wear rompers and come in rolling a hoop if you like... let's go say good night. \nThey exit into the dining room. As they open the swinging door, the CAMERA REMAINS in the doorway. Margo and Lloyd walk toward the stairs. In the b.g., Eve is talking to the group. How much she says is dependent on how long it takes Margo and Lloyd to reach her. \nEVE (in the b.g.) Imagine... to know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you... They smile, their eyes shine - you've pleased them, they want you, you belong. Anything's worth that. \nJust as before, she becomes aware of Margo's approach with Lloyd. She scrambles to her feet... \nMARGO Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother. \nAnd as Margo speaks - or before - we \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. N.Y. THEATER STREET - DAY \nMargo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in. It's Friday afternoon - no performance. \nMARGO'S VOICE What was it the wise man said - \"This, too, will pass away\"? Two weeks later - the day of the audition - all was well with Bill and me, the world and me- \nINT. LOBBY AND FOYER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY \nMargo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few people buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer. She spots Addison sprawled on one of the sofas. \nMARGO Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support... \nADDISON Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise. \nMARGO The ladies' - shall we say - lounge? \nADDISON Being violently ill to her tummy. \nMARGO It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts. \nShe heads for the auditorium. \nADDISON Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over. \nMARGO (stops) Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max. \nADDISON The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four. \nMARGO (lightly) Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill? (he shakes his head) Lloyd? (he shakes his head) Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who? \nADDISON Naturally enough, your understudy. \nMARGO I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy- \nADDISON I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington. \nMARGO Eve! My understudy... \nADDISON (keenly) Didn't you know? \nMARGO (quickly) Of course I knew. \nADDISON It just slipped your mind. \nA moment of silence. \nMARGO How... how was Miss Caswell? \nADDISON Frankly, I don't remember. \nMARGO Just slipped your mind. \nADDISON Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick. \nMARGO Was she that bad? \nAs Addison speaks, he rises with excitement. \n", "test2_id": 931, "test3_input": "LLOYD (into phone) Hello...hello, this is Lloyd Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk to her- \nROOMING HOUSE \nGIRL She's up in her room, Mr. Richards. I really hate to bother you like this, but the way Eve's been feeling - I'm just worried sick what with her leaving for New Haven tomorrow, and everything... \nRICHARDS' BEDROOM \nLLOYD Tell her not to worry - tell her I'll be right over. \nROOMING HOUSE \nGIRL I'll tell her, Mr. Richards. \nShe hangs up. As she moves from the phone, the ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs. The girls smile at each other. They go upstairs, arm in arm. \nRICHARDS' BEDROOM, Karen is still in bed, phone still in her hand. She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her cigarette, gets into a robe. The open door and light of the dressing room tell us where Lloyd is. \nKaren walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her mind. She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes back to the door. \nKAREN (finally) Aren't you... broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit? Rushing off in the middle of the night like a country doctor? \nNo answer except the opening and closing of drawers. \nKAREN What would you do if, instead of Eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical? \nStill no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides swiftly back to the open door. \nKAREN Lloyd, I don't want you to go! \nNow Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with no tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured. \nLLOYD I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general- \nKAREN I'm a human being, I've got some! \nLLOYD (goes right on) - and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater! \nHe goes back into his room. \nKAREN Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done? \nLLOYD Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth! \nKAREN Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career! \nLloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door, Karen after him. \nKAREN That first, last, and foremost - your reason for going now is that you want to be with Eve! Three in the morning or high noon - play or no play - wife or no wife! (Lloyd stops at the door) Isn't it true, Lloyd? \nLloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing. \nEXT. SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY \nThe theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by Max Fabian, opening tonight. \nAddison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. \nADDISON'S VOICE To the Theater world - New Haven, Connecticut, is a short stretch of sidewalk between the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel, surrounded by what looks very much like a small city. It is here that managers have what are called out of-town openings - which are openings for New Yorkers who want to go out of town... \nThey start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's. \nEVE What a day - what a heavenly day... \nADDISON D-day. \nEVE Just like it. \nADDISON And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality... \nEVE (grins) Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go... \nADDISON Are you that sure of tomorrow? \nEVE Aren't you? \nADDISON Frankly - yes. \nThey've arrived in front of the hotel. \nEVE It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one... \nADDISON All paved with diamonds and gold? \nEVE You know me better than that. \nADDISON Paved with what, then? \nEVE Stars. \nShe goes in. Addison follows her. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY \nAddison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door. \n", "test3_true": "ADDISON Almost four. \nEVE Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night... \nADDISON You could sleep, too, couldn't you? \nEVE Why not? \nThey've arrived at her door. She opens it. \nADDISON The mark of a true killer. (he holds out his hand) Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting... \nEVE Why'd call me a killer? \nADDISON Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed. \nHe turns to go. After a few steps- \nEVE (calling) Addison- (he pauses) - come on in for just a minute, won't you? There's... I've got something to tell you. \nAddison turns curiously, and enters behind her. \nINT. EVE'S SUITE - TAFT HOTEL - DAY \nOld-fashioned, dreary and small. The action starts in the living room and continues to the bedroom. \nAddison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair. \nADDISON Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant? \nEVE Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink? \nShe indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor, glasses, etc. Addison's eyebrows lift. \nADDISON Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian. \nEVE Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up... \nADDISON Some plain soda. (Eve starts to fix it) Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven... \nEVE That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance. \nADDISON We're? \nEVE Lloyd and I. \nShe carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet. \nADDISON I find it odd that Karen isn't here for the opening, don't you? \nHe sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at Eve. As he looks back- \nEVE Addison... \nADDISON (blandly) She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her- \nEVE (breaks in) Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted- \nADDISON (nods) - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars... \nEVE I didn't mean just the Theater. \nADDISON What else? \nEve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common. \nEVE (her back to him) Lloyd Richards. He's going to leave Karen. We're going to be married. \nFor just a flash, Addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously. Then they crinkle into a bland smile. \nADDISON So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all... \nEVE (turns; shocked) It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him! \nADDISON I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you. \nEVE I'm in love with Lloyd! \nADDISON Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America- \nEVE You have no right to say such things! \nADDISON - and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison. \nEve drops her shocked manner like a cape. Her face lights up - she crosses back to the ottoman. \nEVE Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great! (as she sits) You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me... \nADDISON ... and Karen. \nEVE She doesn't know. \nKAREN She knows enough not to be here. \nEVE But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married. \n", "test3_id": 932}

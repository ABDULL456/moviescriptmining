DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT \nIt is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for four but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, for about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. \nDiner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overall effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It is June. \nThe CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, is on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about a foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor. \nOver this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of ADDISON deWITT: \nADDISON'S VOICE The Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement is perhaps unknown to you. It has been spared the sensational and commercial publicity that attends such questionable \"honors\" as the Pulitzer Prize and those awards presented annually by the film society... \nThe CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who is speaking. We do not hear what he says. \nADDISON'S VOICE The distinguished looking gentleman is an extremely old actor. Being an actor - he will go on speaking for some time. It is not important what you hear what he says. \nThe CAMERA EASES BACK some more, and CONTINUES until it discloses a fairly COMPREHENSIVE SHOT of the room \nADDISON'S VOICE However it is important that you know where you are, and why you are here. This is the dining room of the Sarah Siddons Society. The occasion is its annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our Theater knows - the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement. \nA GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the entrances of the kitchen. The screens are papered with old theatrical programs. The waiters are all aged and venerable. They look respectfully toward the speaker. \nADDISON'S VOICE These hollowed walls, indeed many of these faces, have looked upon Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the room, Booth breathed this air. It is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death. \nCLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar, it shines proudly above five or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now empty. \nADDISON'S VOICE The minor awards, as you can see, have already been presented. Minor awards are for such as the writer and director - since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it and no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but more of Eve, later. All about Eve, in fact. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES TO: CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT, not young, not unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and merciless of tongue. An omnipresent cigarette holder projects from his mouth like the sward of D'Artagnan. \nHe sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. His narration covers the MOVE of the CAMERA to him: \nADDISON'S VOICE To those of you who do not read, attend the Theater, listen to uncensored radio programs or know anything of the world in which we live - it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself. My name is Addison deWitt. My native habitat is the Theater - in it I toil not, neither do I spin. I am a critic and commentator. I am essential to the Theater - as ants are to a picnic, as the ball weevil to a cotton field... \nHe looks to his left. KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way. She is scraping bread crumbs, spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. Addison takes one of her bread crumbs. She smiles absently. Addison rolls the bread crumb into a cannonball. \nADDISON'S VOICE This is Karen Richards. She is the wife of a playwright, therefore of the Theater by marriage. Nothing in her background or breeding should have brought her any closer the stage than row E, center... \nKaren continues her doodling. \nADDISON'S VOICE ... however, during her senior year in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards lectured on drama. The following year Karen became Mrs. Lloyd Richards. Lloyd is the author of 'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the play which has won for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award... \nKaren absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. A hand reaches in to take the spoon away. Karen looks as the CAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN. He sits at her left. He's a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension. He smiles apologetically and indicated a white powder with he unwraps. He pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping. \nKaren smiles back, returns to her doodling. Addison mashes a cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. He eyes Max. \nADDISON'S VOICE There are two types of theatrical producers. One has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax deductible loss. This type is interested in Art. \nMax drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps delicately and close his eyes. \nADDISON'S VOICE The other is one to whom each production mean potential ruin or fortune. This type is out to make a buck. Meet Max Fabian. He is the producer of the play which has won Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award... \nMax rests fitfully. He twitches. A hand reaches into the SCENE, removes a bottle of Scotch from before him. The CAMERA follows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING. She sits at Max's left, at deWitt's right. An attractive, strong face. She is childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when she should be the other, but always positive. She pours a stiff drink. \nAddison hold out the soda bottle to her. She looks at it, and at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. He smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself. \nADDISON'S VOICE Margo Channing is the Star of the Theater. She made her first stage appearance, at the age of four, in 'Midsummer Night's Dream'. She played a fairy and entered - quite unexpectedly - stark naked. She has been a Star ever since. \nMargo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it. \nADDISON'S VOICE Margo is a great Star. A true Star. She never was or will be anything less or anything less... (slight pause) ... the part for which Eve Harrington is receiving the Sarah Siddons Award was intended originally for Margo Channing... \nAddison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in the general direction of the table of honor. As he speaks the CAMERA MOVES in the direction of his glance... \nADDISON'S VOICE Having covered in tedious detail not only the history of the Sarah Siddons Society, but also the history of acting since Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line - our distinguished chairman has finally arrived at our reason for being here... \nAt this point Addison's voice FADES OUT and the voice of the aged actor FADES IN. CAMERA is in MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT of him and the podium. \nAGED ACTOR I have been proud and privileged to have spent my life in the Theater - \"a poor player ... that struts and frets his hour upon the stage\" - and I have been honored to be, for forty years, Chief Promoter of the Sarah Siddons Society... (he lifts the Sarah Siddons Award from its altar) Thirty-nine times have I placed in deserving hands this highest honor the Theater knows... (he grows a bit arch, he uses his eyebrows) Surely no actor is older than I - I have earned my place out of the sun... (indulgent laughter) ... and never before has this Award gone to anyone younger than its recipient tonight. How fitting that it should pass from my hands to hers... \nEVE HANDS: Lovely, beautifully groomed. In serene repose, they rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small evening cup. \nAGED ACTOR Such young hands. Such a young lady. Young in years, but whose heart is as old as the Theater... \nAddison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. Then, slowly, he turns to look at Karen... \nAGED ACTOR Some of us a privileged to know her. We have seen beyond the beauty and artistry- \nKaren never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs. \nAGED ACTOR -that have made her name resound through the nation. We know her humility. Her devotion, her loyalty to her art. \nAddison's glance moves from Karen to Margo. \nAGED ACTOR Her love, her deep and abiding love for us- \nMargo's face is a mask. She looks down at the drink which she cradles with both hands. \nAGED ACTOR -for what we are and what we do. The Theater. She has had one wish, one prayer, one dream. To belong to us. (he's nearing his curtain line) Tonight her dream has come true. And henceforth we shall dream the same of her. (a slight pause) Honored members, ladies and gentlemen - for distinguished achievement in the Theater - the Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve Harrington. \nThe entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous applause. Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet... Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the Aged Actor's left... \nKaren practically propels her toward the stage door. \nKAREN (insisting) There isn't another like you, there couldn't be- \nEVE But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this. \nKAREN You look just fine... (they're at the stage door) ... by the way. What's your name? \nEVE Eve. Eve Harrington. \nKaren opens the door. They go in. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT \nEverything, including the doorman, looks fireproof. \nEve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican. Karen, with a \"Good evening, Gus -\" to the doorman, leads the way toward Margo's stage dressing room. Eve, drinking in the wonderment of all the surveys, lags behind. Karen waits for her to catch up... \nEVE You can breathe it - can't you? Like some magic perfume... \nKaren smiles, takes Eve's arm. They proceed to Margo's dressing room. \nEXT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT \nNo star on the closed door; the paint is peeling. A type written chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING. \nAs Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from Margo makes them pause. \nKAREN (whispers) You wait a minute... (smiles) ... now don't run away- \nEve smiles shakily. At the same moment: \nMARGO'S VOICE (loudly; through the door) \"Honey chile,\" I said, \"if the South had won the war, you could write the same plays about the North!\" \nKaren enters during the line. \nINT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT \nIt is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and cracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A door leads to an old-fashioned bathroom. \nMargo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, her hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almost finished drink. \nLLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He's in his late thirties, sensitive, literate. \nBetween them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's maid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. She is fiercely loyal to Margo. \nKaren enters during the line Margo started while she was outside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. \nKAREN Hi. (she goes to kiss Lloyd) Hello, darling- \nMARGO Hi. (she goes right on - in a think \"Suth'n\" accent) \"Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!\" \nLLOYD How was the concert? \nKAREN Loud. \nBIRDIE Lemme fix you a drink. \nKAREN No thanks, Birdie. \nKaren laughs with them. \nLLOYD Margo's interview with a lady reporter from the South- \nBIRDIE The minute it gets printed they're gonna fire on Gettysburg all over again... \nMARGO It was Fort Sumter they fired on- \nBIRDIE I never played Fort Sumter. \nShe takes the wig into the bathroom. Margo starts creaming the make-up off her face. \nMARGO Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers... \nLLOYD That was way back... \nMARGO Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband. \nBirdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig. \nBIRDIE You need new girdles. \nMARGO Buy some. \nBIRDIE The same size? \nMARGO Of course! \nBIRDIE Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic. \nShe picks up Lloud empty glass, asks \"more\"? He shakes his head. She pours herself a quick one. \nKAREN (firmly) Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie. \nBIRDIE I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo. \nThey start together, and stop in deference to each other. They're a little flustered. But not Eve. \nEVE (to Margo) No, thank you. (to Lloyd) Yes. I've seen every performance. \nLLOYD (delighted) Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it? \nEVE I'd like anything Miss Channing played... \nMARGO (beams) Would you, really? How sweet- \nLLOYD (flatly) I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'. \nEVE Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards? \nMARGO Of course it is. \nLLOYD How'd hear about it? \nEVE There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'. \nLLOYD Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance? (Eve nods) Why? I'm curious... \nEve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes. \nEVE Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go. \nMARGO There are other plays... \nEVE Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards... \nLLOYD But you must have friends, a family, a home- \nEve pauses. Then shakes her head. \nKAREN Tell us about it - Eve... \nEve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her \"Eve.\" Then away, again... \nEVE If I only knew how... \nKAREN Try... \nEVE Well... \nBirdie comes out of the bathroom. Everybody looks at her sharply. She realizes she's in on something important. She closes the door quietly, leans against it. \nEVE Well... it started with the play before this one... \nLLOYD 'Remembrance'. \nMARGO Did you see it here in New York? \nEVE San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East. \nBIRDIE I'll never forget that blizzard the night we played Cheyenne. A cold night. First time I ever saw a brassiere break like a piece of matzos... \nEve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands. \nKAREN Eve... why don't you start at the beginning? \nEVE It couldn't possibly interest you. \nMARGO Please... \nEve speaks simply and without self-pity. \nEVE I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? \nLLOYD Not at all... \nEVE Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery. (she smiles) When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards? (Lloyd nods) That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him. (a slight pause) Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead... (Karen puts her hand on Lloyd's) ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am... \nShe finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes the bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes. \nBIRDIE (finally) What a story. Everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end... \nThat breaks the spell. Margo turns to her- \nMARGO There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect! (to Eve) I want to apologize for Birdie's- \nBIRDIE (snaps in) You don't have to apologize for me! (to Eve) I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'... \nEVE (nicely) You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan... \nBIRDIE Call me Birdie. (to Margo) As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed the first half for eleven years an' you know it! \nShe slams into the bathroom again. At that precise instant BILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room. He's youngish, vital, undisciplined. He lugs a beat-up suitcase which he drops as he crosses to Margo- \nBILL Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard- \nMARGO Thank you so much. \nBILL Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration? \nMARGO Show me a human and I might have! \nEVE Mrs. Richards. (Karen and Lloyd look back) ... I'll never forget this night as long as I live. And I'll never forget you for making it possible. \nKaren smiles warmly. She closes the door. They leave. \nKAREN'S VOICE - and I'll never forget you, Eve. Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I? Funny the things you remember - and the things you don't... \nINT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nEve sits on the same chair. Bill keeps moving around. Eve never takes her eyes off him. He offers her a cigarette. She shakes her head. He looks at his watch. \nEVE You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it. \nBILL (grins) I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut. \nHe goes to the dressing table, picks up Margo's pocketbook, opens it. He finds a letter. He glances at it, puts it back. \nBILL She's been carrying that letter around for weeks. I've read it three times... \nThere's a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom. \nMARGO'S VOICE You're supposed to zip the zipper - not me. \nBIRDIE'S VOICE Like tryin' to zip a pretzel - stand still! \nBill grins. \nBILL What a documentary those two would make... like the mongoose and the cobra- \nHe sprawls on the chaise, closes his eyes. A pause. \nEVE (finally) So you're going to Hollywood. \nBill grunts in the affirmative. Silence. \nBILL Why? \nEVE I just wondered. \nBILL Just wondered what? \nEVE Why. \nBILL Why what? \nEVE Why you have to go out there. \nBILL I don't have to. I want to. \nEVE Is it the money? \nBILL Eighty percent of it will go for taxes. \nEVE Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater- \nBILL The Theatuh, the Theatuh- (he sits up) - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna? (he gets up) Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere. \nEVE I just asked a simple question. \nBILL (grins) And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense... (he sits back down) ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin... \nHe lies down again. \nEVE But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there. \nBILL (he closes his eyes) It's only one picture deal. \nEVE So few come back... \nBILL Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards... \nA pause. \nEVE I read George Jean Nathan every week. \nBILL Also Addison deWitt. \nEVE Every day. \nBILL You didn't have to tell me. \nMargo, putting on an earring, buzzes out of the bathroom followed by Birdie. Bill sits up. \nMARGO (en route) I understand it's the latest thing - just one earring. If it isn't, it's going to be - I can't find the other... \nShe grabs her pocketbook, starts rummaging. Out comes the letter... \nBILL Throw that dreary thing away, it bores me- \nMargo drops it in the wastebasket, keeps rummaging. \nEVE (concerned) Where do you suppose it could be? \nBIRDIE It'll show up. \nMARGO (gives up) Oh well... (to Birdie) ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught- \nBILL As of this moment you're six years old... \nHe starts to kiss her, stops when he becomes aware of Eve standing near them. She has his ticket in her hand. \nEVE All ready. \nShe hands Bill his ticket, they start toward the gate. \nINT. BOARDING GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT \nThe D.C. 6 in the b.g. A few visitors. Bill hands his ticket to the guard, turns to Eve. \nBILL Thanks for your help... good luck. \nEVE Goodbye, Mr. Sampson. \nBill puts his arms around Margo. \nBILL Knit me a muffler. \nMARGO Call me when you get in... \nThey kiss. Margo's arms tighten desperately. Bill pulls away, kisses her again lightly, starts for the plane. Margo turns away. Eve puts her arms through Margo's. \nBill pauses en route to the plane. \nBILL Hey - junior... \nMargo turns to look at him with Eve. \nBILL Keep your eyes on her. Don't let her get lonely. She's a loose lamb in a jungle... \nEve looks at Margo. Margo smiles. \nEVE Don't worry... \nBill waves, climbs aboard. The door is closed behind him, the departure routine starts... \nMargo and eve turn to go. They walk down the passage. As they walk, Eve gently disengages her arm from Margo's and puts it comfortingly about her... \nMARGO'S VOICE That same night we sent for Eve's things, her few pitiful possessions... she moved into the little guest room on the top floor... \nINT. DINING HALL - NIGHT \nMARGO slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides of the almost empty highball glass. \nMARGO'S VOICE ... she cried when she saw it - it was so like her little room back home in Wisconsin. \nADDISON eyeing her quizzically. He offers her the whiskey. \nMARGO shakes her head, absently. She looks down at her glass again. Then, she raises her eyes to look at Eve. \nMARGO'S VOICE ... the next three weeks were out of a fairy tale - and I was Cinderella in the last act. Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother, friend, psychiatrist and cop - the honeymoon was on... \nINT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nIt's one floor above street level. A long narrow room, smartly furnished - including a Sarah Siddons Award. \nMARGO'S NARRATIVE overlaps into the scene which is a SILENT ONE. \nEve sits at a smart desk. She is just arranging a stack of letters which she carries to Margo with a pen. Margo sits comfortably by the fire with a play script. She hands the scrips up to Eve, shakes her head and holds her nose. Eve smiles, takes the script, hands Margo the letters to sign. \nBirdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table before the fire. \nThe phone rings. \nBirdie and Eve both go for it. Eve gets there first. By her polite but negative attitude, we know she is giving someone a skillful brush-off. \nBirdie glares first at her, then at Margo. \nMargo leans her head back, closes her eyes blissfully... \nBirdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out... \nINT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - DAY \nFrom the wings. The audience is never visible. Eve in the f.g. Margo and company taking a curtain call. Tumultuous applause... the curtain falls. The cast, except for Margo and two male leads, walk off. The curtain rises again... \nEVE, watching and listening to the storm of applause. Her eyes shine, she clasps and unclasps her hands... \nTHE STAGE, Eve again in the f.g., but closer. Again the curtain falls. This time the two men go off. Curtain rises on Margo alone. If anything, the applause builds... \nEVE, that same hypnotic look... there are tears in her eyes. The curtain falls offscene, then rises again - \nMARGO, the curtain falls again between her and CAMERA... \nBACKSTAGE, the curtain just settling on the floor. Margo starts off. \nSTAGE MANAGER One more? \nMARGO (shakes her head) From now on it's not applause - just something to do till the aisles get less crowded... \nShe walks as she talks and winds up at Eve - still in the wings. Eve's eyes are wet, she dabs at her nose. \nMARGO What - again? \nOPERATOR'S VOICE We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills... \nMARGO Call, what call? \nOPERATOR'S VOICE It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing? \nMARGO That's right, but I don't understand- \nOPERATOR'S VOICE We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills... \nMARGO I placed...? \nOPERATOR'S VOICE Go ahead, please... \nBILL'S VOICE (a loud, happy squawk) Margo! What a wonderful surprise! \nMargo jumps at his vehemence. As she does so, the SCREEN WIPES DOWN DIAGONALLY LEFT TO RIGHT, so that Margo remains in the lower right-hand diagonal of the screen and Bill is disclosed in the upper left. He, too, is in bed, reading. His clock says midnight. \nBILL (continuing) What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do- \nMARGO (dazed) Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill? \nBILL You're my girl, aren't you? \nMARGO That I am... \nBILL Then you're crazy. \nMARGO (nods in agreement) When - when are you coming back? \nBILL I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can- \nMARGO - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home... \nBILL You in a hurry? \nMARGO A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight... \nBILL Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it- \nMARGO Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff... \nBILL Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it... \nMARGO (convinced she's gone mad) Sing it? \nBILL Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do... \nMargo's eyes pop. Her jaw and the phone sag. \nMARGO Bill... Bill, it's your birthday. \nBILL And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...? \nMargo knows damn well it wasn't she. \nMARGO (miserably) Happy birthday, darling... \nBILL The reading could have been better, but you said it - now \"many happy returns of the day...\" \nMARGO (the same) Many happy returns of the day... \nBILL I get a party, don't I? \nMARGO Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask? \nBILL (laughs) It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me... \nMARGO She did...? \nBILL She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her. \nMARGO Yeah... I will. \nBILL How is Eve? Okay? \nMARGO Okay. \nBILL I love you... \nMARGO (mutters) I'll check with Eve... \nBILL What? \nMARGO I love you too. Good night, darling- \nBILL See you... \nMargo hangs up. Bill hangs up. He replaces the phone, picks up his book... SLOW WIPE until ONLY MARGO is on screen. She puts her phone away. She gets a cigarette. She lights it. She rolls over on her back... \nINT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - DAY \nMargo is propped up in bed, still reflective. Birdie comes in with her breakfast tray and a \"hi\" which gets a \"hi\" from Margo. She starts on some petty chores. Margo takes a sip of orange juice... \nMARGO Birdie- \nShe starts upstairs. \nBILL Need any help? \nMARGO (pauses, smiles) To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve? \nEVE If you'd like. \nMARGO I wouldn't like. \nShe goes up, exits out of sight. A pause. Miss Caswell reaches up to take the drink out of Max's hand. \nMAX I forgot I had it. \nMISS CASWELL I didn't. \nBill gets up and goes after Margo... \nADDISON Too bad! We'll miss the third act. They're going to play it off stage. \nEve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears. \nLLOYD Coming? \nKAREN In a minute... \nShe crosses to Eve, puts an arm around her. \nKAREN You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do... \nEVE But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing... \nKAREN The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't. \nEVE If I thought I'd offended her, of all people- \nKAREN Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants. \nEVE (smiles) Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me. \nKaren smiles back. She joins Lloyd and Max. \nLLOYD Max is going to drop us... \nADDISON I've often wondered, Max, why you bother with a chauffeur and limousine in New York City. \nMAX In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays. \nADDISON And too many of them are produced. \nMISS CASWELL Let's go sit by the piano. \nADDISON You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano. (to Eve) And you come sit by me. (to the others) Good night. \nThey laugh, say \"good night,\" and start downstairs. As Eve crosses to Addison: \nEVE Karen... (Karen pauses) ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before? \nKAREN (smiles) No, Eve, I won't forget... \nShe follows the men downstairs. CLOSE UP of an old engraving of Mrs. Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among other theatrical mementos on the stair wall... \nINT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT \nThe applause continues. Margo sits back in her chair now, picking at a bit of fingernail polish... \nMARGO'S VOICE Bill's welcoming-home-birthday party... a night to go down in history. Like the Chicago Fire - or the Massacre of the Huguenots. Even before the party started, I could smell disaster in the air... \nINT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe same night as the previous sequence, but before the party has started. Margo is all dressed except for jewelry. She stands before her dressing table putting it on. She sips at an enormous Martini... \nMARGO'S VOICE I knew it, I sensed it even as I finished dressing for that blasted party... \nBirdie comes in. \nBIRDIE You all put together? \nMARGO My back's open. (Birdie goes to work on it) Did the extra help get here? \nBIRDIE There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency? \nMARGO You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food? \nBIRDIE The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- (she zips Margo) Voila. \nMARGO (laughs) That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he? \nBIRDIE There was nothing he didn't know. (she starts tidying the room) There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake? \nMARGO The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. (Birdie cackles) They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late. \nBIRDIE Late for what? \nMARGO Don't be dense. The party. \nMARGO Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit? \nEVE'S VOICE (quietly) Miss Channing? \nBill and Margo look off. Eve is in the room. They have no way of knowing how long she's been there. \nEVE The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do? \nMARGO Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry. \nBILL I'll get it. (he crosses to Eve) What'll you have? \nEve, involuntarily, looks to Margo. \nMARGO A milkshake? \nEve smiles, turns to Bill. \nEVE A Martini. Very dry, please... \nBill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the pantry. As he crosses the stairs, Karen, Lloyd and Max come up from the street level below. General greetings. Bill continues up to pantry. Eve and then Margo come up to add their welcome... \nEVE (to Karen) May I have your coat? \nKAREN Don't bother, I can take it up myself... \nEVE Please... \nKaren yields with a \"thank you, Eve-.\" Eve goes up with the coat. Lloyd looks after her approvingly. \nLLOYD I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness... \nMARGO ... Among so many quiet qualities. \nThey start for the living room. \nKAREN Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in... \nMARGO I'm so happy you're happy. \nMAX Look, you haven't been running a settlement house exactly - the kid's earned her way. You had a pretty mixed-up inventory when she took over - merchandise laying all over the shop... \nLLOYD You've got Margo mixed up with a five-and-ten-cent store... \nMARGO Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max? \nMAX How about me what? \nThey've come to a halt near the fireplace. \nMARGO Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory? \nMAX I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit. \nKAREN This is the most ghoulish conversation... \nBill brings two Martinis. He hands one to Margo. \nMARGO (it drips ice) Thank you. \nBILL Nothing, really... \nMARGO The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her... \nBILL (smiles) I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl... \nHe hands Eve's drink to Karen. Max has wandered off. Other guests are arriving. Margo gulps her drink, hands Bill the empty glass. He puts it on a passing tray. Margo takes a fresh one at the same time. \nLLOYD The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen? \nMARGO (to Bill) What is he talking about? \nBILL Macbeth. \nKAREN (to Margo) We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning? \nMargo surveys them all. \nMARGO Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy night. \nShe downs the drink, hands the empty glass to Bill, and leaves them. She passes two women, gabbing by the piano. As they see her: \nWOMAN #1 Margo, darling! \nWOMAN #2 Darling! \nMARGO (passing) Darlings... \nShe arrives at the landing just as Addison comes up with Miss Caswell. Margo takes a drink from a passing tray. \nMARGO (to Addison) I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here? \nADDISON Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell? \nMARGO I do not. How do you do? \nINT. PANTRY - NIGHT \nIt's a good sized one. In the b.g., the caterers are packing dishes, glassware, etc. Margo crosses to a cupboard. She finds the bicarb. \nMARGO Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell... \nMAX The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise... \nMARGO Miss Caswell? (Max nods) What? \nMAX An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister... \nHe adds water to the bicarb. \nMARGO Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation... \nMAX (mixing) I feel right now like there's one burning in me. \nMARGO When's the audition? \nMAX A couple of weeks. \nMARGO I tell you what. Why don't I read with her? \nMAX Would you? \nMARGO Anything to help you out, Max. \nMAX This is real cooperation. I appreciate it. \nMARGO Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would- \nMAX All you got to do is name it. \nMARGO Give Eve Harrington job in you office. \nMax burps. \nMARGO You get quick action, don't you? \nMAX Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you... \nMARGO You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max. \nMAX But what could she do? \nMARGO She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure- \nMAX Well... \nMARGO Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track... \nMAX I don't know if this would be a wise move... \nMARGO Promise. \nMAX I promise. \nMARGO (happily) That's my Max. \nLloyd enters, looking for her. \nLLOYD There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go. \nMARGO Where is she? \nLLOYD Up in the room. \nMAX If you'll excuse me- (to Margo) I'll tell Miss Caswell... \nHe goes out. A pause. \nMARGO Who's left out there? \nLLOYD Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood. \nMARGO Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners. \nAnother pause. \nMARGO You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you? \nLLOYD Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better. \nMARGO When you do, let me in on it. \nLLOYD I will. \nAnother pause. \nMARGO How's the new one coming? \nLLOYD The play? All right, I guess... \nMARGO \"Cora.\" She's - still a girl of twenty? \nBILL Don't mix your metaphors. \nMARGO I mix what I like. \nBILL Okay. Mix. \nMARGO I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind. \nBILL What a body, what a voice. \nMARGO The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind! \nBILL The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down. \nMARGO I will not calm down! \nBILL Don't calm down. \nMARGO You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you? \nBILL I'm trying terribly hard. \nMARGO Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against! \nBILL Here we go... \nMARGO Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt- \nBILL (sits up) Now don't get carried away- \nMARGO (going right on) - shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance! \nBILL You've been all through that with Lloyd- \nMARGO The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches! \nBILL I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts! \nMARGO Paranoiac! \nBILL I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon! \nMARGO Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it... \nShe turns away. Bill grabs her, pulls her down on the bed. He holds her down. \nBILL No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums! \nMARGO (struggling) That word again! I don't even know what it means... \nBILL (firmly) It's time you found out. I love you. (Margo says \"Ha!\") I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman- (Margo says \"A body with a voice\") - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress- (he waits; Margo says nothing) - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness- (Margo says \"Except happiness\") - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid- (Margo sneers \"Kid!\") - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it! \nMargo seems quiet. He gets up. She sits up. \nMARGO It's obvious you're not a woman. \nBILL I've been aware of that for some time. \nMARGO Well, I am. \nBILL I'll say. \nMARGO Don't be condescending. \nBILL Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink. \nMARGO (with dignity) I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut. \nBILL (laughs) Margo, let's make peace. \nMARGO The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender. \nBILL Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me? \nMARGO It's not nonsense. \nBILL But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me? (Margo nods) Isn't that enough? \nMARGO I wish it were. \nBILL Then what would be enough? (Margo doesn't answer) If we were married? \nMARGO I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something. \nBILL You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this. \nMARGO I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know... \nBILL I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me. (Margo doesn't say) I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could. (a pause) We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time. (he takes a breath) You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo. \nNo word from her. He starts away. \nMARGO Bill... (he stops) ... where are you going? To find Eve? \nBILL (smiles grimly) That suddenly makes the whole thing believable. \nKAREN Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet- \nMARGO Peace and quit is for libraries. \nThe car swerves - suddenly and slightly. \nKAREN Lloyd, be careful... \nLLOYD Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass. \nMARGO Karen and I just don't want an accident- \nLLOYD I have no intention of having an accident! \nMARGO It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear. \nThey all laugh. Suddenly the car slows and stops - with that hissing sound that can mean only one thing - no gas. \nLLOYD Now what's this...? \nHe tries to start it again. No luck. He turns on the dashboard lights. The gas gauge reads empty. \nLLOYD But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday! (to Karen) Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning? \nKAREN (very low) I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things... \nLLOYD Incredible. \nFutilely, he runs the started again. \nMARGO (crisply) How much time have we? \nKAREN Roughly ten minutes. \nMARGO How far to the station? \nKAREN Three or four miles... \nMARGO Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas? \nKAREN (looking) None in sight, there aren't many along this back road... \nMARGO Not many car either, not much chance of a lift... \nA moment of silence. \nLLOYD Well. No sense my just sitting here. I'm going to walk up about half a mile, just in case. \nHe starts out of the car. The cold comes in like a knife, the women react. \nKAREN You'll break your neck on that ice. \nLLOYD (grins) What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties... \nKAREN Don't joke about such things. \nMARGO (quietly) How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on. \nLLOYD The audience will want its money refunded, believe me. \nMARGO Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed. \nLloyd starts down the road. He slips once, recovers, waves and keeps going. \nKAREN He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical- \nMARGO It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous. \nKAREN (smiles) I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down. \nMARGO Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas. \nThey tuck the fur car robe around them. A pause. Margo turns on the radio... it's \"Liebestraum.\" \nMARGO Do you want it on? \nKAREN It doesn't matter. \nMARGO I detest cheap sentiment. \nShe turns it off. Another pause. \nMARGO Karen. (Karen says \"hm?\") I haven't been pleasant this weekend. \nKAREN We've all seemed a little tense lately... \nMARGO Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me... \nKAREN We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well... \nMARGO So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me... \nKAREN You're Margo. Just - Margo. \nMARGO And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved. \nMARGO It get better! \"- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-\" \nKAREN I can't believe Eve said those things! \nMargo crumples the paper as if it were Eve's neck. \nMARGO (pacing) In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization... (she hurls the paper away) ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance! \nKAREN (weakly) Lloyd says it's a publicity release... \nMARGO The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat... \nShe pauses in midair to look at... Bill. He has come up the stairs tow at a time, stands at the landing. \nBILL (quietly) I came as soon as I read that piece of filth. I ran all the way... \nMargo suddenly starts to cry. She turns from him. Bill takes her in his arms. He holds her... \nBILL Bill's here, baby. Everything's all right, now... \nMargo says nothing, just hides in his embrace. He soothes her, pets her... he looks over at Karen. \nKAREN I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'... \nBILL (smiles) Maybe just a little around the edges. \nKaren smiles back, waves, and goes out. \nINT. RICHARDS' APARTMENT - DAY \nKaren's having some lunch. Lloyd, still in his robe, sits opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. A copy of the interview before him. \nLLOYD (is saying) - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say- \nKAREN Where'd you get all that information? \nLLOYD (put out his cigarette) Eve. \nKAREN Eve? \nLLOYD She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her... \nKAREN That was a pity... \nLLOYD (gets up) She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo... \nKAREN I wonder why. \nLloyd wanders about - he seems to be searching for words, for a position to maintain... \nLLOYD She started to tell me all about it - and she couldn't finish, she cried so... \nHe's over by a window, his back to her. Karen eyes him curiously, waiting for the payoff... \nLLOYD (finally) You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression... \nKAREN That's quite a change of subject. \nLLOYD (walks again) What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking... \nKAREN I'm trying hard to follow you. \nLLOYD If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away... \nKAREN I'm beginning to catch up. \nLLOYD If we could cast it properly, that is... \nKAREN (carefully) Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it? \nLLOYD (smiles) You've got to admit it would be a novelty. \nKAREN Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve. \nA pause. \nLLOYD Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like \"Cora,\" she'd never have the nerve... \nKAREN Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello. \nLLOYD No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me... \nKAREN With gestures, of course. \nLLOYD (wistfully) For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise- \nNow Karen explodes. She rises. \nKAREN Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of \"Cora.\" \nLLOYD Now just a minute- \nKAREN Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise! \nLLOYD (angry) Now just a minute! \nBILL The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends. \nLloyd fills all the glasses. \nLLOYD There are very few moments in life as good as this. Let's remember it. (he lifts his glass) To each of us and all of us... never have we been more close - may we never be farther apart. \nThey drink. A waiter approaches with a note. \nWAITER Mrs. Richards? \nKAREN Yes? \nWAITER For you. \nKaren stares at it curiously, then opens it. \nLLOYD Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass... \nMARGO Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe... \nKAREN (angrily) This beats all world's records for running, standing and jumping gall! \nShe whips the note to Margo, who reads it aloud. \nMARGO (reading) \"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please\" - it's underlined - \"meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve.\" \nBILL I understand she is now the understudy in there. \nMARGO (looking about) Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin. \nAddison sits near the entrance, at a banquette table for two. A crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate Eve's place. He nibbles daintily at some blini. \nMargo hails a passing captain. \nMARGO Encore du champagne. \nCAPTAIN More champagne, Miss Channing? \nMARGO That's what I said, bub. \nLLOYD (to Karen) After all, maybe she just wants to apologize... \nKAREN I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say. \nBILL But what could she say? That's what fascinates me... \nLLOYD Go on - find out... \nMARGO Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there... \nKAREN Well... all right. \nShe gets up and goes. The CAMERA takes her past Addison's table. He rises in polite surprise. \nADDISON Karen! How nice... \nShe walks past him without a word. He smiles, looks toward the group. He raises his glass in a toast. \nMargo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand flourish, then eating it. \nBILL Very effective. But why take it out on me? \nHe eats one in self-defense. \nINT. LADIES' ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT \nNever having been, I can't say what it looks like. It is to be hoped that there is an outer and inner room. We are concerned with the outer. \nThere is an attendant in charge, and a constantly changing flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs. All cafe society - including one young drunk stretched out under a mink coat and a wet towel. \nThere are two chairs - or a banquette - in a corner. Eve waits there. She rises as Karen approaches. \nEVE I was wondering whether you'd come at all.. \nKAREN Don't get up. (she smiles grimly) And don't act as if I were the queen mother. \nEVE I don't expect you to be pleasant. \nKAREN I don't intend to be. \nEVE Can't we sit down? Just for a minute... \nShe sits down. Karen remains standing. \nEVE I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy. \nKAREN There can't be very much- \nEVE Oh, but there is- \nKAREN - and easy or not, I won't believe a word. \nEVE Why shouldn't you? (a pause) Please sit down. \nKaren sits, reluctantly and rigidly. \nEVE Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk. \nADDISON Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of \"Cora\" - and your hopes of playing it. \nEVE I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested. \nADDISON She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part? \nEVE Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part. \nAddison puffs at his cigarette, bemused. \nADDISON Just like that, eh? \nEVE Just like that. \nADDISON (thoughtfully) Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me. \nEve's feelings are hurt. \nEVE I don't think that's funny. \nADDISON It wasn't meant to be. \nEVE I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever... \nADDISON (breaks in) I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it. \nTheir eyes meet. \nADDISON We have a great deal in common, it seems to me... \nThey both look as Karen passes them on her way back to her table. \nGROUP, as Karen joins them. Another bottle of champagne has come and almost gone - there's a fine, cheery feeling among them. Margo, in particular, is cheery. A pause. Karen downs a glass of champagne. \nLLOYD - well? What happened? \nKAREN Nothing much. She apologized. \nMARGO With tears? \nKAREN With tears. \nMARGO But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella... \nKAREN Check. \nMARGO Very classy stuff, lots of technique- \nLLOYD You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say? \nKAREN Not much. \nMARGO Groom- (Bill says \"huh?\") - may I have a wedding present? \nBILL What would you like? Texas? \nMARGO I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine... (blissfully) ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go. \nThey all look. \nADDISON AND EVE, they get up and go without looking back. \nGROUP, they watch for an instant. \nMARGO There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre... \nBILL You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre. \nMARGO You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her... \nKaren's reactions are, of course, most important. Knowing what she's done to Margo - wondering how to do what she must. \nMARGO ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too. \nLLOYD You know, she probably means well, after all... \nMARGO She is a louse. \nBILL (to Lloyd) Never try to outguess Margo. \nMARGO Groom. \nBILL Yes, dear. \nMARGO You know what I'm going to be? \nBILL A cowboy. \nMARGO A married lady. \nBILL With the paper to prove it. \nMARGO I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen? \nLLOYD (into phone) Hello...hello, this is Lloyd Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk to her- \nROOMING HOUSE \nGIRL She's up in her room, Mr. Richards. I really hate to bother you like this, but the way Eve's been feeling - I'm just worried sick what with her leaving for New Haven tomorrow, and everything... \nRICHARDS' BEDROOM \nLLOYD Tell her not to worry - tell her I'll be right over. \nROOMING HOUSE \nGIRL I'll tell her, Mr. Richards. \nShe hangs up. As she moves from the phone, the ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs. The girls smile at each other. They go upstairs, arm in arm. \nRICHARDS' BEDROOM, Karen is still in bed, phone still in her hand. She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her cigarette, gets into a robe. The open door and light of the dressing room tell us where Lloyd is. \nKaren walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her mind. She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes back to the door. \nKAREN (finally) Aren't you... broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit? Rushing off in the middle of the night like a country doctor? \nNo answer except the opening and closing of drawers. \nKAREN What would you do if, instead of Eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical? \nStill no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides swiftly back to the open door. \nKAREN Lloyd, I don't want you to go! \nNow Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with no tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured. \nLLOYD I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general- \nKAREN I'm a human being, I've got some! \nLLOYD (goes right on) - and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater! \nHe goes back into his room. \nKAREN Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done? \nLLOYD Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth! \nKAREN Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career! \nLloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door, Karen after him. \nKAREN That first, last, and foremost - your reason for going now is that you want to be with Eve! Three in the morning or high noon - play or no play - wife or no wife! (Lloyd stops at the door) Isn't it true, Lloyd? \nLloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing. \nEXT. SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY \nThe theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by Max Fabian, opening tonight. \nAddison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. \nADDISON'S VOICE To the Theater world - New Haven, Connecticut, is a short stretch of sidewalk between the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel, surrounded by what looks very much like a small city. It is here that managers have what are called out of-town openings - which are openings for New Yorkers who want to go out of town... \nThey start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's. \nEVE What a day - what a heavenly day... \nADDISON D-day. \nEVE Just like it. \nADDISON And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality... \nEVE (grins) Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go... \nADDISON Are you that sure of tomorrow? \nEVE Aren't you? \nADDISON Frankly - yes. \nThey've arrived in front of the hotel. \nEVE It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one... \nADDISON All paved with diamonds and gold? \nEVE You know me better than that. \nADDISON Paved with what, then? \nEVE Stars. \nShe goes in. Addison follows her. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY \nAddison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door. \nADDISON (thoughtfully) I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined? \nEVE We decided the night before last, before we came up here... \nADDISON (increasingly tense) Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage? \nEVE The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home... \nADDISON You sat and talked until it was light... \nEVE (meaningly) We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract. \nADDISON (quietly) There never was, there'll never be another like you. \nEVE (happily) Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve! \nAddison rises slowly, to his full height. As Eve watches him, as her eyes go up to his, her smile fades- \nADDISON What do you take me for? \nEVE (cautiously) I don't know what I take you for anything... \nADDISON (moving away) It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them? \nEVE I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what... \nADDISON Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours. \nEVE I never intended you to be. \nADDISON Yes, you did. You still do. \nEve gets up, now. \nEVE I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I- \nADDISON (breaks in) - it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer. \nEVE (wisely) Champion to champion. \nADDISON Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class. \nEVE Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap! \nADDISON Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say. (they are now facing each other) Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you. \nEVE What do you mean by that? \nADDISON More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it. \nEVE What have you got to do with it? \nADDISON Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me. \nEVE I can't believe my ears... \nADDISON A dull cliche. \nEVE Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama... \nADDISON So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I... \nEVE ... taken it for granted? That you and I... \nShe smiles. Then she chuckles, then laughs. A mistake. Addison slaps her sharply across the face. \nADDISON (quietly) Remember as long as you live, never to laugh at me. At anything or anyone else - but never at me. \nEve eyes him coldly, goes to the door, throws it open. \nEVE Get out! \nAddison walks to the door, closes it. \nADDISON You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske. \nEVE Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out. \nShe goes to the phone. \nADDISON Don't pick it up! Don't even put your hand on it... \nShe doesn't. Her back is to him. Addison smiles. \nADDISON Something told you to do as I say, didn't it? That instinct is worth millions, you can't buy it, cherish it, Eve. When that alarm goes off, go to your battle stations... \nHe comes up behind her. Eve is tense and wary. \nADDISON Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski. \nEVE What of it? \nADDISON It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years... \nEVE (curtly) What of it? \nEVE My director - who demanded always a little more than my talent could provide- \nBILL, seated at the speakers' table. He has his award before him - a smaller one. He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly as the applause breaks out. \nEVE - but who taught me patiently and well... Bill Sampson. \nLLOYD sits beside Bill. He, too, has a smaller award. As Eve speaks, he throws her a brief glance. \nEVE'S VOICE And one, without whose great play and faith in me, this night would never have been. How can I repay Lloyd Richards? \nEVE waits for the applause to die. \nEVE Hoe can I repay the many others? So many, that I couldn't possibly name them all... \nADDISON smiles approvingly. \nEVE'S VOICE ... whose help, guidance and advice have made this, the happiest night of my life, possible. \nEVE stares at the award for an instant, as if fighting for self-control. \nEVE Although I am going to Hollywood next week to make a film - do not think for a moment that I am leaving you. How could I? For my heart is here in the Theater - and three thousand miles are too far to be away from one's heart. I'll be back to claim it - and soon. That is, if you want me back. \nAnother storm of applause. Much ad lib shouting as Bill and Lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures. People are thronging out. The Aged Actor shouts above the hubbub... \nAGED ACTOR A good night to all - and to all a good night! \nEve disengages herself from the photographers, makes her way toward Addison's table... Bill and Lloyd follow. CAMERA FOLLOWS Lloyd to Karen. They kiss. He gives her the award. \nLLOYD For services rendered - beyond the whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling. \nMax bustles into the SHOT. \nMAX Come on! I'm the host, I gotta get home before the guests start stealing the liquor... \nShe and Lloyd follow Max. Addison and Eve are on their way. Lloyd goes right by. Karen pauses at Eve. \nKAREN Congratulations, Eve. \nEVE Thank you, Karen. \nKaren goes. Eve is being constantly congratulated. Some ad lib about seeing her at Max's party... \nMAX (to Addison) I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late. \nADDISON As soon as the peasants stop pawing her. \nMax hurries out. Margo and Bill step into the SHOT. Eve turns from a well-wisher to face her. \nMARGO ... nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award where your heart ought to be. \nEve looks at her wordlessly. Margo and Bill leave. Addison and Eve are alone. The tables about them are empty. Suddenly, her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she glances at the table. \nEVE I don't suppose there's a drink left... \nADDISON You can have one at Max's. \nEVE (sits) I don't think I'm going. \nADDISON (sighs) Why not? \nEVE Because I don't want to. \nADDISON (patiently) Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you. \nEVE No, it's not. (she holds up the award) It's for this. \nADDISON It's the same thing, isn't it? \nEVE Exactly. (she gives him the award) Here. Take it to the party instead of me. \nADDISON You're being childish. \nA well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an \"Eve, darling, I'm so happy!\" Eve rises, thanks her graciously. Then she pulls her wrap over her shoulder. \nEVE I'm tired. I want to go home. \nADDISON (curtly) Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it... \nThey exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables, waiters, and the usual banquet debris. \nEXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT \nEve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment hotel. She doesn't say good night to Addison, she enters the hotel as the cab drives off. She hasn't the award with her. \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSmart, but not gaudy. Eve crosses from the elevator to her apartment. She lets herself in. \nINT. EVE'S HOTEL APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA small foyer, from which one door leads to the leaving room, another to the bedroom. The bedroom and living room do not connect except through the foyer. \nAll the lights are out. Eve turns them on in the foyer, the same as she enters the bedroom. There are some new trunks, in various stages of being packed. Eve tosses her wrap on the bed, goes through the foyer to the living room. \nShe turns on the light in the living room. CAMERA FOLLOWS her to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink. As she turns from the bar, she stares - starts in fright - and drops the drink. \n", "test1_input": "EVE Hollywood. \nKAREN Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy? \nEve melts into warmth. She beams, sits on the bed. Karen has spun around on the dressing table stool. \nEVE There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me- \nKAREN (smiles) Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality... (she gets up, gets her coat) ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket... (throws it over her shoulder) ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo... \nShe starts out. \nEVE (hesitantly) Mrs. Richards. \nKAREN (pauses, smiles) Karen. \nEVE Karen... (she picks at the coverlet) ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done. \nKAREN (crosses to her) Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it? \nEVE Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her... \nShe looks down at the coverlet once more. \nKAREN ... you want to be Margo's new understudy. \nEVE I don't let myself think about it, even- (she looks up, rises as she speaks) - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl- (suddenly afraid, she sits) - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly... \nKAREN (laughs) Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays. \nEVE (nods proudly) The show must go on. \nKAREN No, dear. Margo must go on. (she sits beside Eve) As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy... \nEVE Do you think Miss Channing would approve? \nKAREN I think she would cheer. \nEVE But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson- \nKAREN They'll do as they're told. \nEve smiles a little. A pause. \nEVE Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it? \nKAREN Of course. \nEVE You won't forget it? \nKAREN I won't forget. \nEVE I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I? \nShe hugs Karen, leaves. She nearly collides with Birdie on her way in. \nBIRDIE The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables? \nKAREN (pointing) But she just got here... \nBIRDIE She's on her way. With half the men in the joint. (she hold up the coat) It's only a fur coat... \nKAREN What did you expect - live sables? \nBIRDIE A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people... \nThey start out. \nKAREN Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here- \nBIRDIE They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square... \nThrough the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out of sight. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS - NIGHT \nKaren and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison, a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protegee-of the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve. They are all seated on the steps. \nBirdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor. Karen remains with the others. \nAddison is holding forth: \nADDISON Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings. \nMISS CASWELL (as Birdie and the sables pass) Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for. \nBILL'S VOICE And probably has. \nMISS CASWELL Sable. \nMAX (to Miss Caswell) Did you say sable - or Gable? \nMISS CASWELL Either one. \nADDISON It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children- \n", "test1_true": "BILL (nods) He must be miserable, the life he lives out there- \nADDISON These so-called abnormalities - they're our stock in trade, they make us actors, writers, directors, et cetera in the first place- \nMAX Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer? \nADDISON What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair? \nMAX This answer satisfies me a hundred percent. \nADDISON We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities... \nBILL (laughs; to Eve) You don't have to read his column tomorrow - you just heard it. I don't agree, Addison... \nADDISON That happens to be your particular abnormality. \nBILL Oh, I admit there's a screwball element in the Theater. It sticks out, it's got spotlights on it and a brass band. But it isn't basic, it isn't standard - if it were, the Theater couldn't survive... \nMISS CASWELL (to a passing butler) Oh, waiter... \nThe butler goes right by. \nADDISON That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler. \nMISS CASWELL Well, I can't yell \"Oh, butler,\" can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler... \nADDISON You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point. \nMISS CASWELL I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink. \nMAX (getting up) Leave me get you one... \nMISS CASWELL (pitching) Oh, thank you, Mr. Fabian. \nMax leaves with her empty glass. \nADDISON Well done. I see your career rising in the East like the sun... (to Bill) ... you were saying? \nBILL I was saying that the Theater is nine-tenths hard work. Work done the hard way - by sweat, application and craftsmanship. I'll agree to this - that to be a good actor, actress, or anything else in the Theater, means wanting to be that more than anything else in the world... \nEVE (abruptly) Yes. Yes, it does. \nBILL (goes on) It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little... \nEve speaks almost unaware of what she says. She looks at no one in particular, just off... \nEVE So little. So little, did you say? Why, if there's nothing else - there's applause. It's like - like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up. Imagine... To know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you... they smile, their eyes shine - you've pleased them, they want you, you belong. Just that alone is worth anything... \nShe becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks of warm interest. She's embarrassed, she turns away - then scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the direction of the pantry. \nMargo's had too much to drink. Her fake smile fades as Eve gets up. She's unpleasant and depressed. \nMARGO Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother. \nEVE (hurt) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- \nBILL (sharply) Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly! \nMARGO You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- (to Eve) - aren't we, honey? \nKAREN Margo, really... \nMARGO Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter... (to Addison) I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say \"ain't I\"? \nADDISON You're maudlin and full of self pity. You're magnificent. \nMax has come up with Miss Caswell's drink. \nLLOYD How about calling it a night? \nMARGO And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep... \nBILL It's a good thought. \nMARGO It won't play. \nKAREN As a nonprofessional, I think it's an excellent idea. Undramatic, but practical... \nAs she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side. \nMARGO Happy little housewife... \nBILL Cut it out. \nMARGO This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-! \nKAREN Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast! \nADDISON Hear, hear... \nLLOYD Now let's not get into a big hassle- \nKAREN It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off. \nMARGO (suddenly) All right! I'm going to bed. (to Bill) You be the host. It's your party. Happy Birthday, welcome home, and we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you. \n", "test1_id": 930, "test2_input": "ADDISON Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them... \nMARGO (flatly) I take it she read well. \nADDISON It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire... \nMARGO How nice. \nADDISON In time she'll be what you are. \nMARGO A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice? \nADDISON Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning... \nMARGO How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody. \nAddison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing. He senses the approaching typhoon, he whips it up... \nADDISON Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them. \nMARGO The implication being that I have not been reading them as written. \nADDISON To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation. \nMiss Caswell appears, uncertain, in the b.g. \nADDISON Feeling better, my dear? \nMISS CASWELL Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what? \nADDISON You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television. \nMargo, abruptly, starts for the auditorium. Addison smiles. He takes Miss Caswell's arm. \nMISS CASWELL Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television? \nADDISON That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions. \nHe takes her toward the street. \nINT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY \nThe curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a deteriorating Southern mansion. \nThere is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the aisle about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the stage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditorium. There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot make out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace. \nShe passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignores him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears through the door which leads backstage. \nMax whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and puts his hands to his head in despair. \nMargo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd turn to her. Eve rises. \nMARGO (cheerily) Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve... \nEVE Hello, Miss Channing. \nMARGO How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office? (over the footlights to Max) I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too... \nMax slumps in his seat. By the time Margo turns back to them, the others have exchanged swift looks. \nBILL It's all over. \nMARGO What's all over? \nBILL The audition. \nMARGO (pleased astonishment) Eve? (she turns to her) How enchanting... (to Lloyd and Bill) Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell? \nLLOYD She's your understudy. \nMARGO Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea... \nLLOYD I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago- \nMARGO It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all- (out to Max again) - Max you sly puss. \nMax submerges further in his seat. \nEVE Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late. \nMARGO Really, Eve? Why? \nEVE Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all... \nMARGO Why not? \nEVE ... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on- \nMARGO (murmurs) What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off... \nBILL What fire and music? \nMARGO You wouldn't understand. (to Lloyd) How was Miss Caswell? \nLLOYD Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve- \n", "test2_true": "MARGO I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do. (to Lloyd) You were about to tell me about Eve... \nLLOYD You'd have been proud of her. \nMARGO I'm sure. \nLLOYD She was a revelation... \nMARGO To you, too? \nLLOYD What do you mean? \nMARGO (the ice begins to form) I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress... \nLLOYD That's beside the point. \nMARGO It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them! \nBILL Addison-! \nMARGO So full of meaning, fire and music! \nLLOYD You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt- \nMARGO - in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac! \nLLOYD You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse... \nMARGO Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat! \nLLOYD You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most! \nMARGO Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel! \nLLOYD I never said it was! \nMARGO Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher? \nMax has edged his way to the stage. \nMAX (from below) May I say a word? \nLLOYD No! (to Margo) What makes you think that either Miller or Sherwood would stand for the nonsense I take from you - you'd better stick to Beaumont and Fletcher! They've been dead for three hundred years! \nHe stalks into the wings. Bill's reaction to the fight is typical. He lights a cigarette, stretches out on the covered bed. Eve stands frozen with fear. Margo yells after Lloyd into the wings. \nMARGO And they're getting better performances today than they ever got! All playwrights should be dead for three hundred years! \nLloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium. The battle goes on without a pause. As he yells back, he crosses to Max at row A, center. \nLLOYD That would solve none of their problems - because actresses never die! The stars never die and never change! \nHe starts up the aisle with Max. \nMARGO You can change this star any time you want! For a new, fresh, exciting one fully equipped with fire and music! Any time you want - starting with tonight's performance! \nNow it's Max who stops and shouts back at her. \nMAX This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib! \nMARGO (from the stage) Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian? \nMAX Are you breaking the contract? \nMARGO Answer my question! \nMAX Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man. \nMARGO I didn't hear you. \nMAX (yelling) I said I'm a dying man! \nMARGO Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill! \nLLOYD (from the top of the aisle) I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing? \nMARGO Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater! \nLLOYD It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto! \nMax has already walked out unhappily. Lloyd now slams out. Margo glares after him, then turns to Bill who smokes his cigarette peacefully on the bed. \nMARGO (quiet menace) And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano? (Bill waves his cigarette; he's noncommittal) Where is Princess Fire-and-Music? \nBILL Who? \nMARGO The kid. Junior. \nBILL (looks lazily) Gone. \nMARGO I must have frightened her away. \nBILL I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me. \nMARGO (paces up and down) Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent... \n", "test2_id": 931, "test3_input": "BILL (lightly) The names I've been called. But never Svengali. (he pats her shoulder) Good luck. \nHe starts out. Addison ducks. \nEVE Don't run away, Bill. \nBILL (stops) From what would I be running? \nEVE You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off? \nBILL (curiously) I'm for it. \nEVE Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room. \nBILL (smiles) When I told you what every young actress should know. \nEVE When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you- \nBILL Your make-up's a little heavy. \nEVE - and for you. \nBILL (slowly) You're quite a girl. \nEVE You think? \nBILL I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard? \nEVE You hear all kinds of things. \nBILL I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man... \nEVE Find out. \nBILL (deliberately) Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me. \nTears come to Eve's eyes. She turns away slowly. \nBILL Don't cry. Just score it as an incomplete forward pass. \nHe walks out. Addison ducks to avoid being seen. Eve glares after Bill, tears the wig from her head, throws it on the dressing table. Her glance is caught by a pair of scissors. Swiftly, she snatches them up and in a sharp, vicious gesture she slashes the wig. Addison knocks politely at the door. Eve turns. \nADDISON May I come in? \nEVE Certainly, Mr. deWitt... \nADDISON (entering) I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet... \nEVE I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things. \nShe starts creaming her face, removing make-up. \nADDISON Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled. \nEVE You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original... \nADDISON You're more than modest. \nEVE It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself. \nADDISON A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion... \nEVE Please do. \nADDISON I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly... \nEVE I don't think I've done anything to sound off about. \nADDISON We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will? \nEVE Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow. \nADDISON It needn't be. \nEVE Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody. \nADDISON I am somebody. \nEve rises. She eyes him steadily. \nEVE You certainly are. \nShe goes into the bathroom. \nADDISON Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk. \nEve does so. \nADDISON After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper. \nEVE (from the bathroom) I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy? \nADDISON (smiling) Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you- \nEVE I'm not enough for a paragraph. \n", "test3_true": "EVE That's right. \nADDISON San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco? \nEVE Yes. I do. \nADDISON And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert? \nEVE (a slight pause) Yes. The Shubert. \nADDISON (grins happily) A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name? \nEVE Eddie... \nADDISON Eddie what? \nEve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door. \nEVE I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you... \nADDISON I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night... \nEVE (trustingly) You take charge. \nADDISON I believe I will. \nShe closes the door. He leans back, lights a cigarette. \nEXT. 52ND STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT \nA cab drives up to \"21.\" \nKAREN'S VOICE Some of the morning papers carried a little squib about Eve's performance. Not much, but full praise... I couldn't imagine how they found out about it - but Lloyd said Max's publicity man probably sent out the story... \nKaren gets out of the cab, pays and goes in. \nKAREN'S VOICE ... at any rate, I feel terribly guilty and ashamed of myself - and wanted nothing so much as to forget the whole thing. Margo and I were having lunch at \"21\" - just like girlfriends - with hats on... \nINT. LOBBY - \"21\" - DAY \nKaren consults her watch and the doorman as she enters. \nKAREN Has Miss Channing come in? \nDOORMAN Not yet, Mrs. Richards... \nKaren sees Eve who waits as Addison hands his hat, coat, and cane to an attendant. She smiles, crosses to her. \nKAREN Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance- \nEVE Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all... \nADDISON She was magnificent. \nKAREN (pleased) Then you've heard too. \nADDISON I was there. An eyewitness. \nKAREN (staggered) You were there? At the play - last night? \nADDISON (smiles) A happy coincidence. \nEVE (quickly) We're having lunch with a movie talent scout. \nKAREN They certainly don't waste much time. \nEVE Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch. \nADDISON They'll be wasting this much of their time at any rate. Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood. \nHe turns to Karen, changing the subject. \nADDISON From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady? \nKAREN (smiles) Margo. \nADDISON Margo? Lunching in public? \nKAREN It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one. \nADDISON She may be later than you think... \nAs he speaks, he crosses to pick up an evening paper, opens it as he comes back. \nADDISON (handing it to her) Why not read my column to pass the time? The minutes will fly like hours... (he takes Eve's arm) ... and now we must join our sunburned eager beaver. \nHe goes up the stairs with Eve. Karen glances after them curiously, then at the column. It is headed: \"Things I Promised Not To Tell\" by Addison deWitt. He expression becomes increasingly horrified. She drops the paper and rushes out... \nINT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAddison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides about reading it. Karen sits miserably. \nMARGO (declaiming) \"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops.\" ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott... (she skips part of the column) Down here... here, listen to this- \"... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-\" \nKAREN I just can't believe it. \n", "test3_id": 932}

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. 
Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind. 
CUT TO: 
THE SECRET KNOT 
that reveals the staircase. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. 
Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen. Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and -- 
Nothing. He has failed. 
In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each other, then start down. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head. 
FEZZIK He's dead. 
Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags. 
INIGO (barely able to speak) It just is not fair. 
THE KID (off-screen) -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait -- 
CUT TO: 
THE KID'S ROOM 
He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him. 
THE KID -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean, "He's dead?" I mean he didn't mean dead. 
The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there. 
THE KID Westley's only faking, right? 
GRANDFATHER You want me to read this or not? 
CUT TO: 
THE KID: CLOSE UP 
THE KID Who gets Humperdinck? 
GRANDFATHER I don't understand. 
THE KID Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who? 
GRANDFATHER Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. 
THE KID You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for? 
And he desperately fights for control. 
GRANDFATHER You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously. I think we better stop now. 
He closes the book and starts to get up. 
THE KID (shaking his head) No! I'm okay. I'm okay. (gestures toward the chair) -- sit down. All right? 
GRANDFATHER Okay. (sitting and opening the book again) All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO, IN DESPAIR 
We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a moment, he just sags. 
INIGO Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body. 
FEZZIK The body? 
INIGO (not stopping) Have you any money? 
FEZZIK I have a little. 
INIGO I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. 
As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs -- 
CUT TO: 
A HOVEL - DUSK 
Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

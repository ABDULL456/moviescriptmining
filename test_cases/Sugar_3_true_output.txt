JORGE See?   Just like home. 
Jorge runs back to his position at third.   Miguel tucks his index finger into his knuckle curve grip.   Delivers... 
UMPIRE Strike!

JORGE That's it!   There it is! 
And the next pitch... 
...is hit sharply to Jorge at third, who fires it over to second for one, and on to first for a double play. 
The crowd goes WILD and Miguel finally exhales. 
One, two, three... he mows down the next BATTER on three consecutive strikes. More APPLAUSE. 
110   IN THE DUGOUT                                                    110 
Orlando hands him his first strikeout ball. Miguel takes a seat, wipes the sweat from his head, then looks down at Anne's address scribbled on his forearm. 
111   SCOREBOARD - LATER THAT NIGHT                                    111

113   INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH                                     113 
JACK JEFFERIES Nearly unhittable for the first 6 innings, that was only the second hit allowed by Santos tonight. 
114   BACK ON THE FIELD.                                               114 
The next BATTER dribbles a spinning groundball at Jorge, but it squirts through his legs into left field, allowing the runner to score an unearned run from second. 
Stu walks toward the mound, signals for the bullpen.   He and Orlando greet Miguel on the mound. 
STU Good game, kid.   Enjoy this... 
ORLANDO (in Spanish) Nice work, Sugar. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    56. 
MIGUEL (in Spanish, to Orlando) But that wasn't my fault. I can go longer. 
ORLANDO (in Spanish) Take it easy; it's your first game. 
Though he doesn't speak Spanish, Stu knows exactly what's happening. He takes the ball from Miguel with a smile, but Miguel doesn't move, still reluctant to leave the mound. 
As the FANS begin to cheer his stellar debut... 
STU You hear that? It's for you, kid. 
Orlando smiles, pats Miguel on the butt, and Miguel finally starts his slow walk off the field. As we follow him off, the FANS rise to their feet and Miguel approaches the dugout to a standing ovation. On his way in, he's greeted by his teammates with congratulatory high-fives. 
AT THIRD Jorge stares at the dirt, frustrated by his misplay.

117   EXT. ANNE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        117 
Miguel rings the doorbell, waits.   He's holding a baseball. Anne opens the door. 
ANNE Hey Miguel.    C'mon inside. 
He hands her the ball like it's a rose. 
MIGUEL (in rehearsed English) My first... strike-out. 
ANNE Oh, Miguel... you're so sweet. Congratulations, I heard you pitched awesome.

118   INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER                                118 
Some kind of casual teenage party is in effect. Pizza boxes are spread around the living room and everyone (12-15 WHITE KIDS) are drinking soda from plastic cups. No booze. 
ANNE Hey everybody, this is Miguel. He's from the Dominican Republic, and now he pitches for the Swing. 
Everyone manages to say "Hi Miguel" at the same time.

RANDY What's up, man? 
TRAVIS Wanna play?

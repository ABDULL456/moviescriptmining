ED He's just ... trying a little too hard -- 
CYNTHIA Ed, the audience can smell the desperation coming through the screen. 
TERRY Could you... see him a little less often? 
ED How much less? 
FELICIA Never would be plenty. 
ED I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him. 
SILENCE 
ED (CONT'D) He'11 be fine. 
59    INT. CAR - DAY "DAY FIVE" 
Ed is driving slowly on a busy street. Suddenly an EIGHTEEN YEAR-OLD BOY lands heavily on Ed's windshield. Ed is badly startled. He can't see. He swerves and stops. The boy is not hurt. He's banging on the windshield, waving at the camera. Ed, furious, gets out. 
60    EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 
ED What the --?! 
BOY I'm on TV! I'm on TV! 
Ed just stares in disbelief. 
61    EXT. STREET - LATER Ed is walking. PEOPLE YELL at him. 
GUY Ed! Your show stinks! 
The Guy LAUGHS like he really got in a good one. Ed ignores him. 
TWO TEENAGERS run in, one has a camera and quickly snaps a picture of Ed and the other Guy. Merrily, they shake his hand and run off, whooping. 
There are PEOPLE who trail along. Many of them will show up again and again, throughout the movie, following Ed. Some of them will look mentally or emotionally impaired. 
62    INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT QUICK SHOTS of Ed with CUSTOMERS - One or two show a bit of camera-consciousness. A little group has gathered to observe Ed's "show". 
63    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT Ed rings the bell. 
ED (to the camera) This is Ray's apartment. Ray's got a big-screen TV and the Knicks are playing in L.A. tonight, so sometimes I come over after I work late and we watch the game here. He makes funny comments. He's really a good guy. He just... 
RAY (O.C.) Who is it? 
ED It's me, Ed. 
The door opens a crack, revealing Ray in a bathrobe. Ray's look is unwelcoming. 
RAY Hi. 
ED You watching the ballgame? 
RAY Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep. 
ED Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then. 
RAY Yeah... 
WOMAN (O.C.) Ray, where do you keep the glasses? 
ED Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired? 
ED (CONT'D) (calls out) Hi, Shari. 
WOMAN (O.C.) Who's Shari? 
ED Who's -- 
Ray looks pained. Ed realizes what's happening and freezes Ray's phone RINGS. 
RAY Oh shit... 
He turns to answer his phone, allowing the door to swing open a little. Ed can see into the kitchen. He sees a WOMAN, wearing just panties, facing away from him, searching for glasses. 
RAY (into phone) Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God! 
ED (to the camera) We'd better go... 
RAPID CUTS of VIEWERS loving this, some screaming "Don't go!, don't leave, stay" etc. 
BACK TO SCENE 
RAY (into phone) No, honey, it's not what it looks like-- 
She hangs up on him. He holds his head. 
RAY Oh God ... Ed! 
64    INT. HALLWAY Ed is TIP-TOEING away. He stops when Ray calls him. Ray 'runs out into the hallway after him. They speak with lowered voices. 
RAY That was Shari. She saw the whole thing on TV--

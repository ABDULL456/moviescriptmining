They all stare at him in shock. 
MRS DASHWOOD Mrs Robert Ferrars? 
ELINOR has frozen. EDWARD rises and goes to the window. 
EDWARD Yes. I received a letter from Miss Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say-- communicating the... the transfer of her affections to my brother Robert. They were much thrown together in London, I believe, and... and in view of the change in my circumstances, I felt it only fair that Miss Steele be released from our engagement. At any rate, they were married last week and are now in Plymouth. 
ELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking at one another. 
ELINOR Then you--are not married. 
EDWARD No. 
ELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET's hand and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY 
The three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
ELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly. 
EDWARD Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very young. Had I had an active profession, I should never have felt such an idle, foolish inclination. At Norland my behaviour was very wrong. But I convinced myself you felt only friendship for me and it was my heart alone that I was risking. I have come with no expectations. Only to profess, now that I am at liberty to do so, that my heart is and always will be yours. 
ELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released emotion, of pain and of happiness. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN 
MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house. The branches rustle. 
MARGARET He's sitting next to her! 
MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE Margaret, come down!/Is he? 
MRS DASHWOOD (scolding) Margaret! Will you stop-- 
MARIANNE What's happening now? 
MRS DASHWOOD Marianne! 
MARGARET (V.O.) He's kneeling down! 
MRS DASHWOOD can't help herself. 
MRS DASHWOOD Oh! Is he? Oh! 
She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully. 
EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON - DAY 
The figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in deep conversation. 
EXT. PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSK 
Later. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching, their words low and intimate. 
ELINOR Your mother, I suppose, will hardly be less angry with Robert for marrying Lucy. 
EDWARD The more so since she settled the money upon him so irrevocably-- 
ELINOR --no doubt because she had run out of sons to disinherit. 
EDWARD Her family fluctuates at an alarming rate. Then, in London, when you told me of the Colonel's offer, I became convinced that you wanted me to marry Lucy and that--well, that you and Colonel Brandon... 
ELINOR Me and Colonel Brandon! 
EDWARD I shall not forget attempting to thank him for making it possible for me to marry the woman I did not love while convinced he had designs upon the woman I did--do--love. 
EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can stand it no longer. 
EDWARD Would you--can you--excuse me-- 
He takes her face in his hands and kisses her. 
EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY 
A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best. 
EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY 
A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS, SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN, MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in regimental uniform. 
The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft. 
The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour. 
CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her seem much older. 
According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN jump and dive for them. 
The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into the surrounding countryside.

The plane touches down. 47   INT. NATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY                                 47 Through the airport move our Floridians. They look like they're going to opening day at the track. VOICE (O.S.) Congressman Johnson! Congressman Johnson! Tommy looks. It's REINHHARDT, a young straight-arrow bearing two huge document briefcases, which he puts down to shake hands. (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              33. 47   CONTINUED:                                                   47 REINHARDT Arthur Reinhardt. You remember me -- I Fed-Exed that material to you in Key West? TOMMY Reinhardt, my man! Of course! You look just like I pictured you. Nice wing tips. REINHARDT Thank you. Congressman, I hope you don't think I'm out of line for meeting you here -- I thought you might want some help with logistics, settling in at your hotel -- (indicating the briefcases) Since you didn't make it to the Harvard seminar, I put together a set of their papers for you. TOMMY I like your initiative, Reinhardt, but to tell you the truth, I've never been much of a student. Maybe you can brief my staff sometime. Reinhardt looks Tommy's cronies over.     Not your classic Hill types. TOMMY But thank you, I will take you up on those logistics. Hey! Entourage! What hotel we at? 
They look at one another, puzzled. TOMMY Reinhardt, it appears that the staff has neglected to nail down some details. REINHARDT Oh, Jesus, the IMF's in town.    Where are we going to find a room? TOMMY Four rooms. 48   OMITTED                                                      48

REINHARDT I got lucky at the Madison. Thank god there's been a coup in Uruguay. Their delegation just checked out. TOMMY You're a wizard, Reinhardt.    I knew you could handle it. 50   EXT. AIRPORT TAXI RANK - DAY                                 50 
Tommy's entourage and their luggage are being packed into a cab. Tommy turns to Reinhardt. TOMMY So when does the House open for business? Reinhardt hasn't heard it put quite that way before. Reinhardt gets his courage up. REINHARDT Say, Congressman, you got my resume, didn't you? TOMMY (hasn't a clue) I'm sure I did. REINHARDT There's something I wanted to ask you. I know it's a big step, but -- I'd like you to consider me to be your AA. TOMMY That's quite an offer, Reinhardt, very decent of you, but I'm just a social drinker. REINHARDT No. AA. Your Administrative Assistant. I worked for Congressman Johnson. I'd like to work for you, Congressman Johnson. TOMMY Really. Tommy looks at his own troops, then back to Reinhardt. (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            35. 50   CONTINUED:                                                 50 TOMMY You mean like an affirmative action thing? Tommy opens the cab door. TOMMY Tell you what -- I'll think about it, okay? Tommy gets in and closes the door. TOMMY (through the open window) Thanks for getting us settled, really appreciate it. (to driver) Madison Hotel. 51   OMITTED                                                    51 52   EXT.

Their taxi drives by. 53   OMITTED                                                    53 55   EXT. CANNON BUILDING - DAY                                 55 Morning. Tommy and cronies get out of a cab and bound up the grand flight of stairs. In b.g., the Capitol dome. 
56   INT. CANNON GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR - DAY           56 They walk the superb ground floor corridor of Cannon, salivating. Marble columns... chandeliers... grand offices. Real class. AT AN ELEVATOR with a sign above it -- MEMBERS ONLY -- they stop. Tommy presses the button. The door opens. The seated ATTENDANT gets a load of this group. Especially Loretta. ATTENDANT Sorry, folks, this elevator's for Members only. (CONTINUED)

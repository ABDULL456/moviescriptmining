EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT 
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front of an apartment building. The couple passes by without noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.

EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT 
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives, HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a long moment. 
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT You feel it? 
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD Yeah. 
They continue to stare. 
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner. 
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT Two men... two guns in the Caddy. 
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy. 
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring. 
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT Yeah, they showed me 
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD Could be unrelated. 
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings? 
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD No. Could be someone's missin' maybe. 
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT That's what I'm thinkin'. 
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy. He looks out and wonders.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN 
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red- headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come back out with more luggage. 
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly into the courtyard and through the open apartment door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN 
The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red- headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the kitchen floor, and passes out.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING 
Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table smiles, then walks off. 
HERB Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry? 
DAN I just wanted to come here. 
HERB To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?

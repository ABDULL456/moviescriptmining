CONTINUED: JAKE No.   Just confidence. The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake. KING PIN I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once. JAKE We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the neck. KING PIN I know it won't happen because you're going to feel like a Prom Queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team! A few pained CHOKES from Jake as his knees buckle. HARLIN Mr. Vig arrived with an escort.   NYPD. The King loosens his grip and let's Jake fall. KING PIN Grifters... Always working  an angle. Alright. I can see you got   some vision. But I give you the Mark. I   tell you the who and you give me the  how. Lupus go with him. Lupus snaps to attention. LUPUS What? KING PIN Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me. Jake begins to speak, but is silenced with a look. KING PIN He goes.   Now let me see your hands.

CONTINUED: The King picks up the nail file again. JAKE Why? KING PIN You ask a lot of questions.   Come on. (motioning with nail file) Let me see `em. Jake turns to find Lupus and Harlin on either side of him. They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up for the King. KING PIN (cont' d) I don't like to ask things more than once, Junior. I want you to know how much that irks me. The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers with the nail file. Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his fingers. Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress. KING PIN You have incredibly soft hands. Good cuticles . They' re like a baby's hands. Grifters with rough hands... You know that they're probably not that good. Means they've had to do some hard labor to make ends meet. But you... Smooth... Supple. The King continues to stroke Jake's hands with his own meaty paws. BUTCH (V.O.) Are you insinuating that the King Pin is of an alternative lifestyle? CUT TO: EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT) Jake shakes his head slowly. JAKE I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.

GRAHAM I'm not embarrassed. Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie. 
JEAN Like I said. This country is driving me mad. 
(BEAT) Shall we go? 
107 EXT/INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY107 
Evelyn is outside in the courtyard. We don't see Douglas. 
EVELYN Anything? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) Not yet. Evelyn waits a moment. 
EVELYN How about now? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) One second. Another pause. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) Oh good lord. 
EVELYN What? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) Listen. The sound of a flowing tap. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) And now ... The tap stops. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) No drip. He appears in the doorway, triumphant. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) No drip! He walks towards her, hand in the air. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) Hi-five ! Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in her life. After a moment Douglas puts his hand down. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) I've never done that before. It just seemed appropriate. Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard. Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) Darling! 
EVELYN Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did you have a good day? Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks so happy. 
DOUGLAS Let me tell you about ours. Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to - 
JEAN 
(SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING) We have to get out of here. 
DOUGLAS What did you say? 
JEAN I can't stay in this country a moment longer. 
DOUGLAS Why ...? 
EVELYN Do excuse me. She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into their room. 
DOUGLAS I don't understand 
JEAN 
(INTERRUPTING) Pick a reason. Pick ten. The climate, the squalor, the poverty She goes past him into their room. 
108 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 108 
JEAN . we should never have come. This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy. It's time to go home. Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively. 
DOUGLAS Who's paying for the tickets? 
JEAN (not hearing him) Look at us. A group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year. Humiliating ourselves 
DOUGLAS Not us, we can't pay. And I don't see you asking our friends 
BACK HOME 
JEAN 
(OVERLAPPING) .. We should just face up to the truth. That we're all old, we're all past it. That's the real truth, the raw, unvarnished fact of the matter. All we're good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner ... She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying quietly. Nobody speaks for a while. 
DOUGLAS 
(GENTLY) We just have to make the best of it, darling. I really think that's the best thing to do. 
JEAN Yes, well. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. 
109 INT. MEEHAR CLINIC - MORNING 109 
An impossibly small roadside clinic. Norman is sitting there, the only man in three rows of brightly dressed women. DR RAMA comes out of the consulting area. 
DR RAMA Mr John Smith. No response. The doctor looks at Norman, who has forgotten his own alias. DR RAMA (cont'd) Mr John Smith? Norman jumps up. 
NORMAN That's right! Me!

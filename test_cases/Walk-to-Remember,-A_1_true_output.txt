LANDON (duh) Because that's where the fire is? 
He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.      He's searching the dash -- no cassette player. 
LANDON Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable. 
JAMIE Like me. 
LANDON No.    Not like you. 
She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the wrong side of the road. He grips the dash. 
LANDON What the -- ?! 
JAMIE So you agree you need help? 
LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD 
Headlights looming, a car coming.      Closer and closer. 
BACK TO SCENE 
LANDON Yes! 
She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling. A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING. 
JAMIE Really? 
Landon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the glove compartment knob. 
LANDON Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave school if I screw up the play. 
JAMIE (to herself) 28 and 42. 
Pause.   He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested. 
LANDON What's with the friggin numbers? 
JAMIE 28 is do something illegal.   42 is befriend an enemy. 
LANDON I'm an enemy? 
JAMIE Kinda.    Yeah. 
EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER 
Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her. 
JAMIE The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me. 
LANDON Good thing. 
If she's offended, she keeps it to herself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON You got some kind of list? 
JAMIE Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know? 
LANDON Maybe a little of both. 
They both smile. 
JAMIE I'll take a chance. 
LANDON Go for it. 
JAMIE It's like a to-do list, but for my life. 
He smirks. 
JAMIE If you can't imagine the future, you won't have one. 
He lights a cigarette.       She reaches for it. 
LANDON (joking) Having a cigarette. 100. 
She grins and takes a drag.      They share the cigarette. 
LANDON So what else is on this list? 
JAMIE It's private. 
LANDON (cajoling) You want to tell me... 
She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing her dreams with him. 
LANDON (guessing, rudely) Get very wasted. Lose your virginity -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE (correcting) Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery -- 
LANDON (contemptuous) Ambitious. 
JAMIE Being negative's a lot more work than being positive. 
LANDON Like you'd know. 
JAMIE I do know. (pause) Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...

DEBBIE Henry? He looks up again. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Do you still love me? He's still as a stone. 
HENRY Of course I do. She looks at him. 
DEBBIE Because I know you did once. A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now. She's crestfallen. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) What happened, Henry? He just sits. 
THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS Henry gets up, heads to the door. Debbie watches him go... 
EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more GUYS sit in the back of the car. Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking friend is JOE. 
EDDIE Henry Torne. 
HENRY Eddie Vibes. 
EDDIE So how you doin', man? 
HENRY I'm okay. What's going on? 
EDDIE Listen, I got a man down here. 
Eddie glances up and down the street. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Mind if we come in for a second? 
INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform. She touches his forehead. 
DEBBIE He's hot. He starts to retch. 
JOE (holding it in) I'm sorry. 
DEBBIE You better come with me. Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly toward the bathroom. 
EDDIE Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels. 
HENRY Yeah. 
EDDIE So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see... 
HENRY Yeah. Eddie stares at him. Smiles. 
EDDIE So, what do you say? 
HENRY What do I say what? 
EDDIE You feel like playing a little ball? Filling in for Joe? 
HENRY It's November. 
EDDIE Yeah. They keep the field in perfect shape. 
HENRY Oh. Beat. 
EDDIE So what do you say? Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open. She's tending to him, caring for him... Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Henry? 
INT. IMPALA - LATER 
Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform. Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They grimly stare out the windows. 
EDDIE Appreciate you driving, man. 
HENRY So where's this game? 
EDDIE Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes. 
CUT TO : 
EXT. MAIN ST - DAY 
The car turns a corner on to Main Street. 
EDDIE Pull up right over here. We gotta grab some beer money at that ATM. The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST 
BUFFALO BANK. Eddie pats Henry's shoulder. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Just hang tight. We'll be right back. Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.

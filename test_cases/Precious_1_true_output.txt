Precious rides lost in thought. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) I still don't know why I said all them thangs. I know I wasn't s'posed to. Just tired.

62   EXT STREET - DAY                                          62 
The girls burst into frame followed by Ms. Rain and Cornrows and then bound up a large number of steps leading into THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART. 
63   INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM PERMANENT EGYPTIAN ART COLLECTION 63 
Led by a spirited guide and trailed by Ms. Rain and Cornrows, the girls scrutinize colossal tombs, various artifacts, hieroglyphics and photographs. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Miz Rain brang us out to see some real old stuff. Thangs and stuff before TV's was made, before Mr. Abraham Lincoln, before Miz Harriet Tubman -maybe some stuff before Miz Weiss even. 
Precious and Rita fearfully enter the Tomb of Perneb. 2 steps in, Rita grabs Precious hand tightly. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Before we turn tha corner in a mummy tomb, Rita grab hold of my hand. No one in my life ever do that. Ever. (beat) How Rita do it wiffout a thought? 
Rita and Jermaine study a sphinx. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Guide lady smart. Say dis the first civilization of the Earf. Black folks, first! 
Jo Ann poses like an Egyptian hieroglyphic. Consuelo examines her nail polish. 
64   INT. CLASSROOM -DAY                                       64 
Ms. Rain writes briskly across the blackboard. 
As she makes her way across the frame, a barrage of letters and numbers peel off the board, fly across the room, converge and enter Precious' forehead. 
(CONTINUED) 
64   CONTINUED:                                                64 Just before the letters and numbers reach Precious, lifelike holographic images flank them. They are SPINNING PLANETS, FLYING PTERODACTYLS, STAMPEDING ELEPHANTS, EMMETT TILL, MLK, JFK, MALCOLM X, CIVIL RIGHTS MARCHERS, FIRE, TIDAL WAVES, A VOLCANIC ERUPTION, CONTINENTS, MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS, LIGHT BULBS AND THE INVERTED WORDS "JANIE", "SULA" AND "CELIE" ... 
A few letters, numbers and images try to reach Jo Ann but most just bounce off of her and fall away. Consuelo bats a few mathematical symbols off as if they were flies. 
Finally we land on Precious as she confidently stabs her hand into the air to answer a question. 
65   INT. CITY BUS - DAY                                          65 
Precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back while wearing her red scarf. 
The New Yorkers surrounding her are all men of various backgrounds. All wear the exact same suits and raincoats. 
Precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down at her. 
We pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other passengers studying Precious in silence as well. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) I liked'd that museum so much I went back by myself... Peoples ...They only look when my belly big. They minds all made. But do they know? No. They do not know that I am a girl for flowers and thin straw legs? 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) If other peoples could see that the way I do, they would see that I am a real person inside. 
Our long circular pan finally lands on Precious' seat but sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from Precious' bedroom mirror wearing Precious' clothes. 
The bus grinds to a stop. 
A man smiles at Precious and steps off the bus. 
The original Precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his empty seat and tries to read it. 
(CONTINUED) 
65   CONTINUED:                                                   65 Precious stops to watch two "society" ladies in hats and gloves push antique buggy style baby carriages along the sidewalk. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Miz Rain say the longest journey begin wif a single step. I wonder what step they journeys begin on. Mama always talk about how there be all different types of welfare. I want filfy rich white folks welfare. Mama crazy but Mama not stupid. 
Precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street in tattered clothes. 
As Precious studies him, her expression changes ever so slightly. 
Enormous handwritten letters forming "NOT STUPID" overtake her face as we DISSOLVE TO the PAGE upon which she wrote it. 
66   INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                           66 
Precious writes in her notebook. All of the other girls do the same. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) I am happy to be writing. I am happy to be in school. I am happy to know my baby coming soon. Don't see the sense in pretending I am not pregnant anymore. I am also thinking about lil Mongo a lot. Miz Rain say we gonna write everyday, that mean home too. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) And she gonna write back everyday. Thas great. 
Precious looks up to find Jo Ann tapping her pencil, looking around annoyed and literally at a loss for words. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Mama say this new school ain' shit tho. Say you can't learn nuffin' writing in no book. Gotta git on that computer you want to make some money. But Mama wrong about that.

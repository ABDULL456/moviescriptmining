{"train": "FACE/OFF \nWritten by \nMike Werb & Michael Colleary \nRevised 9/10/96 \nFADE INTO: \nSEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE \nof a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an elephant.  Noah's Ark going round... and round... and round... \nEXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY \nDisjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal: \nJON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.  On the adjacent unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).  Clutching a balloon, Matty waves at his dad.  A happy moment, like so many certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching them THROUGH... \nSNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES \nwait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the target.  They round the bend and disappear... \nMATTHEW \nLoses his grip on the unicorn.  Archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap.  They happily ride together... \nAs the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer... \nNow we see the sniper.  CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient, aggressive, sexual.  His finger closes around the trigger. \nBOOM!  A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.  Bleeding... he drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the carousel.  His eyes desperately searching... searching... searching... until he sees -- \nMatthew lies on his back -- still.  Slowly, Archer reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see COLOR for the first time... \nBlood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son... \nTILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating away. \nHANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS: \nFBI BRIEFING ROOM \nGazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession. \nCAROUSEL HORSE \nsweeps by, as if marking time itself... \nHOLY PLACE \nSmoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden cross.  A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.  The glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.  This is no chapel... but an atrium.  Somewhere. \nAnd as the \"priest\" rubs out his cigarette we see it's Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device. \nANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE \nsweeps by... \nARCHER \npockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun... \nCASTOR \nsets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in front of it.  Totally hidden. \nBRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT \nis on a computer screen.  His criminal dossier scrolls by endlessly:  bombings, assassinations, mercenary kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire... \nRookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully.  Other agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid- maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and coffee cups.  These people are on high alert. \nARCHER Any follow-up from L.A.P.D. Intelligence? \nBUZZ No, sir, nothing yet. \nARCHER Get them on the phone -- now. What about S.I.S. and our airport teams? \nWANDA We've had everything from psychics to satellites on this.  Even if Castor was here... he must have slipped the net by now... \nARCHER He's here!  And we're going to keep looking until we find him! \nA silence descends on the chastised team.  As they go back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer aside. \nTITO Jon, these people have been working round the clock -- you gotta cut them some slack... \nArcher considers his best friend's advice -- then... \nPOLLUX I hate when you call me bro. \nPollux heads for the jet.  Castor hands Lunt a wad of cash. \nCASTOR Thanks for babysitting. \nLUNT Anything else? \nCASTOR I'll contact you when we get the rest of the money. (turns to leave) Oh, and stat away from downtown. The inversion layer's going to be pretty thick around the 18th. \nThe twins nod... then take off.  Castor heads for the jet. \nINT. JET - DAY \nCastor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT. \nCASTOR Let's go, let's go! \nAs the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his seat.  A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him a Scotch.  He downs it, looking her over salaciously. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Would you like anything else? \nCASTOR Hell, yes... (pulls her into lap) It's the only way to fly. \nShe smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway. \nCOCKPIT \nCastor yanks open the door. \nCASTOR What's wrong? \nAT END OF RUNWAY \nA squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway. \nEXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY \nBehind the wheel is Jon Archer.  Beside him is Tito. \nBACK TO ARCHER \nCASTOR It's Archer. (gun to Pilot's head) Go, dammit! \nSuddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand.  he turns around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them -- holding a smoking pistol.  This is Agent WINTERS. \nWINTERS F.B.I.!  Throttle down, captain! \nBut Castor elbows the throttle up.  The jet lurches forward, throwing Winters off balance.  Pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed. \nINT. HUMVEE - DAY \nArcher slams the vehicle into gear. \nARCHER Get out. \nTITO You're not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum... \nARCHER Get out! \nTito obeys as Archer peels out.  The HUMMER ROARS at the jet. \nThe jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft. \nThe humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow. \nCOLLISION COURSE \nas two hunks of metal bear down.  The machines are seconds apart when -- \nArcher looks up to see... \nWinters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, Castor holding a gun to her head. \nArcher cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet.  The Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but too late.  Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a swirl of dust. \nAs the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens.  Castor blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac. \nINSIDE \nCastor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until... \nKA-CHUNK:  Something POUNDS the jet -- from above. Castor leans out the hatch and sees... \nThe chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls. \nEye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men. \nCastor BLASTS at him from the open hatch. \nCastor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers. The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in. \nArcher reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering the challenge.  As the deadly beat between them continues -- \nBLAM BLAM BLAM!  Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead. \nINTERCUT as necessary: \nCASTOR Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun. \nARCHER And how much will your 'fun' net you this time? \nBOOM BOOM BOOM!  Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning. A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP!  He fits a new CLIP into his pistol. \nCASTOR What's it to you?  I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a week -- \nARCHER You're under arrest.  Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent -- \nCASTOR I've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaoh.  I'll give it up -- but my brother and I have to walk. \nARCHER No discussion -- no deals. \nCASTOR What're you gonna do with me locked up?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts!  I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now.  What's her name, Janie? \nEnraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses... \nCastor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away. The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches. \nCastor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP- SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches. \nVRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall. \nThe ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito. \nTITO Tell me he didn't get away again... \nThen Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless body.  Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile survives. \nEXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET \nHeavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda. \nPOLLUX Where's my brother?!  I want to see my brother! \nThe van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards.  Bullying through the media, Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the devastation. \nApproaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded on the ambulance.  A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face. \nLAZARRO The oversight committee would've roasted us for this one -- thank God it paid off.  Damn fine work. \nARCHER Real fine, Victor.  Especially the casualties. \nArcher contemplates the slain agents -- their three bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked. Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies. \nInstinctively, the two men close ranks.  Archer grabs the Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back. \nLAZARRO Classified information.  No photographs. \nLazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and leads him away from the media... and the carnage. \nLAZARRO You okay, Jon? (off Archer's nod) Then go home.  Tell Eve. \nEXT.  ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET \nA renovated Craftsman.  Sipping a carton of milk, Archer pulls into the driveway.  He sits, gathering his thoughts. \nINT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT \nArcher enters and sees his wife EVE.  Handsome, intelligent. \nARCHER Hi... (no response) ... What's wrong? \nShe nods toward the KITCHEN.  JAMIE is there -- a sullen and hard fifteen-year-old.  There are cigarette cartons on the table. \nEVE She complimented for her 'F' in history with an 'A' in shoplifting... \nArcher marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of Marlboros.  Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee. \nARCHER Nice stunt, Jamie.  You break the law and I'm expected to ignore it? \nJAMIE That's right -- it's all about you.  Don't even ask me what happened. \nArcher looks to Eve for help.  Eve shakes her head -- nope. \nARCHER Okay.  What happened? \nJAMIE Like you'd ever fucking believe me! \nShe bolts.  In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her. \nMILLER Powerful enough to flatten ten city blocks. \nARCHER 'Worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs.' (to Tito) Get Pollux Troy.  Now. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERROGATION FOOTAGE \nWired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his frustrated interrogators on the run. \nINT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY \nArcher, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other FBI officials watch the monitor.  Pollux remains implacable \nPOLLUX (V.O.) (on screen) That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me... a mental exercise. I never built it... \nLazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer. \nARCHER He's lying. \nLAZARRO He's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. \nARCHER Pollux is a manipulative psychopath.  He can control his heartbeat, his sweat glands, his blood pressure... \nLAZARRO Jon, I trust your instincts, I always have.  But D.C. wants more evidence.  And frankly, so do I. \nARCHER You'll get all the evidence you need when ten thousand people die. \nLAZARRO We'll get a team right on it.  But we can't evacuate the city on what amounts to a hunch. \nArcher looks at the gathered brass.  He knows it's hopeless. \nARCHER That bomb has been built, it's out there somewhere and it's going to detonate... \nEXT. FBI BUILDING - INTELLIGENCE MEMORIAL - DAY \nWords etched in the granite wall read: \nIN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE OF DUTY \nArcher watches as a workman engraves the last of the three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring the dead. \nBRODIE Didn't Castor give any clue where the bomb might be? \nARCHER Only one person knows -- his brother Pollux.  And he'll keep his mouth shut until it blows. \nBRODIE We could plant an agent in his cell -- get him to spill the location. \nARCHER Pollux is way too paranoid.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is Castor himself.  And dead men can't talk. \nBrodie and Miller exchange a knowing look. \nBRODIE There might be a way around that... \nFULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S BODY \nTubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice. \nINT. ICU ROOM - DAY \nArcher stares at the body... he can't believe it. \nARCHER Why are you keeping him alive? (gets no answer) As long as he's breathing, he's dangerous. \nMILLER Relax, he's a turnip. \nMiller grinds out her cigarette on Castor's leg.  Of course, Castor just lies there like a vegetable. \nBRODIE We can arrange for you to enter Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy. \nARCHER What are you talking about? \nArcher turns as DR. MALCOLM HOAG (50s) enters the room. \nHOAG I think I'd better answer that question. (offers hand) Malcolm Hoag.  I run the Physiological Camouflage Unit for Special Ops. \nARCHER I know who you are. \nMILLER But you don't know what he can do. Physical augmentation; enhancement surgery... \nBRODIE ... He can disguise a compromised agent or alter the likeness -- even the voice -- of a government witness. \nHOAG Let me show you how it's done. (leading him out) I think you'll recognize our patient... \nINT. HOAG'S SURGICAL BAY - DAY \nLoomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away charred flesh around his burned ear.  The doctor turns to a -- \nSTEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE \nARCHER Answer the question. \nSASHA Look, I'm clean.  I teach kids now -- \nARCHER Sasha -- you are a felon, on probation for harboring Castor Troy.  So it's in your best interest to cooperate. (as she's silent) Would you like your son put in a foster home? \nSasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps control. \nSASHA No, but I'm sure you'd love it -- you sick bastard. \nARCHER (unmoved) When was the last time you saw Castor Troy? \nShe stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred. \nSASHA I haven't seen him for years. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nArcher watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into Sasha's arms.  She hugs him protectively.  Adam sees Archer watching them -- and smiles.  Archer doesn't smile back. \nFULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S REAL FACE \nPULL BACK TO: \nINT. I.C.U. - NIGHT \nArcher slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed body.  Although on life support -- his signature smirk remains. \nARCHER What about Lazarro? \nBRODIE No way -- the red tape alone would take a month.  This is a black-bag operation -- completely off the books. \nMILLER If you need him, Tito can help you prepare.  But you know the drill: You can't tell anyone -- not the Director, not your wife... nobody. \nArcher's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods. \nARCHER I'm in. \nEXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT \nArcher slowly gets out of his car.  Trudging toward the front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot. His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nArcher passes Jamie's room.  Loud MUSIC POUNDS from within.  He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads down the hall. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEve is in bed.  Archer comes in quietly and sits beside her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face.  She stirs. \nEVE I was dreaming... \nARCHER Something good? \nEVE I'm not sure... you were flying this weird old stunt plane... doing flips... walking on the wings... I was watching from the ground -- when you fell.  You had a parachute, but you wouldn't open it. \nARCHER Did you catch me? \nEVE No. \nARCHER How come? \nEVE I don't know... (nuzzles him) Maybe because you've never needed my help. \nARCHER Come on, you made that up, didn't you? \nEVE ... Maybe I did... (teasing) ... maybe I didn't... \nThey kiss affectionately.  Passion building, Eve runs her hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest.  Archer freezes -- mid-caress. \nEVE It's all right, Jon. \nARCHER After all these years, I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive. \nEVE And you wouldn't be. \nNo response.  The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve. \nEVE Things will get better now that you're home.  Everything will be better -- now that... that man is finally out of our lives. \nARCHER Eve... \nHe starts to say the words.  He wants, needs to share the truth with her.  But he can't.  Instead -- \nARCHER ... If I had to do something to find some closure... I should do it, shouldn't I?... No matter how crazy? \nEVE Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again... \nARCHER One last time.  And while I'm gone, I want you and Jamie to go to your mother's.  It's important... \nTITO Shoot me. (as Archer doesn't move) Shoot me! \nTito pulls the gun against his own forehead. \nTITO You want to be Castor Troy?  If you hesitate for a breath, you're finished!  Now -- shoot me!  Kill me! \nArcher holds the gun unsteadily.  Tito is disgusted. \nTITO You can't do it... because Castor is tougher than you... \nBOOM!  The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's head.  Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's still there. \nThen Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination. \nEXT. HOAG'S FACILITY - NIGHT \nClear and calm.  God's night.  Someone's God anyway. \nINT. I.C.U. ROOM - NIGHT \nHoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror. \nHOAG Let's see if I missed anything before I get my hands really dirty. \nArcher removes the robe.  He's amazed to see: \nHis own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc.  Hoag touches Archer's scar. \nHOAG You realize this has to be removed. (as Archer slowly nods) Then here we go, Commander. Through the Looking Glass... \nINT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT \nUnconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, Castor beside him.  Hoag turns to the video technician. \nHOAG Make sure you get everything -- I'll need to study the tape before the reverse surgery. \nHoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face. Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma- Induction-Device (D.I.D.) attaches via suction. \nHoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the trigger.  A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly slicing it.  Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his skull. \nBrodie and Miller watch from above.  Tito stumbles into the nearby bathroom to throw up. \nHoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse. \nHOAG Vault it. \nHoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor. \nCastor's consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize. Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have disappeared. \nBut the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castor's ear -- and we sense that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY \nA head swathed in gauze.  The bandages start to fall away. \nTito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze. The patient looks into a mirror. \nJon Archer has become Castor Troy. \nhe touches his new face.  Archer stares... the cold reality chilling his blood. \nArcher buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's done to himself.  For a moment, he seems to teeter on madness. \nTITO Jon -- are you all right? \nArcher can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't comprehend.  Finally he emerges... shaken, but in control. \nTITO enters.  Instinctively, he grabs for his holster. \nARCHER Okay... I'm okay. (realizes) But my voice... I still sound like me. \nHOAG I implanted a micro-chip onto your larynx. \nHoag SWITCHES ON an AUDIO TAPE.  Archer repeats Castor's words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box. \nCASTOR (V.O.)                  ARCHER Okay, I've got a               Okay, I've got a confession to make, but        confession to make, but you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like it... (etc.)                   it... (etc.) \nAfter a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches perfectly. \nArcher yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing every muscle.  He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes.  Archer slowly turns to... \nCastor.  Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile... \nARCHER Now what? \nTITO We're down to 72 hours.  Let's call Lazarro.  Castor Troy just came out of his coma. \nWalton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room. Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed. \nEspecially his \"brother\" Pollux -- who watches uncertainly. \nDubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.  He grabs Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face. \nARCHER Never -- in -- the -- face. \nHolding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov repeatedly in the groin.  Metal boot meeting soft flesh. \nDubov staggers back -- hurt.  Archer moves in for the kill, savoring it. \nWalton looks skyward. \nWALTON Lock 'em down. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nUP ABOVE - CENTRAL SECURITY \nThe prison's nerve center -- with video-feeds and monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a minimum. \nThe two deputies react to Walton's call.  Identifying Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the appropriate switches and... \nZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor. Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of reach. \nCrack!  Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm. \nARCHER What?  He started it! \nWalton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor. \nARCHER When I get out of here -- \nWALTON You'll what? \nARCHER I'm going to have you fired. \nHis statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs.  Everyone does.  From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's been accepted. \nWALTON (to Dubov) That's two strikes, Dubov.  One more and you know where you're going. (to the others) Back to your 'suites' -- or no dinner. \nAs Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux waiting for him.  Girding himself for this first encounter -- he's got a plan. \nPOLLUX Hey, bro... \nARCHER -- Pollux? \nPOLLUX Of course it's Pollux, what the fuck's wrong with you? \nArcher stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods him forward.  Pollux watches his \"brother\" go -- very concerned. \nINT. ARCHER'S CELL - NIGHT \nArcher lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling. Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go insane here. \nEXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT \nAn insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night he cut off his ear, anyway. \nINT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT \nCastor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice -- three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and stabilizes. \nCastor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard. Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop open. \nReflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He goes down -- in agony -- groaning. \nHe struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze. \nThe discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE... then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool. \nFinally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the phone and he dials. \nCASTOR Lars... okay, Lunt, then. (rifling desk documents) Something really fucked-up happened... I'm in trouble... so listen very carefully... \nEXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT (LATER) \nA RANGE ROVER SCREECHES up.  At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt manhandle Hoag into the lab. \nINT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT \nLars and Lunt hustle Hoag in.  The lab is on.  The screens run -- scrolling through the video log of Archer's surgery. \nHoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct tape. \nHOAG What's this about?  What do you want? \nLars shoves Hoag into a towering figure... we ZOOM IN ON Hoag's glasses.  And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see... \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nArcher's boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises. But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror. Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of -- \nJon Archer.  This man has Archer's face -- his real face. \nIMPOSTOR What's the matter?  Don't you like the new me? \nArcher studies the image of his former self -- trying to understand.  Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he cannot say... \nARCHER -- Castor...? \nCASTOR Not anymore. \nARCHER It can't be.  It's impossible. \nCASTOR I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was 'titanically remote'.  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all. (starts pacing) By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here. \nContinuing to circle, he displays the current LA Times: \n\"INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead\" \nCASTOR Terrible tragedy. Hoag was such a genius -- but selfish with his artistry.  I actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me. \nARCHER You killed them? \nCASTOR Of course I killed them, you dumb fuck.  Hoag, his staff... \nFLASH ON Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab. Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's. \nCASTOR Miller and Brodie -- \nFLASH ON Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car wreck. \nCASTOR I even paid a visit to your buddy Tito. \nARCHER He doesn't know anything about this! \nCASTOR Come on, Jon.  I think I know you better than that.  I only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face -- \nFLASH ON Tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up Archer's wedding band off the counter... \nINT. EREWHON PRISON (PRESENT) \nArcher stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now on Castor's finger. \nCASTOR -- then again, I guess you were there. (a beat) I torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are.  So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life. \nARCHER Castor, don't do this -- \nCASTOR No discussion, Jon -- no deals. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean 'make love to.' \nArcher freaks out.  He screams, flails -- unable to reach Castor.  Castor opens the door and guards rush in -- clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless. \nWALTON Sorry, sir. \nCASTOR It's quite all right.  You never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal... \nINT. CELL BLOCK - DAY \nThe guards dump Archer into his cell. \nWALTON Better be nice, Castor.  You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone. \nARCHER Pollux is -- what? \nWALTON Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence.  He's been released... \nARCHER Walton, you have to listen to me -- right now! \nWALTON Or what?  You'll have me fired? (pushes a button) You're confined until I say otherwise... \nThe steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading voice. \nINT. ARCHER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY \nSipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss: men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag. \nCASTOR (sickened) Jesus, what a life. \nCastor tries to catch a street address and rolls past... \nARCHER'S HOUSE \nDressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by. A moment later, it backs up and parks. \nHiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile -- and gets out.  She doesn't smile back. \nEVE I suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived. \nCastor dons his stern \"Archer\" face as the gate guard checks his thumbprint ID.  He's cleared and waved in. \nINT. FBI INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY \nBuzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror. He's gorging himself on a big lunch.  Castor arrives. \nBUZZ Listen, sir... we just want you to know... \nWANDA We're all really sorry about Tito... \nCASTOR Yeah, well, shit happens. \nBuzz and Wanda exchange a glance.  To them, \"Archer\" is just avoiding his feelings again. \nCASTOR How's our star witness? \nBUZZ He hasn't told us a damn thing except what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches. \nWANDA If that bomb is out there -- we're almost out of time. \nLAZARRO (O.S.) Archer! \nLazarro stomps toward them... furious.  Buzz and Wanda quickly excuse themselves. \nLAZARRO You made a deal with Pollux Troy? He's 'a manipulative psychopath.' Your own words, Jon! \nCASTOR Just let me do my job, Victor. \nLAZARRO The job I've been protecting for the last eight years.  From now on, you go strictly by the book. Everything gets cleared by me. Understand? \nLazarro stomps off.  Castor watches him go, wheels turning. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nCastor enters -- shutting down the mikes... and the blinds. \nCASTOR You're supposed to be snitching -- making me look good. \nPOLLUX 'Look good'? (drops food in disgust) Seeing that face -- I want to vomit. \nCASTOR I'm the one who has to look at this butt-ugly mug every time I pass a mirror.  Look at my eyes, my chin, my perfect nose -- gone! (considers his reflection) Archer took my life, so I'm taking his.  Bro, I'm going straight. \nPOLLUX Sounds like they took your brain, too? \nCASTOR Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar Hoover.  Carlos the Jackal running Interpol.  Kaddafi heading the Mossad.  Think of the secrets we could sell... \nPollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus. \nPOLLUX The drug agents we could expose. The movie stars we could blackmail! \nCASTOR That's just the bottom of the food chain.  Pollux -- what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force One? \nPOLLUX ... that somebody would get rich. And, I suppose, the nation would be pretty pissed-off. \nCASTOR Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking for someone to step in, take charge, give them hope again. What if that someone was an F.B.I. hero?  A true Boy Scout and family man -- with a spotless past. Imagine where that guy could land -- if the timing's right. \nPOLLUX It's an audacious dream, Caz.  But Jon Archer is hardly a household name. \nCASTOR Not yet he isn't.  But after you 'confess' -- you'll be a free man. And I'll be on my way... \nEXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY \nPolice VEHICLES ROAR into position.  Squads of police evacuate throngs of people. \nINT. CONVENTION CENTER - SUB-BASEMENT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY \nTICKS down to less than two minutes. \nWorking as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the bomb's casing.  Inside, the complex guts glow evilly. The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their league. \nBOMB LEADER Jesus... Any suggestions? \nTECHNICIAN Yeah... run \nCastor pushes up his blast visor.  He looks grim. \nBOMB LEADER It's protected by a vibration detector... One touch and... \nCASTOR Evacuate your team, Captain. \nBOMB LEADER Sir, you can't disarm it -- \nCASTOR Just go! \nThe bomb squad hustles out.  Waiting until he's alone, Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its switch.  The bomb's glow dies instantly. \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER \nstops at 26 seconds. \nflares as Castor lights a candle.  The dining room table is set for a candlelight dinner.  He smiles warmly at her confusion. \nCASTOR Don't tell me you forgot.  Eve -- it's date night! \nDINING ROOM - LATER \nEve looks up from her pasta.  After an awkward silence. \nEVE Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date? \nCASTOR It's important to keep some mystery... so things stay... unpredictable. \nEve studies him as he pours her more wine.  Her smile slowly fades as she realizes what's going on. \nEVE 'Unpredictable'?  You're about as unpredictable as the tide. (detached) How long are you going to be gone this time? \nCASTOR Gone? \nEVE Isn't that what all this is about? The wine, cooking me dinner -- your next assignment? \nCASTOR I'm not going anywhere. \nEVE You always say that -- then you leave. \nCASTOR I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon Archer is the most inattentive, sexless spouse on Earth. \nEVE Jon, that's not true -- \nCASTOR Of course it's true, but I'm trying to change?  I'm here because I want to be alone with you.  I want to see the candle- light dance in your beautiful -- \nUh-oh.  Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes.  He leans in \"romantically\" -- but we know the real reason. \nCASTOR -- brown eyes. \nHe smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill. \nCASTOR I wanted it all to be just right... when I told you about my promotion. \nEVE Your what? \nCASTOR Well, I don't have it yet.  But Lazarro's getting old -- he won't be around forever.  And I'm getting the itch to move up. \nEVE Jon... that's wonderful. \nCASTOR So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you... \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCastor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the water. \nHe rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to carrion.  As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and whispers... \nCASTOR baby, it's like I'm having you for the first time. \nDirty water runs down a floor drain... PULL BACK to: \nINT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT \nDesolate, Archer mops down the rec area. \nARCHER Don't they ever let us take off these boots? \nVOISINE Not unless you're sent to the 'Clinic.' \nARCHER You mean if I get sick? \nVOISINE They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Dubov just got sent down -- and look at Wainwright -- \nVoisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- WAINWRIGHT -- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles. \nVOISINE Toughest bastard I ever saw -- after you, of course.  Now he's a fucking drool case. \nARCHER What did he do? \nVOISINE He hit a guard. \nArcher sees Walton hovering nearby.  Archer heads for him. \nWALTON Looking for trouble, Castor? \nARCHER As a matter of fact -- yes. \nCrack!  Archer decks Walton. \nINT. PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT \nWalton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door. \nINT. \"CLINIC\" - NIGHT \nArcher and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level labyrinth.  A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with catwalks, staircases and high walls. \nECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER -- they seem to be coming from all around them. \nOver the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall.  He pulls one screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized wall. \nArcher gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came. \nSMASH CUT: \nSHEER WALL \nArcher and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal boots.  They climb higher and higher as... \nGuards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and around them -- oblivious. \nArcher and Dubov almost reach the next level when... \nWALTON There! \nBULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and Dubov reach the next catwalk. \nArcher spots the emergency exit security door at the far end.  But four guards descend on them -- and block their way. \nFist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking guards.  Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more guards.  Dubov drops another over the catwalk. \nThey continue their desperate race for the door -- reaching the landing.  As BULLETS PING around them -- hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel.  He uses it as a shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter. \nAs SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold. \nHe presses his thumb to the door's keypad.  To his horror, its LED reads \"print unreadable.\" \nWalton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer range. \nDubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.  The shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly disintegrating. \nArcher licks his thumb, tries again.  Finally it reads \"Clearance Confirmed\"... the door slides open. \nARCHER Let's go! \nDubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but as he turns to follow... Walton BLOWS him away. \nArcher reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled inmate ignores the helping hand.  Pulling the door shut, he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily. \nINT. HIGH CATWALK TOWER \nArcher hesitates for a moment... but that's all he has. he keeps going... up the winding staircase-catwalk -- higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing guards. \nAs BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top. He ignores a sign which reads... \nEMERGENCY EXIT ONLY SAFETY LINES REQUIRED \nHe charges straight up a ladder and plows right through -- \nSMASH CUT: \nEXT. PRISON - DAWN \nArcher's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world. \nA sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the bird... \nPULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal: \nThe prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform. \nArcher rushes over to a transport chopper. \nINSIDE COCKPIT \nArcher searches for the keys.  No go.  He throws switches.  Nothing works. \nGuards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING.  Archer leaps from the chopper and jumps over the side to the platform's -- \nLOWER LEVEL \nHe lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and rolls to the ground.  He grabs a high-pressure hose -- and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards close in. \nArcher BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON -- knocking Walton and others into the sea.  Archer upends a stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards. Archer spots: \nTUGBOAT \npulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea. \nArcher jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail -- where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back.  Under FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the platform. \nHanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean. At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into... \nCHOPPY SEA \nEXT. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY - DAY \nIt's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot, Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of graves -- with no idea where she's leading him. \nFinally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone: \nMatthew Archer, Age 5 Beloved Son & Brother We Cherish You Always \nStunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker. \nEVE Happy birthday, Matty. \nShe places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark... a little bulldozer... a spaceship.  Overwhelmed with grief, she collapses into Castor. \nEVE He took our baby, Jon.  He took our little boy. \nFULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE \nHe stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy whose mother is weeping into his chest. \nThe ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the victim's pain. \nCASTOR Stop crying... stop crying... stop ... \nINT. FBI BULLPEN - DAY \nShaking off his funk, Castor arrives at the office. \nWANDA You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off! \nCASTOR What happened? \nWANDA Castor's dead! \nCASTOR He's -- what? \nBUZZ Somehow he escaped from Erewhon. But a prison chopper mowed him down just off Long Beach Harbor... \nCASTOR Where's the body? \nWANDA It hasn't been recovered yet. \nCASTOR 'It hasn't been recovered yet!' You people have no idea who you're dealing with! (beat) I want everyone on this, reports on the half hour, and all leads get routed through my office. Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D. \nBUZZ L.A.P.D.?  Even if he is alive, Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city. \nCASTOR He's alive -- and he's already here.  Move! \nEXT. PIER - NIGHT \nSomething bobs up in the surf.  Archer is thrashed ashore by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand.  He takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach. \nEXT. TITO'S STREET - NIGHT \nArcher's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon taped across Tito's front door.  Some teenage cholos notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going. \nINT. TITO'S DUPLEX - NIGHT \nA rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in. In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall... then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks. \nHe buckles and has to sit down.  Taking a deep breath, he picks up the phone and dials. \nARCHER Dr. Archer please.   It's an emergency. (listens) -- Her husband. \nArcher waits.  He pinches his throat -- trying to dislodge the vocal implant.  His voice scrambles into garbled static. \nARCHER Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds crazy, but -- (reverting back) Dammit. \nINT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT \nEVE deftly stitches up a gash above little IRIS's (8) eye. \nEVE How did this happen, sweetie? \nIRIS'S DAD She fell off her Big-Wheel. \nSomething about his too-quick response rankles Eve.  She eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some bruises on the child's arm.  A NURSE enters. \nNURSE Dr. Archer -- your husband's on three. \nEVE Get Child Services down here -- and don't let her father leave. (goes to wall-phone) Jon?  Hello? \nINTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary. \nARCHER Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't. \nEVE Who is this? \nARCHER Please, just listen!  Take Jamie and go to your mother's in Santa Fe.  Don't tell him where you're going -- just go. \nDIETRICH That's my other curse. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER) \nCars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low- rent streets. \nEmerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo, Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee. \nINT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nArcher splashes water on his face -- then stops and listens as the DOORBELL RINGS.  He screws up his courage. \nARCHER You're Castor Troy... This is your old crew -- you don't take shit and you don't take no for an answer... \nINT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous, in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor. \nALDO Helluva place, Dietrich.  So what's the big surprise? \nArcher emerges.  The men are stunned -- the women beam. \nFITCH Are you crazy?  You're going to bring the Feds down on all of us! \nARCHER Archer doesn't want you, he wants me!  But I'm going to get him first -- with your help. \nALDO Archer's a damn celebrity now -- he's untouchable -- and you're radioactive. \nHe turns to leave.  Archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall.  Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's too quick -- he strips him of it. \nThe four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround Archer. \nARCHER You wanna face-off with Castor Troy?  Come on, then!  Come on! 'Cause I've had a real bad day... \nFour against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer. One-by-one, the bodyguards back off.  Archer points the gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back. \nARCHER You're all forgetting who the real enemy is. (to Aldo) Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled you in for questioning.  He rattled you so bad -- you shit your Armani suit right there in the interrogation room. \nAldo blanches -- how did Castor know that?  Fitch laughs. \nARCHER You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer laughed at your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom. \nStunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up. \nDIETRICH We all have a reason to hate Jon Archer.  We all want to see him dead -- \nARCHER And nobody's untouchable if we say he's not. \nThe thugs exchange a glance... reading each other... considering. \nDIETRICH It's all worked out.  Caz has Archer's routine down cold. \nARCHER We start with your basic kidnapping.  Then -- a little surgery. \nFITCH Surgery? \nARCHER I'm going to rearrange his face in a way you won't believe. \nALDO You're an evil bitch, Caz.  But you've got balls of titanium. Count us in. \nArcher sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance. \nDIETRICH Come on -- let's drink to it! \nFULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE \nDietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high- ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer. \nDIETRICH How about one of your famous toasts, Caz? \nThey all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss. \nARCHER To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh -- blow jobs? \nSilence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge to puke. \nLIVIA Enough business, Caz.  Let's dance. \nARCHER Sorry... I don't... \nShe drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin.  The girls start \"dancing,\" grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist. \nLIVIA Remember the Charger's game, Caz? The owners box?  We did it four times. \nARCHER Sure I remember... Once a quarter, right? \nArcher's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings. \nThe twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche. \nSASHA Take off the rest of those rags and get dressed.  Then get out. \nARCHER Not until I finish my business with your brother. \nSASHA I told him to keep those creeps away -- but you're just too big an attraction. (calming herself) Look, if the F.B.I. finds out you've been here -- I'll lose my son.  So please, just go. \nFor the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her. \nARCHER I know I've done some things that made your life harder... \nSASHA How would you?  You walked out and never looked back. \nADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing. \nARCHER I'm not the same person you remember.  And for what it's worth, I'm sorry... \nHer harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves. \nARCHER Not a bad fit. \nSASHA They should.  They're yours. \nARCHER Nice-looking kid, too \nSASHA Of course he is... \nSasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil. Then... \nSASHA Adam, come here... I want you to meet your father. \nArcher's face pales over in shock. \nEXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTheir silhouettes are visible against the shades. \nPULL BACK... \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nCastor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes. \nCASTOR (into cellular) We've got him sighted.  Okay, Pollux, pull out. \nBUZZ What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother? \nCASTOR I've never been more certain of anything.  Get everyone in position.  Remember -- shoot to kill. \nBefore Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say \"don't argue.\" \nBUZZ You heard the man -- let's saddle up! \nINT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nPlaying with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy gaze. \nARCHER How old is he? \nSASHA Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you... \nADAM Bang!  Bang!  Bang! \nStartled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at them.  Upset, she takes it from his hands. \nSASHA You know Mommy doesn't like you playing with these things... \nShe kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to Archer.  Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy. \nArcher's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body. \nSASHA You're not holding him right... Caz... \nArcher isn't hearing Sasha.  He's lost in his own memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER... a GUNSHOT... \nThen Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled. It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something strong.  He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms. \nARCHER He's not my son. \nSASHA Yes, he is -- ! \nThen something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest second. \nARCHER Get down! \nK-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft. \nOUTSIDE \nacross the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER. \nAgents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through the floor -- desperate to hit their targets. \nAgents open FIRE from the girders supporting the roof -- cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard. \nDIETRICH They're like cockroaches! \nDietrich and Livia toss SMOKE GRENADES into the loft -- covering their escape. \nTOP LEVEL \nDietrich leads them to the very back of the loft.  He pulls open a hidden door. \nDIETRICH If we make it, we'll meet up at my Malibu place.  You remember it, Caz? \nARCHER Off Kanan Road -- I know it. \nArcher hands Adam over to Sasha.  She hugs her little boy -- then embraces Archer tightly.  Hanging on -- near tears -- because she knows this may be the last time. \nSASHA Thank you, Caz... thank you... \nARCHER Get the boy out of here... \nLivia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out -- \nINT. ROTUNDA - NIGHT \nMAC-10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM!  BOOM!  His escorts drop. \nCastor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer. Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the eight columns.  The columns are separated by mirrored- panels. \nCat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column and mirror.  He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away! \nCRASH!  The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces. \nARCHER (O.S.) That's about a thousand years bad luck... \nCastor whirls, spots Archer again and FIRES!  Another MIRROR.  Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN REFLECTION. \nThen Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and onto Castor.  They battle for control of the pistol. \nCASTOR It's too late, Jon.  Your kid loves me.  And your wife's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her. \nThey're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's ear. \nCASTOR Tonight I'm going to make her come like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate your death. \nCastor licks Archer's ear salaciously.  Enraged, Archer tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor. \nHe's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED the world around him.  Archer staggers away as -- \nLoomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a doorway.  Loomis FIRES the M-16's grenade launcher. \nBOOM!  The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into flames -- but Archer has made it through. \nLoomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off angrily.  Castor can't follow through the flames. \nEXT. ROOF - NIGHT \nArcher slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS force him to take cover behind the cupola. \nPollux FIRES at him from the other side. \nArcher RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.  Stand-off. \nPOLLUX Remember me?  Your 'baby brother'? \nTrying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the top of the cupola. \nPOLLUX You tricked me into telling you things I never told anyone... \nArcher hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the crown. \nPOLLUX Now take it to your grave. \nArcher FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet.  The cupola disintegrates beneath his weight.  He plunges down into -- \nROTUNDA \nCastor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the floor at his feet. \nCASTOR Pollux... \nPollux is almost gone.  Castor looks up and sees -- \nARCHER \nPeering down into the rotunda. \nCASTOR \nEXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nNothing happening here at 4 A.M.  Nothing indeed.  The bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in. \nINT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEve paces anxiously as the BLOOD ANALYZER CLICKS away. \nEVE Please be O-neg.  Please... \nThe MACHINE STOPS CLICKING.  It reads \"Male -- Type AB.\" She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned. \nARCHER (O.S.) Thanks for believing me. \nArcher emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority. \nARCHER What are you doing?  Where did you get that gun? \nEVE I took it from my fake husband. \nARCHER Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing. \nEVE I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead. \nARCHER What more proof do you need? \nEVE Tell me... tell me about the all- night dentist. \nAs Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth. \nARCHER ... I took a date out for chicken and ribs -- not knowing she was a vegetarian.  When the night couldn't get worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow she and I had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist... (a beat) And even though it must have hurt -- you still kissed me. \nEve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears. \nEVE Christ, Jon!  How could you put us in this position?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me...? \nARCHER Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you -- \nShe pulls herself together -- regaining her composure. \nEVE But you're damn well going to try. (a beat) First -- how are we going to get you out of this? \nINT. ARCHER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCastor wakes up and finds Eve gone.  His eyes narrow as he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there. \nINT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow vial. \nEVE This will knock him out for hours. \nARCHER Good.  What's his schedule tomorrow? \nEVE He doesn't tell me anymore than you ever did... All I know is -- tomorrow we're going to Victor's memorial service. \nARCHER Victor... Tito... they both died thinking I killed them... And in a way... I did. \nEVE Jon -- you can't think about that now. \nArcher takes a breath -- and pulls himself together. \nARCHER -- What happens after the memorial? \nEVE He's taking Jamie and me away. \nARCHER And neither of you will be coming back.  Where's the service? \nEVE Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea. \nArcher reacts... the irony's not lost on him. \nEVE What are you going to do? \nARCHER Hit him with a trank dart.  Once he's unconscious -- I'll try to get to Buzz and Wanda before the security team gets to me. \nEVE What else can I do? \nARCHER Think up a good excuse.  I don't want you or Jamie anywhere near that service. \nEVE I can cover for Jamie.  But if I'm not there, he'll suspect something... (as Archer considers) The second you make your move, all hell's going to break loose.  If I'm there beside him -- I can take charge.  I'm his wife, remember? (a beat) There's no way around it -- for once, you need me. \nArcher looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over. \nARCHER I've always needed you... \nThey embrace... soaking up each other's warmth. \nEVE Jon -- what are the odds? \nARCHER \nFIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit.  Castor BLASTS back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS. \nCIVILIAN BOAT \nspeeds toward him -- causing a near-miss. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRunning parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER at point-blank range.  Their boats smash and pound each other. \nA police boat closes in on them. \nCastor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and boat.  The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's craft. \nArcher's BOAT plows up and through the other.  EXPLOSION! Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the water. \nThe boat lands right next to Castor's. \nArcher and Castor resume their battering... approaching a -- \nTUG \npulling a barge. \nCastor forces Archer into its path.  At the last moment... \nArcher leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as -- \nKA-BOOM!  Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which EXPLODES. \nCASTOR \nswerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off. \nArcher can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip. \nBut the boat hits a wave... \nCastor loses the gun -- which skids away.  Archer slips, his head hanging over the side.  Castor tries to ram Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time. \nCastor grabs the anchor -- swings it.  WHUNK!  It sinks into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around his neck. \nAs Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain. Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water. \nArcher tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds toward -- \nPIER \nArcher yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.  But as they slug it out... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nWHAM!  The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS straight for the shipyard.  COLLIDING with a shoreline obstruction -- \nThe BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow... \nArcher and Castor go flying... onto the beach. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nArcher and Castor lie dazed... then stir.  Castor sees the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it. But -- \nArcher gets it first.  He aims it at Castor as they rise. \nCASTOR You won't shoot me, Jon.  I'm unarmed... \nARCHER Okay, I have a confession to make... but you aren't gonna like it... You're right, I won't shoot you.  Not in the face anyway. \nBOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!  He jerks and reels -- dropping to his knees.  He looks at Archer in total disbelief.  Then he sinks to the ground and lies still. \nExhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.  Then he turns and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.  Relieved, he turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone! \nCastor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw.  Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the leg.  He buckles... but keeps going. \nArcher leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade. \nCASTOR It'll never be over, Jon... every time you look in the mirror... you'll see my face... \nThey struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer, closer -- slicing into \"Archer's\" cheek.  At the last instant... \nArcher reaches the anchor-chain.  He wraps it around the screw -- stopping the whirling blades. \nCastor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer moves. \nArcher takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his wedding ring.  Just when he almost has it off -- Castor suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight. \nEye contact between the two men.  Castor smirks, his grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.  Archer lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own finger. \n", "test1_input": "Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle. \nAn LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.  A cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter. \nThe driver stands at his door, radio in hand.  Sensing something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt. \nArcher sprays him in the face.  The cop gags and sags. Archer quickly slips behind the wheel. \nInside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.  He HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nArcher slows the squad car. \nUp ahead:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic. \nArcher pulls off the road, out of sight.  He flips open the portacomp and starts to type rapidly. \nINT. FBI - DAY \nA DISPATCHER'S SCANNER CLICKS to life. \nDISPATCHER All units.  I have a confirmed code zero-zero priority alert. Proceed at once to Parthenia Street Terminal.  That's Parthenia at Nordhoff. \nQUICK SHOTS \nA)  MOTOR POOL \nTac squads pile into armored Jeeps. \nB)  HELIPORT \nChoppers lift off and veer east. \nC)  ARCHER'S HOUSE \nThe surveillance CARS ROAR away. \nEXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY \nArcher watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer. Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west. \nEXT. ARCHER HOME - BACK YARD - DAY \nA plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into the yard.  He peers out from behind the garage. \nA cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO. \nArcher approaches the bird feeder.  Quietly, he sticks his hand inside -- and searches for the key. \nJust when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD hovers over Archer.  The cop looks over -- but Archer is gone.  All Lars sees is the bird. \nINT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY \nCastor arrives.  Wanda is shocked to see him. \nWANDA Commander, what are you doing here? \nCASTOR Where should I be? (looks around) Where's everyone else? \nWANDA Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Parthenia Street Terminal? \nCASTOR What? \nWANDA You radioed in your personal security code.  Nobody knows that code but you. \nCASTOR Obviously someone else knows it! Get everybody back to their posts -- now! \nINT. ARCHER HOME - SUNSET \nArcher tiptoes through the house -- listening.  He sees Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his pistol.  He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of RUNNING WATER. \nMASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION \nArcher walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing the bed.  He stops.  On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs. \nOverwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has stopped.  Eve steps in from the bathroom. \nARCHER Eve... \nThe look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality. She runs, but Archer grabs her.  She struggles -- fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her mouth covered. \nARCHER I'm not going to hurt you.  Just don't scream, okay? (no response) Okay? \nTerrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her. \nEVE I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son -- \nARCHER -- I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband. \n", "test1_true": "ARCHER Now, you're going to listen.  The last time we saw each other -- was in this room.  We had a fight after I told you I had to go away. (a beat) My assignment -- Jon Archer's assignment -- was to enter a federal prison as Castor Troy. \nEve is startled by this intimate information but she reveals nothing.  SIRENS approach the house, the cops are returning.  She keeps an eye on the door.  Playing for time. \nEVE How did he expect to do that? \nARCHER An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission.  But not before he was transformed into me. \nThe back DOOR CLICKS open.  A voice booms out. \nCOP (O.S.) Dr. Archer, are you okay? \nARCHER If you need hard evidence, get it. Your husband's blood type is O negative.  Castor's is A.B. \nArcher glances at the balcony -- as FOOTSTEPS CLOMP up the stairs.  Eve is about to answer -- or scream.  But then... \nARCHER Remember the parachute dream?  I'm falling, Eve... I'm falling... \nThe blood drains from her face as... Archer slips over the balcony and disappears. \nINT. STUDY - LATER \nEve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented.  She snaps alert on hearing the front DOOR OPEN -- Castor is giving orders to the cops guarding the house. \nCASTOR (O.S.) I want you guys here around-the- clock.  And stay off the lawn. \nEve feigns interest in her laptop as Castor enters.  She tenses as he starts massaging her back. \nCASTOR You're all in knots.  Maybe another date night will help you relax... \nEVE Not tonight... I'm way behind in my Continuing Ed. \nHe studies Eve, then grasps her firmly by the shoulders. \nCASTOR You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person. \nEVE -- Yes. \nCASTOR Okay, I have a confession to make. But you aren't going to like it... \nCastor wraps his hands around her slender neck... \nCASTOR (cont'd) ... I read your diary.  I've been trying to change -- trying to be more like the man you want me to be. \nEve reacts to the explanation.  There is a logic to it. \nCASTOR And to prove it, I'm taking you and Jamie away on a trip -- right after the memorial service. \nEVE What memorial service? \nCASTOR Victor Lazarro had a heart seizure... right in my office.  It was horrible... \nEVE Oh, my God... \nCastor pours it on -- feigning immense grief. \nCASTOR First Tito... now Victor... (holds her tight) ... please don't tell me I'm going to lose you, too... \nEVE (returns the embrace) Of course not. \nINT. ARCHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCastor slumbers fitfully.  Suddenly, his shoulder twitches, rousing him.  He looks up to find Eve reading beside him. \nCASTOR What was that? \nEVE What was what? \nCASTOR Something bit me. \nEVE Probably a mosquito -- I'll close the window. \nEve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep. She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nEve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her pocket.  She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood. \nEXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT \nAs Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her. She stifles a scream -- then sees... the two COPS. \nCOP Sorry, Dr. Archer.  Where are you going at this hour? \nEVE There's been an emergency at the hospital. \nCOP One of us will have to escort you. \nEVE Fine... (a beat) But please don't wake my husband... he's exhausted. \n", "test1_id": 69, "test2_input": "EXT. SEA-SIDE - DAY \nAt the foot of the cemetery knoll.  Rows of chairs... white flowers... mourners.  A yacht is docked at the breakwater. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE \npeers down through scope -- seeing... \nCastor and Eve as they emerge from their limo. \nEve glances around, searching for Archer.  She comes eye- to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move. \nArcher TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front row.  The ceremony begins. \nPRIEST We are here to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.  We all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending this great nation -- first, as a highly decorated admiral -- then, as west coast director of the F.B.I.  But not all of you know what a deeply spiritual man he was.  It was his wish that his Requiem Mass be performed in Latin. (a beat) In Nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.  Amen... \nThe PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass. \nARCHER \nfills the trank-dart with sedative. \nPRIEST \ncontinues the solemn ritual. \nPRIEST Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda quando caeli movendi sunt et terra... \nEVE \nchecks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away... \nCastor absently pats her knee.  She's forced to return focus to the service. \nARCHER \nchambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and carefully peers over the crucifix. \nTHROUGH SCOPE \nArcher TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor. As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head... \nBACK TO SCENE \nWe've come full circle from Matthew's death:  with Archer the sniper and Castor the target. \nThe Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes. \nPRIEST Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine... Amen. \nFULL SCREEN - TRIGGER \nArcher's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze... \nPOV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE \ncrosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot.  Archer's finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling away from her face.  It's Jamie. \nAT SERVICE \nEve stiffens as Jamie sits down. \nJAMIE Thanks anyway, Mom -- (slides her $50) But I wanted to be here for you... and Dad. \nCastor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing. \nHe simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in hers. \nThe honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles, commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as -- \nARCHER \nsteadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle. \nHe hears MOTION behind him.  Someone's coming and fast... but this is his only chance.  Off-balance, Archer squeezes -- \nTHFFFT!  The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the barrel. \nFOLLOW DART \nScreaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide. It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during the 21-GUN SALUTE. \nON KNOLL \nTHUMP!  Archer is cracked across the head.  He slumps down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear.  As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we don't know when, or if, this pistol fires... \nAT SEA-SIDE SERVICE \n", "test2_true": "PRIEST The admiral's family will now take his ashes to the sea... \nAs Mrs. Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone... getting a message. \nHis eyes alight on a boathouse... adjacent to the service. \nCASTOR (into headset) Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car around, then meet us at that boathouse... \nGuests head for their cars.  Eve seizes the moment and steps over to Wanda and Buzz. \nEVE Wanda -- I need to talk to you. \nWANDA (reads her face) Sure... what's wrong? \nBut then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at her -- tightening his \"friendly\" grip on Jamie's shoulder. \nEVE Never mind -- \nCASTOR Come on, baby.  I've got a surprise for you. \nWanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the boathouse. \nINT. BOATHOUSE - DAY \nDim, deserted.  Filled with boat parts, tools, etc. Castor hustles Eve inside and locks the door behind him. \nLunt is there -- standing over a beaten Archer.  Eve gasps. \nCASTOR Look who we caught creeping around -- Castor Troy. \nEVE Why is he here? \nCASTOR Before I turn him in, I thought we'd pay him back for everything he's put us through... \nCastor starts kicking Archer.  Over and over in the gut. \nCASTOR Come on, baby.  Join the fun -- \nEve can't stand it.  She charges Castor -- but he immediately subdues her. \nCASTOR Too bad.  Part of me was hoping you didn't know. \nHe throws her down beside Archer.  She clings to him. \nCASTOR Did you really think it would be that easy, you dumb fucks? (to Eve) Sorry, baby.  Castor Troy is about to murder you and our daughter... but I promise you won't die unavenged. \nARCHER This is between you and me.  Leave them out of this. \nCASTOR It was between you and me.  Even your little boy -- that wasn't supposed to happen.  But you couldn't let it go. \nARCHER No father could. \nCASTOR Appealing to my sense of 'family' won't work, Jon.  I thought you knew me better than that \nArcher plays for time -- looking for some edge.  He sees a crate filled with block-and-tackle amid the shop's tools. \nARCHER I know some things that even you don't know, Caz.  You have a son. I've met him.  His name is Adam... \nCASTOR I imagine I've got a dozen kids -- so what? (cocks pistol) No more head games... First your wife dies.  Then your daughter. Then you. \nCastor smiles as the DOOR CREAKS open. \nCASTOR Just one big happy family... \nBut it's not Jamie and Lars.  Three people emerge from the shadows, machine pistols poised. \nCASTOR Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha? \nDIETRICH That's right, Archer.  Now drop 'em. \nNo options.  Castor and Lunt drop their weapons. \nEXT. BOATHOUSE - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY \nLars and Jamie pull up in the car.  Lars listens to his headset -- knows something is wrong. \nLARS Don't fucking move... \nINT. BOATHOUSE - DAY \nSasha's at Archer's side. \nSASHA Caz -- are you okay? \nCASTOR You're making a mistake.  I'm Castor -- he's Archer.  Sasha, baby -- just give me a minute to explain! \nSASHA That's pathetic, Archer.  But then, your terrible sense of humor is legendary. \nALDO (cocks GUN) It's pay-back time. \n", "test2_id": 70, "test3_input": "Aldo aims at Castor when BOOM!  He's blown apart. \nLars charges in -- BLASTING. \nArcher grabs a block-and-tackle as -- \nLunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol.

Staggered -- Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich. \nCastor and Lars BLAZE at the now-scattering intruders -- driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums. \nARCHER Find Jamie! \nEve crawls through the FUSILLADE toward the exit. \nEXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY \nAmong the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert. Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear something? \nEXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY \nEve rushes to the car -- it's empty.  Jamie is gone. \nEVE Jamie?  Jamie! \nBULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her. \nINT.

Archer FIRES back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back. \nArcher leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha. \nSASHA ... Help Adam... don't let him end up like us... \nShe dies in his arms.  Wounded, Dietrich crawls over. Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror... \nDIETRICH Sasha -- ! \nBOOM BOOM BOOM!  Castor wastes Dietrich.  Archer BLASTS back -- driving Castor outside.  Archer pursues. \nEXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY \nEve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run. \nWANDA We heard gunshots -- \nEVE Wanda, I've got to tell you something.  Something crazy... \nEXT. BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY \nArcher emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats. Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun. \nCastor moves stealthily through the narrow paths. Hearing a NOISE behind him -- \nBOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair hull.  He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two steps -- until -- \nCastor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps. \nThe men collapse hard.  Castor's pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat. \nArcher and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is dislodged. \nHis VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.  STATIC. \nARCHER Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out. \nCASTOR Not if I kill you first. \nThey scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop dead in their tracks because -- \nJamie appears, holding the pistol. \nCASTOR Give it here, Jamie. \nARCHER No, Jamie.  Don't do it! \nEverybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now... \nBoth speaking in Archer's true voice. \n", "test3_true": "ARCHER Listen to my voice, Jamie.  I'm your father. \nCASTOR It's a trick, Jamie.  I'm your father. \nJamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled. \nCASTOR Shoot him, Jamie. \nARCHER Jamie... \nCASTOR Shoot him! \nJamie FIRES.  Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his shoulder.  Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand. \nCASTOR You dunce.  No kid of mine would miss so badly. \nHe aims the gun at Archer's head. \nWANDA (O.S.) Hold it. \nWanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns leveled.  Eve and more agents are right behind. \nCASTOR Just saving the taxpayers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike. \nWANDA You're both under arrest until a D.N.A. test proves who's who. \nCASTOR I'm ordering you to back off! \nSeveral agents waver -- unsure.  But not Wanda and Buzz. \nWANDA Put the gun down -- \nBUZZ -- Now! \nCASTOR (beat) Can't blame me for trying. \nHe grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her chin. \nArcher struggles to his feet as -- \nCastor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate to the garden.  Archer follows -- cautiously. \nCASTOR Say goodbye to Daddy -- \nJamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's thigh and twists.  She dives away.  FIRING wildly, Castor staggers back through the gate. \nCASTOR (O.S.) You ungrateful delinquent! \nOUTSIDE GATE \nAs Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a confused security agent. \nCASTOR Give me your weapon -- now! \nThe agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him. \nBOATYARD \nArcher and Eve make sure Jamie's okay. \nJAMIE (to Archer) Who are you?  Will someone please tell me what's going on? \nArcher rushes to the gate and hauls it open. \nCASTOR \nlimps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive with sunbathers and yachters. \nEXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY \nCastor hustles along until he finds what he's looking for -- \nTwin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by their suntanned crews.  He jumps into one of the boats. \nBOAT CAPTAIN Hey -- ! \nWithout even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead.  In a flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT.  He sees -- \nCASTOR'S POV \nArcher running down the dock toward the adjoining boat. \nCASTOR \nFIRES -- peppering the dock. \nArcher knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him.

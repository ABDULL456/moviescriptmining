Now. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERROGATION FOOTAGE \nWired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his frustrated interrogators on the run. \nINT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY \nArcher, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other FBI officials watch the monitor.  Pollux remains implacable \nPOLLUX (V.O.) (on screen) That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me... a mental exercise. I never built it... \nLazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer. \nARCHER He's lying. \nLAZARRO He's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. \nARCHER Pollux is a manipulative psychopath.  He can control his heartbeat, his sweat glands, his blood pressure... \nLAZARRO Jon, I trust your instincts, I always have.  But D.C. wants more evidence.  And frankly, so do I. \nARCHER You'll get all the evidence you need when ten thousand people die. \nLAZARRO We'll get a team right on it.  But we can't evacuate the city on what amounts to a hunch. \nArcher looks at the gathered brass.  He knows it's hopeless. \nARCHER That bomb has been built, it's out there somewhere and it's going to detonate... \nEXT. FBI BUILDING - INTELLIGENCE MEMORIAL - DAY \nWords etched in the granite wall read: \nIN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE OF DUTY \nArcher watches as a workman engraves the last of the three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring the dead. \nBRODIE Didn't Castor give any clue where the bomb might be? \nARCHER Only one person knows -- his brother Pollux.  And he'll keep his mouth shut until it blows. \nBRODIE We could plant an agent in his cell -- get him to spill the location. \nARCHER Pollux is way too paranoid.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is Castor himself.  And dead men can't talk. \nBrodie and Miller exchange a knowing look. \nBRODIE There might be a way around that... \nFULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S BODY \nTubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice. \nINT. ICU ROOM - DAY \nArcher stares at the body... he can't believe it. \nARCHER Why are you keeping him alive? (gets no answer) As long as he's breathing, he's dangerous. \nMILLER Relax, he's a turnip. \nMiller grinds out her cigarette on Castor's leg.  Of course, Castor just lies there like a vegetable. \nBRODIE We can arrange for you to enter Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy. \nARCHER What are you talking about? \nArcher turns as DR. MALCOLM HOAG (50s) enters the room. \nHOAG I think I'd better answer that question. (offers hand) Malcolm Hoag.  I run the Physiological Camouflage Unit for Special Ops. \nARCHER I know who you are. \nMILLER But you don't know what he can do. Physical augmentation; enhancement surgery... \nBRODIE ... He can disguise a compromised agent or alter the likeness -- even the voice -- of a government witness. \nHOAG Let me show you how it's done. (leading him out) I think you'll recognize our patient... \nINT. HOAG'S SURGICAL BAY - DAY \nLoomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away charred flesh around his burned ear.  The doctor turns to a -- \nSTEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE \n", "test1_true": "OBSERVATION BOOTH - ABOVE \nArcher, Hoag, Brodie and Miller watch the operation -- video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls. \nHOAG With our new generation of anti- inflammatories, healing is accelerated from weeks to days. By his next paycheck, he won't even remember which ear he lost. (a beat) Your situation, however, would be a little less permanent... \nBRODIE -- and a lot more classified. \nHoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc.  Archer pulls it over his face -- like a gauze mask.  A \"tendon\" falls off. \nARCHER This'll fool Pollux. \nHOAG That is a state-of-the-art morpho- genetic template.  The inside can be built to match the exact shape of your skull; the outside -- exactly like Castor's.  Then we fit his face right on top -- \nMILLER -- and you become him. \nARCHER You're talking about removing the guy's face? \nBRODIE Borrowing, Jon.  The procedure's completely reversible. \nMILLER One way or the other -- the mission ends on the eighteenth. \nArcher turns the shell over and over and over in his hands. \nBRODIE You know Castor better than anyone.  You've lived and breathed him for years -- hell, you even look a little like him. \nArcher shoves the template back at Hoag. \nARCHER Find yourself another lab-rat. \nMILLER If you don't do this -- Castor will beat us again.  He'll beat you again... \nArcher pushes his way past them -- and marches out. \nHOAG I don't think that went very well. \nBRODIE Trust us, Doc... \nMILLER ... he'll jerk around.  Then he'll be back. \nINT. INTERROGATION BOOTHS - DAY \nArcher enters... sizes up DIETRICH HASSLER.  His stylish garb doesn't completely hide his criminal roots.  Archer sits down calmly.  He looks at his watch. \nARCHER I'm in a hurry, Dietrich.  So you've only got ten seconds to go through your usual litany of lies, empty threats, and moronic denials.  Then I'm coming over there -- \nDIETRICH If you're in such a fucking hurry -- why are you wasting your time with me?  I'm just an art dealer. \nARCHER You're a dealer, all right: technical secrets, munitions... explosives. \nDIETRICH You've never proven any of that. And when my bitchy, never-been- laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here, she's going to... \nARCHER Time's up. \nArcher topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the top.  Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug. \nHALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nLazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrich's head. \nLAZARRO The only ticking bomb I see is inside his head.  He's getting worse, Tito. \nTITO Don't worry, sir.  It's all an act... \nBut as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too. \nBACK INSIDE BOOTH \nArcher has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner. \nDIETRICH ... Okay!  Castor called me but I blew him off... I swear I never saw him.  And I don't know anything about any bomb! \nINT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION BOOTHS - SAME TIME \nArcher emerges... eyes blazing. \nARCHER Let him go, but I want him watched... Who's next? \nTITO Just Dietrich's sister... \nIn another booth, a careworn but striking woman sits with a little boy on her lap.  She gently helps him Crayola a book.  This is SASHA HASSLER (30) and her son ADAM (5). \nINT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY \nArcher hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced by an icy hatred.  Tito and the child are gone. \nARCHER When was the last time you saw Castor Troy? \nSASHA Who cares?  He's dead. \n", "test1_id": 69, "test2_input": "Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room. Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed. \nEspecially his \"brother\" Pollux -- who watches uncertainly. \nDubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.  He grabs Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face. \nARCHER Never -- in -- the -- face. \nHolding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov repeatedly in the groin.  Metal boot meeting soft flesh. \nDubov staggers back -- hurt.  Archer moves in for the kill, savoring it. \nWalton looks skyward. \nWALTON Lock 'em down. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nUP ABOVE - CENTRAL SECURITY \nThe prison's nerve center -- with video-feeds and monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a minimum. \nThe two deputies react to Walton's call.  Identifying Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the appropriate switches and... \nZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor. Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of reach. \nCrack!  Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm. \nARCHER What?  He started it! \nWalton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor. \nARCHER When I get out of here -- \nWALTON You'll what? \nARCHER I'm going to have you fired. \nHis statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs.  Everyone does.  From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's been accepted. \nWALTON (to Dubov) That's two strikes, Dubov.  One more and you know where you're going. (to the others) Back to your 'suites' -- or no dinner. \nAs Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux waiting for him.  Girding himself for this first encounter -- he's got a plan. \nPOLLUX Hey, bro... \nARCHER -- Pollux? \nPOLLUX Of course it's Pollux, what the fuck's wrong with you? \nArcher stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods him forward.  Pollux watches his \"brother\" go -- very concerned. \nINT. ARCHER'S CELL - NIGHT \nArcher lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling. Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go insane here. \nEXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT \nAn insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night he cut off his ear, anyway. \nINT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT \nCastor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice -- three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and stabilizes. \nCastor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard. Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop open. \nReflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He goes down -- in agony -- groaning. \nHe struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze. \nThe discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE... then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool. \nFinally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the phone and he dials. \nCASTOR Lars... okay, Lunt, then. (rifling desk documents) Something really fucked-up happened... I'm in trouble... so listen very carefully... \nEXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT (LATER) \nA RANGE ROVER SCREECHES up.  At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt manhandle Hoag into the lab. \nINT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT \nLars and Lunt hustle Hoag in.  The lab is on.  The screens run -- scrolling through the video log of Archer's surgery. \nHoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct tape. \nHOAG What's this about?  What do you want? \nLars shoves Hoag into a towering figure... we ZOOM IN ON Hoag's glasses.  And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see... \n", "test2_true": "Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle, cartilage and bone.  The man lifts a cigarette to his lips... then exhales. \nCASTOR What do you think I want? \nINT. PRISON - POPULATION - DAY \nA huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes.  Below -- the inmates engage in their exercise hour. \nVoisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully watches his \"brother\" play basketball.  Archer tosses up an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates. \nPOLLUX You realize, of course, that magnetic humming is designed to drive us insane.  If we all don't get brain tumors first. \nVOISINE And that same cloying Bambi tape -- over and over... \nPOLLUX It's like they're begging us to riot.  Where the fuck are we, anyway? (the game ends) Gotta go... \nPollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette. He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags. \nPOLLUX ... I'm worried about you. \nARCHER Why? \nPOLLUX Your jumpshot has no arc.  You used to swagger... now you swish. You're gumming that butt like a Catholic school girl. (notices) And why do you keep picking at your finger? \nPollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his phantom wedding ring.  Archer immediately stops.  He takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in Pollux's face. \nARCHER I was in a coma... \nPollux sticks his finger under Archer's eye and pulls down like a vet examining a sick dog.  Archer pushes him off. \nARCHER My reflexes, my senses, my memory... everything's jumbled.  I can't even tell you why Dubov jumped me yesterday. \nPOLLUX You Pollinated his wife the day he was arrested.  How could forget that? \nARCHER I've forgotten plenty.  Look around -- we've screwed over half the freaks in here.  What's gonna happen to us if they think I've lost it? \nPollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling, sizing up the brothers like hungry sharks.  Instinctively, Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection. \nARCHER I need you to play big brother for once -- till I can fill in a few blanks.  Think you can handle that? \nPollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve, exposing the pyramid tattoo. \nARCHER I know I got this on my tenth birthday.  I just can't remember why. \nPOLLUX Man -- that was the worst day of our lives! \nArcher feigns a \"struggle\" with his memory.  He lights a new butt with the old -- chain-style... then \"remembers.\" \nARCHER Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County General. \nPOLLUX Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution. (a beat) Remember what you swore to me at the funeral? \nARCHER Uh -- to kill the doctors? \nPOLLUX After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me. \nARCHER And I bet I kept that promise... \nPOLLUX Only one you've never broken. \nPollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort.  Archer puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the trap. \nARCHER Screw the past.  We've got the future to look forward to. (a beat) We still have tomorrow. \nPOLLUX No shit... five million bucks... now those Red Militia crackpots get to keep it. \nARCHER That's not the worst part. \nPOLLUX What's worse than losing five million bucks? \nARCHER Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  What you built was a work of art.  It belongs in the Smithsonian. \nPollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word. \nPOLLUX Yeah -- well... the L.A. Convention Center will have to do... \nARCHER Thanks, Pollux. \nPOLLUX 'Thanks'?  I guess they really did fuck you up. \nThen Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer.  Without knowing exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux. \nINT. ARCHER'S CELL - DAY \nArcher paces impatiently... as the door rolls open. Walton is looking at him with cool respect. \nWALTON You have a visitor. \nArcher smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's timeliness. \n", "test2_id": 70, "test3_input": "INT.

Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of -- \nJon Archer.  This man has Archer's face -- his real face. \nIMPOSTOR What's the matter?  Don't you like the new me? \nArcher studies the image of his former self -- trying to understand.  Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he cannot say... \nARCHER -- Castor...? \nCASTOR Not anymore. \nARCHER It can't be.  It's impossible. \nCASTOR I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was 'titanically remote'.  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all. (starts pacing) By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here. \nContinuing to circle, he displays the current LA Times: \n\"INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead\" \nCASTOR Terrible tragedy. Hoag was such a genius -- but selfish with his artistry.  I actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me. \nARCHER You killed them? \nCASTOR Of course I killed them, you dumb fuck.  Hoag, his staff... \nFLASH ON Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab. Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's. \nCASTOR Miller and Brodie -- \nFLASH ON Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car wreck. \nCASTOR I even paid a visit to your buddy Tito. \nARCHER He doesn't know anything about this! \nCASTOR Come on, Jon.  I think I know you better than that.  I only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face -- \nFLASH ON Tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up Archer's wedding band off the counter... \nINT. EREWHON PRISON (PRESENT) \nArcher stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now on Castor's finger. \nCASTOR -- then again, I guess you were there. (a beat) I torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are.  So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life. \nARCHER Castor, don't do this -- \nCASTOR No discussion, Jon -- no deals. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean 'make love to.' \nArcher freaks out.  He screams, flails -- unable to reach Castor.  Castor opens the door and guards rush in -- clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless. \nWALTON Sorry, sir. \nCASTOR It's quite all right.  You never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal... \nINT. CELL BLOCK - DAY \nThe guards dump Archer into his cell. \nWALTON Better be nice, Castor.  You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone. \nARCHER Pollux is -- what? \nWALTON Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence.  He's been released... \nARCHER Walton, you have to listen to me -- right now! \nWALTON Or what?  You'll have me fired? (pushes a button) You're confined until I say otherwise... \nThe steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading voice. \nINT. ARCHER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY \nSipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss: men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag. \nCASTOR (sickened) Jesus, what a life. \nCastor tries to catch a street address and rolls past... \nARCHER'S HOUSE \nDressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by. A moment later, it backs up and parks. \nHiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile -- and gets out.  She doesn't smile back. \nEVE I suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived. \n", "test3_true": "Castor looks her over -- she's much sexier than he expected. \nEVE So what happened to your 'important' assignment? \nCASTOR What do you know about it? \nEVE I know exactly what you always tell me:  Absolutely nothing. \nCASTOR It didn't work out the way everyone thought it would.  Where are you off to? \nEVE I've got surgery. \nCASTOR Surgery -- are you okay? \nThen he spots her medical bag.  Oops. \nEVE Don't try to charm me -- I'm still angry.  There're leftovers in the fridge. \nCASTOR Have fun at work. \nCastor kisses her good-bye -- on the mouth. \nEVE What is with you? \nCASTOR Don't I usually kiss my wife? \nEVE No. \nCastor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out. \nINT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY \nCastor steps inside, looks around. \nCASTOR What a dump. \nINT. STUDY - DAY \nCastor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past, studying the ones with photos.  He's memorizing -- matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, etc. \nSomething else catches his eye.  He finds a floral notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it.  Then, he reads: \nCASTOR '... \"Date-night\" has been a typical failure... we haven't made love in almost two months...' What a loser ... \nCastor hears a voice.  Glancing across the hall, he sees... \nGLIMPSES OF JAMIE \nAs she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped T-shirt. Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view. \nCASTOR The plot thickens. \nINT. JAMIE'S ROOM - DAY \nJamie stamps out her cigarette. \nJAMIE -- I got your E-mail, Karl.  That poem was really sweet -- (spots Castor at door) Hang on a sec... \nShe slams it -- but he gets his foot inside. \nJAMIE I'll call you back. (to Castor) You're not respecting my boundaries. \nCASTOR I'm coming in, Janie. \nCastor pushes menacingly into the room. \nJAMIE 'Janie'? \nCastor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow. He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps toward her. \nCASTOR I don't think you heard me... Jamie... You have something I want ... \nHe reaches for her -- and right past her.  He picks up a pack of cigarettes from the desk. \nJAMIE Clarissa left those here. \nCASTOR (shrugs and lights up) I won't tell mom if you don't. \nJAMIE When did you start smoking? \nCASTOR You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here -- (blows a perfect smoke ring) Daddy's a new man. \nJamie stares, astonished, as Castor goes out. \nINT.

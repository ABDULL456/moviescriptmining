EXT. PATH-NIGHT The moon reflects off the dark puddles of muddy water that line the side of the railway tracks. Anouar propels his board with astonishing agility along the path, Said and Poomina running with him. Max, Joan, carrying a first aid bag, Aloka and Hasari following, slipping and sliding on the rough ground with its puddles and sewage. 
EXT. RAILWAY LINE - LEPER HUTS - NIGHT The little procession arrives outside the three rough huts, made of bamboo, plastic sheeting, cloth, wood and cardboard. A few shadows materialize. Lepers -- staring silently. Anouar points into a hut. Joan and Aloka precede Max inside. Max forgets to bend and bumps his head. 
INT. HUT - NIGHT The only light is the feeble waver from a candle. The blind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground. Her ragged sari is pulled up to her middle. Her face runs with sweat, her hair is plastered to her face. A girl with black eyes is fanning her with a piece of wood. Meeta sends up a SOFT, uninterrupted MOAN. A wedge of blood-soaked cloth is between her legs. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A middle-age leper is leaning over her -- a midwife, encouraging Meeta with a string of commands in their own language. Max kneels, Aloka at his side.   His breathing becomes shallow... but then he pulls off  the blood-soaked bandages. Between Meeta's legs   he can just make out the bottom of a foot. The child   is breached. Maybe already dead. ALOKA Will she die? Max goes into reflex actions. Joan has opened the first aid kit. There's a flashlight among the medicine, alcohol, compresses, scissors, etc. He hands the flash- light to Aloka as... MAX (to Joan) Pull me two c.c.'s of Coramine. He nods at Aloka; she illuminates the scene. MAX Uh-oh, uh-oh, who's this coming' down the lane? Why it's -- is it possible -- way over here, in India -- yes, it's Mr. Choke. He comes to a stop. Everyone stares at him. Meeta moans. For a moment, he stays frozen. Aloka reaches out instinctively, wipes the sweat from his eyes. This gesture seems to free him; he looks at her, looks at the room and its expectant, trusting faces... 
MAX I'm going to have to turn it -- the baby. Tell her she has to relax these muscles as much as she can. He doesn't finish the sentence. Aloka speaks softly to Meeta as Max takes Meeta's arm, makes a tourniquet. Joan hands him the syringe and he injects. Hands the syringe back to Joan and begins to work at turning the baby. Aloka takes Meeta's hand and it's a moment before we realize Aloka, with her fine hand, is holding Meeta's fingerless palm. 
OUTSIDE A small group waits, trying to determine from the sounds what's happening inside. Anouar pours tea from a pot on the small fire, offers the cup to Hasari. Hasari stares at the cup, doesn't want to be impolite, but more than that, doesn't want to touch the cup. He shakes his head, smiles. Anouar drinks off the tea. 
INSIDE Sweat pours down Max's face into his eyes. He shakes it out. Aloka leans forward and, with her new sari, wipes the sweat away again. Max nods thanks. MAX Tell her again to breathe in short little bursts now. He demonstrates. Aloka does the same to Meeta. Meeta tries to cooperate. And suddenly Max has the baby turned. MAX All right!   Now, tell her to push. Aloka translates. Meeta pushes.      The midwife, the little girl, Aloka lean forward. MAX Again.   Yes!   Again.   It's coming. 
OUTSIDE No one is sitting now. Everyone hangs close to the door. Only Hasari remains apart, seated on a tree stump in the middle of the quad. He coughs; suppresses it. 
INSIDE MAX I've got the head. Come on, little baby, come on, little baby. Be alive, be alive, be alive. Aloka wipes the sweat away again. He looks at her, his voice squeezed out through his teeth. MAX We've got it, we've got it.     Yeah! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He seems as released as Meeta. Then he gives a last gentle tug and a CRY squeezes out of the little piece of life in his hands. Max is fairly overwhelmed by the life in his hands. Poomina steps close, a smile on her lovely face, and touches the baby in Max's hands. 
EXT. LANE - NIGHT Max, Joan, Aloka and Hasari walk in silence down Nizamudhin Lane. There is only the mingled  sound of COUGHING, MOANING, and a TRANSISTOR RADIO nearby playing a popular song. Outside the clinic, they  stop. She takes his hand. JOAN For a non-practicing doctor, that was pretty practiced. MAX Never been so scared in my life. It's a warm, open moment between them.   But now there's the ongoing desperation of her needs. JOAN Max, please, won't you change your mind? We desperately need another doctor. Full-time. Think about it -- just give us a couple of months. MAX Can't do it. Maybe you've got it in you to be a saint. I just don't.

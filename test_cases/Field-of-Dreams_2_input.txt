RAY No deal, Mark. We're staying. 
KARIN We don't have to go. 
MARK 
(EXPLODES) You're virtually bankrupt, and I'm offering you a way to keep your home because I love my sister! I've got partners who don't give a damn about you, and they're ready to foreclose right now! 
KARIN Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm. 
MARK Karin, please! 
RAY Wait. They all turn to Karin. 
KARIN People will come. 
RAY What people, sweetheart?

KARIN From all over. They'll just decide to take a vacation, see, and they'll come to Iowa City, and they'll think it's really boring, so they'll take a drive. And they'll drive down our road, and they'll see the lights and they'll think it's really pretty. Ray, Annie, and Mann listen with wonder, to this vision. 
KARIN So, the people in the cars? They'll drive up and they'll want to pay us, like buying a ticket. Mark looks at them all as if they're crazy. 
MARK You're not listening to this seriously, are you? 
ANNIE Yes. 
MARK Why would anybody pay money to come here? Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton. 
KARIN To watch the game. And it'll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago, and it was summertime, and they'll watch the game and .remember what it was like. Ray and Annie couldn't be prouder of their daughter than they are right now. 
MARK What the hell is she talking about? 
ANNIE She's talking about people seeing their memories... touching their past. 
RAY 
(NODS) People will come.

ANNIE It'll be like one of those tiny, French restaurants that have no sign. You find it by instinct. They'll be drawn. 
MARK Okay, this is all fascinating, but the fact remains that you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date, so you still have to sell. I'm sorry, but you have no choice. He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray looks at it. He doesn't know what to do. 
MANN Ray... Ray looks at Mann. 
138 MANN 
speaks now as he has not spoken for many years: as Terence Mann, master of words, spellbinder. 
MANN People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it, and arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past. 'Of course we won't mind if you look around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty dollars per person.' And they'll pass over the money without even looking at it. For it is money they have, and peace they lack. 
139 MARK 
pushes the papers. forward. 
MARK Just sign the papers, Ray. 
140 MANN 
is not one to give up.

MANN They'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening, or they'll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines -- wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes. They'll watch the game, and it will be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces. 
141 MASTER 
Spellbound, Ray has put the papers down. Mark picks them up again. He is battling Mann for Ray's attention. 
MARK Listen to me. Tomorrow morning, when the bank opens, they will foreclose. 
MANN People will come, Ray.

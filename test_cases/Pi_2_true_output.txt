Max stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat. He looks at the pills. Then he looks at Euclid around him. He throws the pills and the bottle to the floor. They fall to earth in SLOW MOTION. 
The room rushes in on Max and so does the pain. It throws him to the ground and he bashes his head against the floor. 
MAX (Courageously) No. No. I'm ready. I'm ready! Show me! 
Max recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The pain rips apart his voice. 
Max's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks Euclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his voice. 
MAX Three, seven, two... He smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool through the mainframe. 
Then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard covering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the entire window wide open. 
Sunlight floods the room and throws Max into the BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone. Everything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases from his brow and his shoulders sag. 
Max continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender and peaceful. As he starts to become part of the void, his voice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close. 
Then he hears Devi. 
DEVI (O.S.) Max. Max! Are you okay!? Oh my God, Max! 
Her voice reaches into the void. 
DEVI (O.S) Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe! Max looks toward her voice. 
DEVI (O.S.) Yes, Max. Listen to me... We cut back to ...THE MAIN ROOM where Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he continues to recite the number. 
DEVI Breathe, Max! Breathe. Focus. 
Max turns away from Devi and we return to the BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max continues to recite the number.

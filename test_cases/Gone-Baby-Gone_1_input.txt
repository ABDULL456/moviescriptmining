LIONEL Of what, drugs? 
HELENE Yeas, Lionel. 
BEATRICE What kind of drugs? 
HELENE Yay, ron. . . 
BEATRICE What does that mean? 
POOLE Cocaine and heroin. 
BEATRICE No, we would have seen the tract marks-- 
BRESSANT Not if you snort it, right sugar? 
HELENE Less addictive that way. 
Helene gets up and gets a beer. It's 10:15 am. 
INT. HELENE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The conversation has moved to the living room. The same participants, but the collection of EMPTY BEER CANS surrounding Helene suggest she's loosened up some. 
Patrick peers out the WINDOW to see the CIRCUS below (POV) 
BRESSANT I don't know Helene. I keep thinking about this thing I heard. You know where I'm going with this? 
HELENE No. 
BRESSANT Did you know I used to work DCU? 
HELENE I give a fuck. 
BRESSANT Right. So, I still know some of those guys real well. Anyway, I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run. You didn't hear that, did you? Angle on Patrick and Angie. 
HELENE No. 
BRESSANT Care to take a polygraph? 
HELENE 
(PROUDLY) Already passed. 
BRESSANT Different questions this time. 
POOLE How much you take, Helene? Nothing. Angle on Patrick. 
POOLE (CONT'D) It's all right. We don't care about hopheads beatin' each other. We care about your daughter. 
(GENTLY) Come on. How much? A beat. 
BRESSANT You want Amanda back or not? Silence in the room. 
BRESSANT (CONT'D) Do you give a fuck about your kid? Another beat. 
POOLE We know you took the money. How much did you take? 
BRESSANT rising, scary) How much? She takes a pull on her beer. Looks around. Fuck it. 
HELENE Ninety five. The room goes quiet. 
LIONEL Hundred? 
HELENE rolls her eyes) Thousand. 
BEATRICE Nintey five thousand dollars?! 
HELENE Yeas, Bea! 
BRESSANT Howrd you do it. She exhales a long thread of smoke. 
HELENE Two weeks ago me and Ray did a run up Nashua to drop four keys on some bikers. When we was walking back through the motel with the money, all these cops swooped in and went for the bikers. Amanda was with us so we pretended to be like a family and they went right past us. So we just-- got in the car and took off. 
BEATRICE You took Amanda with you? 
HELENE What am I gonna do? Leave her in the car, Bea? 
BEATRICE (shakes head, plainly) You are an abomination. God as my witness. 
HELENE 
(GETS 'EMOTIONALR) You know what, Bea? It's hard bein' a mother. It's hard raisinf children. (beat, pointedly) And if God made you barren then you can' t judge me. 'Cause you wouldnrt fuckin' know. By Bears silence, and the narrowing of her eyes, we presume this to be a low blow and that Bea can't have children. 
BRESSANT Hey. (snaps fingers at Helene) Right here. What happened? 
Helene takes a pull from her beer. 
HELENE When we was driving back. Ray's like, 'everyone's gonna think the cops got the money too.' 
BRESSANT You told Cheese the cops got it? 
PATRICK But you and Ray kept the money? 
HELENE This whole fuckin' thing is Ray' s fault. Reactions to this realization.

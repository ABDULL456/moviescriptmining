{"train": "THE CIDER HOUSE RULES \nWritten by \nJohn Irving \nProduction Draft \nFADE IN. BEGIN TITLE SEQUENCE. \nEXT. ST CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAWN \nAn establishing shot of the rundown train station on an overcast morning. There's snow on the station platform. A train arrives and departs. \nLARCH (V.O.) In other parts of the world, young men of promise leave home to make their fortunes, battle evil, or solve the problems of the world. \nBehind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St. Cloud's orphanage. \nLARCH (V.O.) I was myself such a young man, when I came to save the orphanage in St. Cloud's... many years ago. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING \nA man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main entrance of the large brick building. \nLARCH (V.O.) Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to understand that promises are rarely kept, that the battle isn't so much against evil as ignorance, and that being successful can't hold a candle to being of *use*. \nThe couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of babies. \nLARCH (V.O.) Nor have I solved the problem I came here to solve. \nINT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING \nTwo nurses, EDNA and ANGELA, chase CHILDREN--a morning routine. \nLARCH (V.O.) Even in the most enlightened times, unwanted babies will manage to be born. That there will always be orphans is simple not a problem to be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we don't regard the sordid facts of life as problems. \nThe camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids. \nINT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY \nWe enter an office where DR. LARCH shows couple #1 their newly adopted son, HOMER, an infant who lies smiling in Dr. Larch's arms. \nLARCH (V.O.) In truth, we've only had one real problem. \nWe close in on the infant until his face fills the screen. \nLARCH (V.O.) His name was Homer Wells. \nDr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents. \nLARCH I named him after the Greek writer. You know Homer, of course? \nHesitant nods. (They don't look as if they read.) \nLARCH I made his name \"Wells\" because I could tell he was very deep. \nThe parents look with pride at their adopted son. \nLARCH (V.O.) In truth, Nurse Angela named him-- her father *drilled* wells, and \"Homer\" was one of her family's umpteen cats. \nINT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY \nAt the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good- bye to Homer, they close the door. \nINT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nThe same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as Nurse Edna lets them in. \nINT. BOY'S DIVISION, DOORWAY - NIGHT \nLarch is delivering his benediction to the boys. \nLARCH \"Good night, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England!\" \nAs he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple #1 and baby Homer. \nADOPTING MOTHER There's something wrong with him! He never makes a sound. \nLarch looks quickly at Homer. \nLARCH (V.O.) He didn't cry enough for them, if you can believe it. \nADOPTING FATHER Do you think we could have a look at someone a little different? \nThe mother hands over the baby to Larch. Baby Homer lets out a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms. The parents stare in disbelief. \nLARCH (V.O.) Thus was Homer Wells returned. He was too happy a baby. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY \nAngela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and watches the family head down the hill. \nHomer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a moment. Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nHomer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor. \nHOMER Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch! \nINT. DISPENSARY - DAY \nLarch wakes up; he shakes off the ether haze. Homer reenters. \nHOMER We've got two new patients, one to deliver. \nDr. Larch and Homer leave together. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe *two* doctors walk briskly down the hall, a couple of professionals. \nLARCH First pregnancy? \nHOMER Yes, for both. \nLARCH (sarcastically) I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery. \nHOMER (tiredly; an old topic) All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them. \nLARCH You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else? \nHOMER One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me. \nLARCH What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use. \nHomer and Larch split off and disappear into two different operating rooms. As he goes, Homer mumbles to himself, \"Of use, of use, of use.\" \nINT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY \nLarch and Angela are preparing the ether for DOROTHY, a not visibly pregnant woman. The sounds of labor across the hall can be heard Over. \nLARCH (holds the cone) Have you ever had ether, Dorothy? \nDOROTHY Once, when they took out my appendix. \nANGELA (looks for scar) No one's touched your appendix. \nDOROTHY Whatever it was... the ether made me sick. \nLARCH It won't make you sick this time, Dorothy--not the way I do it, just a drop at a time. \nDOROTHY I can't pay for this, you know--I got no money. \nLARCH One day, Dorothy, if you have any money, a donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated. \nANGELA Only if you can afford it. \nLARCH (holds the ether bottle) Try to think of nothing, Dorothy. \nAngela puts the cone over Dorothy's mouth and nose; Larch drips the ether on the cone. A newborn wails in the other O.R. Over. \nINT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY \nHomer has delivered CARLA. A newborn baby is screaming in Edna's arms. Homer is attending to Carla, who is panting. \nHOMER That was good, Carla--that was *perfect*. Everything's fine. \nCARLA I don't wanna see it! \nEDNA You don't have to see it, dear. Don't worry. \nCARLA I don't even wanna know what sex it is--don't tell me! \nHOMER We won't tell you, Carla. You're going to be okay. \nEDNA Your *baby's* going to be okay, too. \nCARLA I don't wanna know! \nLarch pops into the delivery room; he peers at the baby. \nLARCH He's a big boy! \nCARLA Let me see him, for Christ's sake--I wanna see him. \nEdna shows the baby to Carla, who stares, then turns away. Larch whispers to Homer. \nLARCH Would you mind having a look at Dorothy? \nINT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY \nAngela sits with the still-etherized Dorothy while Larch and Homer confer over a basin containing Dorothy's uterus. \nLarch plucks Fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips him into the breathing tent. Fuzzy smiles. As larch leaves, MARY AGNES, a pretty but tough-looking teenager, comes into the dispensary. \nHOMER What is it, Mary Agnes? \nMary Agnes smiles at Homer; then she sticks her tongue out at him. Homer looks at her impassively, but as the moment continues his expression suggests his annoyance. Fuzzy starts to cough; he wheezes as he breathes. Homer leans down; he peers at Fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent. \nMARY AGNES (garbled because of her tongue) Look! \nHomer examines Mary Agnes' tongue. \nHOMER Did you bite it? \nMARY AGNES I don't remember. \nHOMER (dismissively) It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right. \nMARY AGNES Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me. \nHOMER (looks at her tongue again) No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep. \nMARY AGNES I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone. \nHomer is not responding to her come-on. He wheels Fuzzy into the hall. \nHOMER Story time, Fuzzy! \nINT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nIn the girls' bunk room, Nurse Edna is saying prayers. The girls lie with their palms pressed together on their chests. \nEDNA \"Oh Lord, support us all the day long...\" \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - NIGHT \nThe building of St. Cloud's is silhouetted against the sky. Carla, the woman we saw deliver the baby, is heading down the hill alone, she sobs, not looking back. \nEDNA (O.S.) \"...until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done.\" \nINT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nIn the bunk room again, with Edna and the girls. \nEDNA \"Then in Thy mercy grant us save lodging, and holy rest, and peace at the last.\" \nALL THE GIRLS Amen! Amen! Amen! \nINT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nDr. Larch is reading from Oliver Twist--the death scene of Bill Sike's dog. The boys listen in horror in their beds. \nLARCH \"A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders.\" \nHomer enters; he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner of the room, where he starts to undress. \nLARCH \"Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed his brains out. \nLarch turns out the lights. From the open doorway to the hall, Larch delivers his nightly benediction. \nLARCH Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England! \nLarch closes the door, leaving them in the semi-darkness. One young boy runs into Homer's bed, nervously giggling. \nFUZZY (in his breathing tent) Why does Dr. Larch *do* tht every night? \nCURLY (about seven) Maybe to scare us... \nCOPPERFIELD (about eleven) No, you jerk. \nSTEERFORTH (about nine) Dr. Larch *loves* us! \nFUZZY But why does he do *that*? \nBUSTER He does it because we like it. \nThe boys silently agree, Homer among them. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - EARLY MORNING \nThe girls, led by Mary Agnes, round a corner of the orphanage, towing a sled piled high with snowballs. \nMARY AGNES Buster is mine. You two get Copperfield and Curly. Nobody touches Fuzzy. \nThey shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. Buster throws two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and CLARA (eight or nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks his head in the snow. Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes, escapes. Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to the ground. Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of the orphanage. \nEDNA Stop it! No fighting! *Share* the snowballs! \nBUSTER (mouth full of snow) They're *our* snowballs! They *stole* them! \nMARY AGNES They attacked us--just like the Japs! \nFuzzy coughs and wheezes, trying to catch his breath. \nHomer sees Curly standing all alone by a window in the corridor; a suitcase is next to him. \nHOMER Hi, Curly. You going somewhere? \nCurly shakes his head. \nCURLY I thought they might take me. \nHOMER They wanted a girl. \nCURLY Nobody ever wants me! \nHomer embraces Curly and lifts him up, he grabs the suitcase and continues down the corridor. \nHOMER You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you. \nCURLY Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us! \nHOMER That's true. \nCURLY Nobody's asked for me, have they? \nHOMER Nobody special enough, Curly. \nCURLY You mean somebody asked? \nHOMER Only the right people can have you, Curly. \nHomer disappears into the boys' bunk room carrying Curly and his suitcase, leaving the corridor empty. \nINT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY \nFaces in the windows; the orphans watch Hazel walking across the snowy lawn with her new parents. \nINT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nEdna (with the girls) gives her good-bye blessing to Hazel. \nEDNA Let us be happy for Hazel. Hazel has found a family. Good night, Hazel. \nTHE GIRLS Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel! \nINT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY \nThe front door opens. The orphans excitedly run outside onto the green lawn, into the warm weather of spring. \nINT. DISPENSARY - MORNING \nAngela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a more romantic song then before, which rouses Larch from his ether. He is grumpy, but she sings the song in his ear and won't give him back the ether cone; he rolls away from her, but she tickles him and bites his ear, coaxing him into a more playful mood. \nLARCH I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were! \nANGELA You weren't dreaming about me. \nLARCH I was! \nPlayfully, she slips out of his embrace. \nANGELA Then I wasn't beautiful. \nLARCH You were! You *are*! It was fantastic. \nANGELA It was just the ether, Wilbur... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nHomer wheels a tray with glasses of water between the beds. A DISTRAUGHT PREGNANT WOMAN stops him by her bed. \nHOMER Are you okay? Can I get you anything? \nDISTRAUGHT WOMAN No one but me ever put a hand on me, to feel that baby. Don't you want to touch it or put your ear down to it? \nHOMER Okay. \nHomer touches the woman's belly. \nDISTRAUGHT WOMAN Put your ear there. Go on. \nHomer cautiously lays his ear against her belly. \nDISTRAUGHT WOMAN You shouldn't have a baby if there's no one who wants to put his face right there! \nShe holds Homer's head against her belly; she presses his face into her. She shuts her eyes. Homer's eyes stare widely. Dr. Larch stops in the doorway; he watches with concern. \nDISTRAUGHT WOMAN Stay right there. Right where you are. Stay right here. Right here. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAY \nHomer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks. Buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock. \nBUSTER Do you ever think about leaving this place to go find them? \nHomer shifts his weight to the other foot; aggravated; he stands there. \nHOMER She's a patient, right? She should see a doctor. \nHomer and Larch stare at each other. \nLARCH (trying to stay calm) Homer, you are a skilled and gifted surgeon. You have near-prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure. \nHomer is also trying to avoid a fight. \nHOMER I just mean I'd rather fix the movie. Tonight. \nLarch can't hide his disappointment. \nLARCH Sure. Okay. You splice. I'll deliver. \nIt is an uneasy peace. \nINT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT (LATER) \nHomer is adjusting Fuzzy's breathing tent as the other boys climb into bed. \nFUZZY Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*? \nHOMER Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right. \nFUZZY That's why Kong loves her! \nLarch comes in and walks over to Homer and Fuzzy. Larch and Homer exchange a look. \nHOMER I thought it was my turn. \nLARCH It is. I'll get this. You go ahead. \nHomer sits down with 'David Copperfield.' There is quiet anticipation while Homer readies himself to read. \nHOMER (reading) \"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.\" \nLarch continues to adjust Fuzzy's breathing tent. \nHOMER \"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it.\" \nFUZZY (whispers to Larch) His father's dead, right? \nLARCH (whispering back) That's right, Fuzz. \nClose on Fuzzy. \nHOMER (O.S.) (continues reading) \"There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me...\" \nAs Larch bends over Fuzzy to fix the breathing apparatus, Fuzzy whispers. \nFUZZY Is *your* father dead? \nLARCH (nods, whispers) Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver. \nFUZZY *Liver* killed him? \nLARCH *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death. \nFUZZY But did you know him? \nLARCH Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him. \nFUZZY Did you know your mother better? \nLARCH (nods, still whispers) She's dead now, too. She was a nanny. \nFUZZY What's a nanny do? \nLARCH She looks after other people's children. \nFUZZY Did you grow up around here? \nLARCH No. She was an immigrant. \nFUZZY What's an immigrant? \nLARCH Someone not from Maine. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - NIGHT \nThe orphanage in moonlight. Not a sound. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - MORNING \nThe children are chasing a ball near the incinerator. \nA VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is lying next to the incinerator. \nEdna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear. \nWALLY (to Homer) I never said they were boring. \nCANDY You said, \"Apples aren't exactly flying.\" \nWALLY Well, they aren't. \nHomer looks back at Candy. Her eyes close. \nHOMER I think I'd probably like the apple business. \nWALLY You're a little overqualified, aren't you? \nHOMER No, I'm not. I need a job. \nWALLY The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring. \nCandy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little. \nCANDY There! You said it was boring. \nWALLY Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking! \nCandy seems irritated with Wally. Homer tries to engage her. \nHOMER Is your family in the apple business, too? \nCANDY No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. \nHOMER I've never seen a lobster. \nCANDY Really? \nHOMER I've never seen the ocean, either. \nWALLY (amazed) You've never seen the *ocean*? \nHomer shakes his head, smiles. \nWALLY That's not funny... that's *serious*. \nEXT./INT. ROADSIDE/CAR - NIGHT \nThe car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half- hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob. \nCANDY I couldn't have a baby with someone who's leaving me--I didn't know what else to do! \nHomer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions. \nHOMER I know. \nCANDY He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him! \nHOMER Where's Mandalay? \nCANDY Burma! \nHOMER Oh... \nCANDY I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! \nHOMER I understand. \nHe doesn't, really. Wally returns. Wally leans over Candy to hug her. \nWALLY Honey, honey... of course I'll come back. \nCandy pounds on his chest with her fists. \nCANDY You don't *know*, Wally. You have no *idea*! \nWally backs away. Candy sobs uncontrollably. \nCANDY Stay away from me! \nWally signals to Homer to get out of the car. \nLater, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously. \nHOMER (strictly medical) This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time. \nWALLY I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*! \nHOMER It's all very normal. \nWally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his cigarette. \nWALLY You ought to cut that shit out--it's terrible for you. \nHomer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes. Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot. \nThey notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy asleep in the backseat. \nWally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes. \nOLIVE How do you do, Homer Wells... \nHomer has never met anyone like her. \nHOMER How do you do... \nMrs. Worthington starts picking up her son's uniform from the floor. She is politely curious about Homer. \nOLIVE Were you a friend of the bride or the groom? \nHomer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the alleged wedding. Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him into the hall. \nWALLY Homer is everybody's friend, Mom... the bride's, the groom's, mine, Candy's, *everybody's*. \nHomer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered. \nOLIVE Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner, Homer... \nWally calls to her as he pushes Homer down the hall. \nWALLY Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet *Mr. Rose*! \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - DUSK \nHomer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line after line of trees--the apple orchards. \nHomer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself. \nJACK You already used up the hot water! \nMUDDY You're usin' my soap, ain't you? \nJACK I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold to bother with soap! \nMUDDY There ain't never enough hot water, soap or no soap. \nWALLY They're migrants. \nHOMER (no clue) Migrants? \nWALLY Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons. (leaning close to Homer) The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss. \nHomer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting Homer and Wally. \nROSE ROSE That sink's backed up again, Wally. I thought you was gonna get me a plumber. \nWALLY Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose. \nHOMER Rose Rose? \nROSE ROSE Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber? \nWALLY No, no--Homer is a new *picker*. He's going to stay here with you. \nThis gets the attention of the men on their way from the showers. They walk over, towels around their waists. \nROSE ROSE (suspiciously) He's stayin' *here*? \nThe screen door swings open and shut again, startling them all, as MR. ROSE comes out of the cider house. \nMR. ROSE That daughter of mine sure is Miss Hospitality, ain't she, Wally? \nGrinning, Mr. Rose shakes Wally's hand. Rose Rose goes back inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer introduces himself. \nMR. ROSE You got lots of experience pickin', I suppose. \nWALLY Homer's got no experience, Arthur, but he's smarter then I am. He's a fast learner. \nMr. Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction. \nMR. ROSE This is history. Ain't that what you're sayin', Wally? I guess we makin' *history*... havin' this young man stay with us! \nWally slaps Homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house to help Rose Rose with the plumbing. \nWALLY (over his shoulder) See you later. \nHomer looks at Mr. Rose for instructions. Mr. Rose stares back at him with his enigmatic smile. \nHOMER So. What should I do now? \nMR. ROSE Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there. \nHomer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression. \nMR. ROSE If you're as smart as Wally says, you know you sometimes gotta do one job before you do another. \nHomer thinks that over. \nLater, Homer is cleaning out the shed. \nAll the smokers laugh and cough in their beds. \nMR. ROSE (uncharacteristically blunt) Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them. \nHOMER Okay... \nRose Rose stomps back to her bed. Her father absently snaps his towel. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) \nEverybody is asleep, except Homer. He is staring at the ceiling in the quiet semi-darkness, the book lying on his chest. \nLARCH (O.S.) (distant echoing) Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England. \nINT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nDr. Larch is standing in the doorway to the boys' room; he closes the door. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nHomer, on his bed, closes his eyes. \nINT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nLarch lies in bed with his eyes open. (No ether.) \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe cider house and the apple orchard in the moonlight. \nEXT. ORCHARDS - MORNING \nWally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with Homer in the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life. \nWALLY Remember this! In the morning, when the tall grass is wet, you can make the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you feel it? \nHomer is excited as Wally weaves among the trees--faster and faster. \nWALLY It's almost like flying. \nHOMER What about the trees? \nWALLY The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground. \nWally brakes hard. The Jeep comes to a stop in the packing- house area. \nCandy has been waiting on the loading platform. The pickers are working in the background. \nWALLY (defensively to Candy) I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson. \nCANDY (good-naturedly) I know what you've been doing. \nShe pulls an apple branch, with an apple to two, out of the vehicle's grille--or else the branch is wedged in the front - bumper or headlight area. Candy playfully starts poking Wally with the branch. \nCANDY (to Wally) You've been giving him a *flying* lesson! \nWALLY (teasing her) He *loved* it! (to Homer) Didn't you? \nHOMER Yeah, it was great. \nWally gets the apple branch away from Candy. He pins her arms at her sides--he hugs her, kisses her. She doesn't struggle. \nCANDY (laughing to Homer) He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches. \nWALLY *Homer* liked it! (to Homer) Didn't you? \nHOMER Yeah, sure. There's no stress or strain around here... \nThey all laugh. Homer observes the happy couple. \nEXT. ORCHARDS - DAY \nHomer is walking with Wally and Candy. The orchards are beautiful. \nEXT. PACKING HOUSE - MORNING \nMuch activity: the pickers are unloading apple crates from a full flatbed trailer. An angry-looking VERNON gives Homer an evil glare. Homer spills some apples lifting the crate to the loading platform. \nVERNON What's wrong with you? \nMr. Rose takes Homer aside. \nMR. ROSE That's Vernon. You best stay away from him until he gets to know you better--then you best stay away from him *more*! \nWally, in full uniform, appears from inside the packing house; he calls for Homer. \nMR. ROSE Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer. Mind your ass. \nHomer smiles are runs toward Wally. \nINT./EXT. PACKING HOUSE - MORNING \nEDNA Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922? \nLARCH \"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939.\" \nANGELA This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates! \nLARCH \"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care...\" \nANGELA You *invented* him! You've completely made his up! \nLARCH Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the \"new blood\" is *for*! \nEDNA You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions. \nLARCH (sarcastically) Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law. \nANGELA These *credentials* are against the law! \nLARCH We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here? \nEdna and Angela think this over. \nLARCH (points at file) So here is my candidate. What do you think? \nEDNA But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*... \nLarch turns the easel around. Attached is a parchment headed: \"HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL\"--it's a diploma-in-progress. \nLARCH He *will* have them, Edna. \nThe women are shocked, awed. \nANGELA Oh, Wilbur, I don't know... (sudden thought) We don't even know where he is! \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - NIGHT \nROSE ROSE (O.S.) Where's that Homer? \nHomer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the cider house; he starts to climb up, drawn by the murmuring voices, the soft laughter. \nJACK (O.S.) Who cares? \nMR. ROSE (O.S.) Now, now. He's a good boy. \nJACK (O.S.) Shit. We don't know what he is. \nMR. ROSE (O.S.) Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter. \nHomer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long plank, a bench attached to the apex of the roof--obviously a popular spot. \nMR. ROSE Here he is. \nNo one moves. \nMR. ROSE Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view. \nMUDDY What view? \nPeaches slides over and Homer sits down. \nHOMER Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said... \nMR. ROSE Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong. \nThe others laugh. \nMUDDY *What* view? \nMR. ROSE Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about. \nMore laughter; Homer smiles, enjoying the teasing. \nJACK (gesturing toward the Worthington farmhouse) I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'. \nMR. ROSE You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight. \nROSE ROSE (playfully, teasing him) Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night. \nMR. ROSE (teasing her back) You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl... \nROSE ROSE What's lucky about that? \nRose Rose is being physically affectionate with her father-- lightly punching his arm, rubbing the top of his head. \nMR. ROSE You know where that Wally is tonight, darlin'? He's up there in them angry stars. (gesturing at the dark sky) He's flyin' all around up there... with them Japs shooting at him. \nThey all look up, imagining that. Homer more than the others. Rose Rose, looking thoughtful, rests her head on her father's shoulder. They are completely natural together. \nEXT. CAPE KENNETH - APPLE MART - DAY \nHomer and the pickers are loading crates of apples into a shipping truck. Olive and Candy are consulting some papers (the shipping tally) on a clipboard; Mr. Rose is standing beside them. \nDR. HOLTZ But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally qualified... \nLARCH I'm not talking about his medical qualifications. It's the *Christian* thing that bothers me--I just don't see it being of much *use* around here. \nMRS. GOODHALL (bitterly) I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here! \nLARCH Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested. \nDR. HOLTZ We're *very* interested! \nMRS. GOODHALL Yes, *very*! \nDR. HOLTZ You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him? \nLARCH I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again? \nANGELA Dr. Homer Wells. \nLARCH (mumbling) I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time. \nThe three elderly gentlemen repeat the name. \nMRS. GOODHALL It's a nice name, very New England. \nDR. HOLTZ Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding name. \nEDNA *Very*! \nINT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nA song plays on the old phonograph as a happy Larch and Angela dance. Edna interrupts them. \nEDNA I just wanted to ask you... \nLARCH Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight. \nEDNA Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back? \nThis causes Larch to take the needle off the record. \nLARCH (angrily) He's a field hand! What could possibly hold him there? \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - RAINY DAY \nThe rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr. Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room. \nINT. MILL ROOM - RAINY DAY \nMr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable; only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice. \nMR. ROSE Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts... \nHOMER What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms. \nMR. ROSE Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you! \nEveryone but Jack laughs. He takes a last drag on his cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat. \nMR. ROSE That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right. \nJACK Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there! \nMR. ROSE It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'. \nJACK You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette! \nMR. ROSE What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is... \nJack looks for a translation from the other men, who are nervous. \nMUDDY Just say you're in the *apple* business, man. That's the only business you wanna be in. Just say it. \nJack pulls a knife on Mr. Rose. \nPEACHES (whispers excitedly to Jack) You don't wanna go in the knife business with Mistuh Rose--just say you're in the *apple* business, Jack! \nJACK (to Mr. Rose) What business are *you* in? \nWe never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed. \nMR. ROSE I'm in the *knife* business, Jack. You don't wanna go in the knife business with me. \nMuddy turns Jack around and views his slashed clothes. \nMUDDY You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man. \nPEACHES The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*... \nMUDDY Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed. \nJack starts to undress for the vat. \nCANDY You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie. \nHOMER (teasing her) That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie. \nCANDY Not with the right girl you wouldn't. \nHomer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks afraid to breathe. \nFrom behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. Suddenly the movie \"King Kong\" appears. \nINT. DINING HALL - NIGHT \n\"King Kong\" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; his eyes are closed. \nLARCH Fuzzy? Fuzzy? \nThey are alone in the dining hall. Larch has wheeled in Fuzzy for a private viewing. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - MORNING \nBuster helps Larch lower the small coffin into the grave. The tiny gravestone says \"F.S.\" \nBUSTER What are you going to tell the little ones? \nLARCH I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted. \nBUSTER Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him? \nLARCH They'll believe it because they want to believe it. \nBUSTER Shouldn't we tell Homer? \nLARCH If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us. \nINT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nThe boys in their beds listen to Buster inventing Fuzzy's \"family.\" \nBUSTER It was a family with a better breathing machine then the one Dr. Larch built. \nINT. ST. CLOUD'S - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nLarch leans against the wall, covering his eyes, overhearing the boys. \nBUSTER (O.S.) The family that adopted Fuzzy, they *invented* the breathing machine. It's their business... breathing machines. \nLarch pauses; he waits to see if they believe this. \nCURLY (O.S.) Lucky Fuzzy! \nLarch almost breaks with a sudden sharp breath. \nALL THE BOYS (O.S.) Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy Stone! \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - MORNING \nAs the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the \"Good mornin', Mrs. Worthin'ton!\" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to Homer. \nOLIVE Some mail for you, Homer. \nHomer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the table, unopened. Olive turns to Rose Rose. \nOLIVE And some clothes for you, dear-- (nodding to the cider house) let's go see if they fit. \nMr. Rose watches Rose Rose and Olive disappear into the cider house. The other men view Homer's package with curiosity, especially Peaches. \nPEACHES Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer? \nMR. ROSE Mind your own business, Peaches. \nPEACHES Sorry, Homer... \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT \nHomer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep. Homer pulls the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough to see what it is; then he shoves it back under his bed. \nEXT. OCEAN/BEACH - DUSK \nThe beach at sunset. Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler weather, are alone at the water's edge. From a paper bag, Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of broken glass. \nHOMER Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet? \nCANDY Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges. \nShe finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells at the high-tide mark. \nCANDY See? That's last year's glass, or from some year before. I put glass here every year. The ocean makes it beautiful. \nCandy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade of green. \nCANDY Give me your hand. \nOLIVE Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over. \nThey both laugh, but Homer has a hard time looking her in the eye. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY \nThe pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't hear their conversation. Rose Rose and the other men walk past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck. Olive and Homer walk over to the truck. \nOLIVE Good-bye. Have a safe trip home. Thank you, again, for all your hard work. \nMR. ROSE You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton. \nThey shake hands. \nOLIVE Good-bye, Arthur. (she hugs Rose Rose) Homer, I'll see you tomorrow? \nHOMER Right. \nOlive gets in her Jeep and waves as she drives off. \nThe truck is packed. Muddy tugs on a rope that secures the load. \nMUDDY (to Mr. Rose) We all set, I think. \nMr. Rose nods and gets in behind the wheel. Rose Rose and Muddy get in next to him. The others are bundled up for the ride in the open back of the truck. \nAs they're leaving, Homer waves good-bye--the pickers calling out to him. \nMR. ROSE You all take care of yourself, too, Homer! \nPEACHES We see you next harvest. \nMUDDY Don't freeze to death, Homer. \nJACK Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer. \nMR. ROSE Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right. \nROSE ROSE You just stay out of trouble, Homer! \nHomer stands looking after them, after they're gone. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - LATER THAT SAME DAY \nHomer is alone, rearranging his stuff--spreading out a bit, making the place his own. (On the other beds, we see the mattresses rolled up on the bare bedsprings.) \nCANDY (O.S.) So, you're staying. \nHomer turns; he hadn't seen Candy come in. \nCANDY Olive told me. (awkward pause) You might have told me yourself. \nHOMER I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said. \nShe smiles. He goes to her; they embrace. \nBEGINNING A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT NINE OR TEN MONTHS. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE ROOF - MORNING \nHomer, drinking coffee, is writing a letter on a note pad. \nHOMER (V.O.) Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your doctor's bag... \nEXT. RAY'S LOBSTER BOAT - DAY \nHomer is learning how to \"haul\" a lobster pot with Ray and Candy's guidance. \nHOMER (V.O.) ...although it seems that I will not have the occasion to use it. \nEXT. LOBSTER POUND, FLOATING PENS - EVENING \nFollowing Ray's example, Homer is trying to \"disarm\" the lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little wooden wedges. Roy works quickly, never getting pinched. As Candy watches, Homer gets pinched. \nHOMER (V.O.) Barring some emergency, of course. I am not a doctor. With all due respect to your profession. I am enjoying my life here. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nHomer and Candy are naked. They have pulled two beds together and made a double bed. He can't take his eyes off her. \nHOMER I've looked at so many women... I mean, I've seen *everything* about them, *everything*... but I never felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now... with you... it *hurts*... to look at you. \nINT. DISPENSARY - DAY \nEdna and Angela and Larch are all reading Homer's letter, their lips moving silently as they read the words. \nHOMER (V.O.) I am enjoying being a lobsterman and an orchardman--in fact, I have never enjoyed myself so much. \nINT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, FIREPLACE - NIGHT \nOlive and Homer and Candy are playing a board game around the fireplace. \nMUDDY It's that Candy, too... \nThen comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of which has been stepped on. \nMR. ROSE Don't this place look like home? \nPEACHES It look nicer then home! \nMR. ROSE What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice? \nRose Rose enters. She looks hardened, toughened--not happy. She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy. \nROSE ROSE How is that Wally doing? \nCANDY Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places... \nHomer tries to help out. \nHOMER (mumbling) ...bridges, oil refineries, fuel depots... \nHe peters out, knowing how sick of hearing this Candy is. He tries to change the subject. \nHOMER Where's Jack? \nThere is an uncomfortable silence. \nMUDDY He just wasn't up for the trip. \nMore silence. \nMR. ROSE That Jack just never knew what his business was. \nOne look at Muddy and we know something pretty bad happened to Jack. \nEXT. ORCHARDS - DAY \nThe pickers on their ladders, all picking. Homer is now a good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose. She is slumped against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (Mr. Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked.) \nMR. ROSE You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that. \nPEACHES They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree! \nMR. ROSE Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider. \nEXT. ORCHARDS - DUSK \nIn the aisle between the trees, Homer and Candy are arguing in one of the work vehicles. \nCANDY Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? \nHOMER So we should \"wait and see.\" For how long? \nCANDY I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him. \nHOMER Fine. That's all there is to it then. \nCANDY No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do. \nHOMER Okay, okay--I know you do, too. \nCANDY (bitterly) It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it? \nHer sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their separate ways. Candy drives on. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - SUNNY MORNING \nBreakfast time at the picnic table. Rose Rose by herself, away from the table. She does not look well; she suddenly goes back inside the bunkhouse. \nPEACHES (calling after her) Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose? (to the men) She used to eat with us. Now we ain't good enough for her, I guess. \nHERO She ain't hungry, maybe. \nMUDDY She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause she's sick every mornin'. \nHomer gets up to take his dishes inside. \nINT. KITCHEN AND BUNKHOUSE - MORNING \nWhen Homer comes in, Rose Rose is throwing up in the sink. \nHOMER You okay, Rose? \nROSE ROSE I guess you must like watchin' me be sick... \nHOMER I don't like watching anyone be sick. \nRose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. There is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. He sits on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance that she doesn't protest. \nHOMER How many months are you? \nShe just stares. But she doesn't stop him when he touches her abdomen. It's as if she knows that he knows what he's doing. \nRose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table. Her voice turns bitter, despairing. \nROSE ROSE It sure ain't Jack. \nThere, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is uncharacteristically tentative. \nMR. ROSE (to his daughter) I'll be up top... \nMr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking at Candy with an ashamed expression. \nEXT. ORCHARD - DAY \nThe pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs down the aisle between two rows of trees. She stops at the bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath. Muddy and Peaches and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening. \nCANDY She won't go to St. Cloud's! \nHOMER (shrugging) Well, we can't force her. It's her decision. \nCANDY You don't understand! It's her father... \nHOMER Mr. Rose *knows*? \nCANDY (shouting) He's the *father*! He's her baby's father! \nThe pickers can't help but hear this, too. Candy starts to leave, Homer running after her. \nHOMER Wait... *wait*! Are you sure? \nCANDY We've got to keep her away from that bastard! \nCandy leaves. Homer starts looking for Mr. Rose. \nEXT. ORCHARD, NEAR CIDER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nSmiling his enigmatic smile, Mr. Rose keeps slowly picking while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder. \nMR. ROSE I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today! \nHOMER Is it true? \nMr. Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around. \nHOMER Are you sleeping with your own daughter? \nMr. Rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder. \nMR. ROSE (slyly; still composed) I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer. \nHOMER You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible? \nMR. ROSE Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows. \nHOMER You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter! \nMr. Rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second. \nMR. ROSE Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right? \nHOMER Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes. \nMr. Rose is indignant. \nMR. ROSE You a fine one to be talkin' about lies. Shame! These people took you in. That boy Wally's at *war*! \nThat takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority. \nHOMER But she's your *daughter*... \nMR. ROSE And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do! (looks away) I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that. \nHomer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away. \nHOMER She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*? \nBy his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*. \nThe other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is sleeping with his daughter. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - PICNIC AREA - LUNCHTIME \nRose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins. \nEXT. ORCHARD - DAY \nHomer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder on the other side of the same tree. \nMUDDY Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you. \nHOMER How long's this been going on, Muddy? \nMUDDY Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it. \nHomer tries to cuddle closer, but Candy sits up, preoccupied. \nHOMER Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do. \nCANDY Nothing. \nHOMER Isn't that like waiting and seeing? \nCANDY No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too. \nHOMER I know. (he kisses her) Is *that* nothing. \nCANDY No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. (Homer's sad smile) Don't even look at me. I want... \nCandy buries her face in his chest. \nCANDY ...to do nothing. \nHomer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. As her crying subsides, Homer's thoughts are far away. With Candy slumped against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead, he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, Candy's words resonating. An unfamiliar expression is on his face. \nHOMER (mumbling to himself) It's a tempting idea, I know... to do nothing. \nCandy is silent. Homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts his position. \nCANDY (groans) Please don't move, don't go anywhere. \nHOMER (overly genuine) *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night! \nCANDY (irritated) If you're trying to be funny, Homer... \nHOMER (irritated, too) I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all... \nCandy is angry; she gets to her feet and stares hard at him. \nCANDY Stop it! Just cut it out! \nHOMER (mock surprise) You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*! \nCANDY For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down! \nCandy sobs. Homer puts his face in his hands for a minute. He regains his composure and stands up. \nHOMER (genuinely contrite) I know, I'm sorry. \nCANDY (yelling and sobbing) He's *paralyzed*! \nHOMER (deadpan; just the facts) He's *alive*. He still loves you. (pause) So do I. \nCANDY (anguished) What do you want me to *do*? \nHe faces away from her. \nHOMER (with calm resolve) Nothing. You're not the one who has to do anything. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT \nHomer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house. \nMR. ROSE (O.S.) Where do you think you're going? \nROSE ROSE (O.S.) You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please... \nHomer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat. \nMR. ROSE You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl! \nROSE ROSE I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go. \nRose Rose starts to pedal away, but Mr. Rose stops her. She starts to struggle. \nHOMER Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help. \nThey turn to see Homer. \nMR. ROSE You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help. \nROSE ROSE That's right, Homer. This ain't your business. \nShe tries to break free from her father and pedal away, but he stops her again. They keep struggling. \nHOMER Please listen to me! *Both* of you... \nMR. ROSE You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right? \nHomer steps between them, which makes Mr. Rose furious. \nMR. ROSE (yelling) What business is you in, Homer? \nHOMER Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. (to Rose Rose) If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere. \nRose Rose and Mr. Rose stop struggling. Suddenly Homer is in charge. \nHOMER \"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch.\" \nPEACHES That's the best place to eat lunch! \nHOMER \"Three: Please--even if you are very hot--do not go up to the roof to sleep.\" \nHERO What do they think? They must think we're crazy! \nMUDDY They think we're dumb niggers so we need dumb rules--that's what they think. \nHOMER This is the last one. \nThe men groan, in mock disappointment. \nHOMER \"Four: There should be no going up on the roof at night.\" \nPEACHES Why don't they just say, \"Stay off the roof!\"? \nHERO Yeah, they don't want us up there *at all*! \nHomer crumples the list and throws it into the wood stove. \nROSE ROSE (to Homer) That's *it*? \nHOMER That's it. \nROSE ROSE It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it! \nPEACHES They're *outrageous*, them rules! \nMR. ROSE Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar? (he pauses) Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer? \nHOMER Right. \nCamera closes on Candy. \nINT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EVENING \nHomer and Candy sit and stare at the blank screen; they don't look at each other. Candy grips the steering wheel of the parked car. \nCANDY Please don't make me say it again. \nHOMER No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you. \nCandy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel. \nHOMER I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right? \nCANDY Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did. \nHOMER \"...did.\" Well, okay. \nCANDY Please don't... \nHOMER (sarcastically) And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you... \nCANDY You say that as though it's some awful thing! (angrily) I never stopped loving Wally! \nHomer lets that sink in. \nHOMER (still sarcastic) At least there's no more waiting and seeing. At least I got to see the ocean. \nCandy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears-- another \"first\" for him. He turns and looks at her with an almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at the blank screen. \nEXT. ORCHARD - IN FRONT OF THE APPLE MART - DAWN \nThe rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer, walking, exits the frame in another. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAWN \nAs he walks toward the cider house, Homer sees Muddy and Peaches and Hero waving to him from the roof. \nMUDDY Rose Rose has runned away! \nPEACHES She took off in the night! \nMUDDY She took off on the bicycle, man. \nHomer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house. Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nRose Rose's bed is exposed. The curtains are flung open; her bed is empty. Mr. Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal position we have seen before. Mr. Rose's trancelike expression doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter. \nMR. ROSE Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer-- she's long gone. (pause) I swear, I didn't try and stop her-- I just wanna touch her hand before she go. That's all I wanna do, I swear. (pause) Where'd she get that knife, Muddy? That looked like *your* knife--what I seen of it. \nMuddy is scared; he looks to Homer for advice. \nMR. ROSE If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her. \nHOMER (seeing the blood) Where'd she get you? \nHe tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or finger. Music continues Over. It's a funeral. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nBuster is bringing in the wood as the music plays Over. Buster smells the spilled ether. He heads toward the dispensary, sniffing. Camera follows him into the dispensary. \nIn the dispensary: Buster approaches Larch's ether-bed. \nBUSTER Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch? \nHe drops the armload of wood and runs for help. \nINT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nAngela enters. She feels for Larch's pulse; Larch is dead. Angela opens a window. She pull's Larch's body away from the windowsill. Buster joins her on the bed. \nANGELA (V.O.) I can assure you that the overdose was entirely accidental. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nHomer finishes reading the letter; he puts it down, gets up, and walks to a window. He stares into the night. \nANGELA (V.O.) Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr. Larch has found a family. \nTHE BOYS (V.O.) Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch! \nHomer wipes a tear off his cheek. \nEXT. PICKERS' TRUCK - CIDER/PACKING HOUSE - MORNING \nThe truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has made up his mind about something. \nMUDDY You ever see a palm tree, Homer? \nPEACHES He ain't never been outta Maine! \nHERO Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer? \nHomer just smiles and shakes his head. \nEXT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING \nAs the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by. \nWally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is drawn into a tight-lipped smile. \nPEACHES (O.S.) Let me tell you somethin' about Florida, Homer. \nHERO (O.S.) The Sunshine State! \nPEACHES (O.S.) It's so nice 'n' warm down there, you can pick them grapefruits and oranges *naked*, if you want to. \nOlive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, her hair. \nIn the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes his head. \nHOMER Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on. \nMUDDY Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*! \nPEACHES Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin' on! \nThis makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear from view. \nINT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT \nA CONDUCTOR, taking tickets, comes to Homer, who is better dressed than we've ever seen him; he is looking at his sober reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when the conductor gets his attention. When the conductor moves on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he skips ahead to the end. \nANGELA (V.O.) Dr. Larch often wondered how the world was treating you. \nEXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON \nANGELA (V.O.) He talked a lot about you, hoping you would be of use, whatever you were up to. \nAngela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's coffin; they set it down by the raw hole. The pile of fresh dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black against the new white. \nEDNA (O.S.) \"Oh, Lord, support us all the day long...\" \nWe see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone. \nEDNA (O.S.) \"...until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done.\" \nINT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nWe see the faces of the girls praying for Larch (Mary Agnes, too) as Edna finishes her favorite prayer. \nEDNA \"Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest, and peace at the last.\" \nINT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT \nCamera closes on Homer, sleeping to the sound of the rocking train. Angela's letter lies in his lap. \n", "test1_input": "Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and a wheelbarrow in the back. Larch and Homer are in the cab, they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild driving. Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious smile. \nHOMER What?! \nLarch says nothing. Homer gives him a look. \nLARCH (smiling) It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people. \nHOMER I'm happy I amuse you. \nLARCH (to Homer) Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. (Buster considers this) \nHOMER Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! (Buster grins) \nLARCH Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point? \nBuster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on the road again in a few seconds. \nHOMER Happy to be alive... I guess so. \nThey are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps-- a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY \nThe luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car; they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates. \nCANDY So many children. Are they all orphans? \nWALLY Well, this *is* an orphanage. \nThe kids climb into Wally's car. \nCANDY Oh, they're getting into the car... watch your fingers! \nCurly tugs on Candy's dress, staring up at her, his face already smeared with chocolate. \nCURLY I'm the best. \nCANDY (sweetly) You are? \nWALLY (good with kids) The best? Wow! The best at *what*? \nCURLY I'm the best one. \nCurly's nose is streaming snot. Candy kneels beside him and holds her handkerchief to his nose. \nCANDY Here, blow... \nCurly tries to talk while she's holding his nose. \nCURLY I really *am* the best, I just have a cold. \nCANDY Blow! There, I bet that feels better. \nCURLY (sniffs) Yeah. \nThe other orphans are dying with envy--Candy is so beautiful. (Some, like Buster, are torn between Candy and the car.) \nLARCH Curly, come here! \nCURLY (to Larch) *Tell* them! I'm the one. \nVirtually all the orphans have climbed into Wally's car. \nHOMER (to Wally) I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this. \nWALLY It's okay--I don't mind. \nLarch, scowling, presents himself to the new couple. \nWALLY We brought some chocolates for the kids. \nLARCH (witheringly) Chocolates. How *thoughtful*. \nLarch picks up Curly and carries him toward the boys' division. \nCURLY I'm the best! *Tell* them! \nLARCH You're the best, Curly. \nINT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY \nHomer is seated in the desk chair. The impressive couple sit in front of him. \nHOMER So, Mrs... \nCANDY Candy. Candy Kendall. \nWally jumps up to his feet to shake Homer's hand. \nWALLY Wally. Wally Worthington. \n", "test1_true": "HOMER (to Candy) How many months are you? \nCANDY (whispers) Two. \nHomer writes on a piece of paper. Candy and Wally exchange a worried look. \nWALLY So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the-- \nHOMER No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure. \nWALLY (relieved) Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered... \nEdna pokes her head in the door. \nEDNA Excuse me, Homer. Dr. Larch said this one is your turn. \nEdna quickly sees that all three of them have misunderstood her. \nEDNA Oh, dear--I'm sorry. I meant the circumcision. That boy you delivered on Tuesday... \nHOMER Sure. Fine. Have you prepped him? \nEDNA I'll get started. \nCandy and Wally can't conceal how impressed they are with the young Homer. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nHomer walks down the corridor, dressed in his operating gown, as the door to the O.R. opens and Wally stumbles out, hurriedly opening a window. Wally breathes deeply to regain his composure. \nWALLY I think it was the ether--the smell got to me. (pause) God. This is all my fault. \nEdna comes down the hall with a dirt-stained, crying Curly who's covering one eye. \nEDNA (over the din) Steerforth got into the pantry--he's eaten all the pie dough. \nCURLY (sobbing) He wasn't sharing it, either. \nEDNA He's down the hall, throwing up. \nHomer nods to Edna, who is marching off with Curly. Wally smiles at Homer. \nHOMER What kind of plane are you flying? \nWALLY A B-24 Liberator. \nHOMER Liberator... \nWALLY Have you enlisted? \nHOMER They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect. \nWALLY Really! Is it serious? \nHOMER No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time. \nWally hears Homer's facetiousness--how tired he is of his heart condition. \nWALLY Oh, well. I don't imagine there's any strain or stress around *here*! \nHomer appreciates the joke. \nThe door to the operating room that Wally exited opens into the corridor; Candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by Larch and Angela. Wally rushes to Candy's side. Homer follows slowly. Candy is groggy, coming out of the ether. \nWALLY How is she doing? \nLARCH Just fine. \nCANDY (slurred speech) Boy or girl? \nANGELA It was nothing--it's all over. \nWALLY It's all over, honey. \nThey walk Candy on her gurney. Homer looks after them. \nCANDY (slurred speech) I would like to have a baby, one day. I really would. \nANGELA Why, of course--you can have as many children as you want. I'm sure you'll have very beautiful children. \nLarch wheels Candy behind a curtain. \nLARCH You'll have Princes of Maine! You'll have Kings of New England! \nLarch has a different tone of voice when he speaks to Wally. \nLARCH I suggest you find yourself some fresh air, Lieutenant. \nWally is left alone in the corridor. \n", "test1_id": 690, "test2_input": "INT. BOYS' DIVISION - DAY \nCranked at three-quarters, Fuzzy sits in bed, wheezing and coughing. He's drawing with great intensity, using crayons on a piece of paper held by a clipboard. Homer sits on the end of Fuzzy's bed, cleaning up Steerforth. Homer pauses to look out of the window; he sees Wally, dashing and spotless in his uniform beside his flashy car. A life Homer might have had crosses his face. \nFUZZY (O.S.) Homer, when is Halloween? \nHomer turns to Fuzzy, who holds up his picture--a big pumpkin with a jack-o-lantern face. \nHOMER (distracted) Uh... it's the end of October. \nFUZZY Is that soon? \nHomer looks at Fuzzy; his little body is working hard just to breathe. \nSTEERFORTH That's a few months away, Fuzz. (to Homer) I still don't feel so good. \nFUZZY (disappointed) Oh. It's the best time! How come we only get pumpkins once a year? \nFuzzy coughs and coughs. \nHOMER Don't get too excited, Fuzzy. \nFUZZY Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway. \nHomer looks out the window at Wally again. His decision forms. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY \nHomer approaches the flashy car, where Wally is still pacing. \nHOMER Has anyone offered you anything to eat? \nWALLY Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything. \nAn awkward silence, which Homer covers by examining the car. \nHOMER (trying to sound casual) I wonder if you might give me a ride. \nWALLY Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where? \nHOMER (unprepared) Where are you going? \nWALLY We're heading back to Cape Kenneth. \nHomer nods, but he has no idea where Cape Kenneth is. \nHOMER Cape Kenneth... \nWally nods. \nHOMER That sounds fine. \nINT. STAIRWAY/CORRIDOR - DAY \nHomer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. Suddenly Dr. Larch appears in front of him. Homer stops abruptly, out of breath, unable to speak. \nINT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY \nAs Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an X-ray file, holding various X rays up to the lit screen. He quickly finds the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen for a confirming look--a heart X ray, which Larch waves at Homer as he talks. \nLARCH (sarcastic) Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do. \nHOMER (restrained) I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use. \nLARCH In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways. \nHOMER (still restrained) Of course. \nLARCH (blows up) Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there! \nHOMER (feeling trapped) You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me... \nLARCH (calmly) I don't need your gratitude. \nLarch hands Homer the heart X ray. \nHOMER (exasperated) I don't need this--I know all about my condition. \nLARCH It's your heart--you ought to take it with you. \nCamera closes on Homer with the X ray. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON \nBuster and Mary Agnes are serving the evening meal while Larch rails at Angela and Edna, who are helping Buster and Mary Agnes. The sound of children in the dining hall is intermittent and chaotic. \nEDNA Going where? Does he have a plan of some kind? \nANGELA Will he be back soon? \nLARCH I don't know! He's just leaving-- (to Angela) you're the one who says he needs to see the world! (to Edna) *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world! \n", "test2_true": "ANGELA He'll need clothes... some money... \nLARCH Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of \"seeing the world,\" isn't it? \nANGELA (angrily) Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man. \nLARCH (almost breaking) He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy. \nANGELA Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes. \nCamera closes on Larch, fighting tears. \nINT. BOYS' DIVISION - AFTERNOON \nHomer is packing his things--we see the heart X ray, and some photos of Larch and Edna and Angela. \nLarch approaches Homer with a small bundle of clothes. \nLARCH (gently, almost reverently) I think these will fit you. \nHomer is grateful and ashamed. Before he can speak, Edna is there--a wad of bills in her hand. She tries to put the money in his pocket; when he refuses it, she simply puts the money in his open suitcase, stuffing the bills under his clothes. \nEDNA You'll need some money--just a little something, until you find a job. \nLarch and Edna retreat from him, humbly, as if they were his servants. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON \nAs Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela can't resist touching his face. She is too upset to speak. \nFrom a window, Larch is watching the departure. He sees Homer saying goodbye to the children, embracing them. \nFrom another window, Fuzzy just stares. (Of course he's coughing.) \nWe see Wally carrying Candy to the car. \nCANDY (groggy) I'm okay--I can walk. \nWALLY I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold. \nCANDY No--keep it down. I want to feel the air. \nShe speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat. \nCANDY (still groggy) Coming with us? It's always a good idea to have a doctor along for the ride. \nHomer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts the car; suddenly there is Curly. Homer can't look at Curly, who looks betrayed. Edna picks up Curly and carries him to the passenger-side window. Curly is sobbing. \nHOMER I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry. (to Edna) I couldn't find Buster. Will you tell him... \nHe can't finish what he has to say. Edna kisses him good- bye. \nFrom the window, Larch watches the car leave. \nBuster, whittling a stick, isn't watching. \nINT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - AFTERNOON \nThere is quiet as the journey gets underway. Wally keeps glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant, lost in thought. Homer is taking everything in--the speed, the road, the wind in his face. \nINT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nAngela speaks to the boys. \nANGELA Let us be happy for Homer Wells... \nINT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT \nIn the girls' washroom, in front of the mirror by the row of sinks, Mary Agnes is repeatedly slapping her face. Angela's benediction to the boys plays Over this scene of violent self-abuse. Except for the sound of the slaps. Mary Agnes doesn't make a sound. \nANGELA (O.S.) Homer Wells has found a family. Good night, Homer! \nALL THE BOYS (O.S.) Good night, Homer! \nINT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nOn his bed, Larch is taking ether. We hear the refrain from the boys in the bunk room Over. \nALL THE BOYS (O.S.) Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer Wells! \nINT. WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT \nThe radio is playing. Candy is lying down, her knees drawn up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to Homer and Wally's conversation. \nWALLY Actually, the Army has given me leave twice. First when my father died, and now I'm on leave to help my mother-- I'm just trying to get her ready for the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples were my dad's business. And with the war on, she's short on pickers. \nCandy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy. \nCANDY (to Homer) Wally thinks apples are boring. \n", "test2_id": 691, "test3_input": "Homer and Ray and Candy go up the gangplank from the dock to the lobster pound. \nRAY They're the garbage-eaters of the ocean's floor. The seagulls clean up the shore. The lobsters clean up the bottom of the sea. \nHOMER They eat everything? \nRAY Everything that falls to the bottom. \nCANDY It's time somebody ate *them*. \nRAY (to Candy) I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer... (to Homer) They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington! \nCANDY Daddy, it's a letter to *me*. \nRAY He mentions Homer, too, you know. \nCANDY (awkwardly) Wally said to say, \"Hello.\" \nHOMER (equally awkward) Oh! That's... nice. \nRAY (to Homer) Wally said the most spectacular hits were in the oil fields at Yenangyat. \nLater, through the window of the lobster pound, we see them eating lobster around a kitchen table. Laughter and some unclear dialogue drift to us. \nEXT./INT. CAPE KENNETH/WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT \nWith the bicycle stowed in the trunk, Candy is driving Homer back to the cider house. They pass a drive-in movie theatre, the marquee announcing \"CLOSED FOR THE SEASON.\" Homer stares in awe at the giant blank screen. \nHOMER A movie *outside*? \nCANDY Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout. \nHOMER People watched the movies in their cars? \nCANDY (smiling) When they watched at all. Do you like movies? \nHOMER Yes! I've only seen one, though. \nCandy looks at him; he isn't joking. \nCANDY You've seen only one movie? Which one? \nHOMER \"King Kong\". It's really good. \nCandy laughs. \nCANDY I haven't seen \"King Kong\" since I was a kid! \nHomer laughs a little self-consciously; around her, he feels like he's *still* a kid. \nINT. DINING HALL - EARLY MORNING \nAt one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their pockets. At another table, Larch, Edna, and Angela sit around an open packing crate of apples. Larch takes a bite from an apple and spits it out. Angela takes the apple out of his hand. \nANGELA That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer said you're not supposed to eat it! \nAngela hands him another apple. \nLARCH So he's an apple expert, is he? \nAngela gives him a critical look as Larch takes a bite out of the new apple. \nLARCH (sarcastically) Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies! \nANGELA Wilbur, he picked them for us himself... \nLARCH (incredulous) You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples? \nBoth Edna and Angela glower at him. \nLARCH Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need! \nEDNA (annoyed) He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too. \nLARCH I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner! \nLarch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the garbage. \nEDNA Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you be angry with Homer for sending us a *gift*? \nLarch stares into space, depressed. Then he examines the crate and finds the mailing label that says \"OCEAN VIEW ORCHARDS--CAPE KENNETH, MAINE.\" He rips it off, holds it up triumphantly. \nLARCH I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give him a gift he can *use*! \nLarch storms out of the room. \nINT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT \nA newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers marching, smiling, waving to the camera. Homer and Candy sit together watching. Homer is completely fascinated; Candy watches Homer as much as the news. Her expression changes when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid. \nEXT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "CANDY (disappointed) But you looked as if you liked it. \nHOMER (smiling) I *did* like it. All I said was, \"It's not 'King Kong'.\" \nCandy makes a face, but in good fun. \nHOMER First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him... \nCANDY She *did* love him! (teasing him) How many women have you known? \nHomer is embarrassed; he ducks the question. \nHOMER And what did she die of, exactly? \nCANDY She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. \nHOMER Oh, sure! \nHomer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh. \nHOMER What's the *medical* explanation? \nCANDY Well, she was in a weakened condition... (laughs) I don't know! What about \"King Kong\"?! Is that medically possible? \nHomer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it. \nHOMER (mock serious) At least King Kong knew what he *wanted*. \nCandy pushes him playfully. They're both having a good time, *too* good a time. \nEXT. ORCHARDS - DAY \nHomer is picking apples in a big tree; Rose Rose is on a ladder in the tree right beside him. She's picking about twice as fast as he is, and he keeps dropping his apples. In another tree, Muddy is watching. \nROSE ROSE What is you *doin'* with that Candy, Homer? \nMUDDY (imitating Mr. Rose) He's makin' history, I suppose. \nFrom the surrounding trees, the other pickers laugh. \nROSE ROSE You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope. \nHOMER No trouble. \nIn adjacent trees, both Peaches and Hero are picking apples; they can hear Homer and Rose Rose, too. (So can Mr. Rose.) \nPEACHES That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know! \nMUDDY She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest. \nHOMER She's the nicest *and* the most beautiful girl I've ever known. \nThe men *oooh* and *aaah* at Homer's announcement--Mr. Rose, too. \nROSE ROSE That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer. \nMR. ROSE That's right--that sounds like trouble to me. \nHOMER I'm not in trouble. \nROSE ROSE Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is. \nCamera closes on Homer's face; he keeps picking. \nLARCH (O.S.) His name is Homer Wells... \nINT. ST. CLOUD'S - DINING HALL - EVENING \nEdna and Angela face the Board of Trustees around a table. Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a folder. Larch has provided a copy for each member. The three elderly gentlemen on the Board don't speak; they just nod their heads to everything Dr. Holtz or Mrs. Goodhall says. \nLARCH ...and his *pathetic* resume is the best I've seen. Though I find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in this character. \nDR. HOLTZ But he looks like an excellent young man, a first-rate candidate! \nLARCH He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary *moron* to me, but that's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here! \nMRS. GOODHALL Do you know him? \nLARCH *No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war! \nSuddenly Steerforth bursts through the door, having been pushed from behind by Mary Agnes. The two stop when they see what's going on--not to mention Larch's stern expression. They back out. Mary Agnes winking at Dr. Holtz before the door closes. Mrs. Goodhall is ready to continue. \nMRS. GOODHALL I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here. \nLARCH Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*! \nMRS. GOODHALL You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is? \nLARCH Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him! \n", "test3_id": 692}

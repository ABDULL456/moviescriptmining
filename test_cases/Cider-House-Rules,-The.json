{"test1_input": "WALLY (to Homer) I never said they were boring. \nCANDY You said, \"Apples aren't exactly flying.\" \nWALLY Well, they aren't. \nHomer looks back at Candy. Her eyes close. \nHOMER I think I'd probably like the apple business. \nWALLY You're a little overqualified, aren't you? \nHOMER No, I'm not. I need a job. \nWALLY The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring. \nCandy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little. \nCANDY There! You said it was boring. \nWALLY Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking! \nCandy seems irritated with Wally. Homer tries to engage her. \nHOMER Is your family in the apple business, too? \nCANDY No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. \nHOMER I've never seen a lobster. \nCANDY Really? \nHOMER I've never seen the ocean, either. \nWALLY (amazed) You've never seen the *ocean*? \nHomer shakes his head, smiles. \nWALLY That's not funny... that's *serious*. \nEXT./INT. ROADSIDE/CAR - NIGHT \nThe car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half- hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob. \nCANDY I couldn't have a baby with someone who's leaving me--I didn't know what else to do! \nHomer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions. \nHOMER I know. \nCANDY He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him! \nHOMER Where's Mandalay? \nCANDY Burma! \nHOMER Oh... \nCANDY I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! \nHOMER I understand. \nHe doesn't, really. Wally returns. Wally leans over Candy to hug her. \nWALLY Honey, honey... of course I'll come back. \nCandy pounds on his chest with her fists. \nCANDY You don't *know*, Wally. You have no *idea*! \nWally backs away. Candy sobs uncontrollably. \nCANDY Stay away from me! \nWally signals to Homer to get out of the car. \nLater, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously. \nHOMER (strictly medical) This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time. \nWALLY I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*! \nHOMER It's all very normal. \nWally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his cigarette. \nWALLY You ought to cut that shit out--it's terrible for you. \nHomer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes. Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot. \nThey notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy asleep in the backseat. \n", "test1_true": "The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark highway. \nEXT. COAST OF MAINE - MORNING \nThe car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her. \nCANDY I'm a little worried about the... (she gestures below her waist) ...about how much bleeding is okay. \nHOMER It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps? (Candy nods) They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal. \nWALLY (O.S.) Catch! \nA football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it bounces off his chest. Wally laughs. \nWALLY (meaning the football) Give it here! \nHomer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one before. \nWALLY What was *that*?! Come over here! \nHomer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy, who closes her eyes. \"Put your fingers on the laces--no, it rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes, like that!\" \nEXT. COAST OF MAINE - DAY (LATER) \nHomer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her direction before he speaks to Homer. \nWALLY It's called the Burma run. It's about a seven-hour round-trip flight between India and China. \nWally draws a crude map in the sand. \nHOMER \"Burma run\" because you fly over Burma... \nWALLY *And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump. \nOn Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening. \nHOMER (O.S.) At what altitude? \nWALLY I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass. \nHomer looks at Wally, thoughtfully. \nHOMER What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that! \nWALLY (conspiratorially) Actually, I volunteered. \nHomer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice. \nHOMER It's the flying, right? You love to fly, don't you? \nWally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before he responds. \nWALLY I love the bombing, too. But there's also the Himalayas--they have the most wicked air currents in the world. I wouldn't miss flying there for anything. \nHomer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder. \nWALLY Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring. \nHOMER Oh, I would love that, Wally. \nEXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - AFTERNOON \nThe car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door. Candy stands outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand. \nCANDY I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything. \nHOMER Sure... I'll see you around. \nCandy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally. A lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock. It's RAY, Candy's father. Candy waves. \"Hi, Daddy!\" Homer glances at Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye. \nCANDY (whispering) I love you, Wally. \nWALLY I love you, too. See you tomorrow. \nEXT. OCEAN VIEW - WORTHINGTON HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nWally drives up to the Worthington house; he gets out of the car. Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse. \nWALLY Come on. You have to meet my mom. (conspiratorially) If it comes up, I've been at a wedding. That's where I met you, at the wedding. \nINT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - WALLY'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nHomer as never seen such a room: the sports trophies, the photos of athletic teams, and of Candy with Wally. Model airplanes are everywhere. Mrs. Worthington's voice comes from the hall. \nOLIVE (O.S.) Wally? I expected you earlier... \nShe appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer. \nWALLY This is Homer Wells--he's the most overqualified apple picker you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn the apple business. \n", "test1_id": 690, "test2_input": "DR. HOLTZ But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally qualified... \nLARCH I'm not talking about his medical qualifications. It's the *Christian* thing that bothers me--I just don't see it being of much *use* around here. \nMRS. GOODHALL (bitterly) I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here! \nLARCH Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested. \nDR. HOLTZ We're *very* interested! \nMRS. GOODHALL Yes, *very*! \nDR. HOLTZ You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him? \nLARCH I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again? \nANGELA Dr. Homer Wells. \nLARCH (mumbling) I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time. \nThe three elderly gentlemen repeat the name. \nMRS. GOODHALL It's a nice name, very New England. \nDR. HOLTZ Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding name. \nEDNA *Very*! \nINT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nA song plays on the old phonograph as a happy Larch and Angela dance. Edna interrupts them. \nEDNA I just wanted to ask you... \nLARCH Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight. \nEDNA Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back? \nThis causes Larch to take the needle off the record. \nLARCH (angrily) He's a field hand! What could possibly hold him there? \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - RAINY DAY \nThe rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr. Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room. \nINT. MILL ROOM - RAINY DAY \nMr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable; only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice. \nMR. ROSE Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts... \nHOMER What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms. \nMR. ROSE Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you! \nEveryone but Jack laughs. He takes a last drag on his cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat. \nMR. ROSE That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right. \nJACK Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there! \nMR. ROSE It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'. \nJACK You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette! \nMR. ROSE What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is... \nJack looks for a translation from the other men, who are nervous. \nMUDDY Just say you're in the *apple* business, man. That's the only business you wanna be in. Just say it. \nJack pulls a knife on Mr. Rose. \nPEACHES (whispers excitedly to Jack) You don't wanna go in the knife business with Mistuh Rose--just say you're in the *apple* business, Jack! \nJACK (to Mr. Rose) What business are *you* in? \nWe never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed. \nMR. ROSE I'm in the *knife* business, Jack. You don't wanna go in the knife business with me. \nMuddy turns Jack around and views his slashed clothes. \nMUDDY You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man. \nPEACHES The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*... \nMUDDY Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed. \nJack starts to undress for the vat. \n", "test2_true": "INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY \nMr. Rose has cut his own hand in the fight. Homer's professionalism if offended to watch Rose Rose's amateurish efforts to stitch up her father's wound, but clearly this isn't the first time she's done it. \nHOMER Give men that. I know how to do it. \nROSE ROSE Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer? \nHOMER Almost. \nMR. ROSE I don't need no \"almost\" a doctor, Homer. \nHomer can't bear to watch Rose Rose at work with the needle. \nROSE ROSE We should drown that damn Jack in the vat! \nMR. ROSE Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in. \nROSE ROSE Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes! \nMR. ROSE You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer? \nHomer winces at the stitching. \nINT. WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EARLY EVENING \nWally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed drive-in. Homer is at the wheel; Candy calls out some driving instructions. The car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost. Candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the window. Homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window and over the seat. He feels great. \nCANDY You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this. \nHOMER You think? Maybe I was. (looks around) I love this place! \nHomer looks up at the giant movie screen. \nHOMER The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here? \nCANDY Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie. \nHomer stares at Candy in disbelief. \nHOMER You don't care about the movie? \nCandy looks at him for a moment. \nCANDY What are you so crazy about the movies for? \nHOMER It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing. \nCANDY At least you were never lonely. \nHOMER I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone. \nCandy is moved. Homer feels exposed; he tries to change the mood by making light of what he's said. \nHOMER You're not alone in the bathroom, or... or in the shower... you're never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf, or even in your own bed on a cold morning. \nCandy laughs. \nCANDY You don't miss it? \nHOMER I miss things. I miss... people. (with certainty) I miss reading to the boys. \nCANDY But you had so much *responsibility*. \nHOMER I never *asked* for any responsibility. \nCANDY Just a little privacy. \nHomer laughs. \nCANDY Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies. \nHOMER Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies? \nAt the mention of Wally they both look a little self- conscious. \nCANDY Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally. \nHOMER Ah-ha. (points to the speaker) So what is that--a radio? \nCANDY The *speaker*. For the movie sound. \nCandy looks at Homer. \nCANDY Scrunch down like this. \nCandy scrunches down in her seat; Homer imitates her. Homer is focused on the giant screen. \nHOMER How could you not *care* about the movie? \n", "test2_id": 691, "test3_input": "OLIVE Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over. \nThey both laugh, but Homer has a hard time looking her in the eye. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY \nThe pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't hear their conversation. Rose Rose and the other men walk past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck. Olive and Homer walk over to the truck. \nOLIVE Good-bye. Have a safe trip home. Thank you, again, for all your hard work. \nMR. ROSE You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton. \nThey shake hands. \nOLIVE Good-bye, Arthur. (she hugs Rose Rose) Homer, I'll see you tomorrow? \nHOMER Right. \nOlive gets in her Jeep and waves as she drives off. \nThe truck is packed. Muddy tugs on a rope that secures the load. \nMUDDY (to Mr. Rose) We all set, I think. \nMr. Rose nods and gets in behind the wheel. Rose Rose and Muddy get in next to him. The others are bundled up for the ride in the open back of the truck. \nAs they're leaving, Homer waves good-bye--the pickers calling out to him. \nMR. ROSE You all take care of yourself, too, Homer! \nPEACHES We see you next harvest. \nMUDDY Don't freeze to death, Homer. \nJACK Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer. \nMR. ROSE Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right. \nROSE ROSE You just stay out of trouble, Homer! \nHomer stands looking after them, after they're gone. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - LATER THAT SAME DAY \nHomer is alone, rearranging his stuff--spreading out a bit, making the place his own. (On the other beds, we see the mattresses rolled up on the bare bedsprings.) \nCANDY (O.S.) So, you're staying. \nHomer turns; he hadn't seen Candy come in. \nCANDY Olive told me. (awkward pause) You might have told me yourself. \nHOMER I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said. \nShe smiles. He goes to her; they embrace. \nBEGINNING A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT NINE OR TEN MONTHS. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE ROOF - MORNING \nHomer, drinking coffee, is writing a letter on a note pad. \nHOMER (V.O.) Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your doctor's bag... \nEXT. RAY'S LOBSTER BOAT - DAY \nHomer is learning how to \"haul\" a lobster pot with Ray and Candy's guidance. \nHOMER (V.O.) ...although it seems that I will not have the occasion to use it. \nEXT. LOBSTER POUND, FLOATING PENS - EVENING \nFollowing Ray's example, Homer is trying to \"disarm\" the lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little wooden wedges. Roy works quickly, never getting pinched. As Candy watches, Homer gets pinched. \nHOMER (V.O.) Barring some emergency, of course. I am not a doctor. With all due respect to your profession. I am enjoying my life here. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nHomer and Candy are naked. They have pulled two beds together and made a double bed. He can't take his eyes off her. \nHOMER I've looked at so many women... I mean, I've seen *everything* about them, *everything*... but I never felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now... with you... it *hurts*... to look at you. \nINT. DISPENSARY - DAY \nEdna and Angela and Larch are all reading Homer's letter, their lips moving silently as they read the words. \nHOMER (V.O.) I am enjoying being a lobsterman and an orchardman--in fact, I have never enjoyed myself so much. \nINT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, FIREPLACE - NIGHT \nOlive and Homer and Candy are playing a board game around the fireplace. \n", "test3_true": "INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEdna and Angela view him anxiously from the doorway as Larch furiously types and types. \nLARCH (V.O.) My dear Homer, I thought you were over your adolescence, that period which I would define as the first time in our lives when we imagine we have something terrible to hide from those who love us. \nINT. WALLY'S CAR - DAY \nCandy is singing to the car radio, as animated and happy as we've ever seen her. Homer, driving, can scarcely keep his eyes on the road; he has to keep looking at her. \nLARCH (V.O.) Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you? \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT \nWith the radio playing (a popular song), Homer hops across the bare floor, pulling on his boxer shorts; he opens the door to Olive, who's holding out an armload of blankets to him. He sheepishly thanks her. When Homer closes the door, we see a hidden (and stricken) Candy, naked from their interrupted lovemaking. \nLARCH (V.O.) You're fallen in love, haven't you? By the way, whatever you're up to can't be too good for your heart. Then again, it's the sort of condition that can be made worse by worrying about it. So don't worry about it! \nEXT. ORCHARDS - DAY \nVernon and Homer are working under an apple tree; they are poisoning mice. \nHOMER (V.O.) Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning here may not be as important as what I learned from you, but everything is new to me. Yesterday I learned how to poison mice. You use poison oats and poison corn. \nINT. DINING HALL - EVENING \nSupper chaos--Buster and Mary Agnes are doing their best to stop a food fight while Larch and Angela and Edna are completely absorbed reading Homer's letter. \nHOMER (V.O.) Field mice girdle an apple tree. Pine mice kill the roots. I *know* what you have to do--you have to play God. Well... killing mice is as close as I want to come to playing God. \nINT. MOVIE THEATRE - CAPE KENNETH \nHomer and Candy are watching \"Rebecca\". \nLARCH (V.O.) Do I interfere? When absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply *can't* have an abortion, that they simply *must* go through with having another--and yet another-- orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I do not. I do not even *recommend*. I just give them what they want: an orphan or an abortion. (close on Homer) You are my work of art, Homer. Everything else has been just a job. I don't know if you've got a work of art in you, but I know what your job is. You're a doctor! \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY \nThe radio is playing a slow, sexy dance number. The fat ladies from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior walls of the bunk house. \nHOMER (V.O.) I am not a doctor. \nLARCH (V.O.) You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it! \nHomer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls. When he gets to the list of rules, tacked on the wall, he removes the list and finishes painting under where the rules were. \nLARCH (V.O.) They're going to replace me, Homer! The Board of Trustees is looking for my *replacement*! \nTwo of the ladies unroll the rolled-up mattresses on the bare bedsprings, as Vernon enters with an armload of blankets and pillows. \nHOMER (V.O.) I can't replace you! I'm sorry... \nHomer holds up the list of rules, rereads it briefly; he walks over to an unpainted beam, a support beam, and tacks the rules on this beam. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING \nHomer reads Larch's letter, sipping coffee. \nLARCH (V.O.) Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for anything I've done. I'm not even sorry that I love you! \nINT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nLarch sits on his ether-bed with a letter from Homer in his hand. He looks completely deflated. Angela is standing in the doorway. \nLARCH I think we may have lot him to the world. He's not coming back. \nEND OF THE MONTAGE. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nIn the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. He is untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts to unbutton his shirt. They kiss while they dance. But the song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and silly. \nHomer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the mood--they are passionately kissing again. \nThe sound of a truck is sudden and loud. \nEXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY \nMr. Rose's truck has arrived. The pickers are hopping out of the truck, grabbing their gear. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY \nThe door opens. Hero and Peaches barge in, as Homer and Candy are struggling to return the pillows to the beds. \nHERO Who's that? \nPEACHES It's that Homer! \nMuddy is right behind them. He picks up a pillow, off the floor, looking for which bed it belongs on. \n", "test3_id": 692}

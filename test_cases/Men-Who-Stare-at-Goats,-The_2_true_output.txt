BOB (V.O.) ...whereas the army had long felt fine about doing stuff to goats - even testing atomic weapons on them. We hear the drone of an AEROPLANE high, high above. The goat looks up... 
136   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST               136 
Lyn stands facing the goats. Holtz and Hooper watch him. Lyn STARES. One of the goats STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. The goat STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. And the Goat falls over. 
MAJOR HOLTZ 
(SOFTLY) Holy shit. Beat. The goat gets back up, shakes itself and walks off. Lyn slumps. 
137   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                      137 
Bob listens transfixed. 
LYN CASSADY This was the real deal, Bob. I was at the Gateway. Afterwards I realized I'd got injured. 
BOB Huh? 
LYN CASSADY Sympathetic injury I guess. I was bruised all over. 
BOB So, it's not that the goat fought back? 
LYN CASSADY 
(SADLY) Goat didn't have a chance. 
BOB But...that was it? 
(CONTINUED) 
137   CONTINUED:                                               137 
LYN CASSADY I wish it was. Hooper told Holtz we should try the experiment again. Only this time they said...kill the goat. 
138   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                 138 
Six GOATS - each wearing a NUMBERED BIB - stand in a small bare room. A SOLDIER is setting up a VIDEO CAMERA in front of them. 
139   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - SECOND ROOM - THE PAST         139 
Lyn sits in another bare room. Holtz and Larry Hooper stand watching him. Lyn is also being TAPED. A SOLDIER walks in carrying an envelope. Holtz takes the envelope and draws from it a piece of paper. He shows it to Lyn - the number FOUR. 
MAJOR HOLTZ Take out number four. Lyn stares at the number. 
BOB (V.O.) Lyn said he had no intention of killing the goat. 
140   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                        140 
Lyn flushes with indignation at the memory. 
LYN CASSADY There was no way! What had the goat ever done to me? It was totally against the way of the Jedi. I was just going to pretend to try so they would say, "okay - it can't be done" and forget about it. But then, as I sat there, I felt this, this pulse start inside of me and...I couldn't stop it. He turns to look at Bob, haunted. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) You know what I keep thinking? 
141   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - LYN'S ROOM - THE PAST          141 
CLOSE ON LYN ...as he stares, concentrating. 
(CONTINUED) 
141   CONTINUED:                                               141 
LYN CASSADY (V.O.) Maybe deep down inside some dark part of me wanted to see if I could do it? 
142   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - GOAT ROOM - DAY - THE PAST     142 
VIDEO FOOTAGE Grainy, flickering black and white footage of the six goats in the room. Suddenly one of them goes down. 
143   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - LYN'S ROOM - THE PAST          143 
A soldier runs into the room. Holtz, Hooper and Lyn turn to him, the atmosphere electric with dread and anticipation. 
SOLDIER

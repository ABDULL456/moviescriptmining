DR. EVIL Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil. 
They all look up at the SCREEN. 
DR. EVIL In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.  Well, it's in safe hands.  If you want it back, you'll have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS! 
The UN representatives are confused.  Number Two COUGHS. 
DR. EVIL (frustrated) Sorry.  ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS! 
The representatives ARGUE amongst themselves. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETATY Gentlemen, silence! (to Dr. Evil) 
NOW, MR. EVIL&EMDASH 
DR. EVIL (angry) Doctor Evil!  I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'mister'. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY Excuse me.  Dr. Evil, it is the policy of the United Nations not to negotiate with terrorists. 
DR. EVIL Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with one 
hundred billion dollars.  If you fail to do so, we'll set off the warhead and destroy the world. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY You can't destroy the world with a single warhead. 
DR. EVIL Really?  So long. 
The screen goes BLANK. 
DR. EVIL (to evil associates) Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. (laughing) Ha-ha-ha-ha. (slightly louder) Ha-ha-ha-ha. 
EVIL ASSOCIATES (laughing with him) Ha-ha-ha-ha. 
DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES 
(LOUDER AND MORE STACCATO) 
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! 
(louder again, and even more evil and maniacal) 
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! 
(PAUSE) Ohhhh, ahhhhhh... (pause, quieter) Ohhh, hmmmm. (pause, very quiet) hmn. 
There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the room, not knowing what to do with themselves. 
DR. EVIL Okay...Well...I think I'm going to watch some TV. 
EVIL ASSOCIATES Okay.  Sure. 
They exit the frame awkwardly.

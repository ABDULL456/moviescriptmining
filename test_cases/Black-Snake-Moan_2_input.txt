R.L.'s prayer is heard as Laz opens the front door to the cafe. He looks ill. Each step is painful. 
R.L. (V.O.) We do not question your divine plan for us, Oh God. But in these times, when our spirit lies in shadow. When we are lost. 
Laz crosses to Rose's booth -- the distance seems to stretch out into eternity. 
R.L. (V.O.) We ask that you give us strength. Give us strength that surpasses all understanding. In your name we pray. Amen. 
Laz sits across from his wife. 
ROSE Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit. 
LAZARUS Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember? 
The waitress is kind and twangy as she asks for their order. 
WAITRESS Can I start you both off with some coffee 'fore I take your order? 
ROSE We won't be stayin' long. Coffee'll be fine. 
The waitress leaves. The sounds of the cafe fill the silence. 
ROSE We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company... 
LAZARUS (interrupting) If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha. 
ROSE Think this about money still, ya old fool? 
LAZARUS Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear? 
ROSE How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times? 
The waitress places the coffee between them and leaves. 
ROSE Thought we was gonna be friendly about this. 
LAZARUS Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that? 
ROSE I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do. 
LAZARUS And you gonna live it with him? 
Rose doesn't answer. Lazarus softens, touching her hand. 
LAZARUS Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all. 
ROSE Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house. 
LAZARUS I keep the heat on. 
ROSE That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed. 
LAZARUS Kept us warm for twelve years. 
It's over. Laz has lost her for good. 
ROSE I deserve better than this. 
LAZARUS Better'n me? 
ROSE Better than what you give. 
LAZARUS Rose... please... 
ROSE Laz... You can't say nothin'... 
LAZARUS If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's... 
ROSE (the final interruption) I don't love ya no more. 
The words are daggers. Laz is wounded beyond concealment. Rose picks up her purse, preparing to leave. 
ROSE I'm sorry you hurtin'. But, like I say, this the only life I got. (waits for him to respond) I said my piece. 
She stands and attempts to walk away. Laz grips her tightly by the wrist. 
LAZARUS God forgive you, for how you done me... 
ROSE Let go... 
LAZARUS My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me. 
ROSE Let go of my arm... 
LAZARUS Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!

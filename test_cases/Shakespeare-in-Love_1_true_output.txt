WILL Your aunt? 
VIOLA AS THOMAS (catching up) Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will. 
WILL Like a sickness and its cure together. 
VIOLA AS THOMAS Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat. (collecting herself) Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful? 
WILL Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself. 
He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but WILL belies his words. 
VIOLA AS THOMAS And her lips? 
WILL Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! 
VIOLA AS THOMAS And her voice? Like lark song? 
WILL Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. 
VIOLA AS THOMAS She sings too? 
WILL Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? 
VIOLA AS THOMAS (glinting) What of her bosom? 
WILL Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! 
VIOLA AS THOMAS I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player? 
WILL (fervently) Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden! 
VIOLA AS THOMAS But what of Lord Wessex? 
WILL For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! 
The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house. The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth and jumps out of the boat. 
VIOLA Oh, Will! 
She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the house. 
BOATMAN Thank you, my lady! 
WILL (stunned) Lady? 
BOATMAN Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child. 
WILL gets out of the boat. 
BOATMAN (CONT'D) (reaching under his seat) Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a writer myself. 
The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript. 
BOATMAN (CONT'D) It wouldn't take you long to read it, I expect you know all the booksellers 
But WILL has gone. 
EXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT. 
WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
WILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by the door. They stare at each other across the room. 
WILL Can you love a fool? 
VIOLA Can you love a player? 
They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. 
WILL (springs back) Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent. 
VIOLA Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare? 
WILL I am. 
VIOLA Then kiss me again for I am not mistook. 
They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.

EDDIE Hey, it's the best I could do. 
MR. WHITE The man is fucking dying. 
EDDIE And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll take care of him. 
MR. WHITE He needs a doctor, not a fuckin nurse. 
EDDIE Ask me how many doctors I called. You wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors I called. 
MR. WHITE Obviously not enough. 
EDDIE Fuck you! You gotta little black book, then whip is out.  If not, listen how it is.  I called three doctors and couldn't get through to shit.  Now, time being a factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse.  Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment. 
MR. WHITE If he dies I'm holding you personally responsible. 
EDDIE Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you wanna play that way.  I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.  I don't think she'll call the cops, but I don't know for sure.  But me being too nice- a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk it.  But no fuckin more. (he grabs his portable phone) I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin her to forget it.  You take care of your friend, you know so much about it. 
MR. PINK Goddamnit, will you guys grow up! 
EDDIE I don't need to grow up, my friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm being responsible, I'm taking care of business. 
MR. WHITE Cut the shit!  I don't think you called anybody except some cooze you once fucked, who happens to wear orthopedic shoes.  And I don't think that's good enough care for a gut-shot man. 
EDDIE Yeah, well I don't give a flying fuck what you think! 
MR. PINK (to Mr. White) Look, he's not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him.  She's gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor. Nobody's forgotten about doctors. Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is something we're doing in the meantime.  I think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes. 
EDDIE Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I leave myself wide open, and I'm an asshole. 
50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks. 
We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot. 
EDDIE What the fuck happened here? 
Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic. 
MR. WHITE (to Mr. Orange) What happened? 
MR. ORANGE (very weakly) Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive. 
EDDIE (yelling) Who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig? 
Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once more. 
EDDIE (to Mr. Orange) You were saying he went crazy? Something like that?  Worse or better? 
MR. ORANGE Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn. He was gonna kill the cop and me. And when you guys walked through the door, he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds. 
MR. WHITE (to Eddie) Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho. 
MR. ORANGE (to Eddie) You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him.  He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.

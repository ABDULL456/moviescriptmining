Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're going to enjoy this. 
Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up. 
The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE. 
ANGLE ON DENT 
DENT If elected, my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against Boss Carl Grissom! 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place reeks of money. 
In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured. Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse. 
In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech. 
DENT (on the TV screen) Together we can make Gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play. 
THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the middle. 
JACK NAPIER Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace else. 
JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his appearance. He is also absolutely merciless. 
He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides over in her negligee and snuggles up. 
ALICIA Anything new? 
JACK The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom... I would've had to kill him by now. 
ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She begins knotting it playfully about his neck. 
ALICIA If Grissom knew about us... he might kill you. 
JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a nearby vanity. 
JACK Don't think so, angel. I'm too valuable. That's the way I've planned it. (pause) And besides, he doesn't know. 
JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble. 
ALICIA You look just fine, Jack. 
He smiles at himself before turning to the door. 
JACK ... I didn't ask. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 
The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van. 
EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE MEDIC. 
MEDIC That one there won't say a word. The other one's raving his head off. 
ECKHARDT Variety, huh? The spice of life. 
At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX -- thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed PATROLMAN. 
PATROLMAN They found him hugging a drainpipe. He was scared to come off the roof. 
KNOX Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week. 
PATROLMAN (testily) I dunno. What's "what"? 
KNOX Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation. 
KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath. 
ECKHARDT Oh Christ, it's Knox. 
KNOX Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about? 
ECKHARDT Nothing out of the routine. 
At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain- fried NICK past the mouth of the alley. 
NICK A bat, I tell you, a giant bat! He wanted me to do him a favor...! 
KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade disgusted looks. 
KNOX No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing something up there. 
ECKHARDT No comment. Print what you like. 
KNOX Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City? 
KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him: 
KNOX (cont.) If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after taxes?

CUT TO: 
EXT. CHETWOOD FOREST -- DAY 
ANGLE ON: 
STRIDER, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy, overgrown forest. Sam follows at the read leading "Bill", a scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies. 
FRODO Where are you taking us? 
STRIDER Into the wild. 
Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of the trees... 
MERRY (whispered aside) How do, we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? 
FRODO We have no choice but to trust him. 
STRIDER But where is he leading us? 
ANGLE ON: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam. 
STRIDER (CONT'D) To Rivendell, Master Gamgee...to the house of Elrond. 
SAM looks excited. 
SAM Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell! We're going to see the Elves! 
Strider leads the Hobbits through the gloom of the forest. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MIDGEWATER MOORS -- DAY 
Aerial on: Strider leading Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin across the windswept moors. The hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks. 
STRIDER Gentlemen, we do not stop until nightfall. 
PIPPIN What about breakfast? 
STRIDER You've already had it. 
PIPPIN We've had one, yes...but what about Second Breakfast? 
Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. 
MERRY I don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. 
PIPPIN What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, dinner...he knows about them, doesn't he? 
MERRY I wouldn't count on it. 
An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it.   Another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MERRY (CONT'D) (exasperated) Pippin! 
The hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and miserable.

INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- NIGHT 
Saruman stands over the Palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye. 
SARUMAN (whisper) The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth. 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: BLACK SPEECH FILLS THE ROOM...ADMIST THE 
HARSH, GUTTURAL WORDS THE VOICE OF SARUMAN EMERGES. 
SARUMAN Build me an army worth of Mordor. 
INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- NIGHT 
Saruman is seated as his ORC OVERSEER approaches. 
ORC OVERSEER What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What does the eye command? 
SARUMAN We have work to do.

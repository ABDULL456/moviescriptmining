Nina shoves her belongings into the TRASH CHUTE, a pile of her next victims strewn at her feet. 
She grabs a TEDDY BEAR IN A TUTU, and jams him in. 77-78A. 
A84 INT. STAGE - DAY A84 
Nina dances the Black Swan in front of the nearly completed scenery. 
A few TECHNICIANS complete last minute touch-ups. 
Leroy watches from his down-stage post, his focus split between her and... 
Lily, stretching with the other ballerinas. She stares at Nina with a dark expression. 
Fueled by the competition, Nina pushes herself. Her dancing becomes more impassioned and aggressive. 
She finishes the section, breathing deeply, covered in sweat. The company enthusiastically claps. 
She stares intently at Leroy, awaiting his response. 
LEROY At last, I saw the Black Swan. 
B84 INT. COSTUME SHOP - DAY B84 
Nina wears the BLACK SWAN COSTUME, facing a mirror. Another mirror behind her creates an infinite array of reflections. 
The overworked COSTUMER checks each seam, pulling the costume taut, analyzing what needs to be taken in and let out. 
Nina looks uncomfortable, disliking the scrutiny of her body. 
She hears a sharp RUSTLE. Like someone's scratching. 
She looks up at the mirror. Her reflection stares back. 
Behind the first reflection, another Nina has her arm behind her back, like she's scratching her shoulder. 
Nina leans to get a better look... 
COSTUMER Sit still, I'm almost done. 
Nina startles. The reflection has returned to normal, its hand back at its side. 
Costumer checks one more thing, makes one more note. 
COSTUMER (CONT'D) Okay, all set. 77-78B. 
The costumer leaves her to change. 
Relieved, Nina quickly takes off the costume and starts to dress in her sweats. 
She hears someone enter the costume shop. 
LILY (O.S.) Hey...Thomas sent me. 
Nina pauses, recognizing her voice. 
COSTUMER (O.S.) Yeah, need to get you measured for your Swan Queen costumes. 
Nina steps out from behind the privacy curtain, and finds Lily waiting. 
NINA (TO COSTUMER) What's she doing here? 
LILY He made me your alternate. (can't help it) Just in case... 
Nina pushes past her. 
C84 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY C84 
Nina chases after Leroy, in mid-conversation with the STAGE MANAGER and two STAGEHANDS. 
NINA Thomas! 
He stops and faces her. 
NINA (CONT'D) She's trying to replace me. 
LEROY (to stage manager, STAGEHANDS) Go ahead. I'll catch up. 
They continue walking. 
LEROY (CONT'D) What's going on? 77-78C. 
NINA Lily. You made her my alternate. 
LEROY There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice. 
NINA She wants my role. 
LEROY Every dancer in the world wants your role.

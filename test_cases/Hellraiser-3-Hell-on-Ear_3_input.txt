TERRI I miss you too. 
JP That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone? 
TERRI Yes. 
JP Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel? 
TERRI Oh, I don't ... 
JP C'mon.  It'll be great. 
INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT 
CLOSE on Terri's face - we can almost see her summon the will- power to refuse. 
TERRI No!  No.  I can't.  I just can't. 
She slams the phone down quickly before he can persuade her. She takes a couple of deep breaths and walks away from the phone. 
TERRI Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit. 
She looks around.  She looks at the books.  She looks at the videos.  She looks at the table.  She looks back at the phone. 
ANGLE ON PHONE 
- as it RINGS again. 
TERRI 
- shakes her head and turns the ansafone on. 
After two rings, the machine responds. 
JOEY (ansafone message) Hi.  You've reached Joanne Summerskill. In spirit at least.  Please leave a message.  Thanks. 
WOMAN (on phone) Hello.  Ms. Summerskill, this is Sharon Leech again from K-YZY in Monterey. Sorry to call so late but I was wondering if you got my other message? Look, I probably shouldn't say this on tape but what the hell ... there's a job here if you want it.  Late-night news reader.  We think you'd be marvelous .. 
The machine BEEPS and cuts her off, leaving the message light FLASHING. 
CLOSE on Terri's face - disappointed and sad. 
INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT 
Joey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors. 
As Kirsty speaks, INTERCUT between Joey and the monitors. 
KIRSTY (Looks to side)  Again?  (Shrugs. Looks back at camera)  The box.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't know who made it or why.  I only know what it does.  It hurts.  It hurts.   (Looks off to side as if listening.)  How?  (Looks back)  I don't know.  It kind of opens itself.  Your fingers move.  You learn. It wants to open, that's the thing.  And it knows when you want to open it.  And it helps.  And it opens.  And then they come.  The Cenobites.  The demons. 
ANGLE ON WALL OF MONITORS 
Multiple images of Kirsty speaking those last few lines. 
Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE NOISE WIPE-OUT. 
Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then freezes in shock. 
ANGLE ON MONITORS 
- as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears: 
A hazy, black-and-white image (very grainy, like early experimental TV images) of a thirtysomething man in early twentieth century military uniform. 
The man - ELLIOTT - stares directly out of the monitor screen and, just as Kirsty finishes her last line ("The cenobites. The demons."), he speaks (in an English accent). 
ELLIOTT (on monitor) She's telling the truth, Joey. 
Another BURST of WHITE NOISE and the image is gone. 
Kirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others. 
KIRSTY Look, you can have me tell this ... 
Joey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock. What the hell is going on?

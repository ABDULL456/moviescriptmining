BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Here we go, honey! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Ready, Violet? Ready? Now! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
This is gonna be rough! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
The robot's in the financial district. Which exit do I take? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Traction Avenue. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
That'll take me downtown. I take Seventh, don't I? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Don't take Seventh! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Great, we missed it! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
You asked me how to get there and I told you. Exit at Traction! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
That'll take me downtown! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
He's coming up! Get in the right lane! Signal! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Not Traction! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
You're gonna miss it! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Is everybody okay back there? 
VIOLET 
Super-duper, Dad! 
DASH 
[laughing] Let's do that again. 
[people screaming] 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Wait here and stay hidden. I'm going in. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines? I don't think so. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I'm asking you to wait with the kids. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
And I'm telling you not a chance. You're my husband. I'm with you for better or worse. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I have to do this alone. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
What is this to you? Playtime? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
No. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
So you can be Mr. lncredible again? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

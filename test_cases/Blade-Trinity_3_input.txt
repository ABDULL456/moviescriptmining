ABIGAIL 
jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat.  Long tresses of hair spill around her shoulders.  She's not mousy at all.  In fact, she's beautiful.  And cut like an Olympic athlete.  And equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons. 
Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH!  Abigail plants her heel in his face, SMASHING IN his nose.  She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again. Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as -- 
-- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING -- 
Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat -- 
-- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES -- 
FOLLOWING ABIGAIL 
as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE secured to her back.  She holds the crescent in the center, the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and -- 
CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping outward into a three-foot long metal arc.  Connecting the two ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER. 
Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm.  His arm falls, ASHING.  Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter -- 
Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling away to reveal Abigail in the background -- 
Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life. 
Abigail gives her UV arc a twist.  It retracts.  She secures it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking "bloop" GUN with a large barrel.  She FIRES -- 
A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up -- 
Dingo goes down again.  He panics, trying to scrape the gunk off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap. 
Abigail calmly approaches.  She stands over Dingo, staring down at him with a look of cruel indifference.  She holsters her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE -- 
ABIGAIL Scream if this hurts, chica. 
-- and SLAMS the stake into his chest. 
WIDEN OUT 
Abigail turns, surveying her work.  The ashen remains of the vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers.  In thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all. 
A train approaches, pulls into the station.  PASSENGERS disembark, flood the platform.  They tramp all over the ashes of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter. 
Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Whistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding ring on his hand.  He slowly spins it around his finger. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Blade sits before a small Buddhist shrine, meditating. Incense burns.  His sword rests in a ceremonial holder.  Near silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside. 
CLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE 
We hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS. These are Blade's thoughts.  The inner demons he is constantly trying to tame.  The sounds CRESCENDO and -- 
--	Blade opens his eyes.  He listens.  Something is wrong. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Blade creeps into the outer room, sword drawn. 
NOISE behind him, turns to see -- 
WHISTLER 
standing in the shadows, clutching a handgun. 
WHISTLER What is it? 
BLADE What you've been worrying about. 
They listen.  Just the sound of the ocean swell.  Then -- 
A WINDOW SHATTERS 
TWO ARMORED SWAT AGENTS lower in on rappelling lines. 
TWO MORE AGENTS 
CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in. They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS.  As Blade moves to engage them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory --

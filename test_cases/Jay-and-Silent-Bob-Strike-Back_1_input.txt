A.D. Or House Party Three? 
CHAKA Shut the fuck up! 
Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock- Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill-shot, when we hear-- 
JAY (O.S.) YO-BITCH-FISTS! 
Cock-Knocker turns to see-- 
Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One). 
JAY Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg. 
Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong Saber. 
CHAKA (from behind the monitor) I think George Lucas is going to sue somebody-- 
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY 
Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside the flashing red light. 
WILLENHOLLY (looking around) So, this is Hollywood? (suddenly full of purpose) Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent Bob. 
Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY 
The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two shots, O.C. 
WILLENHOLLY FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!! 
Willenholly goes wide-eyed. 
It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses. 
WILLENHOLLY Oh my God-- (to kids) Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm on the wrong, uh--wrong set. 
The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the O.C. Willenholly. 
KID You killed Mooby-- (to Kids) LET'S GET HIM!!! 
The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as he's attacked. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME 
Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle. 
COCK-KNOCKER (breaking character) You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek! 
Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other hand. 
COCK-KNOCKER (to O.C. Chaka) CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A "CUT"! 
On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire). 
Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, Jay grins at Cock-Knocker. 
JAY Now whose balls have been busted, bitch? 
Suddenly, a gun shot rings out. 
All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun first on Jay, then Bob. 
WILLENHOLLY The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and Silent Bob! (revealing badge: calling out) Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal Wildlife Marshal. These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey. 
VOICE (O.S.) They didn't really steal that monkey. 
All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows. Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops. 
JUSTICE It was just a diversion so we could steal these. 
Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them. 
JUSTICE And they're not the leaders of C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real. 
WILLENHOLLY No--the clit's real. The female orgasm is a myth. 
JUSTICE (to Jay) Are you guys alright?

79   INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY                                          79 
Nick enters, moves through the bullpen. ADAs (assistant district attorneys) are working and grimly focused. Nick pokes his head into Sarah's office. She looks up. 
NICK What do we have so far?                                * 
80   EXT. PRISON - DAY                                                 80 
A HIGH-END DELIVERY VAN bearing the logo of La Traviata is waved through the gate into the delivery entrance... 
SARAH (V.O.)                             * He's got no next-of-kin. No family                     * since his wife and daughter were                       * killed... 
81   EXT. AERIAL SHOT - DAY                                            81 
THE FBI HELICOPTER THUNDERS over beautiful green hills... 
SARAH (V.O.) He's a tinkerer. Little inventions                     * and gizmos... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          54. 
82   INT. NICK'S OFFICE - DAY                                          82 
Nick gazing out the window, Cantrell seated with his dog, Sarah reading the report thus far: 
SARAH ...he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the last ten years. He's invested a lot of it in real estate. Weird stuff. 
CANTRELL Weird how? 
SARAH Properties with no real value. Around                  * airports, chemical plants. Stuff                       * nobody wants... 
83   INT. CELLBLOCK - DAY                                              83 
A CONVICT comes to his bars, peering out...                         * 
CONVICT                                  * Motherfucker... 
...because here comes the rolling La Traviata cart -- gleaming domes keeping food warm, silver utensils, crisp linens, a ROSE in a bud vase. A red-jacketed LA TRAVIATA WAITER is pushing the cart, accompanied by GUARDS and Warden Iger. 
More cons appear at their bars, faces peering, an angry grumble growing in the cellblock as the cart goes by. The waiter's looking around, nervous... 
SARAH (V.O.) He votes. He gives money to charity, mostly victim's funds... 
84   INT. OFFICE - DAY                                                 84 
SARAH ...but he also gives a big chunk to macular research. 
CANTRELL (looks up) He donates to eye research? 
SARAH RPI. That's the charity you work with, isn't it? 
CANTRELL Huh. Strange. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         55. 
85   INT. CELL - DAY                                                  85 
The waiter, hemmed by guards, nervously reads the order: 
WAITER ...consomm√©...sea bass...squab...                     * New York strip, rare...a variety of                   * pates... 
CLYDE Rack of lamb? 
WAITER ...oh, yes, rack of lamb... 
86   EXT. NEW JERSEY HILLTOP - DAY                                    86 
THE HELICOPTER ROARS IN, lands. Davies and his men jump out. 
AN FBI GROUND TEAM is waiting for them. A CAMDEN FIELD AGENT runs up and points at the ground, shouting: 
FIELD AGENT WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE! SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND PLANTED SOD OVER IT! 
Davies signals his team. SHOVELS AND PICKS hit the ground... 
87   INT. CELL - DAY                                                  87 
...while GORGEOUS FOOD hits paper plates. It's being slopped unceremoniously from the fine china by the guards. TILT UP to Iger overseeing this process, passing china and utensils to the waiter, who's flustered: 
WAITER You're bruising the crepes. 
GUARD Life's a bitch, then you die. 
IGER ...no plates, they break into nice jagged pieces...nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp...no forks, no knives, no spoons....lose that carafe...we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening, thank you...you can eat with your fingers... 
CLYDE The guards will think me gauche. 
Clyde's got the rose, teasing his nose with it. All around        * the cellblock, inmates are shouting insults and threats... 
BLUE    -   9-19-08                                         56. 
88   INT. OFFICE - DAY                                                 88 
Sarah is exiting, leaving Nick and Cantrell to stare at the phone and wait for it to ring... 
NICK (calls after her) Thanks. Keep digging.

DIDO (trying to understand) And what...what is that? 
JOHN The slaves were intentionally drowned, that is not in question. Chained! Thrown into the waters - chained together as one. (MORE) 
JOHN (CONT'D) They were diseased - worth more as dead insured merchandise, than as alive spoiled goods. (stark) The captain hoped it would `pay' to kill them. ON DIDO as colour drains from her face.   Nausea rises... 
His eyes try to read hers, becoming sensitive. As he moves back towards her. She struggles to take it in. JOHN (CONT'D) Miss Lindsay....? DIDO But the insurers are appealing. 
JOHN Yes. They are challenging the decision of the lower court - refusing to pay for murdered slaves. 
Her eyes sting. JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he touches her hand absentmindedly, startling her, but their eyes remain locked. She attempts, weakly, to return self- possession. Then almost a whisper... 
DIDO Thank you. 
That is, thank you for telling me what nobody else has! 
She turns, walks away.    ON DIDO, as her pace quickens. 
37   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 7           37    * ON DIDO, urgently rifling through files, shelves - chaotic. She moves to a desk, pulls open drawers - REVEAL volumes and volumes of news pamphlets. A set of them bound, LORD MANSFIELD'S wax seal hanging from the cord. She unties the cord, wax seal all over her hands. She fingers her way through the pile - legal headlines...all referring to Lord Mansfield. She stops dead... 
POV - pamphlet cover...image of LORD MANSFIELD, drooping bottom lip touching the ground - foolish and dithering, whilst beside him a `Negro' slave wields a judge's' gavel. 
A headline - `Slave Cargo Deliberately Drowned to save ship - Mansfield Dithers on Zong Insurance'. DIDO stares hard... DIDO (whispers) Papaa. 
She runs her fingers across the caricature, pained - then moves urgently to the next pamphlet, and the next... More MANSFIELD caricatures - a big nose, fat lips, all with Zong headlines:'Mansfield to Rule on "Disposable Slaves" ` The library door suddenly opens, jolting DIDO. 
ELIZABETH There you are! DIDO is frozen, says nothing. ELIZABETH stares from the doorway - why does DIDO look so strange? ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We are requested. You - drawing room. I, relegated to the ladies' Palour! 
She disappears leaving DIDO bewildered. 
38   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR. DAY. 7                 38    * 
ELIZABETH stands before LADY MANSFIELD. 
LADY MANSFIELD We are to attend London for the Season. ELIZABETH'S eyes are wide. 
39   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY. 7                   39    * 
DIDO mirrors ELIZABETH. 
DIDO We are to finally `come out'??

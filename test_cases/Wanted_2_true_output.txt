Patrons stand in line at a post office, but the'CAMERA PUSHES PAST THEM, finding a black and white "WANTED" poster of Wesley, describing all the killings he's responsible for. It holds tight on the picture. 
WESLEY (V.0.) I've learned that all of us are unique, even though sometimes we're too fucking blind to see it. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 
The door to the safehouse opens, and Anna, Wesley and Andrew step out into the bright sunlight. Wesley is carrying his little brother. 
They turn and head up the street, toward the eastern sun. The CAMERA RISES UP, UP, UP, where it hovers for a minute... and just when we think it is going to leave the planet... 
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D) And I learned, the easiest place to hide is in plain sight. .it comes back DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, until it finds... 
INT. TYPICAL INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY 
..Wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another cubicle maze, pecking away at his keyboard. A sign attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl" Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties, wishing they were anywhere else. A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk. 
RECEPTIONIST You're the new guy, huh? 
WESLEY Just started last week. 
RECEPTIONIST Where'd you move here from? 
WESLEY All over the place, really. Nothing too exciting. 
RECEPTIONIST Well, welcome to the team. Just watch out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the back first chance he gets. Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up. 
BROKAW Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes to get to? The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does. 
BROKAW (CONT'D) Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun bags, I'll give her that. 
He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space. 
BROKAW (CONT ' D ) Jim, right? 
WESLEY Yes, sir. 
BROKAW Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started off on the wrong foot here, but we.have numbers to make and if we don't make those numbers, it's my ass on the line. And if my ass gets chewed out by regional, I can guarantee.that your ass is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm not sure how they ran things... Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and-- further, until the words become gibberish, just like they did with Janice. Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time to hear... 
BROKAW (CONT'D) .so do we understand each other? 
WESLEY Of course. 
BROKAW Good boy. With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up his ass that they look like they may burst at any second. Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads 11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the receptionist's desk. She looks up, bites her lower lip... 
WESLEY You want to take a break with me? 
RECEPTIONIST Sure! She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting for the doors to open. 
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) You know, we don't usually get breaks. 
Just then, the elevator doors DING.

MARGARET 
(TO GINTY) I'll take Biddy to get ready for her dance. 
(BEAT) Where's your father? Margaret sees the direction of Ginty's gaze. Her face falls but she takes Biddy by the hand and heads for the stage. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Come on Biddy. 
INT. REFRESHMENT TENT - DAY 
Ginty appears in the tent's entrance. On first glance she sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers. Relief begins to dawn and she turns away. It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre. 
TRAVERS Indeed, a published poet-- She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers hand. 
GINTY Father, come and look. Biddy's dancing. 
TRAVERS In a moment, my princess. I'm talking. 
(BEAT) Back in Ireland, I miss her green 
HILLS SO-- 
GINTY But she's-- she really wants you to watch, Dad. You'll miss it. 
TRAVERS Not now Biddy! 
GINTY I'm Ginty. 
TRAVERS Ginty! Shoo! Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his shirt sleeve again. 
GINTY You said don't give up. A waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her away. 
WAITER Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen only in this section of the tent. I think you'll be more comfortable at the far end. 
(BEAT) Are you alright sweetheart? 
GINTY 
(TO WAITER) I'm scared my father is-- Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya, in the entrance. Her mother's face falls and crumples. 
EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS 
Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium. Margaret and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware. 
TRAVERS Good afternoon, distinguished guests, our biggest supporter Mr Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of the bank staff. 
RANDOLPH Why is he speaking for the bank? 
BANK WORKER He's the manager. 
TRAVERS I'm honoured to be here on behalf of the Belhatchett Bank of Australia. Shortly, it will be my very pleasant duty to present the awards to our young performers. But before I begin, I'd like to say a very few words to our very youngest citizens about the role of the - er, the Bank in our community. Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good. 
MARGARET He's using too many `verys'. He always says `very' too much when 
HE'S-- She can't say it. Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret pushes the hand away. 
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Pamela turns away from Don and the Shermans and takes herself to look at a sketch of Mr Banks, pinned to the wall, he still has a moustache. 
DON (as Dawes Snr) Very well, my boy, give me the 
MONEY 
(AS MICHAEL) No I won't I want it to feed the birds! (as Dawes Snr) Banks! 
(AS BANKS) Yes sir. Now Micheal... 
DICK When you deposit tuppence in a bank account, 
(MORE) 
DICK (CONT'D) Soon you'll see that it blooms into credit of a generous amount 
SEMIANNUALLY

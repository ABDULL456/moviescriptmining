CHIGURH Call it. 
PROPRIETOR Call it? 
CHIGURH Yes. 
PROPRIETOR For what? 
CHIGURH Just call it. 
PROPRIETOR Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here. 
CHIGURH You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right. 
PROPRIETOR I didn't put nothin' up. 
CHIGURH Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? 
PROPRIETOR No. 
CHIGURH Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it. A long beat. 
PROPRIETOR Look... I got to know what I stand to win. 
CHIGURH Everything. 
PROPRIETOR How's that? 
CHIGURH You stand to win everything. Call it. 
PROPRIETOR All right. Heads then. Chigurh takes his hand away from the coin and turns his arm to look at it. 
CHIGURH Well done. He hands it across. 
CHIGURH ...Don't put it in your pocket. 
PROPRIETOR Sir? 
CHIGURH Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. 
PROPRIETOR ...Where you want me to put it? 
CHIGURH Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is. He turns and goes. The proprietor watches him. 
EXT. DESERT AIRE - NIGHT

CARLA JEAN Llewelyn? What the hell? Moss enters and the door closes. 
INT. MOSS' TRAILER - LATER

CHARLES She looks a lot better. 
RONNIE Yeah. 
Ronnie shrugs it off. 
INT. PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION - DAY 
Ronnie sits across from a female PSYCHOLOGIST. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Okay, Ronnie, today I'll be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you're competent to enter into the Police Academy. It's really just a formality. Don't want any serial killers working for us, now do we? 
RONNIE No, ma'am, we don't. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with your background. Where are you from? 
RONNIE Born and raised right here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PSYCHOLOGIST Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes? 
RONNIE No, ma'am.   My record is totally clean. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past? 
RONNIE No, ma'am. I believe drugs are the path to self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Any prescription medications? 
RONNIE Yes, for my nerves. A man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with. If you've seen the bloodshed I've seen, you'd be on the meds too. I -- Where are you going with this? 
PSYCHOLOGIST Are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the Communist Party? 
RONNIE I can't believe you'd even ask me that. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Have you ever been in the military? 
RONNIE Yes. 
PSYCHOLOGIST What branch of the military were you in? 
RONNIE The kind of branch that doesn't exist on paper. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PSYCHOLOGIST Okay, here's a real world scenario. You have a gun -- 
RONNIE Finally. 
PSYCHOLOGIST That wasn't really the question, never mind, I think I got that one. Um... here's one. Do you feel like you would work well on a team? 
RONNIE Would I? Yes. Would I be more useful working alone, I would say definitely. I see myself more like a Rambo kind of guy. A man who rolls solo. Taking care of business on his own terms. Kind of like a Superhero or something. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Why do you want to become a cop? 
RONNIE I want to become a cop to help people. The world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. See, I have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there I stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away. Just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. I know I could do some good if I was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Uh-huh. So, what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today? 
RONNIE Maybe Russian gang activity, but you know what? I think I'm gonna have to go with evil on that one too. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PSYCHOLOGIST Okay, I think we're good here. It's been a pleasure, Ronnie. 
RONNIE Thank you, ma'am. 
INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Ronnie's Mom takes a bath and swigs on a bottle. She's drunk and passing out in the tub. Ronnie scrubs her back with a sponge. 
RONNIE I'm telling you, Mom, this police thing could be good for both of us. Not just the fact that I'll be making the streets safer for you, but they have health insurance and a pension plan so I don't have to worry about your medical bills as much. 
MOM I don't care about that bullshit. All I need is a little nip of this good shit right here and I'm ready to walk through the pearly gates. 
RONNIE Mom, I know, but maybe you should stop drinking so much. You're getting up there and you know what the doctor said about your liver. 
MOM I don't tell you how to party, don't tell me how to live my life. I've taken care of you since you were born. 
RONNIE I just worry about you is all. 
MOM Ronnie, don't get your hopes up about this police thing.

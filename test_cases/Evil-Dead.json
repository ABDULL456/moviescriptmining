{"test1_input": "The gold necklace is revealed inside. \nLINDA \nOh Ash, it's beautiful. \nLINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box and holds it around her neck. \nASHLY \n(Fastening it around her neck) I was going to give it to you before we left, but things got so hectic, this is the first chance I've had. Do you like it? \nLINDA moves to a mirror. \nLINDA \nIt's beautiful. I really love it. (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take it off. \n43   EN - CAB \nLightning strikes as something in the woods examines the small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them moves around the house to another window. The silhouette of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside, she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window. She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks at it, then out to the dark woods. \n44   IN - C.B. \nCHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A noise almost like that of something breathing. \n45   EN - CAB \nThe evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering about. \nCHERYL \n(Calling to the woods) Is anybody out there? \nThere is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage toward the woods. \n46   EN - W \nThe breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive. CHERYL stops. \nCHERYL \nI know someone's out there...I heard you...I heard you in the cellar. \nSuddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening. There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves. Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She turns but there is silence again. The winds die down, leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then, all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges from the woods and into the clearing. The force is still following. \n47   EN - CAB \n", "test1_true": "CHERYL \nHelp, help, let me in. Open the door! \nThe evil entity now emerges from the woods. \nCHERYL \nAshly! Linda! Open up! \nCHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran- tically jams one key after another into the lock, but still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer with each key. \nCHERYL \nPlease, someone please! Help me, help meeeee! \nThe evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She pushes him in the door and slams it tightly. \n48   IN - M.R. \nSCOTT \nWhat the hell happ- \nCHERYL \n(In hysterics) It...it tried to kill me. I, I heard a noise and...and I ran and the trees...the trees! \nSCOTT \nWhat are you- \nHe is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others. \nASHLY \nCheryl what's wrong with you? Did something in the woods do this to you? \nCHERYL \nNo, no, no...the woods themselves- The trees- they're alive... \nShe hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs. \nCHERYL \n", "test1_id": 2517, "test2_input": "They're alive... \nLINDA \nAsh, why don't I take her into the bedroom so she can lie down a little- \nCHERYL \n(Cutting her off) -I'm not lying down! I'm not staying here. We're leaving this place, we're leaving this place right now! \nSCOTT \nWait a minute, I'm sure as hell not going anywhere. \nSHELLY \nCheryl- \nASHLY \nCheryl, there's nothing out there. Trees do not attack people. \nCHERYL \nAshly, will you drive me into town or not? \nASHLY \n(Looking at his watch) Right Now? (He realizes how desperate she is) Sure, sure I'll drive you into town. But if you'll just listen to what you're saying, you- \nCHERYL \nI don't care how it sounds. I want to leave this minute. You can bring back my things when you go. \nASHLY \nOkay- if you don't want to stay, I can't make you. \nLINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to the door. \n49   EN - CAB \nASHLY and CHERYL move to the car.

ASHLY tries again. The car will not turn over. A look of dread comes across CHERYL's face. \n51   EN - CAB \nSCOTT and the others join the two outside. \n52   IN - CAR \nCHERYL \nIt's not gonna start. \nASHLY again tries the engine. \nCHERYL \nI know it's not gonna start. It's not gonna let us leave. \nASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time, start- ing up with a roar. ASHLY, worried by CHERYL's condition glances over to her. Confused and upset, CHERYL turns away from ASHLY and looks out her window. They drive off into the night through the wooded mountains toward town. ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest in- tensely for any sign of movement. The concern for his sister is made obvious by the expression on his face. Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows down. \nCHERYL \nWhy are you slowing down? \nASHLY brings the car to a halt. \nCHERYL \nWhat is this? \nASHLY's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens slowly. He flips on the high beams which stab through the evening mist. \n53   EN - B \nThe bridge over the chasm has been torn away. CHERYL is silent as ASHLY walks to the ravine's edge to examine any remains. \n54   IN - CAR \nCHERYL \n(Mumbling to herself) No, no, no, no, no...it's not going to let us leave, it's not going to let us go...it's not gonna let us gooooo! \n55   EN - CAB \nAn axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash- ing upon a log, splitting it in two. SCOTT is chopping wood outside the cabin. Behind him, through a window, CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him. SCOTT sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves away. CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods beyond. The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards on the floor. ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with the tape recorder in front of him. He plugs an earphone in so only he can hear it. SCOTT enters the cabin and passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back outside. \n", "test2_id": 2518, "test3_input": "Cheryl? \nThere is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something wrong, he stops. \nASHLY \nCheryl? \nHe puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight- est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly it withdraws beneath the floor. \nCHERYL \n(A little too sweet) Ash, what are you doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't you recognize me? \nHer voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from the celler. \nASHLY \n(Crying and yelling to the cellar) You bastards! Why are you doing this? Why? \nThere is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more, and she laughs at ASHLY. \nASHLY \nOh...Linda. \nWith newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by the legs and drags her outside. \n83   EN - CAB \nLINDA \nIt's useless, useless, useless. In time we'll come for him, then you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- \nASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin, closing the door behind him. \n84   IN - M.R. \nSCOTT is coughing again. \nSCOTT \nAsh, Ash, please...I don't want to die- but...but I can't stand this pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something. Gimme something to put me out. \nASHLY \nScott, I can't. I- I know it's bad. But I can't be alone now, I can't. I'd lose my mind. \n", "test3_true": "Please Ash, please. \nASHLY \nYou'll get better- you'll see. \nLINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear- ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes. \nASHLY \nYeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be better and we'll both get out of here tomorrow. \nSCOTT \nThere is no tomorrow! You- you've got to kill her and cut- cut her up- your sister too. \nASHLY \nNo, that was only with Shelly. You had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves me. You're delirious- I...I'll get you some water. \nASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips. \nASHLY \nNow, now the sun will be up in an hour or so and we'll get out of here ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly- n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go home together. Wouldn't you like to be going home? You'd like that I'd bet, wouldn't ya? \nThere is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of his mouth. \nASHLY \n...Scott. \nSCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it. She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back- ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach. Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in a deep growl once, then all is quiet. \nASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below, through the back door and out to the work shed. \n85   IN - W.S. \nHe lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body to it with a number of chains which hang from nails along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He turns off the saw. \nASHLY \n(In a whisper) Linda... \nHe drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's body. \n", "test3_id": 2519}

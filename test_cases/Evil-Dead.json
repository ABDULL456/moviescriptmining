Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash. \n2    ED - CAR \nNear by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap- pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view. \n3    ID - CAR \nInside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister. Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear \"Michigan State\" T-shirts, and are students along with the others at that univer- sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen to an old \"Baby Moses And The Thrillers\" song on the radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum. \nSHELLY \n(Singing with the music)... Together, forever... \nSCOTT \nAsh, where are we? \nASHLY \nScotty, watch out! \n8    ED - CAR \nThe truck races closer. \n9    ID - CAR \nTheir steering wheel is locked. \nASHLY \nTurn! \n10   ED - CAR \nAt the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its own lane. \n11   ED - CAR \nThe truck speeds harmlessly past them. \n12   ID - CAR \nASHLY \nDamn it Scott, what the hell was that? You trying to kill us? \nSCOTT \nDon't yell at me, it's your lousy steering wheel. The damn thing jerked right out of my hand. \nASHLY \nI can't understand it. I just had this thing in for a tune-up. \nSHELLY \nRadio's dead too, ace. \nASHLY \nAnd I just had 'em tune up the whole thing yesterday. \nSCOTT \nWell, then take it back 'cause the damn thing don't work. Only thing that works on the whole car is the lousy horn. \nLINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand- father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it begins to tick. \nLINDA \nTa daaaaaa! \nThe others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles. \n24   ET - CAB \nThe cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come. \n25   IT - M.R. \nCHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor- ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust- ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re- mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably. She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched. She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos- sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it. Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar. \n26   IT - K/M.R. \nASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink- ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between her and the trap door. \nASHLY \nWhat're you drawing Cheryl? \nHe picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his shoulder to glance at it. \nCHERYL \nI...I don't know. \nASHLY \nIs it a bible? \nCHERYL \nNo, no it's no bible. (She glances again at the cellar, knowing some- thing is down there) I don't know what it is. \nLINDA \nWell, this one of the clock's not bad. \nLINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front of her to speak secretly. \nASHLY \n(In a whisper) I got it right here. \nWill you stop it? \nLINDA \nScott, leave her alone will ya? \nSCOTT turns toward LINDA. \nSCOTT \nWill you relax, I'm just kidding around. She can take a joke- \nHe stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment, then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL. \nSCOTT \n(Jokingly) I'll get ya. \nWith a napkin, he blots the water from his pants. \nSCOTT \nI'll get ya for this Cheryl. \nASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass. \nASHLY \nI'd like to make a toast for all here this evening. As a greek friend of mine once said, \"Nis-hat-nis-fert- dis-ruben-tu-tar-im.\" \nLINDA \nWhich means? \nSCOTT \nParty down! \nThe laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of wood heard from the main room. \nSCOTT \nWhat the hell... \nAll stand from the table and hurry to the main room. \n29   IN - M.R. \nWhat melodrama! What courage! A kiss my brave hero. \nSCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends the narrow steps into the cellars blackness. \nSHELLY \nI, your virgin queen eagerly await the precious moment when you will ascend. \nSCOTT \nVirgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- \nHe disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and ASHLY wait above. \nASHLY \n(Calling down) Hey Scott, see any- thing? \nThere is no answer. \nASHLY \nHey Scott!...Scott! \nSHELLY \nHe's just kidding around. \nThere is silence. \nSHELLY \nIsn't he? \nNo sounds come from the cellar. \nASHLY \nLinda, get me a flashlight. \nLINDA That's the only one we brought up. \nASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle. \nASHLY \nThen get that lantern. \n31   EN - CAB \nIt is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin. \n32   IN - M.R. \nThe group sits huddled around the fireplace talking quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking. \nASHLY \nShhh, listen to this. \nVOICE \nMy name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro- fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology in Dextin university's ancient history department... \nASHLY \nThis is the tape I found downstairs. \nVOICE \n(Continuing)...I am recording this entry from a small cabin in the south- ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am staying with my wife for a few weeks so that I may continue my research un- disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc- iate professors and myself have been excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I believe I have made an important find in that area, and thus the reason for this log. With it, I can keep an ac- curate record of translations from my latest find; the first of six, the others still lost, volumes of ancient Sumarian burial practices and rites. Basically, it is a book of do's and don'ts dealing with the deceased en- titled \"Naturan Demanto\" roughly trans- lated \"Book Of The Dead.\" It is bound in human flesh, and inked with blood of the deceased... \nSCOTT \nJeez, I'd hate to find out what they used for pens. \nVOICE \n(Continuing)...This particular volume deals with demons and demon resurrect- ion. These are of the Katardi family, meaning those forces believed to inhab- it the jungles and woods of man's do- main. The first few pages that I have translated warn that these demons are dangerous, everpresent, and exist primarily through this book. As legend has it, only the sacred high priests of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess these books, for they alone could properly control the resurrected de- mons. It is only through the act of reciting the resurrection passage that these demons would be able to posess the living. For many years, it was thought that this legend- \nCHERYL turns off the machine at this point. \nSCOTT \nHey, what'd you do that for? It was just getting good. \nCHERYL \nI just don't want to hear any more that's all. \nSCOTT \n(Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's scared. \nASHLY \n(In a whisper) Shut it off. \nVOICE \nKanda! \n39   EN - CAB \nThe winds howl, and blackbirds fly from their nests, screaming. \n40   IN - M.R. \nCHERYL \n(Louder now) Shut it off. \nASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear. \nVOICE \nKanda! \n41   EN - CAB \nA bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder crash is deafening. \n42   IN - M.R. \nCHERYL can no longer control herself. She screams and covers her ears. \nCHERYL \nShut it offffff! \nThe window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room. ASHLY turns to SCOTT. \nASHLY \nScott, you knew not to play it, I mean...I mean you knew it was upset- ting her. You just don't know when you're carrying something too far. \nSCOTT \n(To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY) Big deal, it's just a joke, shit. \nSCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles to himself along the way. \nSCOTT \nThe gold necklace is revealed inside. \nLINDA \nOh Ash, it's beautiful. \nLINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box and holds it around her neck. \nASHLY \n(Fastening it around her neck) I was going to give it to you before we left, but things got so hectic, this is the first chance I've had. Do you like it? \nLINDA moves to a mirror. \nLINDA \nIt's beautiful. I really love it. (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take it off. \n43   EN - CAB \nLightning strikes as something in the woods examines the small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them moves around the house to another window. The silhouette of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside, she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window. She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks at it, then out to the dark woods. \n44   IN - C.B. \nCHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A noise almost like that of something breathing. \n45   EN - CAB \nThe evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering about. \nCHERYL \n(Calling to the woods) Is anybody out there? \nThere is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage toward the woods. \n46   EN - W \nThe breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive. CHERYL stops. \nCHERYL \nI know someone's out there...I heard you...I heard you in the cellar. \nSuddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening. There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves. Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She turns but there is silence again. The winds die down, leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then, all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges from the woods and into the clearing. The force is still following. \n47   EN - CAB \nThey're alive... \nLINDA \nAsh, why don't I take her into the bedroom so she can lie down a little- \nCHERYL \n(Cutting her off) -I'm not lying down! I'm not staying here. We're leaving this place, we're leaving this place right now! \nSCOTT \nWait a minute, I'm sure as hell not going anywhere. \nSHELLY \nCheryl- \nASHLY \nCheryl, there's nothing out there. Trees do not attack people. \nCHERYL \nAshly, will you drive me into town or not? \nASHLY \n(Looking at his watch) Right Now? (He realizes how desperate she is) Sure, sure I'll drive you into town. But if you'll just listen to what you're saying, you- \nCHERYL \nI don't care how it sounds. I want to leave this minute. You can bring back my things when you go. \nASHLY \nOkay- if you don't want to stay, I can't make you. \nLINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to the door. \n49   EN - CAB \nASHLY and CHERYL move to the car. ASHLY helps CHERYL in then then gets in the drivers side. \n50   IN - CAR \nCHERYL \n56   IN - M.R. \nFrom inside, LINDA speaks. \nLINDA \nCheryl, wanna play some cards? \nCHERYL \n(Turning with a smile) Uh-uh. \nCHERYL turns to face the window again. \nLINDA \nHey, tomorrow morning, we'll find some way around that cliff into town okay? \nCHERYL \nOkay. \nOutside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with the ear plug. \nVOICE \nMarch 12th. Suzanne came after me and almost murdered me. My own wife. At first I thought it was a mental or physical disorder because of what had happened to her eyes, but I was only fooling myself. I knew what it was. \nOutside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds up one in particular. \nSHELLY \nOkay, guess this card. \nLINDA \nHow am I going to know what card that is? \nSHELLY \nGuess, I'm going to see if you're psychic. \nThe card is a two of clubs. \nLINDA \nOkaaaay...is it a queen? \nSHELLY \nOh my God, what suit? \nLINDA \nDiamonds, no wait! I mean hearts! \nSHELLY \nThat's right- seven of hearts! \nLINDA \nHey Ash, did you see that? I guessed two cards in a row. \nASHLY \n(Still not paying attention) How do you do it Linda? \nHe is concentrating on the tape. \nVOICE \nThis is when I saw the dark figures moving about in the woods. I should have never tampered with the \"Book Of The Dead.\" I now know that what- ever it is I have resurrected through this book, is coming for me. \nLINDA \nYou know, I always thought I had some sort of extra sense. You know, like e.s.p or something. \nSHELLY \nWhat's this one? \nShe holds up the queen of spades. \nLINDA \nAnother seven! \nSHELLY \nI don't believe it! \nCHERYL \n(Still looking outside) Queen of spades. \nCHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly. \nLINDA \nLook at her eyes. \nSCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them, but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward, then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon. LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book- case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight. SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the chain across the hatch. \n57   IN - LB \nLater that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping. ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks to the door, closing it quietly behind him. \n58   IN - M.R. \nASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet. \nSCOTT \nShe'll be okay Ash, she just took a bad bump. \nASHLY \n(Quietly) Yeah. \nSCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond. \nASHLY \nWe've still got a few hours before morning. \nSHELLY \nI don't know if I can wait that long. \nSCOTT \nYou have to. We all have to. Then, once it's light out, we'll try to find a way to get around that chasm. \nSHELLY \n(Covering her ears) Why does she keep making those horrible noises? \nASHLY \nI don't know. \nSHELLY \nEverything's gonna be okay. Come morning- you'll see. \nSHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock. It stands silent. \n63   EN - CAB \nAgain, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another. She begins to undress near the window. The force now moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window. She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late. \n64   IN - M.R. \nA noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room. \nSCOTT \nShelly, are you okay? \nShe does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns to ASHLY. \nSCOTT \nKeep an eye on Cheryl for a minute. \n65   IN - S.B. \nSCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing amidst the shadows. \nSCOTT \nShelly? \nHe looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows upon the curtains. \n66   IN - S. BATH \nSCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it. \nSCOTT \nShelly? \nHe pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT. Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's face and clothes with her nails. \n67   IN - S.B. \nScreaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY still upon him biting at his throat. \n68   IN - M.R. \nBury her. \nASHLY \nYou...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend of ours isn't she? \nSCOTT \nAsh, she's dead. \nASHLY moves away from SCOTT. \nSCOTT \nShelly's dead. We're gonna bury her now. \nASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly. \n69   EN - CAB \nFinally, the body is dragged outside and buried near the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the task look very stark and barren. \n70   IN - M.R. \nSCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's room to check in on her. \n71   IN - L.B. \nHe peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully. \n72   IN - M.R. \nASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load- ing new batteries into a flashlight. \nSCOTT \nI saw an old hiking trail when we were driving up here. Now I don't know if it goes all the way around that gorge- \nASHLY \n-Or if it's even still in tact. \nSCOTT \nOr if it's even still in tact. But uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good care of Linda. \nASHLY \nIt's me Linda. \nLINDA \nAsh, I had a bad dream about Linda. \nASHLY \nYou did baby? \nLINDA \nYeah. She's all right isn't she? \nASHLY \nYeah. Fine. \nLINDA \nIs Shelly okay too Ash? \nASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver. \nASHLY \nYeah, sure. She's sleeping that's all. \nLINDA \nAsh, I love you. (She turns over) \nASHLY \nGet some rest. \nASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few hours ago engulfs him once more. \n76   IN - M.R. \nASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks. \nCHERYL \nYou lied to her. You lied to Linda. Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead. Don't you know the difference? You killed her. You and Scott cut her up with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha- ha-ha- \nASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again. \nCheryl? \nThere is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something wrong, he stops. \nASHLY \nCheryl? \nHe puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight- est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly it withdraws beneath the floor. \nCHERYL \n(A little too sweet) Ash, what are you doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't you recognize me? \nHer voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from the celler. \nASHLY \n(Crying and yelling to the cellar) You bastards! Why are you doing this? Why? \nThere is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more, and she laughs at ASHLY. \nASHLY \nOh...Linda. \nWith newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by the legs and drags her outside. \n83   EN - CAB \nLINDA \nIt's useless, useless, useless. In time we'll come for him, then you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- \nASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin, closing the door behind him. \n84   IN - M.R. \nSCOTT is coughing again. \nSCOTT \nAsh, Ash, please...I don't want to die- but...but I can't stand this pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something. Gimme something to put me out. \nASHLY \nScott, I can't. I- I know it's bad. But I can't be alone now, I can't. I'd lose my mind. \n86   EN - CAB \nAn evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial. He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel. Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel and looks at her. She appears to be dead. \n87   IN - M.R. \nInside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to loosen. \n88   EN - CAB \nASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt. \n89   IN - M.R. \nCHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the trap door in tact. \n90   EN - CAB \nASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream- ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on the ground. \nASHLY \nStay back. \nHis hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA advances toward him, laughing. \nASHLY \nLinda please, if you can still hear me. Keep away. \nHis fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream, she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk- ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls. He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin. \n91   IN - M.R. \nInside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body. \nASHLY \nOh..... \nIt is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut. A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the rifle again and cautiously moves to the door. \n92   IN - S.B. \nHe enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him. He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL backs away and spots the open front door. \nASHLY \n", "test1_input": "SCOTT \nWell, the guy that's renting it says it's an old place, little run down, but it's right up in the mountains- totally secluded. (He takes a drink from the bottle) Best part is, we get it so cheap. \nLINDA \nWhy are we getting it so cheap? \nSCOTT \nI don't know, might be in real bad shape. \nCHERYL \nYou mean nobody's seen this place yet? \nSCOTT \nNot yet. \nASHLY \nMight not be too bad. \nLINDA \nNo... \nASHLY \nActually, it might be very nice. \nLINDA \nYeah... \nSHELLY \nIt's probably a real pit. \nCHERYL \nI can't believe that we're renting a place for a week-end that nobody's seen. \nSCOTT \n(Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ, not this again... \n", "test1_true": "(Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and dad would never let us go up to a place like this if they knew- \nASHLY \n-Which is exactly why they don't know. I'll tell you who I am gonna call. The guys that fixed up this car. \n15   ED - CAR \nThe car approaches an exit along the highway. \n16   ID - CAR \nASHLY glances at the map again. \nASHLY \nHey, I think this is where we get off. \n17   ED - CAR \nThe car turns off the main highway and follows several back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that winds upward along a twin set of mountains. \n18   ID - CAR \nSCOTT glances up to the peaks. \nSCOTT \nThese mountains seem familiar. \nLINDA \nWhat do they remind you of? Some- thing majestic? Adventure? \nSCOTT \nYeah, more like adventure. \nLINDA \nAny adventure in particular? \nSCOTT \nShelly's sweater. \n", "test1_id": 2517, "test2_input": "ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly, and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself. \nSHELLY \n(Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it Scotty, when you least expect it, you're gonna get it good. \n19   ED - B \nFinally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses. \n20   ED - CAB \nIt is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin- ues to sputter and backfire. \n21   ID - CAR \nASHLY reacts to his car. \nASHLY \nI...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up. but I'm just not paying for it. \nLINDA \nThis place is perfect. \nCHERYL \nThe woods come awfully close to the house don't they? \nSCOTT \nSo what's wrong with the woods, they can't bite ya. \nCHERYL \nIt's just a little claustrophobic that's all. \nLINDA \nWell, I think it's beautiful. \nSHELLY \nMe too, it's gonna be a bomb week- end. \n22   ED - CAB \n", "test2_true": "SCOTT \nIt's supposed to be one of these on here. \nAfter trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door. \n23   ID - M.R. \nThe interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway for a moment, then enters to find the light switch. The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen, and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye. \nSCOTT \nHey, this place has a dungeon. \nCHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring to SHELLY. \nSCOTT \nPut these back will you? \nSHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the hatch but cannot. \nSCOTT \nThey nailed it shut. \nCHERYL \nGood, I don't like cellars. Probably just some garbage down there anyways. \nSCOTT \nCheryl, they don't nail garbage in cellars. I mean it's not going to try and get out or anything. \nCHERYL \nWell, what's down there? \nSCOTT \nWell, could be any number of things. Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead bodies- \nLINDA \nHey, look at this! \n", "test2_id": 2518, "test3_input": "You'll see. \nHe looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone. She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor- rible rasping sounds. \nSCOTT \nIt's, it's not gonna let us leave... Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're all gonna die here... \nASHLY \nWe're not gonna die! \nSCOTT \n...All gonna die. All of us. \nASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently. \nASHLY \nWe're not gonna die! We're not gonna die! We're getting out of here! Now listen to me- is there a way around the chasm. \nSCOTT passes out. \nASHLY \nScotty. Scott! \nASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles. \nSCOTT \nJesus Ash. I don't want to die. So... so lonely to die like this. You're not gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash? \nCHERYL \n(Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to die. So lonely to die like this. You're not gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- \nASHLY \nScott, is there some way around the chasm? \nSCOTT \nAsh, I'm scared- I...I can't feel my legs. \nASHLY \n", "test3_true": "SCOTT \nThere is...one way, the trail...but the trees, they know...don't you see- they're alive!! They're ali-ahhhhhhh! \nHis sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain. Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred. \nASHLY \nShut up! \nShe continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety and places the barrels against LINDA's head. \nASHLY \nGod forgive me Linda. \nThe laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle. \nLINDA \nAsh, oh Ash, help Me! Please. \nShe hugs him tightly. \nLINDA \nDon't let them take me away again, please, please, please. \nASHLY \n(Crying and holding her tightly) I won't, I won't- I promise. \nCHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar. \nCHERYL \nAshly? Ashly, help me. Let me out of here. I'm all right now. \nASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar. LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace. \nCHERYL \nI'm all right now, Ashly. I'm all right. Come unlock this chain and let me out. \nASHLY \n", "test3_id": 2519}

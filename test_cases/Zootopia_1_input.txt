HOPPS Yes. What I mean is, thousands of years ago... um... predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. 
Nick doesn't like what he's hearing. 
REPORTER (O.S.) Of course they did. 
Nick looks at the posters of the muzzled animals and shakes his head, disbelieving. FLASH BACK to his memory of being muzzled as a child. 
MEAN KID ANIMAL (V.O.) (during flashback) Aw, is he gonna cry. 
REPORTER (O.S.) (on Nick, as flashback ends) Officer Hopps, could it happen again? 
HOPPS It is possible. So we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you... 
This sends the Press into an absolute frenzy. 
PRESS Will more mammals go savage? / What is being done to protect us? / Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators? 
Bellwether steps in, eager to put an end to the questions. 
BELLWETHER Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions... 
Bellwether ushers Hopps off stage. 
HOPPS Was I okay? 
BELLWETHER Oh, you did fine. 
Hopps walks across the lobby to Nick, completely unaware that she just started a controversy. 
HOPPS (excited) That went so fast! I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we-- 
NICK (upset) Oh, I think you said plenty. 
HOPPS What do you mean? 
NICK (sarcastic, hard) Clearly, there's a biological component? These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Are you serious? 
HOPPS I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage... 
NICK Right. But a fox could? Huh? 
HOPPS Nick, stop it. You're not like them. 
NICK Oh, there's a them now? 
HOPPS You know what I mean. You're not that kind of predator. 
NICK The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent? 
Hopps sighs guiltily. 
NICK (CONT'D) Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. (escalating anger) So let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? (Hopps looks heartbroken) Do you think I might go nuts? Do you think I might go savage? Do you think I might try to... EAT YOU?! 
He lunges, like he's going to bite her. She flinches and unthinkingly puts her hand on the repellent. 
NICK (CONT'D) (calm, hurt) ...I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me... 
He shoves the application at her. 
NICK (CONT'D) Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. 
As he walks away, he takes off the sticker badge, crumples it and tosses it away. 
HOPPS No. Nick. Nick! 
REPORTER 5 Officer Hopps! Were you just threatened by that predator? 
HOPPS No. He's my friend. 
REPORTER 6 We can't even trust our own friends? 
HOPPS That is not what I said! Please! 
REPORTERS Are we safe? / Have any other foxes gone savage? 
But no one will listen. Not anymore.

LARRY This guy you're obsessed with, what's his name again? 
MAYA Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti is the nom de guerre. His true name, we think, is Ibraheem Sayeed. His family lives in Kuwait. 
LARRY Wasn't it, like, eight brothers - and a million cousins - that we know about - anyone could be calling home - 
MAYA I know - 
LARRY - It's not like he's saying, "Hey mom, it's me, the terrorist." 
MAYA Over the course of two months, he's called home from six different pay phones, from two different cities, never using the same phone twice. And when his mother asked him where he was, he lied. He said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception -- implying he was in the Tribals -- but he was in 
(MORE) 
MAYA (CONT'D) a market in Peshawar. I'm sorry, but that's not normal guy behavior. That's tradecraft. 
LARRY Maybe he just doesn't like his mom? 
(PAUSE) Look, if he talks about an operation, or refers to anything remotely fishy, I'll get on him. Okay? 
MAYA No. Not okay. Look, Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his hand by talking about ops on the phone: he works for bin Laden. The guys that talk about ops on the phone don't get that job. Larry looks away. 
MAYA (CONT'D) A lot of my friends have died trying to do this. 
(PAUSE) I believe I was spared so I could finish the job. The girl is a true believer - as pure as they come. Larry looks at her. Her sincerity is persuasive. And just like that, he decides to help her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KOTLI CALL CENTER - RAWALPINDI, PAKISTAN 
Hakim walks through a crowded call center. Larry joins him from a back entrance. They look around: nothing. 
EXT. RAWAL CALL CENTER - PAKISTAN 
Hakim parks in front of the Rawal Call Center. 
INT. RAWAL CALL CENTER - PAKISTAN - ANOTHER DAY 
The call center is arranged into two rows of cubby-holes, each separated by a privacy wall. Hakim searches the place, finds nothing. 
CUT TO: CU TV SCREEN: News reports of the attemped NYC bombing. 
REPORTER (O.S.) It is in surveillance video and pictures like this of the explosive- laden vehicle just moments before it was parked, that police hope to find the man who wanted so badly last night to leave a body count in Times Square. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION CUBICLE HALLWAY 
The TV news report continues playing in the bg. Bradley is moving as fast down a hallway. Coming towards him like a shark from the other end of the hallway: Maya. Bradley looks determined not to deal with her right now, and lowers his head, but she spreads her arms slightly and basically blocks his passage through the hallway 
MAYA I really need to talk to you about beefing up our surveillance operation on the caller. 
BRADLEY We don't have a surveillance operation on the caller. (turning to Maya) Someone just tried to blow up Times Square and you're talking to me about some facilitator who some detainee seven years ago said might have been working with Al Qaeda? Maya is practically shaking with zealous rage at her inability to bend Bradley to her will. 
MAYA He's the key to bin Laden. 
BRADLEY I don't fucking care about bin Laden. I care about the next attack. You're going to start working on American Al Qaeda cells. Protect the homeland. 
MAYA bin Laden is the one who keeps telling them to attack the homeland. 
(MORE) 
MAYA (CONT'D) If it wasn't for him, Al Qaeda would still be focused on overseas targets. If you really want to protect the homeland, you need to get bin Laden. 
BRADLEY 
(ANGRY) This guy never met bin Laden. This guy is a free lancer working off the fucking internet. No one has even talked to bin Laden in four years: he's out of the game, he may well even be dead but you know what you're doing? You're chasing a ghost while the whole fucking network grows all around you! For a moment she is silenced by Bradley's reprimand but then Maya's obsession speaks for her - and like a woman possessed she recklessly goes at him: 
MAYA You just want me to nail some low level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that you can check that box on your resume that says while you were in Pakistan you got a real terrorist. But the truth is you don't understand Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda. Either give me the team I need to follow this lead, or the other thing you're gonna have on your resume is being the first Station Chief to be called before a congressional committee for subverting the efforts to capture or kill bin Laden. 
BRADLEY You're fucking out of your mind. 
MAYA I need four techs in a safe house in Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe house in Peshawar. Either send them out or send me back to DC and explain to the Director why you did it.

PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme. 
ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy? 
PALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace. 
131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT 
ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers. 
132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY 
The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY. 
OBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this. 
He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up. 
OBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir! 
OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole. The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord. 
The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him! 
The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him. OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole. 
133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN 
The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . . 
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. 
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord. 
DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself. 
134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY 
A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush. 
AAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . . 
They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi. 
AAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids? 
BLY: No. 
BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground. 
Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away. 
135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY 
YODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall. 
136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY 
The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react. 
The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES. The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION. 
137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY 
The CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS. 
DARTH SIDIOUS: Execute Order Sixty-Six. 
CLONE PILOT: It will be done, My Lord. 
138 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY 
PLO KOON heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform. 
PLO KOON: There they are. Land on the nearest platform.

The FOUR CLONE PILOTS with PLO KOON drop back and blast him out of the sky.

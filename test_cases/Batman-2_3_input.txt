BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. 
DICK turns.  To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. 
INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT 
We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm.  VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. 
PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. 
VICKI SHUT UP.  Help me with him. 
The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him.  They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa.  VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. 
PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? 
FRICK Yes sir. 
PENGUIN Oh, good.  That does relieve my mind -- 
He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat.  The blood drains out of his face. 
PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? 
INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT 
DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. 
Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. 
INSERT - MONITOR 
The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. 
PENGUIN Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. 
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE 
He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. 
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly -- 
-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! 
INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... 
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER 
DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. 
BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal.  You know what to do. 
DICK nods yes and bolts off. 
INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER 
VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. 
Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME."  FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- 
-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. 
BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI!  RUN!  NOW! 
She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- 
-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!  The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... 
INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT 
VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! 
INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT 
DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. 
He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. 
DICK Here.  You might need it. 
ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick.  And...bravo. 
INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT 
VICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a dial tone -- 
VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? 
VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. 
SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!

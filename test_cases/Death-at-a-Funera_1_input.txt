DEREK I don't want to. 
NORMAN Just do me a favor-- Norman is pushing the cake towards Derek's mouth. 
DEREK Get away from me. Derek gets up and walks off, leaving Norman spitting out the cake. From under the table, Jeff pops up. 
JEFF You haven't seen a pill bottle around, have you? A Valium pill bottle? 
NORMAN No. But can you try this-- Jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor. Jeff slides across the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the other end of the table. An OLDER LADY turns to Russell. 
OLDER LADY Edward and I watched the Tony Awards every year. We would get all dressed up and sip cocktails. I'm going to miss him so much. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Don't worry. The way you look, you won't be far behind. The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his search along the floor.

NORMAN (CONT'D) Death is a terrible thing... Did you check to make sure he.was wearing shoes? I hear they steal the shoes. And I hope you took off his ring, 'cause if it's worth anything, someone is going to take that, too. Cynthia stares at Norman.

AARON You don't understand. If we don't give him the money, he's going to show Mom the picture. 
RYAN Okay. Let me think, let me think. Ryan is trying to come up with a solution. 
RYAN (CONT'D) I think you should pay him the money. 
AARON What do you mean, you think I should pay him the money? Where the hell is all your money? 
RYAN I'm in debt up to my ass. I'm broke, man! 
AARON So after paying for the funeral, the clothes, the catering... Now I'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars? He's your father, too. 
RYAN You're the oldest. Besides, you've been living off Mom and Dad long enough. You must have some money saved. You haven't paid rent in two years. 
AARON I have not been living off of them... I've been living with them.

RYAN (CONT'D) You've got to pay him.

The strident music of the students diminishes.  The ringing of the bell stops.  There remain only JIM's footsteps. 
Long shot.  JIM moving off down the corridor.  PLATO is in f.g. looking after him.  He slams his locker and starts after JIM, moving at the same speed and hovering near the wall.  The footsteps of the two boys echo stonily.  They are alone.  JIM stops at a bulletin board near a bend in the corridor.  PLATO stops too. 
Bulletin board.  JIM looking at the notices.  PLATO drifts in several yards away and hangs near the wall watching JIM who doesn't see him.  JIM reads: 
Insert: Bulletin board, "Attention All Juniors and Seniors"-- Planetarium field trip--2 pm--Sharp!" 
Another angle.  JIM and PLATO as JIM turns from bulletin board and starts away. 
PLATO (clearing his throat) Hi. 
JIM Hi there. 
PLATO You remember me? 
JIM No.  I don't think so-- 
PLATO I'm sorry--I made a mistake. 
JIM starts toward camera as PLATO after another look, turns in the opposite direction and walks away from us, smashing his fist against the wall as he goes.  JIM stops, full in camera.  His face clouds, trying to remember.  He turns full around to look after PLATO, then turns back and continues on his way.  The footsteps fade. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Full shot.  Planetarium seen from the parking lot--a great dome crowns it--the city lies below.  Camera picks up JIM's car maneuvering through the crowded lot.  In b.g. a few other late-comers are dashing up steps to Planetarium.  JIM drives into a small lot behind observator, parks, then runs to observatory entrance. 
Full shot.  Lobby as JIM runs through, opens door of theater and passes inside. 
Long shot.  Sky full of stars seen past JIM's head. Darkness.  This is not our sky.  It is a replica of it projected onto the dome of the Planetarium.  The stars slide their tentative ways in an ever-changing pattern.  One of them is much larger than the rest and increases in size as we watch.  Music of the spheres is heard--a high threatening tremolo. 
LECTURER (O.S.) For many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly bright and increasingly near. 
JIM looks around for a seat and passes down aisle.  Seen beyond him is the projector, moving slowly, its great dumb- bell head sparkling with pin-points of light.  JIM takes a seat in front row.  PLATO, in the row behind him, moves over a seat to be nearer.  They exchange looks. 
Full shot.  Normal students watching intently. 
LECTURER (O.S.) As this star approaches us, the weather will change.  The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer. 
Low angle.  LECTURER.  A dry, elderly man in a stiff white collar.  He is seated at a desk, the light from the reading lamp spilling upward onto his face. 
LECTURER The last of us search the heavens and stand amazed.  For the stars will still be there, moving through their ancient rhythms. 
Angle shot.  Students.  Some watching, some taking notes. An OLD LADY TEACHER in f.g. taps the heads of two kids in the row before her.  They stop their whispering.  She smiles at them. 
LECTURER (O.S.) The familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise. 
Med. shot.  PLATO staring upward. 
LECTURER (O.S.) Orion, the Hunter. 
PLATO looks off. 
Med. shot.  JIM (from PLATO's angle).  JIM is seated in the row ahead of PLATO.  His lips are parted as he looks up. 
JIM Boy! 
PLATO (leaning forward) What? 
JIM (surprised) Once you been up there, you know you been some place! 
LECTURER (O.S.) Gemini, the Twins. 
Two shot.  JUDY and BUZZ.  BUZZ has his arm around her.  He is nuzzling her ear.  She is blandly watching the dome. 
LECTURER (O.S.) (continuing) Cancer, the Crab. 
BUZZ pokes JUDY who looks at him.  He curves his wrist toward her, opening and closing his first two fingers like the pincers of a crab. 
BUZZ I'm a crab! 
She laughs.  So do the others. 
Med. shot. JIM (PLATO behind).  Seen from JUDY's angle.  JIM turns at the sound of the laughter, and smiles. 
LECTURER (O.S.) Taurus, the Bull.

LUCY They're gonna let you make coffee?! 
SAM Set your dreams high, Lucy. Lucy looks at her father lovingly. 
LUCY I'm sorry, Daddy.  It was all my fault. 
SAM No, Lucy.  Don't say that. 
LUCY I wouldn't want any Daddy but you. 
She looks around to see if anybody's writing.  NOBODY IS. She suddenly screams at them: 
LUCY (CONT'D) I said I was sorry!  I said I didn't want any Daddy but him!  Why don't you write that down?! 
INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY 
We hear sobbing and see Rita sitting across from a very rich, very angry COUPLE.  Rita's foot is twitching furiously. 
RITA ...are you telling me that neither of you want custody of your child? 
WOMAN He's created a monster.  He's exactly like him.  He...he... 
The woman is distracted by a loud thumping on Rita's glass wall - it's SAM.  Holding an envelope.  Very distressed, as the Secretary attempts to corral him back into the lobby. 
RITA I am right here with you, excuse me. (she unlocks door) Sam?  Didn't I tell you that you have to call? 
SAM I - 
RITA You know how to make an appointment. 
SAM It's - 
RITA That's ridiculous you can always get Patricia. 
SAM They - 
RITA Good.  I'll see you next week. 
SAM But it's an emergency - lots of three syllable words urgent open at once. 
He hands the letter to Rita.  Rita looks through the glass wall at her clients who are getting impatient. 
RITA They want to have you and Lucy evaluated by a shrink.  The appointment is today at three.  Today.  Now.  Today! 
SAM I know and I want you to object. 
RITA Sam I can't object.  It's court ordered. 
Sam notices that the woman in Rita's office is crying.  He walks in and hands her a handkerchief from his pocket. 
SAM Here.  Don't be sad. 
She looks at him as if he's from Mars.  Rita, now outside her office, watches Sam now inside the office. 
RITA Patricia, I'm in the middle - get him out of there - 
She quickly gets up but Rita's too impatient and pushes past her into the office. 
RITA (CONT'D) Sam.  Sam come with me. (to the Couple) We're gonna get through this excuse us... (to Sam) Sam this is their turn now.  Not yours. Theirs.  If you leave now you'll never make it and you have to make it. 
SAM Okay okay I know I take the #34 bus and transfer to the #13...than the Downtown Express to Wilshire then - 
Rita looks at the Couple leaving her office. 
INT. RITA'S PORSCHE - DAY 
Redefining road rage, Rita's slamming the horn.  Sam next to her. 
RITA Go! Go! GO! for chrissakes!  Green means GO! 
SAM Red means stop yellow in the middle means no no no...I don't like shrinks. I've seen too many shrinks. 
RITA Yeah.  You and me both.  Right or left which will it be you IDIOT!? 
SAM Your mother sent you to shrinks, too?

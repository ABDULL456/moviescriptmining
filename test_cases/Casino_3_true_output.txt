LESTER (Over telephone) Every time I ever see you, that's what I see. 
GINGER (Into telephone) Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. (She hangs up the phone quickly.) 
ACE You all right? 
GINGER (Drinking some champagne, wiping away tears) Yeah. 
ACE Why're you crying? 
GINGER (Laughs) I'm not crying. (Sniffs.) 
ACE walks up behind GINGER. 
ACE Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. 
GINGER I'm okay. I just - (Sniffs) You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay? 
ACE It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? 
GINGER Yeah. 
ACE You're with me now. 
GINGER Yeah. 
ACE Right? 
GINGER Uh-huh. 
ACE You sure? 
GINGER Yeah. Yeah. 
They are reflected in a mirror behind the telephone. 
ACE Want to go? Let's go back in. 
GINGER (Sniffs) Okay. 
ACE's hands pick up a white rose and GINGER's gloves from the desk. 
EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY 
ACE and GINGER drive up to an expensive house which backs on to a country-club golf course. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY 
ACE takes GINGER inside. It is fancy and lush. 
GINGER Oh... 
Through sliding glass doors, we see a patio and a pool area. 
GINGER (Sighing) It's great. 
The living-room has exposed white brick along the walls, bronze ostrich figurines, a white baby grand piano, and a zebra print rug surrounded by a few couches. 
GINGER Oh, it's great. 
INT. ACE'S BEDROOM CLOSET - DAY 
ACE takes GINGER past the bedroom to their huge room-sized closet. There are racks and racks of clothes. 
GINGER (Running into the closet) Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God. 
ACE presents her with a long chinchilla coat. 
GINGER You brought all my stuff. I can - 
She sees the coat. 
ACE Try it on. It's yours. 
He puts it on her. 
GINGER (Whispering) You're kidding? My God. What is it? 
ACE It's chinchilla. 
GINGER (Looking at herself in the mirror) Oh, it's so soft. 
ACE It's nice isn't it? 
GINGER Oh... 
ACE Kisses her. 
GINGER No one's ever been so nice to me. 
They kiss and embrace. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY 
ACE's hand opens a leather case full of gold Bvlgari jewelry. 
GINGER (Gasps) Oh, my God. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY 
ACE and GINGER lie on the bed, surrounded by jewelry. GINGER is swathed in the chinchilla coat. Ace watches as a transfixed GINGER tries on gold necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings. 
GINGER So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day? 
ACE You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises? 
ACE kisses GINGER. 
GINGER You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either. 
ACE The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank. 
GINGER (Putting on a gold bracelet) Come on. Can I keep this one in the house? 
ACE Now look, (gently holding her face, gathering her total attention) pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important. 
GINGER Okay. 
ACE All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. 
EXT. BURBANK PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY 
TITLE IN: 'LOS ANGELES' 
ACE and GINGER get off the Tangiers jet carrying two suitcases. ACE gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows GINGER into a brown Rolls Royce. 
ACE (V.O.) With over a million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas only for Ginger, she was secure and happy. 
INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK - DAY 
ACE and GINGER walk into the bank lobby carrying the suitcases. 
ACE (V.O.) She loved that shit. But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of pay-off cash around. 
INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK/VAULT - DAY 
There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash. ACE and GINGER are closing a large box so crammed with cash that ACE has to lean on it for the clasp to lock. 
ACE (V.O.) Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. 
GINGER Need a little help with that, Mr Collins? 
ACE (V.O.) So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. 
ACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot in the wall. 
ACE (V.O.) And, since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money the most... 
The BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, after which, ACE gives GINGER his key. 
ACE (V.O.) ...I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive. 
INT. BANK PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
GINGER is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers. 
BANKER Now this is just a signature card. 
ACE So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself? 
BANKER That's right. 
We see GINGER looking at ACE. 
BANKER That's the way you wanted it, right? 
ACE nods 
BANKER (Quietly.) Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. 
ACE (Quietly) Yeah, sure I do. Why? 
BANKER No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't. 
ACE Well... 
ACE looks over to GINGER, smiles and winks. She looks back at him. 
INT. TANGIERS LOUNGE - NIGHT 
JERRY VALE sings to a seated audience. ACE sits alone at a table. 
ACE (V.O.) With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered, and to play it safe I switched job titles again and made myself, um, Food and Beverage Director. This way nobody would bother me about a license. I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me. Trouble was... 
NICKY is seated at another table with MARINO, peeling off money and giving it to MIKE, a crooked dealer. 
ACE (V.O.) ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas. 
NICKY (V.O.) To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers. 
MARINO (To MIKE) Don't make us come lookin' for you. 
MIKE Oh, you won't have to look for me. I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky. 
NICKY All right, Mike.

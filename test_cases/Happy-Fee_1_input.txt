THE ADELIES ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! ...We should be migrating out to sea by now! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE We need to huddle! 
THE ADELIES Huddle??! 
MUMBLE Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth! 
He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him. 
THE ADELIES ...Oh yeah, nice. ...That's definitely better. ...Good call big guy. 
MUMBLE I said a circle! 
They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from the upwind position, the Adelies complain. 
AN ADELIE ...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way. 
They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops the FULL BLAST of the GALE. 
He gives up and marches off into the driving snow. 
THE ADELIES ...Hey! ...What happened to the Huddle?! 
MUMBLE (shouts back) Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!! 
The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their fronts 
THE ADELIES ...Oh no, now I got chest pain ...tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) THE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...just keep moving or you'll get my beak up your butt 
FLARE OUT TO WHITE 
The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness. 
One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance. 
They have finally reached the sea again 
MUMBLE You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore? 
LOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'. 
ADELIES ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten" shore ....So what are those black things?. 
Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings 
AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION 
The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing- sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned, and half concealed by snow. 
Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting twisted METALWORK. 
MUMBLE Hello?! Is there anyone out there? 
An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the wind. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Hello!! 
THE ADELIES ...No need to shout. ...Yeah, somebody might hear you. ...I think we seen all there is to see round here. 
LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet.

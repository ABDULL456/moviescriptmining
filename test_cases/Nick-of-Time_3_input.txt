The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to close. 
Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go? 
GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard. 
BODYGUARD Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one. 
ELEANOR GRANT Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters. 
She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE. 
ELEANOR GRANT Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that. 
GENE steps aboard, shakes her hand.

They enter the living room.  Mrs. Williams comes in from the kitchen. 
SANDY (hurrying) Is Dad home? 
MRS. WILLIAMS (shocked at sight) No. 
SANDY You better call him and get an ambulance too. 
Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.  Mrs. Williams goes to call. 
Sandy moves closer.  Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look. 
DOROTHY (crazy) Where have you been? (screams) Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God. 
JEFFREY It's okay. it's okay. 
DOROTHY (like a little girl) My secret lover. 
Mrs. Williams comes in. 
MRS. WILLIAMS The ambulance will be here in a minute. I left word for John. The police are on their way. 
DOROTHY (screams) Don't get the police. Oh God, ...Jeffrey I CAN'T STAND IT!! STOP IT. STOP IT. LOVE ME, 
She looks up at Mrs. Williams. 
DOROTHY (continuing) I opened myself to him. He put his disease in me. 
She presses herself tight to Jeffrey. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Tell me its okay. I opened myself to you. Okay, okay, okay, okay? 
Mrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is causing Sandy.  Sandy is crying now and turns away. 
JEFFREY Sandy? ...Sandy, please. 
MRS. WILLIAMS I'll get a coat for her. 
She leaves the room hurriedly. 
SANDY (crying) Jeffrey? .What's going on? 
JEFFREY Shh. I'll tell you. 
DOROTHY (quietly) They hurt his head. 
JEFFREY Who, Dorothy? 
DOROTHY (whispers) Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!! 
A huge, roaring wind sound comes up. 
Dorothy starts screaming. 
201. EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE - NIGHT 
The SCREAMS DISSOLVE INTO a SIREN as it roars to a stop in front of the Williams' house. 
202. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Dorothy clings to Jeffrey.  Her eyes are turning a dull, milky white.  The effect is horrifying.  She is in shock. 
Sandy is still crying, while she moves back and watches Jeffrey.  Jeffrey turns to look at Sandy. 
SANDY (crying) I still love you Jeffrey. 
Mrs. Williams comes to put a coat around Dorothy.  Mrs. Williams is shaking. 
The Paramedics enter the house. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
203. EXT. WILLIAMS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
The PARAMEDICS are loading Dorothy into the ambulance on a stretcher. Dorothy is moaning.  A sickening, warm wind comes up and howls through the neighborhood. 
JEFFREY I should go with her, Sandy. 
SANDY Go ahead. 
JEFFREY ... Sandy?. 
SANDY Go ahead! 
Jeffrey turns slowly and gets into the ambulance. 
INT. AMBULACE - NIGHT 
Jeffrey's head is very close to Dorothy's.  Dorothy is saying something, mumbling. 
DOROTHY Hold me, Don. 
JEFFREY Don?. Where is he? 
DOROTHY (straining her eyes to focus on Jeffrey) HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him! 
JEFFREY I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

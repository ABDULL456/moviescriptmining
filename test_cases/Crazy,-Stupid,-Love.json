{"train": "HANNAH Is that so? \nJACOB It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you. \nLIZ Multiple times. \n(CONTINUED) 6 CONTINUED: (3) 6 JACOB That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? \nHannah and Liz share a look. \nHANNAH What do you expect me to say to that? \nJACOB Margarita, rocks, salt. \nHANNAH Wow. \nShe STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand. \nHANNAH Okay, time to go. \nLiz doesn't move. \nLIZ I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a CRAP -- \nHANNAH Liz! \nLIZ (whispering to him) Another time, maybe. \nGIGGLING, the girls leave the bar. \n7 INT. LEXUS SUV 7 \nStill driving, Tracy looks at Cal. He remains silent. \nTRACY I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? \nHe keeps staring straight ahead. \nTRACY Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more. Maybe that's good, maybe that's good. Okay... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 7 CONTINUED: 7 TRACY (CONT'D) (THEN) There's this person. \nNo response. \nTRACY We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff... \nSilence. She closes her eyes tightly. \nTRACY I slept with him. Kind of. \nTracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing. \nTRACY No, no kind of. I can't believe I said kind of. That's just not something you do in a kind of way. I slept with someone. There. I said it. I slept with someone. Oh God. It's the worst thing I've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud. I slept with someone. I SLEPT with someone. I slept with SOMEONE. I slept with ... please stop me, please say something. \nNo reaction. \nTRACY David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party. You remember that party? They had the giant paper-mach\u00e9 wreath? I kept asking the decorator how he made it? You wore that sweater -- \nFinally, Cal speaks -- \nCAL Please stop. \nTRACY The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal -- \nCAL If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car. \n(CONTINUED) 7 CONTINUED: (2) 7 TRACY But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and -- \nCAL Okay. \nJust like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and, simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying. \nShe screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror. \n8 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 8 \nTracy runs to him. He's on the curb, BLOODIED but okay. \nTRACY Are you out of your mind!? \nHe looks up at her, pleading. \nCAL I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it. \nShe touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's still something here. \nTRACY Okay. \nCAL Okay. \nHe stands, limps back to the car. \nJESSICA Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10 CONTINUED: (2) 10 JESSICA (CONT'D) You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. \nCal smiles, distracted but grateful. \nJESSICA In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a LITTLE CRUS-- \nCAL (NOT LISTENING) Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay? \nJESSICA Uh-huh. \nCAL That's my girl. \nJessica awkwardly gets out of the car. \nCAL Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening. \nShe smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees... He's holding CASH out the window to pay her. \nCAL You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford. \nAnd with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer. \nCUT TO: \n11 INT. BAR - LATER 11 \nCal sits at the bar, drinking away his sorrows. He's disheveled, a bit wobbly. He motions for the BARTENDER. (CONTINUED) 11 CONTINUED: 11 BARTENDER Another vodka cranberry? \nCAL Yes. Just... yes. \nA GIRL (30s) approaches the bar. Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen. \nCAL Guess what? \nGIRL What? \nCAL My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me. \nGIRL I'm sorry to hear that. \nCAL That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore. \nThe Girl has turned back to a group of friends. \nCAL I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. (to no one) She screws him. \nSomething catches Cal's eye across the bar. We PAN TO... \nJACOB PALMER \nwearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table. \nCal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the bartender, and decides: \nCAL (RE: JACOB) Gay. \n12 EXT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - MORNING 12 \nYou know these places: basically a \"strip\" of identical housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads. \nA WOMAN (60s) gives Cal the tour. \nWOMAN So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so... the ground is closer. Which is nice. \n13 INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 13 \nThe most depressing, empty, beige place ever. \nCAL I guess the price is right. \nWOMAN Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here. You'll fit right in. \nCal SIGHS, un-enthused. \nCAL I'll take it. \nWOMAN Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine... I assume you want to get back in shape? \nCal looks down, embarrassed. \nCAL I guess. \nWOMAN Great! I'll let you know when they fix it. \n14 INT. OFFICE - AFTERNOON 14 \nCal sits at his desk, doing paperwork. His BOSS ENTERS. \nBOSS Cal, I just got the weekly sales report, good good good! You really killed this quarter! (MORE) \nBERNIE It's cologne. \nCAL Are you breaking up with me? \nBERNIE Claire's waiting in the car. Um... there's a gift receipt in there. Sorry. \nBernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. \nCal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender. \nCAL Do you have anything with a worm in it? Because I'd like a gallon of that now. \nON JACOB \nLegs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get dumped this whole time. \nHe PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair. \nJacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, gets up and walks away. \nBACK TO CAL \nAs the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender. \nCAL This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things. \nA SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob. \nJacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool. \n(CONTINUED) 18 CONTINUED: (2) 18 Cal points at himself: \"Me?\" Jacob nods: \"Yep.\" Cal SHRUGS, stands, and wobbles over towards Jacob. \nJACOB Jacob Palmer. \nCAL CAL WEA-- \nJACOB I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal. \nCAL I already have a drink. \nJACOB Let me buy you a drink, Cal. \nCAL Okay. \nJacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS. \nCAL My wife is cheating on me with -- \nJACOB David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story. \nCal takes this in. He STANDS. \nCAL You know what, I don't need this CRAP -- \nJACOB Sit down, Cal. \nCAL Okay. \nCal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk. \n(CONTINUED) 18 CONTINUED: (3) 18 JACOB Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand? \nCal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues: \nJACOB As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal. \nCal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw. \nJACOB You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it? \nCal shakes \"no.\" \n(CONTINUED) 18 CONTINUED: (4) 18 JACOB Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? \nCal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up. \nCAL Yeah, okay. \nJACOB Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock. \nCAL I'm sorry, what? \nJacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby). \nJACOB You ready to go? \nShe nods, subservient, and follows him out. \nCal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw. \nMOLLY Don't you love us anymore? \nCal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up. \nCAL Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: 20 CAL (CONT'D) But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron-- \nMOLLY TROY! \nShe bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform. Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly. \nROBBIE Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. \nCal NODS. \nROBBIE You okay? \nCAL You? \nRobbie shrugs. \nROBBIE Can I say something with a curse? One time? \nCAL Yeah. Why not? \nRobbie NODS, takes a deep breath. \nROBBIE Love is fucked. \nCal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved. \nCAL Is that so? You in love, buddy? \nROBBIE Well, if you must know -- \nJESSICA (O.S.) Ding dong. \nThey turn -- it's Jessica, the baby-sitter. \nROBBIE What is she doing here? \nCAL Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for COMING -- (MORE) (CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: (2) 20 CAL (CONT'D) (back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking -- \nROBBIE What? \nCAL Huh? \nJESSICA (CHANGING TOPICS) The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver. \nCAL Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you. (TO ROBBIE) Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few. \nROBBIE But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that! \nCAL I know, buddy. \nCal musses Robbie's hair. \nCAL My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it? \nUch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying. \nCAL Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy? \nNo response, she's glued to the television. \nROBBIE Wait, where are you going? \nCAL I'm, uh... I decided to take a class. \n(CONTINUED) 20 CONTINUED: (3) 20 JESSICA That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... \nCal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off. \nCAL Okay, well... Molly, last chance!? \nBut Molly is still locked on Efron. \nCAL That's my angel. Back in a few. \nROBBIE But, Dad -- \nCAL Nope. \nThe door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool. \nROBBIE I don't need a baby-sitter. \nJESSICA I know, Robbie. \nAn awkward beat, then. \nJACOB Take them off. \nCal bends down, takes one off. \nJACOB (CHEWING) Other one too, please? \nCal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes. \nJacob simply turns and throws them over the railing. \nCAL What the hell!? \nJACOB Are you in a fraternity, Cal? \nCAL Those were my favorite shoes. (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 JACOB ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!? \nCAL No. \nJACOB Are you Steve Jobs? \nCAL What? \nJACOB ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS? \nCAL No. I'm not Steve Jobs. \nJACOB Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go. \n25 INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 25 \nCal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store. \nCAL I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. \nJacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES. \nJACOB Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items. \nCAL Ha! I think I read that in GQ. \nJACOB You did. I wrote it. \nCAL Really? \nJacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes. \nJACOB Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers. (CONTINUED) 25 CONTINUED: 25 Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS. \nCAL I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? \nJacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away. \nJACOB Your credit card please? \nMONTAGE - FROM STORE TO STORE \nWe watch as Jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials (and as Cal's arms get progressively fuller) in each store. \n26 IN A SUIT STORE 26 \nCal gets fitted. \nJACOB (V.O.) Two suits: one black, one grey. One sports jacket, navy preferred. \nJacob leans in toward the tailor. \nJACOB Take it in there... and there. \n27 AT ANOTHER STORE 27 \nCal holds jeans in front of him, eyes them suspiciously. JACOB (V.O.) One pair of quality jeans. \nCAL These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap? \nHe looks up. Jacob is gone. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n28 EXT. MALL - MOMENTS LATER 28 \nCal runs outside. Jacob is already halfway to the car. \nCAL I'm sorry! Don't leave! (CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: 28 Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers: \nJACOB No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap. \nCAL What's wrong with the Gap? \nJACOB In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal. \nCAL Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little. \nJACOB Shut up, Cal. (TO TIFFANY) You'd fuck him, right? \nCAL (HORRIFIED) Jesus! \nTIFFANY Yeah, probably. \nCAL Tiffany! (then, realizing) You would!? \nTiffany SHRUGS. \nJACOB You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. \nCal takes this in. \nCAL Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me. \nJACOB No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. \nCal's lower lip begins to quiver. \n(CONTINUED) 33 CONTINUED: (2) 33 CAL Yeah, okay, that was meaner. \nCUT TO: \n34 INT. BAR - NEXT NIGHT 34 \nCal sits next to Jacob. Cal is wearing his new \"outfit.\" He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new \"gear.\" \nJacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a men's magazine. And he knows it. Cal looks at Jacob. \nCAL I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right? \nJACOB No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly. \nCal rubs his hands together, nervous. \nCAL We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are -- \nJACOB Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with? \nCAL Sexually? \nJACOB Yes. \nCAL In my entire life? \nJACOB No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually. \nCal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on one hand. (CONTINUED) 34 CONTINUED: 34 He smiles at Jacob proudly when he has to move the count to a second hand. Then: \nCAL One. \nJacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly. \nJACOB Wow, okay... wow. (then, checking) Not at a time? Total? \nCAL What? I married young. We met in high school. \nHe smiles, remembering. \nCAL Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it. (THEN) Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it -- \nJACOB Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go. \nCAL (a bit emotional) I miss my wife. \nJACOB Shut up, Cal. \nA YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side. \nYOUNG WOMAN Hi. \nJACOB Hi. Jacob Palmer. \nYOUNG WOMAN Amy Johnson. \nCal extends his hand. \n(CONTINUED) 34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 CAL CAL -- \nJACOB (QUICKLY) Don't. \nHe pulls it back. \nCAL (TO HIMSELF) -- Weaver. \nJACOB Can I get you a drink, Amy? \nRobbie's PHONE BEEPS. A \"NEW MESSAGE.\" Robbie smiles. \n(CONTINUED) 41 CONTINUED: 41 ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN \nThe text: \"Robbie: please stop. U r making me very uncomfortable.\" \nBACK TO SCENE \nRobbie stares at the screen, crestfallen. \nTEACHER (O.S.) Mr. Weaver? Are we interrupting? \nRobbie looks up: the WHOLE CLASS is staring at him. \nTEACHER (O.S.) Mr. Weaver! \nSlowly, Robbie stands. We HEAD IN TIGHT ON him. \nROBBIE You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing. CUT TO: \n42 INT. TRACY'S OFFICE - LATER 42 \nTracy works at her desk. A KNOCK at her door interrupts. A TALL MAN (40's) stands there: DAVID JACOBOWITZ. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You have a second? \nTRACY Oh, David. I'm just a little swamped right now so... \nHe closes the door behind him. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You've been avoiding me. (CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: 42 TRACY No, I haven't. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday. (BEAT) You're very fast by the way. \nShe SIGHS, gives up. \nTRACY I ran track in high school. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ That must be it. \nHe turns serious. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ I'm sorry about you and Cal. \nTRACY Thank you. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ I'm also not sorry, if I'm being completely honest. (GATHERING HIMSELF) I want to make sure you know how much I like you. \nTRACY No, I do -- \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ A lot. Just to clarify. I like you a lot. I had no intention of falling for a married woman. I just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face. But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly I was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work. That doesn't happen to accountants. Ever. I've checked with other accountants. \nShe smiles. \n(CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: (2) 42 DAVID JACOBOWITZ So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially, I just... I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. Officially. That sounded weird. \nTracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward. \nTRACY David, you've been a great friend to me. And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel... noticed, I guess? What happened between us that night... it meant something to me. You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately. \nDavid smiles. \nTRACY But now, when I see you, all I see is his face. All I see when I look at you is what I did to my marriage. \nShe's losing it, wipes her eyes. \nTRACY You see this? I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Honestly, do you really want any part of this? Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone. \nASSISTANT (V.O.) Your son's school on two. \nTracy quickly picks up phone. As she talks, David scribbles something on a postcard, EXITS. \nTRACY (INTO PHONE) Right, okay. No, I understand. Of course, right away. \nShe HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply: \n\"Yes.\" Tracy looks up, but David is gone. \n43 INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - LATER 43 \nRobbie sits, waiting. Tracy EMERGES. \nTRACY (calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. \nShe closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie. \nTRACY Seriously? \nROBBIE Sorry. \nRobbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ Listen, Robbie -- \nROBBIE Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. \nTracy RE-ENTERS. \nTRACY You ready to go? \nROBBIE (SUDDENLY SWEET) Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight? \n(CONTINUED) 44 CONTINUED: (4) 44 Tracy waves to David as she and Robbie EXIT, leaving him stunned in the middle of her office, staring at: \nTHE PHOTO OF CAL AND TRACY that Robbie has left directly in his line of sight. \nCUT TO: \n45 EXT. THE WEAVER BACKYARD - LATE EVENING 45 \nBushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the house. All is quiet. He gets to work. \n-- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass. \n-- Trims some bushes. \n-- Picks off some petals from some dying flowers. \nIt's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen. Finally, he finishes. \nON CAL \nContent. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back in order. As he takes it all in... \nA LIGHT pops on. \nCal DIVES into a SHRUB. \n46 INT. BAR - THAT NIGHT 46 Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward. \nJacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in his new \"skin\" than when we left him. He's drinking a martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry. \nA WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool, practiced move... and he did it instinctively. \nJacob smiles, leans forward. \nJACOB I think you're ready, Cal. \nCAL For what? (CONTINUED) 46 CONTINUED: 46 JACOB To talk to a woman, take a woman home. \nCAL Oh, no. No, I'm not. \nJACOB You've been watching me do it for two weeks. \nCAL Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball. \nJACOB Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches? \nCAL Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone? \nJacob stretches his neck, trying his patience: \nJACOB Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down? \nCAL You ask if you can buy her a drink. \nJACOB And what if she says no? \nCAL You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there. \nJACOB When she asks me a question about myself? \n(CONTINUED) 46 CONTINUED: (2) 46 CAL You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself. \nJACOB And what happens? \nCAL They talk about themselves. A lot. \nJACOB And what do I do? \nCAL You act really interested. You nod a lot. \nJACOB And at the end of the night? \nCAL You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place. \nJACOB Do I ask? \nCAL No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place. (THEN) Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me! \nKATE Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? \nCal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then: \nCAL You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me. \nKATE (PLAYFUL) Ask me again. \nCal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident. \nCAL I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me. \nKate looks up, genuinely turned-on. \nCUE MUSIC: \"SEXYBACK\" by Justin Timberlake. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n47 INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - LATER 47 \nCal and Kate BARGE in, passionately kissing. \nCAL (gasping for breath) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife. \n(CONTINUED) 47 CONTINUED: 47 KATE (TURNED ON) I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so hot. \nCAL I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife. \nKATE More, tell me more. \nCAL I'm worried you have AIDS. \nShe stops. \nCAL Only a little. \nShe pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off. She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing. \nKATE What do you want to do with me? \nCAL Show you off to my wife to make her jealous. \nShe GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch: \n48 CAL WEAVER'S \"SEXYBACK\" MONTAGE (THE NEXT FEW WEEKS) 48 -- The next morning a DISHEVELED CAL lets Kate out, gives her a big passionate kiss, and closes the DOOR. \n-- We STAY ON the DOOR. After a beat, it opens up: as Cal bids farewell to a NEW GIRL on a new morning. \n49 AT THE BAR 49 \nCal strides in -- a skip in his step, a perfectly tailored suit on his body. Everything's in SLOW MOTION. He points at someone, winks at a waitress... \nA SAD SACK GUY at the bar watches Cal stride by, jealous. Cal Weaver has evolved into \"the fucking man.\" \n50 SNAPSHOTS 50 \nMEANWHILE -- \n1) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar. 2) JESSICA reads magazine articles on \"How to Make Him Notice You.\" 3) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone. 4) ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard. But we're mainly with CAL... \n51 BACK TO CAL'S APARTMENT 51 \nA NEW WOMAN EXITS. The door closes. It re-opens as he kisses goodbye ANOTHER WOMAN! \n52 BACK AT THE BAR -- CAL AND JACOB 52 \nare mid-conversation. \nJACOB ... it would work! \nCAL You're out of your mind. \nJACOB What do college guys hate? Doing laundry. What do they love? Strippers. It's a strip club where they can do their laundry. \nCAL It's ridiculous. JACOB And yours isn't? A candy store that only sells red candy. \nCAL Everyone loves the cherry. Look, I'm not rejecting the psuedo- cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry, anything in the -erry family is allowed. But let's be real here: no one wants the lemon. No one likes the grape. \nJACOB I like grape. \nCAL Well then you can't come to my store. (CONTINUED) 52 CONTINUED: 52 They LAUGH, quickly becoming inseparable. \n53 INT. SUBURBAN KITCHEN - EVENING 53 \nA late 40s couple eat dinner: BERNIE (the big guy who \"broke up\" with Cal earlier) and CLAIRE, a bubbly little woman -- the polar opposite of her husband. \nCLAIRE Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon. \nBERNIE For God's sake, Claire. \nMADISON Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown. \nJESSICA Huh? \nMADISON Go TMZ on his ass. \nJESSICA I'm not following you, Madis-- \nMADISON The full gyno. \nOff Jessica's blank look. \nMADISON A crotch shot? A nip slip? (THEN) A dirty picture! You can even Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but with nipple. Yeah, that's what you should do: make it artistic. Black and white. Make this face. \nShe makes a raw sexual face. \nJESSICA Jesus, Madison! \n(CONTINUED) 54 CONTINUED: (3) 54 MADISON Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. \nMadison walks off, calls back. \nMADISON Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month. Thanks, Kevin! \nShe leaves Jessica there, processing the advice. \n55 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER THAT DAY 55 \nJessica EXITS the school, lost in thought. There's a bit of commotion outside. TEENAGERS are pointing and LAUGHING at something. \nJessica pushes through and sees: \nROBBIE, standing atop a man-made, tall, wooden platform/scaffold in front of the school. \nROBBIE (DRAMATICALLY) There she is! \nON JESSICA \nOh shit. \nBACK TO ROBBIE \nas he RIPS OPEN his button-up shirt, revealing a SCARLET J taped to his pale, hairless chest. He has recreated the famous Scarlet Letter tableau. He pulls out a piece of paper, reads it. \n(CONTINUED) 55 CONTINUED: 55 ROBBIE Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.' \nRobbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers. \nROBBIE I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the one! I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude. (CORRECTING HIMSELF) Multitudes? (then, deciding) No, multitude. \nJESSICA Robbie, get down! \nROBBIE I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me. \nJESSICA Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW! \nThat does the trick. He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE. Jessica pulls him off to the side. \nJESSICA (HEATED WHISPER) What the hell are you thinking? \nROBBIE You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it. (THEN) Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave hello. \n(CONTINUED) 55 CONTINUED: (2) 55 OFF TO THE SIDE: Three excited THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WAVE and give THUMBS-UPS to Robbie. Jessica waves, confused, turns back to Robbie. \nJESSICA This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously. \nROBBIE You'll learn to love me. I promise. \nJESSICA I won't. \nROBBIE Just because I'm four years younger than you? \nJESSICA BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!! \nThis stops Robbie dead in his tracks. \nJESSICA I've been spending time with him for a while. \nRobbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual. \nROBBIE No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last MONTH -- \nJESSICA He's older. I don't want my parents to know. \nAnd with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen. \nROBBIE Who is he? \nJESSICA It doesn't matter. \n58 EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NEXT NIGHT 58 \nPARENTS walk hand-in-hand, into the school. It's Parent- Teacher conference night. \n59 INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NEXT NIGHT 59 \nCal sits on a small chair outside a classroom. Tracy approaches. \nTRACY (O.S.) Wow. \nCal looks up. Tracy stands there. She's dressed down, but looks amazing. Vulnerable and nervous. \nTRACY (FLOORED) You look great, Cal. \nCAL Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so... \nTRACY Well you look great. Really. \nCal smiles. \nCAL Thank you. (THEN) You always look great, so... \nAwkward. Neither knows what to say now. Tracy takes the seat next to him. \nCAL I talked to Nanna yesterday. \nTRACY Me, too. She sound okay to you? \nCAL She sounded like... Nanna. She worries about us. (CONTINUED) 59 CONTINUED: 59 \nTracy NODS. A long beat, then: \nCAL I feel like I'm about to get detention. \nTracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit. \nCAL Which teacher is this? \nTRACY Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. \nCal smiles. \nCAL He's a really weird kid, isn't he? \nTRACY Yeah. (THEN) I kind of like him, though. \nCAL I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital. \nTRACY Me, too. \nThey LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. \nAn awkward beat, then: \nCAL So, how are things with... (a beat, then) How's it going with David? \nShe looks down. \nTRACY Oh... it's not. (THEN) It wasn't about him, if that means anything. \nCAL No, I know. (CONTINUED) 59 CONTINUED: (2) 59 Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture. \nTRACY You seeing anyone? \nCAL Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really. \nTRACY Oh. Because you hear things, you know. \nCAL Yeah, well... \nAnother long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy. \nCAL I miss you, T. \nTracy looks up surprised. \nCAL I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high school... you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know? \nShe smiles. \nCAL I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer. \nTRACY I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. \nHe smiles, emboldened. \nCAL All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 59 CONTINUED: (3) 59 CAL (CONT'D) (THEN) I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me. \nTracy's eyes well up with tears. \n61 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61 \nA three-way chase: \nCAL Tracy, wait! \nTRACY Leave me alone, Cal! \nKATE I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you ASSHOLE! \nON SPECTATORS \nTEACHERS and PARENTS (including Jessica's parents), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside. \n62 EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS ACTION 62 \nTracy races to her car. \nCAL Tracy, c'mon! We were separated. \nTRACY (fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you. \nCAL Okay, so -- \nTRACY I can't do this now, Cal. \nCAL Tracy, I love you. \nKATE Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, ASSHOLE! \nTracy looks at Cal, stunned. That's their thing. \n(CONTINUED) 62 CONTINUED: 62 CAL It's a funny story, actually -- \nTRACY I'm going home. \nShe opens the car door. \nCAL Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher! \nGASPS from the crowd. Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a picture with her cell phone. \nCAL But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU! I LOVE YOU!!! Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment. \nCAL Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're STILL... \nHe instantly trails off, realizing. MORE GASPS. \nCAL (MEEKLY COMPLETING) ... the only woman I want to be with. TRACY I don't even know who you are. \nTracy gets in her car and speeds off. \nCAL (weakly, to himself) I'm your soulmate. \nCal turns around to the crowd, only to be met... \nBy a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF. \nCAL HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT! \n(CONTINUED) 62 CONTINUED: (2) 62 THUNDER CRACKS in the sky. It begins to pour. Cal stands there, soaked. He looks up at the sky. \nCAL REALLY!!!??? \n63 EXT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY 63 \nMeanwhile, the rain pours down as DINERS scurry into the restaurant. \n64 INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 64 \nWe've been here before... the same group of BORING PEOPLE at the same table. Liz and Hannah CHAT off to the side. \nThere's a cake on the table that says \"CONGRATS HANNAH!\" \nRichard stands on a chair. \nRICHARD Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? \nThe room goes quiet. \nRICHARD Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember? \nPOLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard. Is this it? \nRICHARD I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course... \nMore CHEESY LAUGHTER. \nRICHARD Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie... \nHANNAH And time for stuff like that? \nHe LAUGHS. \nJACOB My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually... \nWe PULL BACK as they continue chatting. \nTIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then another. \nBody language shifts. \n-- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more. \n-- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's \nHannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him. \nCUE MUSIC as we begin a... \nMONTAGE. IN ONE CONTINUOUS DOLLY MOVE WE HEAD, FIRST, TO... \n69 INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING 69 \nHannah looks longingly at Jacob's plate of pancakes. \nHe notices, switches plates. \nShe smiles. He smiles. God, he's crazy about her. \nHe looks at the next table, watches a LOVELORN GUY switch plates with his GIRLFRIEND. \nUh-oh. \n70 INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 70 \nDOLLY DOWN the row, HANDS are held between COUPLES, all entranced by the movie, until we REVEAL: \nJACOB \nstaring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks terrified. \n71 INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - EVENING 71 \nNow it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares at her lovingly. Suddenly, he catches himself. \nIn a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the implications of what's happening to him. \n-- Pacing. A drink. A big drink. Fingers pulling at his own hair. Hyperventilating. More staring. More pacing. \nCUT TO: \n71A INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM 71A \nAnd finally, he loses the battle: he tucks Hannah under a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally... \nGives in to falling in love with her. \nCUT TO: \n72 INT. BAR - EVENING 72 \nCal is sitting at the table that once belonged to Jacob. He suddenly seems very alone. (CONTINUED) 72 CONTINUED: 72 He looks towards the bar, notices that same SAD SACK MIDDLE-AGED GUY. Also alone. He picks up his cell. \n73 INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 73 \nTracy sits at a table, FLOWERS off to the side. Her phone rings. She looks at it, sees it's \"Cal.\" She hits IGNORE. \nPULL BACK to reveal DAVID JACOBWITZ, across from her. He looks at Tracy and smiles. She smiles back weakly. \n74 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - LATER 74 \nThe awkward end of a first date. David walks Tracy to the front door. She's carrying those same flowers. \nAwkward beat. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I was wondering if -- \nTRACY David, stop. Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the... times I've been having lately. So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say no. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ Wow. You know, that's exactly what I was thinking. It's almost uncanny. \nThey LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then... \nTHE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there. \nJESSICA Hello. \nTRACY Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry. Jessica, this is my work-friend. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 74 CONTINUED: 74 TRACY (CONT'D) He's an accountant named David. David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica. Okay, David, well everything sounds great. Spreadsheets. \nIt's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. \nINSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious. \nOUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it. \n(CONTINUED) 79 CONTINUED: 79 CAL Hello? \nTRACY Hi, Cal. \nSilence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea. \nTRACY So... I'm in the basement. I'm trying to get the water heater working `cause the pilot's out and I don't know how to relight it. \nObviously Cal sees she's not in the basement. \nTRACY I'm sorry to bother you, I just... what do I do? \nCal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then: \nCAL It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad you called. Here: I'll walk you through it. (THEN) Do you see the little grey door? \nTRACY Yeah. \nCAL Pull it down. \nShe pantomimes this in the kitchen. \nTRACY Okay, it's down. \nCAL Now, you see the red button? I wrote `push' on it? \nTRACY I got it. \nCAL Push. Now turn that to the right and stick the match in. \nTRACY Oh, there it goes! \n(CONTINUED) 79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 CAL Good. Now just close the door and you're good to go. \nSilence. The charade is over. Now what? \nTRACY Well, thanks, Cal. I... appreciate your help. \nCAL No, anytime. Call anytime with stuff like that. (AWKWARD BEAT) Talk to you later? \nTRACY Yeah. And... thanks again. \nCal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him. \n80 INT. CAL'S CORPORATE APARTMENT - MORNING 80 \nCal sits on his little couch, between Robbie and Molly. Molly is once again absorbed in High School Musical. \nCal looks depressed. Robbie doesn't look much better. \nCAL Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner? \nROBBIE Sure. \nCAL Your mom's working till five, we'll have to tell her. (off their silence) What do you guys want to do today? \nMOLLY (not looking up) High School Musical. \nCAL Well, there's a shocker. \nShe goes back into her trance. \nROBBIE She still won't talk to you? (CONTINUED) 80 CONTINUED: 80 CAL Not if that show's on. \nROBBIE No, I mean, Mom. \nCAL Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off. \nROBBIE What happened? \nCAL Beyond your pay-grade, buddy. \nCal looks pained. \nCAL I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do... \nHis eyes drift to the TV. It's the timeless GOLF SCENE from High School Musical II. A LIGHT BULB goes on. \nCAL (TO ROBBIE) Hey. Get your coat. \nRobbie smiles, runs off. Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in hand. \nCAL Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show. \n88 INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM 88 \nMeanwhile. Claire is putting away laundry. She throws some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer. \nNotices something. An envelope. It's addressed to Cal Weaver. Curiosity piqued, she picks it up. Looks inside. Almost faints. \n89 INT. CLAIRE AND BERNIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 89 \nBig Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and drinking a cold one. Jessica lies on the floor, doing homework. \nClaire ENTERS, ashen. Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the envelope. Jessica looks up, sees it. \nJESSICA No!!!! \nShe jumps, but it's too late. \n(CONTINUED) 89 CONTINUED: 89 ON BERNIE \nStaring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare. \nBernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope. He looks at the envelope again. \nON ENVELOPE \nCal's name. A heart. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJESSICA Daddy? \nBernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY. \nON JESSICA \nRealizing. She grabs a second set of keys. \n90 EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 90 \nJessica runs into a second car. Races after her father. \n91 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE 91 \nMeanwhile. Tracy approaches Robbie. Not only is he wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES. Tracy LAUGHS. \nTRACY Baby! What are you wearing!? \nROBBIE Dad's here. \nTracy's face drops. \nROBBIE I have to blindfold you. \nTRACY (WEARY) What is this? What is he doing? \n(CONTINUED) 91 CONTINUED: 91 ROBBIE Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. \nShe can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind. \nHe ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER! \nROBBIE Okay, we're good, let's do this. \n92 INT. BERNIE'S CAR 92 \nMeanwhile. There's no expression on Bernie's face. It's frightening. He looks down at passenger seat. At the ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address. \nHe RACES through a light. A HORN blares behind him. \n93 INT. JESSICA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 93 \nJessica is the one BLARING THE HORN, crying and panicked. \nShe too RACES through the same light. \n94 EXT. WEAVER BACKYARD 94 \nRobbie leads a blindfolded Tracy into the backyard. She looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face. We see what she is not yet privy to. \nON THE BACKYARD \nCal's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all. \nCal stands behind it all, in a tux. \nCAL Hi, T. \nTRACY Can I take these off, please? \nCAL Almost. Kids? \nROBBIE Is that Jessica? \nBAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw. \nHANNAH Daddy! \nJESSICA Daddy! \nTRACY (YANKING ON BLINDFOLD) What's happening? \nBernie is pummeling Cal. \nBERNIE I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S SEVENTEEN! \nJacob dives in. Tries to pull Bernie off. Bernie NAILS Jacob with an UPPERCUT! \nHANNAH Jacob! \nCAL (GETTING PUMMELLED) Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! \nBernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF COURSE, readies to bash it over Cal's head. Jessica throws herself on Cal. \nJESSICA Daddy, stop! \nThis breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates. \nJESSICA He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know. \n(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (5) 94 ROBBIE Know what? \nCAL Know what? \nTRACY (STILL BLINDFOLDED) Robbie, please get this off me! \nROBBIE (struggling with it) I'm TRYING! \nJESSICA He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! \nRobbie stops, turns. \nROBBIE With who? \nJESSICA (pointing at Cal) With him. \nCAL Are you pointing at me? \nROBBIE Are you pointing at him? \nTRACY Who is she pointing at!? \nROBBIE (PROCESSING) Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing? \nBERNIE I knew it. \nHe gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him. \nJESSICA (TO BERNIE) He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him. \nROBBIE You made him dirty pictures? Oh God. \n(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (6) 94 Robbie looks to Cal. He's angry, jealous, and broken- hearted all at once. \nROBBIE (TO CAL) You're the one? You're the one she... (then, furious) You stole my soulmate. \nCAL Wait: Jessica is your soulmate? \nVOICE (O.S.) I'm sorry, is Tracy home? \nEveryone turns: DAVID JACOBOWITZ stands in the doorway. He's holding up a SWEATER in his right hand. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You left your sweater in my car the other night. \nHANNAH Who are you? \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ David Jacobowitz. \nJACOB David Jacobowitz! \nCAL David Jacobowitz!? \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ Is this a bad time -- \nWHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right hook. \nHANNAH Jacob! \nJACOB You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!? \nBefore Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob. \nCAL AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT DIDN'T YOU, SWEETHEART!? \nThis time it's Tracy whose face registers shock. Hannah takes Jacob's hand, pulls him away. \nJACOB (one last try) Cal, c'mon -- \nBut Cal won't even look at him. \nMOLLY (CALLING OUT) Goodbye, Nanna. (CONTINUED) 97 CONTINUED: (2) 97 HANNAH (THROUGH TEARS) Goodbye, cutie. \nThey EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things. \nCAL She's all yours, David. \nOuch. \nTRACY (WOUNDED) Nice. \nBefore he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie. \nCAL Go big or go home, right, buddy? \nRobbie looks up at him, cold. \nROBBIE Go home, Dad. \nCal NODS, EXITS. \n98 INT.

And speaking of Cal... \n102 INT. BAR - AFTERNOON (THREE WEEKS LATER) 102 \nCal sits back at his usual table. This isn't \"Cool Cal,\" the Jacob disciple. No, this is \"Sad Mess Cal.\" He's grown a patchy beard. He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit. \nHe's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy red straw. It's pathetic. A WAITRESS APPROACHES. \nWAITRESS Can I get you another? \nCAL What time is it? \nWAITRESS 2:30. In the afternoon. \nCAL 2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress. (THEN) Yes, another drink would be grand. \nShe EXITS. \nCal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches: \nCAL That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick. \nJACOB (O.S.) Ah, it's okay, I deserved it. \nON JACOB \nStanding there. As always, he looks perfectly put together. He takes in Cal. \nJACOB It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal. \nCAL What do you want? \nJACOB Can I sit? \nCAL I don't know, can you? \n(CONTINUED) 102 CONTINUED: 102 JACOB Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children? \nCAL (MIMICKING) `Are we going to be mature or act like children?' \nJACOB Okay, so like children then.

There's distance here. \nPULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY (41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O... if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.: white sneakers in fancy French restaurant). \nCal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu. \nCAL Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread. (THEN) Want to just share a dessert? \nTracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu. \nCAL You okay, babe? You seem out of it. \nTRACY Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want. \nCAL Me too. Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three... TRACY CAL I want a divorce.

Tracy drives. \nTRACY Aren't you going to say anything? \nNothing. \nTRACY Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? \nShe looks at him. He turns to her, about to say something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward. \n", "test1_true": "CUT BACK TO: \n5 INT. CAL AND TRACY'S HOUSE 5 \nMeanwhile, Jessica (the baby-sitter) stops at a bedroom door. She hears MUSIC coming from inside, puts her ear to the door. It's Lady Gaga. It's awful. \nShe smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time. \n(CONTINUED) 5 CONTINUED: 5 JESSICA Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- \nShe SCREAMS as -- \nANOTHER ANGLE \nROBBIE WEAVER (13), quickly covers himself up. He was masturbating. \nROBBIE Close the door! \nBACK TO JESSICA \nwho slams the door shut. \nJESSICA (THROUGH DOOR) I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see anything, I swear. \nBACK INSIDE ROOM \nRobbie lies there frozen, horrified. \n6 INT. BAR 6 \nMeanwhile, where Liz and Hannah keep drinking. \nLIZ I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so... PG-13. \nHannah's mouth drops open. \nHANNAH My life is not PG-13! \nLIZ It so is. You've never left LA. You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' O'Brien. \n(CONTINUED) 6 CONTINUED: 6 HANNAH (ADORABLE) He's funny. \nLIZ He looks like a carrot, honey. \nHannah LAUGHS. \nVOICE (O.S.) Who? \nThey turn. It's Jacob Palmer (the stud from earlier). \nLIZ Hi. \nJACOB Hi. Who looks like a carrot? \nLIZ Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy. \nJACOB I think your friend Hannah is sexy. \nHannah LAUGHS. \nHANNAH You didn't really just say that. \nJACOB Pretty sure I did. \nHANNAH How old are you? \nJACOB Thirty-three next month. \nHANNAH Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. \nJacob sits down at their table, uninvited. \nJACOB I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 6 CONTINUED: (2) 6 JACOB (CONT'D) There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact. (THEN) Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive? \nHannah doesn't flinch. \nHANNAH I don't. \nJACOB Yes you do. \nLIZ Yes, she does. \nJACOB I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied. Multiple times. \nHANNAH You've got to be kiddi-- \nJACOB We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again. \n", "test2_input": "HANNAH Let's go. \nShe leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to. \nWOMAN #1 Slut. \n66 INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - LATER 66 \nWe haven't been here yet. It's exactly what you'd expect though: an elegant bachelor-pad. Modern furniture. Sleek. Everything just right. Jacob puts an album on his record player. \n(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: 66 HANNAH This place looks like something out of a men's magazine. \nJACOB Is that a compliment? \nHANNAH I'm not sure. \nMusic starts playing: \"As Tears Go By\" by the Stones. \nHANNAH I like this song. \nJACOB I thought you would. (THEN) Drink? \nHANNAH Yes, please. \nJacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch. \nHe pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down. \nJACOB Cheers. \nHANNAH Cheers. \nThey CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She holds out her glass for a refill. \nJacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking... \nHANNAH So is this how it normally works? \nJACOB What? \nHANNAH How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink? \n(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 JACOB Yes. That's how it normally works. \nHannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig. \nHANNAH And then you sleep with them? \nJACOB Yes. \nHANNAH So that's what happens next? We sleep together? \nJACOB At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. \nShe takes a deep breath, admits: \nHANNAH I'm very nervous. \nJACOB I'm getting that. \nHANNAH I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. \nJacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS. \nJACOB You're adorable. \nHannah SNAPS, already tipsy. \nHANNAH No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! (THEN) I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me. \n(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (3) 66 JACOB I don't think people say `bang' anymore. \nHANNAH I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! \nHannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up. \nHANNAH Okay, okay, this is happening. (THEN) Take off your shirt. \nJACOB What? \nHANNAH I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. \nJacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped. \nHANNAH Holy crap. \nShe pokes a finger at his abs. \nHANNAH It's like you're photo-shopped. \n", "test2_true": "HANNAH No way! Not with all that happening... \nShe motions casually at his abs. \nHANNAH So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom? \nJACOB (AMUSED) In the bedroom is preferable. \nHannah stands, a girl on a mission. \n(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: (4) 66 HANNAH Good. Let's go there. \n67 INT. BAR 67 \nMeanwhile Cal, beaten up and soaking wet from the rain, ENTERS. He looks to his usual table, in need of a friend's company. \nBut Jacob isn't there. \nCUT BACK TO: \n68 INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 68 \nHannah lies on her back in the dim light. Jacob is on top of her, shirtless. They're making out, gently. \nHANNAH (TIPSY) This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head. \nJACOB I'm glad you like it. \nThey resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again. \nHANNAH Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? \nOff his look... \nHANNAH They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! \nShe shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself. \nHANNAH Sorry, let's proceed. \nJacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again. \nHANNAH You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you? \n(CONTINUED) 68 CONTINUED: 68 JACOB (LYING) No. \nHANNAH Oh. My. God! You totally do! \nJACOB (ADMITTING) I do. \nShe STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious. \nHANNAH How much did it cost? \nJACOB Five thousand doll-- \nThat DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is different for him. He likes her. \nWe watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it. We watch him look at Hannah. \nON HANNAH \nHair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing. And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing: \nJACOB Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself. \nHANNAH What? No! I don't want to know anything about you. \nJACOB C'mon, one question. \nHANNAH Okay, fine, but then we bang. \nJACOB Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past GIRLFRIENDS -- \nHANNAH What's your mom like? \n(CONTINUED) 68 CONTINUED: (2) 68 The question takes him by surprise. He hesitates, then: \nJACOB Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold. \nHANNAH And your father? \nJACOB He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have... \nHe motions at his PILLOW. \nJACOB Stuff like this. \nShe motions at his abs. \n", "test3_input": "ROBBIE I grew up a lot this year, I think. I used to think that growing up meant really growing. Like getting taller and bigger. But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller. Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller... (beat, then) I grew an inch and a half this year, but I feel a lot smaller. \nCal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned. \nROBBIE I was in love. And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: (2) 103 ROBBIE (CONT'D) I believed that there was one true love for everyone, and if you fought for that person, your one true love would always work out. But that's not how it works. It sounded good when I was younger, but... it's just not how it works. There's no such thing as one true love for everyo-- \nCAL (O.S.) Stop! \nRobbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the crowd. Everyone turns to look at him. \nROBBIE Dad? \nCAL Hi. (awkward, to crowd) Hi, everyone. \nSilence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly really uncomfortable. \nCAL May I have a word with my son? It'll just take a second. \nCal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. \nFinally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. \nRobbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down. \nROBBIE (HEATED WHISPER) What are you doing? \nCAL I don't know. What are you doing? \nRobbie's eyes well up with tears. \nROBBIE I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as -- \nCal turns toward the crowd, announces: \n(CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: (3) 103 CAL My son's graduation speech sucks. \nGASPS from the crowd. \nON CAL \nNow standing, alone, front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony. \nHe looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS. THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger. \nCAL In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction. And I basically wrote it for him. I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me. \nPeople squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck. \nCAL My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes that people have soulmates. And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around. \nHe looks at Tracy, out in the crowd. \nCAL I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. Our first date, we went for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do. And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father. (THEN) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: (4) 103 CAL (CONT'D) I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream. I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one. And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying. When you find `the one' you never give up trying... and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that. \nRobbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone. \nRobbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces: \nROBBIE I still love you, Jessica! I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper! I've loved you since... \nThe crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back. \n104 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - LATER 104 The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family. They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob. \nCAL Hi, Nanna. \nHANNAH Daddy. \nHe smiles at her, adoring. \nCAL My perfect girl. \nHe kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob. \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: 104 CAL I already ordered a gun. I'm not kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on a shady internet site, I can show you the receipt. If you hurt her, I am prepared to shoot you in the face. \nJACOB Cal, I'm not going to -- \nCAL Shut up, Jacob. \nJacob shuts up. \nCAL Wow. I like that. \nJacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices: \nCAL Is that a new shirt? \n", "test3_true": "CAL Seriously? \nJACOB Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. I got this at Nordstrom's. \nAnd like that... order is restored in the universe. \nOVER TO ROBBIE \nWho approaches Jessica. \nROBBIE It was nice of you to come. \nJESSICA I wouldn't have missed it. \nAwkward. \nROBBIE So, how are things with your dad? \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: (2) 104 JESSICA Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while. \nROBBIE Yeah, probably a good idea. (THEN) You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. \nHe holds out his hand, to shake, formally. \nJESSICA Wait: I thought you weren't giving up. \nROBBIE I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then. \nJessica smiles. \nJESSICA It's a good plan. \nShe looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse. \nJESSICA Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. \nShe hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... \nRobbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek. \nJESSICA You take care, Robbie. \nRobbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps up next to his son. \nCAL You okay, buddy? \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: (3) 104 ROBBIE (RE: ENVELOPE) I am now, Dad. I am now. \nRobbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles. \nTRACY (O.S.) I'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty. \nCal turns, Tracy has been watching. \nCAL We might have to lock him up. \nTracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her. \nTRACY You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech. \nCAL I've been working on it for thirty years, so... \nShe LAUGHS, then... quiet. \nTRACY Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal? \nCAL I don't know. I'd like to try though. I know I'd like to try. \nShe nods, thinking. \nTRACY Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know -- \nShe stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: \nTRACY I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream. \nCal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then: \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: (4) 104 TRACY It was rocky road by the way. \nCAL No! \nAs they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream was, we PULL BACK. \nOff to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one another's company. \nHe smiles. \nFADE OUT. \n"}

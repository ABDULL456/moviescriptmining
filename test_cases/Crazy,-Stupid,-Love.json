U r making me very uncomfortable.\" \nBACK TO SCENE \nRobbie stares at the screen, crestfallen. \nTEACHER (O.S.) Mr. Weaver? Are we interrupting? \nRobbie looks up: the WHOLE CLASS is staring at him. \nTEACHER (O.S.) Mr. Weaver! \nSlowly, Robbie stands. We HEAD IN TIGHT ON him. \nROBBIE You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing. CUT TO: \n42 INT. TRACY'S OFFICE - LATER 42 \nTracy works at her desk. A KNOCK at her door interrupts. A TALL MAN (40's) stands there: DAVID JACOBOWITZ. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You have a second? \nTRACY Oh, David. I'm just a little swamped right now so... \nHe closes the door behind him. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You've been avoiding me. (CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: 42 TRACY No, I haven't. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday. (BEAT) You're very fast by the way. \nShe SIGHS, gives up. \nTRACY I ran track in high school. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ That must be it. \nHe turns serious. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ I'm sorry about you and Cal. \nTRACY Thank you. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ I'm also not sorry, if I'm being completely honest. (GATHERING HIMSELF) I want to make sure you know how much I like you. \nTRACY No, I do -- \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ A lot. Just to clarify. I like you a lot. I had no intention of falling for a married woman. I just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face. But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly I was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work. That doesn't happen to accountants. Ever. I've checked with other accountants. \nShe smiles. \n(CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: (2) 42 DAVID JACOBOWITZ So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially, I just... I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. Officially. That sounded weird. \nTracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward. \nTRACY David, you've been a great friend to me. And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel... noticed, I guess? What happened between us that night... it meant something to me. You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately. \nDavid smiles. \nTRACY But now, when I see you, all I see is his face. All I see when I look at you is what I did to my marriage. \nShe's losing it, wipes her eyes. \nTRACY You see this? I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Honestly, do you really want any part of this? Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone. \nASSISTANT (V.O.) Your son's school on two. \nTracy quickly picks up phone. As she talks, David scribbles something on a postcard, EXITS. \nTRACY (INTO PHONE) Right, okay. No, I understand. Of course, right away. \nShe HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply: \n\"Yes.\" Tracy looks up, but David is gone. \n43 INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - LATER 43 \nRobbie sits, waiting. Tracy EMERGES. \nTRACY (calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. \nShe closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie. \nTRACY Seriously? \nROBBIE Sorry. \n", "test1_true": "TRACY It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. \nThey walk out together. \nTRACY They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? \nRobbie NODS. \nTRACY You'd really think someone would have written something better by now. \nRobbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit. \n44 INT. TRACY'S OFFICE - LATER 44 \nRobbie wheels around in an office chair as Tracy tries to work behind her desk. He stops, noticing a PHOTO. \nIt's an older picture of CAL AND TRACY. They look happy. Very much in love. Tracy notices. \nTRACY Guess I should take it down, huh? \nROBBIE I guess. \n(CONTINUED) 44 CONTINUED: 44 Tracy NODS. She places the picture face down gently. She tries to return to her work, but can't. \nTRACY How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really? \nRobbie hesitates. \nTRACY Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. \nShe turns back to her work. After a beat: \nROBBIE He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot. \nTRACY Oh. Well, good. That's... really good. (then, covering) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for. \nRobbie hesitates, then adds: \nROBBIE He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know? \nTRACY Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too. \nROBBIE I know. \nTRACY You do? \nROBBIE I heard you crying the other night and... I didn't know what to do. I'm thirteen years old and... can you just tell me what I'm supposed to do in that situation? I didn't want to Google it. \nShe smiles, shakes her head. \n(CONTINUED) 44 CONTINUED: (2) 44 TRACY Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary. You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so sorry. \nROBBIE I'm okay with being like you, Mom. I like you. \nShe puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie. \nTRACY It's my fault, what happened with your father. It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay? \nROBBIE It'll be okay, Mom. \nTRACY (EMOTIONAL) You promise? \nHe NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever. \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ (O.S.) Hey, they need you in the conference room for a sec... oh, sorry. \nThey look up. It's David. Tracy gathers herself, stands. \nTRACY David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. (FORCED) We work together. \nRobbie takes him in, shakes his hand. \nTRACY I'll be right back, okay, honey? ROBBIE DAVID Okay. Okay. \nAwkward. Really awkward. Tracy starts to say something, thinks better of it, and EXITS. \nDavid moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie. \n(CONTINUED) 44 CONTINUED: (3) 44 DAVID JACOBOWITZ So, Robbie... I hear you're quite the soccer player. \nROBBIE So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. \nHe LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked. \nROBBIE You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting? \nDAVID JACOBOWITZ Um, yes I am -- \nROBBIE Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably math. And she still loves him. \n", "test1_id": 1638, "test2_input": "It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. \nINSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious. \nOUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it. \n(CONTINUED) 79 CONTINUED: 79 CAL Hello? \nTRACY Hi, Cal. \nSilence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea. \nTRACY So... I'm in the basement. I'm trying to get the water heater working `cause the pilot's out and I don't know how to relight it. \nObviously Cal sees she's not in the basement. \nTRACY I'm sorry to bother you, I just... what do I do? \nCal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then: \nCAL It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad you called. Here: I'll walk you through it. (THEN) Do you see the little grey door? \nTRACY Yeah. \nCAL Pull it down. \nShe pantomimes this in the kitchen. \nTRACY Okay, it's down. \nCAL Now, you see the red button? I wrote `push' on it? \nTRACY I got it. \nCAL Push. Now turn that to the right and stick the match in. \nTRACY Oh, there it goes! \n(CONTINUED) 79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 CAL Good. Now just close the door and you're good to go. \nSilence. The charade is over. Now what? \nTRACY Well, thanks, Cal. I... appreciate your help. \nCAL No, anytime. Call anytime with stuff like that. (AWKWARD BEAT) Talk to you later? \nTRACY Yeah. And... thanks again. \nCal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him. \n80 INT. CAL'S CORPORATE APARTMENT - MORNING 80 \nCal sits on his little couch, between Robbie and Molly. Molly is once again absorbed in High School Musical. \nCal looks depressed. Robbie doesn't look much better. \nCAL Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner? \nROBBIE Sure. \nCAL Your mom's working till five, we'll have to tell her. (off their silence) What do you guys want to do today? \nMOLLY (not looking up) High School Musical. \nCAL Well, there's a shocker. \nShe goes back into her trance. \nROBBIE She still won't talk to you? (CONTINUED) 80 CONTINUED: 80 CAL Not if that show's on. \nROBBIE No, I mean, Mom. \nCAL Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off. \nROBBIE What happened? \nCAL Beyond your pay-grade, buddy. \nCal looks pained. \nCAL I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do... \nHis eyes drift to the TV. It's the timeless GOLF SCENE from High School Musical II. A LIGHT BULB goes on. \nCAL (TO ROBBIE) Hey. Get your coat. \nRobbie smiles, runs off. Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in hand. \nCAL Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show. \n", "test2_true": "CAL I have to -- \nMOLLY NOOOO! \nCAL I'm turning it off -- \nMOLLY NOOOOOOOOOOO! \nHe just does it! He turns the TV off. Silence. Molly turns towards him, stares. A long, scary, beat. Then: (CONTINUED) 80 CONTINUED: (2) 80 MOLLY (free at last) Thank you. \nCal KISSES her, jumps up from the couch. \n81 INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER 81 \nCal talks to a SALESMAN. Robbie and Molly bounce around, excited. \n82 INT. PARTY SUPPLY STORE - LATER 82 \nCal talks to a different SALESMAN. Robbie and Molly extend a MEASURING TAPE across the ground, assisting. \n83 EXT. U-HAUL CENTER - CONTINUOUS ACTION 83 \nCal rents a TRUCK. \n84 INT. HOME DEPOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 84 \nCal picks up materials. As he rounds a corner, he runs into... BERNIE. \nBERNIE Oh, hey, Cal. \nCAL Bernie. \nBERNIE So how've you -- \nCAL Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but I'm doing something at the old house tonight and I'm in a bit of a rush so... yeah. Thanks again for the cologne. \nCal takes off. \n85 EXT. HOME DEPOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 85 \nMolly points out her three favorite DAY LABORERS, Cal hires them. \n86 INT. WEAVER BACKYARD - LATER 86 \nSome kind of construction is going on back there. \nCal's cell phone RINGS. We go -- \n86A SPLIT SCREEN 86A \nwith JACOB on his. He's waiting outside a LIQUOR STORE in his car. \nCAL Hello? \nJACOB Hey, Cal. \nCAL Oh. My. God. It's alive. \nJACOB I'm sorry. I know I've been out of circulation. \nCAL You abandoned me at my time of need. \nJACOB I've been a little... things have gotten a bit... I met a woman. \nCAL I bet you did. \nJACOB No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman. \nCAL (DISBELIEVING) Okay, whatever. \nJACOB Actually, tonight... I'm going to meet her mother. \nCAL (LAUGHING) Whoa!!!! Look at you! You do realize you might actually have to answer a question or two about yourself? (CONTINUED) 86A CONTINUED: 86A JACOB Yes, I realize that, asshole. \nHannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car. Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her. \nJACOB Gotta go.

WEAVER HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 87 \nTracy pulls up to her house. As she pulls in she notices Robbie. He's standing outside the front door in a tuxedo... a shit-eating grin on his face. \nShe SIGHS (\"what now?\") and parks the car. \n", "test2_id": 1639, "test3_input": "ROBBIE I grew up a lot this year, I think. I used to think that growing up meant really growing. Like getting taller and bigger. But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller. Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller... (beat, then) I grew an inch and a half this year, but I feel a lot smaller. \nCal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned. \nROBBIE I was in love. And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: (2) 103 ROBBIE (CONT'D) I believed that there was one true love for everyone, and if you fought for that person, your one true love would always work out. But that's not how it works. It sounded good when I was younger, but... it's just not how it works. There's no such thing as one true love for everyo-- \nCAL (O.S.) Stop! \nRobbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the crowd. Everyone turns to look at him. \nROBBIE Dad? \nCAL Hi. (awkward, to crowd) Hi, everyone. \nSilence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly really uncomfortable. \nCAL May I have a word with my son? It'll just take a second. \nCal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. \nFinally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. \nRobbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down. \nROBBIE (HEATED WHISPER) What are you doing? \nCAL I don't know. What are you doing? \nRobbie's eyes well up with tears. \nROBBIE I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as -- \nCal turns toward the crowd, announces: \n(CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: (3) 103 CAL My son's graduation speech sucks. \nGASPS from the crowd. \nON CAL \nNow standing, alone, front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony. \nHe looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS. THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger. \nCAL In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction. And I basically wrote it for him. I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me. \nPeople squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck. \nCAL My son -- not him, my actual son -- he believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes that people have soulmates. And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around. \nHe looks at Tracy, out in the crowd. \nCAL I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. Our first date, we went for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do. And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father. (THEN) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: (4) 103 CAL (CONT'D) I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream. I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one. And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying. When you find `the one' you never give up trying... and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that. \nRobbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone. \nRobbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces: \nROBBIE I still love you, Jessica! I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper! I've loved you since... \nThe crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back. \n104 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - LATER 104 The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family. They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob. \nCAL Hi, Nanna. \nHANNAH Daddy. \nHe smiles at her, adoring. \nCAL My perfect girl. \nHe kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob. \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: 104 CAL I already ordered a gun. I'm not kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on a shady internet site, I can show you the receipt. If you hurt her, I am prepared to shoot you in the face. \nJACOB Cal, I'm not going to -- \nCAL Shut up, Jacob. \nJacob shuts up. \nCAL Wow. I like that. \nJacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices: \nCAL Is that a new shirt? \n", "test3_true": "CAL Seriously? \nJACOB Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. I got this at Nordstrom's. \nAnd like that... order is restored in the universe. \nOVER TO ROBBIE \nWho approaches Jessica. \nROBBIE It was nice of you to come. \nJESSICA I wouldn't have missed it. \nAwkward. \nROBBIE So, how are things with your dad? \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: (2) 104 JESSICA Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while. \nROBBIE Yeah, probably a good idea. (THEN) You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. \nHe holds out his hand, to shake, formally. \nJESSICA Wait: I thought you weren't giving up. \nROBBIE I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then. \nJessica smiles. \nJESSICA It's a good plan. \nShe looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse. \nJESSICA Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. \nShe hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... \nRobbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek. \nJESSICA You take care, Robbie. \nRobbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps up next to his son. \nCAL You okay, buddy? \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: (3) 104 ROBBIE (RE: ENVELOPE) I am now, Dad. I am now. \nRobbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles. \nTRACY (O.S.) I'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty. \nCal turns, Tracy has been watching. \nCAL We might have to lock him up. \nTracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her. \nTRACY You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech. \nCAL I've been working on it for thirty years, so... \nShe LAUGHS, then... quiet. \nTRACY Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal? \nCAL I don't know. I'd like to try though. I know I'd like to try. \nShe nods, thinking. \nTRACY Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know -- \nShe stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: \nTRACY I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream. \nCal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then: \n(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: (4) 104 TRACY It was rocky road by the way. \nCAL No! \nAs they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream was, we PULL BACK. \nOff to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one another's company. \nHe smiles. \nFADE OUT. \n", "test3_id": 1640}

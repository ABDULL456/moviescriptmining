M Bond -- 
Bond kicks open a door and enters... 
M'S PRISON ROOM 
He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her. Turns to go, heading upward, after Elektra. 
M Go after the submarine, forget the girl. Bond! 
INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY 
Elektra has reached a balcony.  It affords a spectacular view of Istanbul.  Bond appears, has her cornered. 
BOND Call him off. 
He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth. 
BOND I won't ask again.  Call him off! 
She looks at him seriously.  He's giving her a last chance, willing her to save herself and the city. 
ELEKTRA (into walkie-talkie) Renard. 
Bond waits... 
ELEKTRA (to Bond) You wouldn't kill me.  You'd miss me. 
And her face breaks into a perverted grin and -- 
ELEKTRA (into walkie-talkie) Dive!  Bond -- 
BLAM!  Bond shoots her. 
She staggers back, shocked at her own mortality. 
BOND I never miss. 
He looks out: 
EXT. BOSPHORUS - DAY 
Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half submerged.  The hatch is still open. 
INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY 
He stares at her dead body a beat. And then, he crouches. He touches her cheek, just once, before he goes. 
Behind him, unbeknownst, M has seen it all. 
EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY 
He moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and 
DIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water.  Amazing. 
EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - DAY 
He surfaces close to the exiting sub.  Grabs a ladder, pulls himself up. 
The hatch is closing...  He splashes through the water flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor shutting the hatch.  WHACKS him with the hatch.  Gets inside. Closes it.  Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the water. 
INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
Bond down below. Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub. He creeps through... 
Approaches one man working some levers, smoking.  Bond holds his gun to his head. 
BOND How do you want to die? (re:  cigarette) That? (re:  gun) Or this? 
INT. CABIN, SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER 
A few SOLID BANGS on the metal of Christmas' door.  It opens and Bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck.  That was his head banging. 
CHRISTMAS (stunned) James!... 
He takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of the sub. 
INT. SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER 
A man is operating the tanks.  Through the intercom: 
RENARD (filtered) Flood tanks 4 and 5... 
The man does as told.  When he's finished -- Bond knocks him out with the butt of his gun. 
INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Several men occupy the central control room, Renard at their centre.  Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the reactor. 
INT. OTHER END OF CONTROL ROOM - SUBMARINE - DAY 
From the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas, so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor because there are so many men in there. 
Keeping behind cover: 
CHRISTMAS Is there another way? 
BOND We go down to the torpedo bay.

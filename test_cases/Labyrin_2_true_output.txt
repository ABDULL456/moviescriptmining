JARETH, the bratty little GOBLIN, is throwing a tantrum. 
JARETH: Nobody ever cares about what I want! 
The walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a crack opens up right in front of SARAH's feet. She looks at the clock and the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. There's nothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike. 
SARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye! 
She jumps. 
88	EXT: SKY - NIGHT 
SARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The striking of the clock continues. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
CLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE. SARAH pulls him closer, lovingly. And they go on spinning. 
89	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT 
SARAH is lying face down on the floor. She comes to slowly and tries to sit up. Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner of the open drawer. She tries to focus, blinking her eyes. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SARAH'S POV - Her eyes slowly focus on FREDDIE's crib. When she can see, she gasps. FREDDIE's not there! The side of the crib is down and the BABY is nowhere to be seen. 
SARAH: Freddie! 
She leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggers out into the hallway. 
90	INT: RAILWAY - NIGHT 
SARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a delighted grin. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SARAH'S POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly, into SARAH's room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength to pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Be then holds his hand out, trying to reach something. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SARAH makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face. 
91	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT 
SARAH stands in the doorway looking down at FREDDIE. 
SARAH (softly): That's quite a journey you took, Freddie. 
FREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining, and WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAH's bear. SARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE on her lap, and hands him the bear. 
SARAH: Here. It's yours. 
FREDDIE takes it happily. 
SARAH (smiling): You earned it. 
She kisses his head and rocks him gently. Then she gazes out the window at the stars. 
92	EXT: HOUSE - NIGHT 
The light shines from SARAH's window. The WHITE BIRD flutters down from the starry sky. It perches in the tree beside the path.

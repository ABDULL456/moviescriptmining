Suggs looks up to see Sethe sticking her pink tongue out at her. Suggs smiles. 
BABY SUGGS Oh, that's fine. Fine. 
Sethe lets out a small laugh. She walks toward the window, stretching her body. Her expression changes as she thinks of her boys. Baby Suggs reads her like a book. 
BABY SUGGS They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long. 
SETHE I don't know. Maybe we should have moved. 
BABY SUGGS What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember. 
SETHE (returning to her work) You remember Halle. 
BABY SUGGS Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did... 
SETHE The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here. 
BABY SUGGS Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody. 
Sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face. Although she loved Halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her. 
SETHE Just got a few more things to do, then I'll start supper. 
Sethe exits. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE DAY. 
Denver is playing in the front yard by herself. 
Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up. 
C.U. of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the feeling a memory - from long ago. 
Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in the barren field of 124...but rather- 
MEMORY; 
EXT. SWEET HOME - LATE DAY. 
A stunning vista of the plantation SWEET HOME - sun beating down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as the eye can see. Sethe's figure dwarfed by the majestic landscape. 
Sethe looks frightened. Her breathing grows shallow. She hears something; 
THE SOUND OF A WAGON'S WHEELS - rolling over a road, growing louder, coming towards her 
INTERCUT; 
C.U. OF A WAGON WHEEL MOVING RAPIDLY ON A ROAD. CAMERA PANS UP TO THE MAN DRIVING THE WAGON - A STERN WHITE MAN WEARING A DISTINCTIVE HAT... 
SETHE TURNS away from the sycamores towards the road to see; 
END OF MEMORY; 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE - LATE DAY. 
A MAN driving a horse and wagon with two children in the back, coming up Bluestone Road. He wears no hat. 
Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of 124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's sycamores have vanished. 
Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124, Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity. 
The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her mother watching her. 
Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot. 
Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods. 
EXT. WOODS - LATE DAY. 
Denver runs with a purpose, knowing exactly where she is going. 
She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground, forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high, with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves. 
This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself together. She lays her face against the cool earth. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - NIGHT. 
Denver walks to her room in her night dress. She passes the opened door of her mother's bedroom and peeks in: 
INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 
Sethe kneeling by her bed, as if praying... 
Beside Sethe, A WHITE DRESS KNEELS as well, with it's sleeve around Sethe's waist. Like two friendly grown-up women, comforting each other in prayer. 
Denver tip toes away. 
INT. DENVER'S ROOM - NIGHT. 
Sethe enters to check on Denver, whom she thinks is asleep. She leans over and kisses her forehead, only to discover she is awake; 
DENVER Mama? 
SETHE What is it baby? 
DENVER You think maybe when daddy comes, he could talk to the baby ghost. Maybe make her behave and then people won't be scared of here no more. 
SETHE I don't know. 
DENVER Why won't she ever settle? 
SETHE She's mad like a baby gets mad. You forgetting how little it is. She wasn't even two years old when she died. Too little to understand. 
DENVER For a baby she throws a powerful spell. 
SETHE No more powerful than the way I loved her. 
Hearing her mother say this, moves Denver. 
DENVER What do you pray for Mama? 
SETHE Oh, I don't really pray anymore. I just talk.

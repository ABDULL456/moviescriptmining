Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten regular men, definitely He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali! 
(The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.) 
CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels! 
(In pops a typical parade commentator) 
HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June? 
CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three! 
(In comes another commentator.) 
JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers! 
GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down the parade) When it comes to exotic type mammals Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you It's a world class menagerie! 
(GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.) 
GENIE: GIRLS: (in couterpoint) Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

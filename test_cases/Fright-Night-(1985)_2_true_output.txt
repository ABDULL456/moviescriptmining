VAMPIRES -- 
PETER 
(SHARPLY) I' lied. Now leave me alone. He opens the door only to have Charley slam it shut, star- ing at Peter desperately. â¢ 
CHARLEY Please, you have to listen to me. The vampire tried to kill me last night-and trashed mv car when he didn't succeed. He'll be coming back for me tonight and if I don't get help, he's going to kill me -- Peter shoves him aside,â¢hopping into his car, quickly lock- ing the door behind him, obviously terrified of Charley. As he starts the engine, Charley beats on the window. 
CHARLEY Mr. Vincent, you've got to believe

The window is nailed shut,. strands of garlic, a dozen at least, hung from the curtains. Dime store crosses and cru- cifixes are everywhere,, in every imaginable shape and size. Charley sits. in' the middle of the floor, whittling a stake from a slat of grape fence, a hammer by his side. 
EVIL ED 
(STARING AROUND) What's all this for? 
CHARLEY Self-defense. Not that I think I'll need it. He'll be dead before nightfall. 
AMY (exchanging.: worried glances with Evil. Ed) Who will be? 
CHARLEY Dandrige. I'm waiting for the guy he lives with to leave, then I'm doing to go next door, find his coffin, and pound this through his heart. He holds up the stake. Evil Ed and Amy look at it, hor- rified. 
AMY That's murder, Charley. 
CHARLEY (looking back at her with total seriousness) You can't murder a vampire, Amy. They're already dead, remember. 
AMY Charley, you're acting crazy. 
CHARLEY I don't have any choice, Amy. The police won't listen to me,.my mother thinks I'm crazy, you two, even Peter Vincent thinks I'm nuts.

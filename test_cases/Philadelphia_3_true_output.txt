REPORTER MEDINA "This case is sending a cold chill through the legal community. One of Wyant Wheeler's key clients, the Grace Foster Foundation, which supports several AIDS charities, has taken its business to another firm until this matter is resolved..." 
As the TV DRONES ON, CHARLIE THE COP, OTHERS GLARE at Joe. 
FILKO (chuckles) Hey, Joe. (a wink to the COP) You're not starting to get a little... light on your feet here on us, are you? 
Joe does not laugh. 
JOE Yeah, Filko. I am. (stepping toward Filko) I'm on the prowl, Filko. I need a man. Not just any man. I need a hunk. A hunk like you. How about it, Filko? Want to play sailor? This time, I'll be first mate and you can be Columbus. 
FILKO Chill out, Joe. 
JOE (angry) Those people make me sick, Filko! But a law's been broken, okay? The law. Remember the law? 
CHARLIE THE COP has relaxed a bit. 
CHARLIE THE COP At least we agree on one thing, Joe... They make me sick too. 
HOLD ON JOE, but WE HEAR THE TV REPORTER in the BACKGROUND: 
TV REPORTER MEDINA "... now the public knows that your son has AIDS and he's gay. How does that make you feel?" 
All eyes turn to the TV: SARAH BECKETT IN CLOSE UP. 
SARAH "This is a world full of war, famine, poverty, homelessness... and people make a fuss because two men or two women want to live together, or make love. Seems kind of silly, doesn't it?" 
The bar ERUPTS with a CHORUS OF BOOS AND CATCALLS. 
CUT TO: 
JOE ADDRESSING A WITNESS IN COURT (INT./DAY) ... 
JOE And Walter Kenton knew the lesions on your face and arms were caused by AIDS? 
The witness: MARIA TORRES, Hispanic, 35, healthy-looking. 
MARIA Definitely. People were going around, whispering things. I figured I didn't have anything to lose, so I told all the partners. 
JOE How did Walter Kenton treat you, after you told him you had AIDS? 
CLOSE ON KENTON, looking confident. 
MARIA Every time he came into contact with me, he'd get this look on his face. I called it, the "Oh God" expression. As in "Oh God, here comes that woman with AIDS." 
Andrew LAUGHS. 
JOE Ms. Torres? Have your employers fired you for having AIDS? 
MARIA No. When I need time off, for medical reasons, we work it out. 
JOE Thank you. No more questions. 
Jerome Green rises. 
JEROME GREEN Miss Torres. How did you contract the AIDS virus? 
MARIA During a transfusion. I lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second child. 
JEROME GREEN In other words, in your case you happen to be an innocent victim of the AIDS tragedy. 
MARIA Look. I'm no different from everyone else who has this disease: I'm not guilty, I'm not innocent. I'm just trying to survive. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
JOE, APPROACHING A WITNESS (INT./DAY) ... 
JOE Beyond noticing the marks on his face, were there other things about his appearance that made you suspect he had AIDS? 
THE WITNESS: Paralegal Anthea Burton. 
ANTHEA He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong. (looking at Wheeler) And I can't believe they're saying they didn't notice anything. 
BELINDA Objection. 
JUDGE GARNETT Just answer the question. 
ANTHEA Sorry. 
JOE Ms. Burton. You're black. 
ANTHEA Is that a question? 
JOE No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler? 
ANTHEA Yes. 
Wheeler shakes his head, disgusted. Kenton fumes, outraged. Seidman looks surprised. 
JOE In what way?

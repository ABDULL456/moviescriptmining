DR. HARRIS You don't have to walk like that. 
ZOE Oh.   Okay. 
Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Should we hug? We might have just made a baby together. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this exclusive baby club. 
ZOE Hi. 
PREGNANT WOMEN Hi. 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club... 
ZOE Hi. 
WOMAN Hi. 
The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) You're starting to freak me out. 
ZOE Sorry. 
Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look. 
WOMAN Stop it. 
EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY 
It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over their heads. 
Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together. 
A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by. 
ZOE Hi! 
Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She rounds the corner towards the subway station and then, miraculously, spies a cab. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Taxi! 
She runs (little steps) across the street. 
INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe closes the door behind her. 
ZOE Hallelujah! 
As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices someone entering the cab from the other side. 
This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid -- faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Uh...excuse me. This is my cab. 
STAN You own it? 
ZOE No, but I'm about to rent it. 
STAN Actually, if we're being technical, you kind of stole it. 
ZOE I don't think so. 
STAN If you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours. 
ZOE I didn't see you. 
STAN I saw you see me. 
ZOE (to the cabbie) Sir, who saw you first? 
The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read. 
STAN Maybe you're not from around here, but there's a code. It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we-- 
ZOE Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out. 
Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.

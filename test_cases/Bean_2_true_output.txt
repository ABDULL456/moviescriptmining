ALISON Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin 
DAVID Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England... 
ALISON (SUSPICIOUSLY) Yeeees? 
DAVID And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while. 
ALISON There aren't hotels? 
DAVID Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff. 
ALISON (POINTEDLY) And what did you say? 
DAVID I said I'd check with you. 
She looks at him piercingly.     This clearly happens a lot.   She knows when he's telling the truth. Pause. 
DAVID Then I said 'yes'. 
She puts Bambi carefully back on the table, gets up and moves to the kitchen. DAVID follows. 
ALISON Do we know anything about him? 
DAVID Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ...      at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here. 
ALISON David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'? 
DAVID Yes.   Yes. (pause) Sometime. 
She shakes her head. 
ALISON It's the last thing we need. 
DAVID That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea." 
He knows he's made a mess here.       Enter KEVIN, their smart young son, strolling through. 
KEVIN Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about .... (checks watch) oh, 20 minutes. 
DAVID Great, good. 
And KEVIN exits. 
DAVID Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back?     Years ago? No. Course not. Just imagining it. 
ALISON isn't really listening.       Much tension. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - NIGHT 
9.30 p.m. U.K. time. A black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house with its motor idling. Its driver looks fed up waiting. BEAN appears at a downstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - DAY 
MR. BEAN is ready to leave his room.       Battered old 
suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway. 
Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards, 
drawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock.    Even 
Bean's old G.P.O. phone has one on its dial. 
BEAN looks across to his TEDDY, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside an up-sided cardboard box. The box is sits on an armchair. A hand-written sign, taped to its roof reads: 'TEDDY HOTEL' followed by three stars. 
A smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'FULL'. BEAN is just about to leave but stops to consider. Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars on the hotel hoarding, as a treat. 
He then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various objects in the flat. The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   MR.   BEAN'S RESIDENCE'S HALLWAY ~ DAY 
BEAN leaves his flat. lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door saying 'NO SMOKING". He now turns his attention to the pieces of string hanging out the letter box in his door. Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls. 
CUT TO back inside the flat. we now understand the string - as all the furniture starts to move across the flat. It works incredibly neatly the chair reaches the door

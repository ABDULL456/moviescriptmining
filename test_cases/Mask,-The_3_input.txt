BOBBY Er, uh... Are you on the list? 
THE MASK No, but I believe my friends are. (fans a wad of cash) Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. 
He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club as the crowd scrambles for the cash. 
INT. MONKEY'S PAW 
This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical DECOR complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks. 
CAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite ringside table and removes the "reserved" sign. The lights dim an all eyes go to the bandstand. 
ANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND 
A spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a gigantic fan revealing... 
TINA CARLYLE 
in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would be arrested for disturbing the peace. 
She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella. 
TINA There's all kinds of men In this old world That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl. 
But of the men from Which to choose There's only one type That I... ap...aprooove. 
And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina sings "Checks Appeal". She works the room throughout the song, driving the men crazy as she lingers by each table. 
TINA (CONT.) You can keep your cowboys on the farm The gigolos don't make me warm It's mink my fingers crave to feel I need a man with checks appeal. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina. 
His eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with EACH beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished. 
TINA (CONT.) Pretty boys are such a bore There's manly macho types galore But you'll always know The diamond's real If you've got a man with checks appeal. 
The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint shaker. WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still. 
DORIAN'S TABLE 
Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian. 
DORIAN What the hell are you doing here? 
EDDY We got trouble. You better come upstairs. 
Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards his office. 
ANGLE ON THE MASK 
as he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a wolf's. He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and stomps his foot on the floor. 
TINA Don't want to see too fanatic But dollar signs are so romantic I want a love That's deep and real Just with a man that's got... (big finish) Checks ap-peaaal. 
The audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow. 
Suddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits him. 
THE MASK Let's rock this joint! 
He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, BEATNIK BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE- WOOGIE. 
The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING out a driving rock 'n roll tune. 
Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into a wild special FX JITTERBUG. 
THE CROWD 
watches amazed as... 
THE MASK AND TINA 
put Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS TINA beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat. 
THE MASK S-s-s-smokin! 
CUT TO: 
INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE 
Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound in his side. 
DORIAN What the hell happened to you? 
FREEZE I'll be okay. Nobody puts the chill on Freeze. 
DORIAN Where's the money? 
FREEZE Deal went south, Bro'. Someone else hit the place before we did. 
DORIAN Who?

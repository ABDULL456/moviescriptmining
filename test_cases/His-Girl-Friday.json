{"test1_input": "BRUCE Well, I'll try to give her one. \nBURNS I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother? \nBRUCE Just for the first year. \nBURNS (sighing) That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow! \nThat \"ow\" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the table from Hildy. \nBRUCE Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know. \nBURNS Yes, I know... (he chuckles) Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town... \nHis laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene. \nGUS Well, here we are. \nHe begins serving them. \nBURNS (trying to pick up again after a second) How's business, Bruce? \nBRUCE Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life. \nBURNS I don't blame them. \nGus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, lets out a startled \"ouch\". \nHILDY Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped. \nGUS (a pained expression belies his words) That's all right. \nBURNS I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do. \nBRUCE Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts. \nBURNS I see what you mean. \nThey fall to. \nCLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nShe sips her coffee and acts surprised. \nHILDY Gus, this -- \nCLOSEUP - GUS \nGUS (winking) Good coffee, isn't it? \nCLOSEUP - HILDY \nShe smiles and winks back, and takes another sip. \nGROUP SHOT AT TABLE \nGus starts to go. \nBRUCE You've forgotten my milk. \nGUS Oh. The milk. Yes. \nHe leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy. \nBURNS Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom. \nHILDY (lifts cup) Thank you. \nBRUCE (looking for something to respond with -- apologetically) He hasn't brought my milk yet. \nA bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns. \nBUS BOY They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns. \nBURNS They would! \nBoy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of coffee, which he then takes off with him. \nTWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY \nBRUCE (looking after him) You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow. \nHILDY (looking at him maternally) You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is. \nBRUCE Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm. \nHILDY He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake. \nBRUCE (shaking his head) If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet. \nHILDY That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT \nBurns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and then. \nBURNS Get this -- get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks' vacation -- and right away... All right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't know it yet. But she'll be there. I promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie to stick around. \nHe hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk. He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he comes out of the booth. \nINT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE \nGus is entering the scene. \nGUS Your milk, sir. \nHe serves Bruce. \nGUS And I brought you another cup of coffee, Hildy. \nGus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' chair. \nHILDY Thanks, Gus. \nShe takes a sip and almost chokes. \nBRUCE Too hot? \nHILDY (gasping for breath) No. It's strong. (quickly) But I like it that way. \nGus goes, smiling. \nBRUCE (looking off) Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he? \nHILDY (beaming) He certainly -- hic -- does! \nBurns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before jumping off a roof, and sits down. \n", "test1_true": "BURNS Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters. \nHILDY What now? \nBURNS His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him. (he sips his coffee) I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation. \nHILDY (sipping hers) You said it. \nBURNS So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow. \nBRUCE Just what is the lowdown on Williams? \nBURNS It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down. \nHILDY If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away? \nBURNS Because it happened to be a colored policeman. \nHILDY (for Bruce's benefit) The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town. \nBURNS Especially with an election coming up in a few days. \nBRUCE Are you sure Williams is not all there? \nBURNS All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected. \nBRUCE But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible? \nCLOSEUP - BURNS \nBURNS (there's a sly expression on his face) How? \nHILDY'S VOICE You could run an interview that would prove it. Remember the interview I wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved his life. \nBURNS (slapping hands together) Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You could save that poor devil's life. You could -- but -- (the enthusiasm dies away) -- you're going away. I forgot. \nTHREE SHOT \nBRUCE How long would the interview take? \nBURNS Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it. \nBRUCE We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life. \nHILDY No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same. \nBURNS I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart -- \nHILDY Why, Walter, you're getting poetic! \nBURNS (to Bruce) You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands! \nBruce gulps. \nBURNS How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives! \nHILDY (breaking into applause) What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act! \nBURNS What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling? \nHILDY Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's. \nBURNS What do you mean? \nHILDY I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors. \nBURNS (laughs, throws up his hands) All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition. \nHILDY We're not interested. \nBURNS (to Bruce) Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say? \nBRUCE I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns! \nHILDY Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy? \nBRUCE Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars. \nHILDY And what's the matter with a thousand dollars? \nBRUCE But -- \nHILDY According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined? \nBRUCE I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes. \nBURNS Now you're talking! \nHILDY (turning on Burns) You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train. (back to Burns) And no tricks, Walter! \nBURNS What tricks would I pull? \nHILDY Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy? \nBRUCE About twenty-five hundred dollars. \nHILDY Better make that a certified check, Walter. \nBURNS (indignantly) What do you think I am -- a crook? \nHILDY Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me? \nBURNS All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints? \nHILDY (rising) No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified. \nBRUCE All right, dear. \nHILDY Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money? \nBRUCE (feeling his pocket) The five hundred? Sure. \nHILDY On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets. \nBRUCE But -- \nHILDY Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game -- \nBRUCE But I don't gamble, Hilda! \nHILDY I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear. \nBRUCE (reluctantly) All right. (he pulls out his wallet) One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey. \nHILDY I'll be careful, darling.

Listen, Walter, this'll get me in a terrible jam with my fianc\u00e9e and I don't stand so well with him now. Don't worry, Mother, this is only temporary. \nAt the door, Louie gets Mrs. Baldwin out and disappears with her.

Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me? \nBURNS (scornfully) Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on?

(quickly closes the door) \nHILDY (slightly bewildered) Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone? \nBURNS Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives! \nHILDY (the fire upon her) I'd like to think. \nBURNS Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him. \nHILDY (excited) I get it! \nBURNS You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career!

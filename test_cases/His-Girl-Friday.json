{"train": "\"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" \nscreenplay by \nCharles Lederer \nBased on the play \n\"The Front Page\" \nby \nBen Hecht and Charles MacArthur \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD \nTwo telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in and out answering calls. \n1ST OPERATOR This is the Morning Post... The City Room? Just a moment, I'll connect you. (plugs in call) \n2ND OPERATOR Morning Post... Sports Department? Just a moment -- (plugs in call) \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it again from the city room which stretches on beyond switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock. \nCLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY \nas he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of a crossword puzzle. \nMED. SHOT \nas a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to behind him. The office boy looks up. \nOFFICE BOY What's a seven-letter word for --? \nREPORTER Don't ask me! If I knew any seven- letter words, I'd be something better than a reporter! \nHe catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down. \nREPORTER Hey! Down! Down! \nMED. SHOT ELEVATORS \nas reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds on it. It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in. The door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT TABLE \noffice boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come into the scene. \nHILDY (with a smile) Hello, Skinny. Remember me? \nOFFICE BOY (looks up; then a glowing smile) Hildy Johnson! \nCLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD \nHildy approaches the switchboard. \nHILDY (to operator) Hello, Maisie. \nThe first operator looks up. \nMAISIE Hello -- Hildy! You coming back? \nHILDY No, just visiting. Tell me, is the lord of the universe in today? \nMAISIE He is -- and in a very bad humor. I think somebody stole one of his crown jewels. Shall I announce you? \nHILDY No, never mind -- I'll blow my own trumpet. \nTHREE SHOT BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR \nHildy turns to Bruce. \nHILDY I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you. \nBRUCE Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you. \nWe hear a giggle off scene. \nCLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY \nHe looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles. \nTWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY \nHILDY What did you say, Bruce? \nBruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City Room. \nBRUCE I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you. \nHILDY Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling. \nBRUCE (grimly) I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you? \nHILDY My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it. \nBRUCE I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here. \nHILDY I'll come a-running, pardner. \nShe starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it for her. Hildy smiles. \nHILDY Thanks, Bruce. \nShe kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares after Hildy. \nMEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM \nHildy starts to walk through City Room. \nTRUCKING SHOT - HILDY \nas she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: \"Hildy!\" \"Hello, Hildy\", etc., from the men as Hildy goes straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own greetings: \"Jim!\" \"Hi, good-looking!\" \"Laura\" \"Hullo, Pop\" \"Nan!\" \"Eddie!\" \"Hello, Mac\" \"Pete!\" \"Frank\" \"Oscar!\", and gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him as she goes by. He turns around: \"Say, who did that?\" As he sees Hildy: \"Hello, Hildy!\" Hildy: \"Hi, Jake.\" She passes a middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back. \nHILDY Hello, Beatrice. How's \"Advice to the Lovelorn\"? \nBEATRICE (looking up) Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle! What are you doing here? \nHILDY Point of information -- what does a girl say on meeting her divorced husband? OR: (What does a girl do, etc.) \nBEATRICE (illustrating) My advice is duck and cross with your right. \nHildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the City Room. \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE LONG SHOT \nBURNS Then what does he want with you? \nHILDY (laughing) Now you got me. \nBURNS Nothing personal. I was just asking. \nAt the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out. \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS \nBURNS After all -- \nHe stops as he realizes she's not there. The door opens. Hildy comes out. \nHILDY You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me. \nBURNS (incredulous) No kidding? \nINT. CITY ROOM FULL SHOT \nReporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter scene. \nTRUCKING SHOT \nas Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups are silent as they watch the two. \nHILDY (trying to keep pace) And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady. \nBURNS (over his shoulder) What for? \nHILDY (shouting) And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her! \nBURNS (stops) Oh, I'm sorry. \nBurns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says, under his breath, to Maisie: \nBURNS (under his breath) Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes. \nHildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens the gate and holds it for Burns. \nHILDY Allow me. \nBURNS (walking right through) Thanks. \nHildy follows him out. \nINT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT \nas Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union \"boy\". Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the \"boy\", seizes his hand, shakes it and says: \nBURNS I can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself. \nCLOSE SHOT BRUCE \nHildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this. \nCLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER \nThe messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping his hand vigorously. \nMESSENGER There must be some mistake. I'm already married. \nBURNS (you never saw a more surprised man) Already married! (turning to Hildy o.s.) Hildy, why didn't you tell me? \nCLOSEUP HILDY \nShe shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling nevertheless. \nMEDIUM SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER \nBURNS (again seizing messenger's hand) Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin! \nMESSENGER But my name -- \nBRUCE (as he enters scene) Mr. Burns! \nBurns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand. \nBURNS Yeah? You'll have to excuse me -- I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. Just leave your card with the boy. \nCLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND BURNS \nBruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his attention. Burns turns on him: \nBURNS I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look -- (he points o.s.) -- there's the boy. Take your card and leave it with him. \nHe turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his sleeve and pulls at it. \nBRUCE Mr. Burns -- \nBURNS (wheeling around) I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin! \nBRUCE I'm Bruce Baldwin! \nMEDIUM SHOT \nBurns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce: \nBURNS You're Bruce Baldwin? \nBRUCE Yes! \nBURNS (accusing to messenger) Then who are you? \nMESSENGER (falteringly) My name's Pete Davis. \nBURNS Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is no concern of yours and after this I'll thank you to keep out of my affairs! \nThe messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce. \nCLOSEUP HILDY \nShe is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is compelled to smile at Walter's behavior. \nCLOSE SHOT BURNS AND BRUCE \nBURNS (reaches for Bruce's hand but grabs the umbrella and begins shaking the handle up and down) This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake. \nBRUCE (he tries to shift the umbrella, calling Burns' attention to it, and offers his hand instead) \nBURNS Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related -- \nBRUCE (completely unnerved by this time, and you can't quite blame him) Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all. \nBURNS You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man. \nBRUCE (this is the final crusher) Oh. \nBRUCE Well, I'll try to give her one. \nBURNS I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother? \nBRUCE Just for the first year. \nBURNS (sighing) That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow! \nThat \"ow\" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the table from Hildy. \nBRUCE Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know. \nBURNS Yes, I know... (he chuckles) Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town... \nHis laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene. \nGUS Well, here we are. \nHe begins serving them. \nBURNS (trying to pick up again after a second) How's business, Bruce? \nBRUCE Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life. \nBURNS I don't blame them. \nGus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, lets out a startled \"ouch\". \nHILDY Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped. \nGUS (a pained expression belies his words) That's all right. \nBURNS I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do. \nBRUCE Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts. \nBURNS I see what you mean. \nThey fall to. \nCLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nShe sips her coffee and acts surprised. \nHILDY Gus, this -- \nCLOSEUP - GUS \nGUS (winking) Good coffee, isn't it? \nCLOSEUP - HILDY \nShe smiles and winks back, and takes another sip. \nGROUP SHOT AT TABLE \nGus starts to go. \nBRUCE You've forgotten my milk. \nGUS Oh. The milk. Yes. \nHe leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy. \nBURNS Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom. \nHILDY (lifts cup) Thank you. \nBRUCE (looking for something to respond with -- apologetically) He hasn't brought my milk yet. \nA bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns. \nBUS BOY They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns. \nBURNS They would! \nBoy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of coffee, which he then takes off with him. \nTWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY \nBRUCE (looking after him) You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow. \nHILDY (looking at him maternally) You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is. \nBRUCE Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm. \nHILDY He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake. \nBRUCE (shaking his head) If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet. \nHILDY That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT \nBurns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and then. \nBURNS Get this -- get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks' vacation -- and right away... All right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't know it yet. But she'll be there. I promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie to stick around. \nHe hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk. He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he comes out of the booth. \nINT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE \nGus is entering the scene. \nGUS Your milk, sir. \nHe serves Bruce. \nGUS And I brought you another cup of coffee, Hildy. \nGus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' chair. \nHILDY Thanks, Gus. \nShe takes a sip and almost chokes. \nBRUCE Too hot? \nHILDY (gasping for breath) No. It's strong. (quickly) But I like it that way. \nGus goes, smiling. \nBRUCE (looking off) Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he? \nHILDY (beaming) He certainly -- hic -- does! \nBurns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before jumping off a roof, and sits down. \nShe kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek. \nHILDY So long, husbands. \nShe goes. \nTRUCKING SHOT - HILDY \nleaving. She weaves just a bit. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN \nThey look after her. \nBRUCE (smiling a little) I never knew Hildy to be so determined before. \nBURNS You haven't seen anything yet. \nBruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE SHOT AT TELEPHONE \nIt is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other hand. \nENDICOTT (into phone) Criminal Courts Press Room... This is Endicott... No, nothing new on the Williams case yet boss. Well, you bet I'm here plugging away every minute. (hangs up and studies his cards) Up a dime. \nCAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak. Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and McCue. \nMURPHY (dropping his cards) By me. \nWILSON (also dropping) Droparoo. \nSchwartz knocks on table and drops cards. \nMCCUE (reluctantly) I'll call. \nENDICOTT Three sixes. Is that any good? \nHILDY'S VOICE It sure looks good from here. \nThe boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice. \nCLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON \nframed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and comes into the room. \nMED. SHOT REPORTERS \nThey are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. There are ad libs of \"Hildy!\" \"Where'd you come from?\" \"Holy Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!\", etc. Hildy raises her hand for silence. \nHILDY One at a time, boys. \nShe enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All through the above action she is talking rapidly. \nHILDY No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it! As a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions? \nHildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put on the new stockings. \nENDICOTT (grinning) Well, that about covers everything. \nHILDY Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun? \nMURPHY If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes. \nMCCUE It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job. (waving his hand toward Wilson) Take it away, Fred Wilson! \nWILSON Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding. (gesturing toward Schwartz) Come in, Dave Schwartz. \nSCHWARTZ His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all. \nHILDY Thanks, boys. That's all I want to know. \nHildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts the stockings in a drawer. \nENDICOTT Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk. \nHILDY I know, I just want to give him a thrill. \nHildy crosses back to desk and sits down. \nHILDY All right, boys, now that everything is settled, deal me in. \nHildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM. \nINSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM. \nCLOSE SHOT HILDY \nShe picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, picking up cards dealt her with one hand. \nHILDY (into phone) Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me Walter Burns. (she studies her cards -- then, into phone) Hello, Walter. How's the old double- crosser? \nCLOSE SHOT WALTER BURNS \nTelephone at his ear. \nBURNS Hello, my fine-feathered friend. Thought I might be hearing from you. What have you got to report? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT and we see that Burns is stripped to the waist. A doctor is applying a stethoscope to his chest. We HOLD the picture a second: Burns listening intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to his chest. \nBURNS (into phone) Going all right, eh? \nDOCTOR (nodding) Fine. \nDoctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up. \nBURNS (putting hand over mouthpiece of phone) Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute? How do you expect me to get any work done? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in front of him at the desk. Bruce grins. \nDOCTOR How do you expect me to get anywhere if you're going to keep on that phone? If you'll just give me two minutes more -- \nBURNS (into phone) Well, they haven't finished with me yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of condition. They found two new dimples. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG. CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT TELEPHONE \ncards in her other hand. \nHILDY How about that check? All right, Mr. Burns, but remember, no checkee -- no story. Well, as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up? Yes, sir. (she hangs up) All right, boys. Up a dime. \nENDICOTT'S VOICE Right back at you. \nMED. SHOT \nINT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE MED. SHOT \nThe doctor has gone. Burns is adjusting his shirt. Bruce is sitting at the desk. \nBRUCE I don't know. This makes me feel funny. \nTWO SHOT \nBURNS Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to. \nBRUCE I feel I ought to take care of her. \nBURNS Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent. \nBRUCE Well, I'm independent, too. \nBURNS Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries? \nBRUCE Well, of course, if you put it that way. \nBURNS (everything he has on the ball) And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too. \nBRUCE I'm beginning to realize that. \nBURNS And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone. \nBRUCE (a lump in his throat) Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you. \nBURNS No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over. \nHe turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see how that goes over. It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes a tear away. \nMED. SHOT \nas Duffy comes into the room. He advances toward the desk. \nDUFFY (placing check on desk) Here's that certified check, Walter. (sotto voce) I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man! \nBURNS (also sotto voce) Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five. (louder) Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. (picking up check he rises) \nHe walks over to Bruce. \nBURNS Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything. \nBRUCE (also rising) Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you. \nCLOSEUP DUFFY \nHe reacts to this sweetly solemn thought. \nBURNS AND BRUCE \nCAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his arm around him. \nBRUCE Well, she'll know some day. \nBURNS That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute. \nHe releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it to him. \nBURNS Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again. \nBRUCE Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story. \nThey are at the door. Burns opens the door for Bruce. \nSHOT FEATURING LOUIS \nLouis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a newspaper. He is all alert, however. Bruce and Burns come into the scene talking. \nBURNS Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man. \nBRUCE (embarrassed) Thanks a lot. \nThey pass Louis. He looks up. \nBRUCE AND BURNS \nBruce, still embarrassed, looks down. Burns turns and signals to Louis. \nCLOSE SHOT LOUIS \nwatching. \nCLOSE SHOT BURNS \nBurns points to Bruce's back. \nCLOSE SHOT LOUIS \nLouis nods. \nBRUCE AND BURNS \nBURNS Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you? \nBRUCE Oh, sure. (he extends his hand) Well, thanks for everything. \nBURNS Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long. \nBRUCE So long. \nHe turns and goes. Burns watches him. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nBruce is going out, his back toward Camera. Burns watches. Louis comes between Burns and Bruce and follows Bruce out as we see Bruce going toward outer door. \nCLOSEUP BURNS \nHe rubs his hands in glee as he starts back for his office. \nINT. PRESS ROOM SHOT FEATURING HILDY \nShe is raking in a pot. \nHILDY I don't know why you boys are so good to me. \nMCCUE (throwing cards down) Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you? \nHILDY Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps. \nThere is a whirr and crash from the gallows. They start. \nBENSINGER AT WINDOW \nBENSINGER I wish they'd stop that practicing. \nCOP Come on! \nHe whistles. \nCOP (to mob) Beat it! \nCLOSE SHOT THREE \nas they go through crowd. The look on poor Bruce's face, muddy anyhow, is something. Suddenly, Bruce cries: \nBRUCE My hat! \nCOP Get his hat, somebody. \nCLOSEUP BRUCE'S HAT \nlying top up, in a puddle. Hand reaches in and picks it up. \nCLOSE SHOT THREE \nas hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head. Another takem from Bruce. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT \nat the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals himself. \nWILLIAMS I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else. \nHILDY (puzzled and worried) You didn't mean to kill that policeman? \nWILLIAMS Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs. \nHILDY What are your beliefs, Earl? \nWILLIAMS They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things. \nHILDY How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl? \nWILLIAMS I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense. \nHILDY (writing) \"Production for use only.\" Well, maybe that's the answer. \nWILLIAMS It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense? \nCLOSEUP HILDY \nHILDY (thoughtfully) Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl. \nWILLIAM'S VOICE Just use things for what they were meant, that's all. \nHILDY Sure. (she studies him a moment) What's the purpose of a gun, Earl? \nCLOSEUP WILLIAMS \nWILLIAMS A gun? (he thinks -- then a revealing smile breaks out) Why -- to shoot, of course. \nMED. CLOSE TWO SHOT \nHILDY Is that how you came to shoot the policeman? \nWILLIAMS Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it? \nHILDY (writing) Very simple, Earl. \nWILLIAMS There's nothing crazy about that, is there? \nHILDY No, Earl, not at all. (she indicates the flowers) Who sent you the flowers, Earl? \nWILLIAMS (reverently) Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person. \nHILDY (pointing to picture pinned on wall) Isn't that her picture? \nWILLIAMS (turning toward it) Yes. Isn't she beautiful? \nINSERT: PICTURE OF MOLLIE \nHILDY'S VOICE If you should be pardoned, are you figuring on marrying Mollie? \nEARL'S VOICE Oh, no, she's much too good for me. \nHARTMAN'S VOICE How'd you get in here? \nMEDIUM SHOT \nSheriff Hartman has come into the scene. Hildy turns toward him. \nHILDY Same way you did. (pointing) Through that gate. \nHARTMAN I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission. \nHILDY All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say. \nHARTMAN Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams? \nHILDY Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it -- \nHARTMAN (beaming) Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. (turning toward Williams) 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling? \nWILLIAMS Fine, thanks, Sheriff. \nHARTMAN That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you? \nWILLIAMS I won't. \nHARTMAN (to Hildy) Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging? \nHILDY (in a low voice so Williams won't overhear) No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight. \nHARTMAN (just as loud as ever) You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy. \nHILDY That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later. \nWILLIAMS Don't forget about production for use. \nHILDY I won't, Earl. (she goes) \nINT. PRESS ROOM GROUP SHOT POKER GAME - NIGHT \nThe game is on. Bensinger, at his desk, is reading a book. The electric lights have been switched on. \nMURPHY (raking in a pot) Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around. \nENDICOTT Who's this guy she's gonna marry? \nWILSON Baldwin -- his name is. \nSCHWARTZ I give that marriage six months. \nENDICOTT What's the use? I can't win a pot. \nCLOSE SHOT WILSON AT PHONE \nWILSON (into phone) Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. (he covers transmitter) \nMED. SHOT TAKING DOOR \nWILSON (to others) Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself. \nSCHWARTZ What's he want? \nWILSON Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited. \nHildy comes back. Looks at them and stares contemptuously. \nHILDY Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better. \nWILSON Phone for you, Hildy. \nHILDY (going toward it) Who is it? \nWILSON Oh, some insurance man. Are you in? \nHILDY (grabbing phone) Give me that! \nCLOSEUP HILDY \nHILDY (into phone) Hello! Hello! Bruce?... what?... Where are you?... You're where?... How did that happen?... (she listens unbelievingly a second) I'll be right over! \nMED. SHOT \nas Hildy hangs up and darts out of room. The others watch in amazement. \nMURPHY Boy, did you see her go? \nENDICOTT Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub. \nWILSON I told you Baldwin was in trouble. \nMCCUE Probably went out without his hankie and wants Mamma to wipe his nose. \nSCHWARTZ I still give that marriage six months. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT BENSINGER \nat phone. \nBENSINGER Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's offico, will you... Hello, Sheriff Hartman?... This is Bensinger. How about that favor? You know what: once and for all, will you hang this guy at five A.M. instead of seven? It won't hurt you and we can make the City Edition. \nINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE CLOSE SHOT SHERIFF HARTMAN \nat phone. \nHARTMAN (indignantly) Once and for all, I'm not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour... What? Don't threaten me, Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up! (he hangs up; an afterthought -- he calls up operator) And, operator, I told you not to disturb me! I don't care who calls -- I don't want to be disturbed again till I tell you! (he hangs up -- turns to somebody o.s. and speaks) How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer? Want me to hang williams at their convenience! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO A MED. GROUP SHOT, showing Williams, Sheriff Hartman and Dr. Egelhoffer. They are the only occupants of room. Williams is seated facing a large standing searchlight. \nEGELHOFFER The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization. \nHARTMAN You said it! \nEGELHOFFER They're always after me for interviews. \nHARTMAN Me, too. \nEGELHOFFER (fencing) Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind? \nHARTMAN (not liking it) Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me. \nEGELHOFFER (he'll bargain) We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects. \nHARTMAN (he buys) A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor. \nEGELHOFFER Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though. \nHARTMAN It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing. \nEGELHOFFER Yes, I suppose so. It all helps. \nWILLIAMS (just a spectator up to now) Are you gentlemen all through with me? \nEGELHOFFER Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights? \nThe Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face. \nEGELHOFFER You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that? \nWILLIAMS The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe. \nEGELHOFFER I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime? \nCLOSEUP WILLIAMS \nWILLIAMS In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. POLICE CELL CLOSEUP BRUCE \nBRUCE I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. I never stole a watch in my life. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to show us Bruce in police cell. Hildy outside. A police lieutenant with her in b.g. \nHILDY I know you didn't, Bruce. \nShe whirls on lieutenant. \nHILDY (to lieutenant) Let him out of here, Lieutenant. \nLIEUTENANT (conciliatingly) But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him. \nHILDY And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames? \nLIEUTENANT Now, Hildy -- \nHILDY Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out? \nLIEUTENANT I can't. \nHILDY All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it! \nLIEUTENANT Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out. \nHILDY You can let him out on bail, can't you? \nINT. SHERIFF HARTMAN'S OFFICE MED. SHOT \nWILLIAMS I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued. \nHARTMAN Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor. \nEGELHOFFER Just one thing more. I'd like to reenact the crime, Mr. Williams. May I have your gun, please, Sheriff? \nHartman starts to take gun out, hesitates. \nHARTMAN I don't know -- \nEGELHOFFER (insistently) Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen. \nHartman hands him the gun. \nEGELHOFFER Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams? \nWILLIAMS Yes, sir. \nEgelhoffer hands the gun to Williams and then backs up a few paces. \nEGELHOFFER So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me. \nWILLIAMS (hesitantly) Well, it wasn't exactly that way -- \nEGELHOFFER (insistently) Point the gun at me! \nWilliams does so. \nEGELHOFFER Then what did you do? \nWilliams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger. Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples over. \nWILLIAMS (pathetically) Now can I go, please? \nThere is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling: \nVOICE Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened? \nWilliams, alarmed by voice, turns and starts toward window. \nINT. PRESS ROOM MED. GROUP SHOT \nHildy is now wearing her hat and gloves. She picks up her bag and starts for the door. \nENDICOTT Goodbye, Yonson. \nMCCUE So long, Hildy. \nMURPHY Send us a postcard, kid. \nSCHWARTZ Who'll keep the lamp in the window for you. \nBENSINGER Goodbye, Hildy. \nHildy has crossed to doorway, the CAMERA TRUCKING WITH HER. She turns and faces the room to make a last bravura speech. \nHILDY Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When you're crawling up fire escapes, getting kicked out of front doors, and eating Christmas dinners in one- armed joints, don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my husband sells insurance! \nShe turns and starts on a bit of verse: \nHILDY \"It takes a heap o' livin' to make a house a home.\" \nShe is interrupted by a terrific fusillade of shots in the courtyard. A roar of excited voices comes up. For a tense second, everyone is motionless. There is another volley of shots. Wilson, Endicott and Murphy jump for the window. \nCLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW \nVOICES FROM COURTYARD Get the riot guns! Spread out, you fellows! Etc. \nWILSON There's a jail-break! \nMURPHY (at window, simultaneously) Cooley! What's the matter What's happened? \nVOICES FROM YARD Watch the gate! He's probably trying the gate! \nOutside, a siren begins to wail. \nENDICOTT (out the window) Who got away? Who was it? \nVOICE OUTSIDE Earl... Williams!!! \nTHE REPORTERS Who? Who'd he say? Earl Williams! It was Earl Williams! He got away! Etc. \nSHOT AT DESK \nMCCUE Holy ---! Gimme that telephone! (works hook frantically) Hurry! Hurry up! This is important! \nMED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR \nSearchlights hit the windows, sweeping from direction of the jail. Hildy stands paralyzed, her bundle in her hand. There is another rifle volley. Two windowpanes crash into the room. Some plaster falls. Gongs sound above the siren. The boys are jumping for their telephones. Another windowpane goes. \nMCCUE (screaming) Look out! \nCLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW \nMURPHY (out the window) Look out where you're aiming, will you? \nA QUICK MONTAGE \nof reporters at their various phones follows: \"Gimme the desk!\" \"Flash!\" \"Earl Williams just escaped!\" \"Don't know yet -- call you back.\", etc., are shouted into the phones by Schwartz, Wilson, McCue, Endicott, Bensinger and Murphy. After each man communicates with his paper, he dashes for the door. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThe last of the reporters is gone. \nCLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHer bag, almost unnoticed, falls to the floor. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER as she moves back into the room, absently grabbing and trailing a chair. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHILDY Ahhh -- \nShe lets go of the chair and takes one of the telephones. \nHILDY Morning Post?... Get me Walter Burns -- quick! Hildy Johnson calling. \nVery calmly she sits on the long table, her back against the wall and waits. \nCLOSEUP - HILDY \nHILDY Walter?... Hildy. Earl Williams just escaped from the County Jail. Yep... yep... yep... don't worry! I'm on the job! \nShe hangs up. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nHe hangs up and exits. \nMURPHY (to Hildy) Any dope yet on how he got out? \nHILDY From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him. \nHARTMAN I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy Johnson. \nHe turns and exits. \nCLOSE SHOT AT TABLE NEAR HILDY'S PHONE \ntaking in Hildy and Murphy. \nMURPHY How do you suppose Williams got that gun? \nAs Hildy shrugs, there is another flurry of machine-gun fire. Murphy leaves precipitately. Hildy, alone at last, picks up the phone. \nHILDY (into phone) Give me Walter Burns -- quick -- \nShe lays down the telephone receiver and crosses to the door which she closes, then returns to the phone. \nHILDY (picking up phone) Walter, listen. I've got the inside story on how Williams got the gun and escaped. \nINT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE - DAY CLOSE SHOT - BURNS \nat his desk, telephone to his ear. \nBURNS Exclusive? That's great. \nINT. PRESS ROOM - DAY CLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHILDY It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley. \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS \nBURNS Never mind that. What's the story? \nINT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHILDY Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money! \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS \nBURNS You'll get it. Now what's the story? (he raises his hand) I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave. \nINT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHILDY Wait a minute. Your mother's alive. \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS \nBURNS I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?! \nINT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHILDY Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime -- \nShe starts to giggle at the thought. \nHILDY Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman! \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS \nBURNS (laughing) No kidding, Hildy. (suspiciously) Say, this isn't a rib? \nINT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHILDY No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover. \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS \nBURNS That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes. \nINT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY \nHILDY It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band. \nINT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT BURNS \nBURNS Hold on a minute. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK disclosing Louis and a blonde sitting on a divan in Walter's office. Burns' beckons the blonde: \nBURNS (his hand carefully over receiver of phone) Come here. There's a guy waiting in a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts building. His name is Bruce Baldwin. Can you do your stuff? \nBLONDE I've never flopped on you, have I? \nBURNS Then scram! You've got about two minutes. \nShe exits. \nBURNS (into phone) Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it again? Four hundred and fifty dollars? Hang on a second. \nHe puts his hand over the phone again and beckons to Louis. \nBURNS (to Louis) I need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money. You know where I can get it? \nLOUIS It's awful funny -- I happen to have some on me. \nBURNS (into phone) It's coming right over. I'm sending it over with Louis. Thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon. \nINT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT HILDY AT TELEPHONE \nHILDY Keep the thanks, but just see that the money gets here! \nShe hangs up. The door opens and McCue enters and crosses to his phone. \nMCCUE Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone. \nHILDY I thought so, too. \nHildy takes a look at the clock, rises and begins to pace up and down, pounding her hands together. \nCLOSE SHOT MCCUE AT PHONE \nMCCUE (into phone) McCue speaking. Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, eight-sixty-one and a half South State Street, colored, gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad acting as nurses. Well -- Phoebe was walking along the street when all of a sudden she began -- that's right. So the police coaxed her into the patrol wagon and they started a race with the stork. When the pickaninny was born the Rifle Squad examined him carefully to see if it was Earl Williams who they knew was hiding somewhere. \nMED. SHOT \nHildy is still pacing. McCue laughs at his own joke. \nMCCUE (to Hildy) Did you get that, Hildy? \nHILDY No -- what? \nHildy's phone rings. She answers. \nHARTMAN (pleadingly) I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night. \nMAYOR Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours? (gesturing) Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it? \nHARTMAN (with dignity) If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years. \nThey come to the door of the Sheriff's office. Hartman opens door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following. \nINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT \nHartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him portentously. \nMAYOR Pete, you're through! \nHARTMAN (stunned) What do you mean -- through? \nMAYOR I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make. \nHARTMAN (David to Jonathan) Fred! \nMAYOR Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side. \nHARTMAN Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature. \nMAYOR I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete. \nHARTMAN Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister. \nMAYOR (wavering and desperate) If there was any way out... \nAs a phone rings: \nHARTMAN There is a way out. I've got Williams surrounded, haven't I? What more do you want? (into phone) Hello... Yes... Hello! (wildly) Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing! This is a man-hunt -- not a banquet!... The twelve dollars includes everything!! \nHe hangs up. \nHARTMAN That gives you an idea of what I'm up against! \nMAYOR (hotly) We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'. \nSheriff winces. \nMAYOR Williams ain't a Red, and you know it! \nHARTMAN Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around -- \nMAYOR I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em? \nHARTMAN But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away. \nA knock on the door. \nMAYOR What do you mean he can't get away?! He got away, didn't he? \nKnocking louder. \nMAYOR Who's out there? \nVOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS) Is Sheriff Hartman in there? \nSheriff starts for door. \nHARTMAN (relieved) Ah! For me! \nMED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR \nSheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and ineffectual man named Pinkus is there. \nHARTMAN (as he opens door, disclosing Pinkus) I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me? \nPINKUS (coming in) You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff. \nMAYOR (annoyed) What do you want? \nPINKUS (taking a document from his pocket and proffering it to Sheriff) I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor. \nMAYOR What's from the Governor? \nPINKUS The reprieve for Earl Williams. \nHARTMAN (stunned) For who? \nPINKUS (amiably) Earl Williams. The reprieve. \nMAYOR W-wait a minute. \nGetting his bearings. \nHARTMAN (bursting forth) The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago! \nMAYOR And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you. (to Pinkus) Who else knows about this? \nThe Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read the thing. \nPINKUS They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing. \nMAYOR (to Sheriff) Get the Governor on the phone! \nPINKUS (helpfully) You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now. \nMAYOR Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan! \nHARTMAN (thrusting the document at the Mayor) Read it! Insane, he says. (shaking a finger in Pinkus' face) He knows very well that Williams ain't insane! \nPINKUS Yeah. But I -- \nMAYOR (interrupting) Pure politics! \nHARTMAN An attempt to ruin us! \nThe phone rings. Hartman starts for it. \nMAYOR (reading) Dementia praecox Oh-h-h! \nHARTMAN We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em? \nMAYOR Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you. \nHARTMAN Ah, Fred -- (into phone) Hello... this is Hartman -- \nMAYOR (apoplectic) And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now! \nHARTMAN (from the phone) Sssh. Wait, Fred. (excitedly, into phone) What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses! \nMAYOR What is it? \nHARTMAN They got him! (back to phone) Wait a minute -- hold the wire. (to the Mayor) They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house. \nHILDY (wheeling towards door) Louie! \nShe drops the phone and hurries towards him. \nHILDY Have you got my dough? \nLOUIS Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it? \nHILDY Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks! \nLOUIS All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you? \nHILDY Come on with that money! \nLOUIS First you got to sign a receipt. (he pulls out a receipt) \nHILDY Where's the money? \nLOUIS Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. (he picks out money and counts) One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign. \nHILDY (grabs money and signs) Here! \nLOUIS Thanks. So long, Hildy! \nHILDY (grabbing him) So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet? \nLOUIS Huh? \nHILDY None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life! \nLOUIS Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet? \nHe takes Bruce's wallet out. \nHILDY (grabbing it) You know it is! \nLOUIS I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was. \nHILDY No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you? \nLOUIS (surprised) What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did! \nHe suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door. Hildy chucks something at him. It just misses as he ducks out of the door. \nMED. SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE \nHildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to dial. \nHILDY (into phone) 27th Precinct Station House? \nHildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window. She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again. \nWILLIAMS (pointing gun at her) Drop that phone -- \nHildy drops the phone back on the hook. \nWILLIAMS (supporting himself by holding on to edge of desk) You're not going to phone anybody where I am. \nHILDY (bracing herself) Put down that gun, Earl. \nHe advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her. \nHILDY You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your \"Production for Use\". \nWILLIAMS Yes -- that's right. Production for use. \nHildy starts walking toward him, slowly. \nHILDY Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you? \nWILLIAMS Don't move! \nHildy stops. \nWILLIAMS Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here. \nHILDY Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody. \nWILLIAMS No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone. \nHildy sneaks another step forward. \nHILDY Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview. \nWILLIAMS What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody. \nHILDY I don't blame you, Earl. (another step forward) If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either. \nWILLIAMS (suddenly) Keep away! \nHe points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a faint \"click!\" \nWILLIAMS (weakly) I guess I used all the shells. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT \nHe drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily. \nHILDY Earl, you must never do that again. \nWILLIAMS Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this. \nHILDY (more her old self now) Well, maybe you think I could! \nCAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades. \nEARL'S VOICE I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin' the fella that when he handed me the gun. \nHildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light from the areaway. \nHILDY Don't talk too loud. \nWILLIAMS (babbling on as she moves about) Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you? \nHILDY Sure I do, Earl. \nHildy is looking around for a hiding place for him. \nWILLIAMS I wish they'd take me back and hang me. I done my best. \nHe abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone. \nHILDY (into phone) Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick! \nAnother phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder. \nCLOSEUP HILDY AT PHONE \nMOLLIE Go find out, you heels! You don't think I'm gonna tell! \nCLOSEUP HILDY \nwho has remained riveted at desk. \nHILDY Let her alone! She's goofy! \nMOLLIE AND REPORTERS \nHemmed in by the massed reporters, she makes a sudden lunge for the door. \nREPORTERS Look out! Close that door! etc., etc. \nThey split, some of them heading her off at door, others from opposite side of table, so that she runs back between window and table. \nMCCUE You ain't gettin' out o' here! \nENDICOTT Now, where is he? \nWILSON Where you hidin' him? \nMOLLIE I ain't gonna squeal! I ain't goin' to! \nMURPHY (leaning across table) Come on, you! Before we slap you down. \nENDICOTT Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots? \nMURPHY Where is he, before we beat it out of you? \nMOLLIE (backing) Don't you come near me, you kidney foot! \nMurphy continues to advance on her. The reporters start for her from the other side. Mollie snatches up a chair and swings it at the advancing circle of men. \nMOLLIE (wild and blubbering) Let me alone or I'll knock your heads off! \nENDICOTT Put down that chair! \nSCHWARTZ Get around -- get on the side of her. \nMOLLIE (still backing) No, you don't! (a scream) Keep away! \nWILSON Grab her! \nWith a last, wild look at her encircling foes. \nMOLLIE You'll never get it out of me! (hurls chair at them) I'll never tell! Never! \nShe makes a desperate leap for the open window and disappears out. Her scream of terror is heard as she drops. THEN RUSH FORWARD TO: \nCLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW \nas the reporters rush in and look out, an assortment of awed and astonished exclamations rising from them. \nCLOSE SHOT MRS.

(resumes typing) \nBRUCE I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours. \nHILDY Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. (calling o.s. to Walter) Walter! \nCLOSE SHOT BURNS \nBURNS (into phone) Take the President's speech and run it on the funny page... (turns to Hildy, o.s.)

Why, quite an honor having you come over here. \nBURNS (casually) Hello, Bensinger. \nBENSINGER Excuse me, I just want to -- \nHe starts for the desk. Hildy's typing goes on, coming in over the scene. \nBURNS (starting for the desk, suddenly blocking his path) Quite a coincidence, my running into you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy? \nHILDY'S VOICE Yeh. \nBENSINGER How do you mean? \nCLOSEUP BURNS AND BENSINGER \nBURNS I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy. \nBENSINGER (essaying a pleasantry) Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope. \nBURNS I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning. \nBENSINGER (deeply moved) Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns? \nBURNS (startled) The poem?... The poem was great! \nBENSINGER (blinking at these words) Remember the ending? (and he recites) \" -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears...\" \nBURNS (overcome) Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me? \nBENSINGER What? \nMEDIUM SHOT \ntaking in table, Hildy typing there. \nBURNS (to Bensinger) We need somebody like you. All we've got now are a lot of low-brows. Like Johnson here. \nHe starts shoving Bensinger away from the desk, toward the table. \nBENSINGER Seriously, Mr. Burns? \nClinging to him, Burns takes him to the phone. \nBURNS (into phone) Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. (looking up at Bensinger) Mervyn, isn't it? \nBENSINGER No. Roy. Roy V. \nBURNS (with a little laugh at his own forgetfulness) Of course! (into phone) Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff. (to Bensinger) How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy? \nBENSINGER Seventy-five. \nBURNS I'll give you a hundred and a by- line. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nas Burns continues. \nBURNS (into phone) Let him have everything he wants.

Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay! \nBENSINGER Sort of a Jack London style? \nTRUCKING SHOT \nBURNS Exactly! \nLeads him hurriedly to the door. \nLOUIE What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street. \nBURNS Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station. \nCLOSEUP - LOUIE \nLOUIE I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean? \nHe winks reassuringly. \nBACK TO GROUP \nHILDY (paralyzed) Don't tell me -- was she killed? \nBURNS (hopefully) Was she? Did you notice? \nLOUIE Say, me with a gun on my hip and a kidnapped old lady on my hands, I should stick around asking questions from a lot of cops! You know what I mean? \nHildy sinks into a chair. \nCLOSE SHOT HILDY IN THE CHAIR \nHILDY Dead... dead! That's the end! \nBurns comes into scene to her. \nBURNS It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be. \nHILDY (wildly) What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him? \nBURNS If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. (whacking her on the shoulder) Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here? \nHILDY I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back! \nShe buries her face in her hands. \nBURNS Look at me, Hildy -- \nHILDY (springing up) I'm looking at you -- you murderer! \nBURNS If it was my own mother, I'd carry on!

You can't stop for a dame now! \nHILDY (into phone) Is this the Community Hospital? \nBURNS (howling into phone) I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through? \nHILDY (into phone) Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --? \nBURNS (into phone, drowning out Hildy) Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here! (indicates up to where) Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does?

Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them. (confidentially) We've got to get this desk out of here. \nHe unlocks the door. \nLOUIE You know me. The shirt off my back. \nBURNS You got plenty of money? \nLOUIE Sure, boss. \nBURNS I mean real money -- not counterfeit! \nLOUIE I always have both. \nHe goes out. \nBURNS (calling after him) And don't bump into anything. \nHe relocks the door. \nHILDY Lafayette two-one-hundred. \nBURNS (turning from door) That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it. (bitterly) Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this? \nCLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE, TAKING IN DESK \nBurns steps into scene. \nBURNS (confidentially) If Louie doesn't come back in five minutes we'll get it out alone. There's millions of ways. We can start a fire and get the firemen to carry it out in the confusion. \nHe crosses to the desk and inspects it. \nBURNS What is it? Here! \nShe tosses the gun to Walter, but one of the deputies intercepts the throw. \nHARTMAN Gimme that. \nHe takes the gun from the deputy. \nCLOSER SHOT \nThe Sheriff stands frozen, staring at the gun. \nHARTMAN (to Hildy) Where'd you get this? \nHILDY I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to. \nHARTMAN Not this gun! \nBurns comes into scene. \nBURNS (easily) I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself. \nHARTMAN Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with! \nREPORTERS AD LIB What? What's that? Etc... \nBURNS (advancing on Sheriff) Are you trying to make me out a liar? \nMURPHY (bitterly at Hildy) It's the last time I ever trust a woman, Hildy. \nSCHWARTZ Maybe Williams was gonna be her best man. \nWILSON That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing your own pals. \nHARTMAN (shoving up to Hildy; trembling) Where is Earl Williams? Where you got him? \nBURNS (sympathetically) You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman. \nHARTMAN I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is. \nHILDY He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer. \nHARTMAN (outraged) What? \nHILDY With a bag of marshmallows. \nThe Sheriff stands silent -- then hastily turns. \nMED. SHOT GROUP AROUND HILDY \nREPORTERS AD LIB Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought we were friends... Etc. (to Sheriff) Look here, Pete! What about Mister Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's he doing over here? \nHARTMAN (grabbing Burns' arm) Speak up! What do you know about this. \nBURNS (gently but firmly disengaging his hand) My dear Hartman! \nHe moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains it. \nMURPHY Can that! Where is he? \nBURNS (to Sheriff) The Morning Post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals. You ought to know that. \nHARTMAN No? Well -- (turning to Hildy) Johnson, you're under arrest. (turning to Burns) You, too, Burns. \nBURNS (calmly) Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing? \nHARTMAN I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this. \nBURNS You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff. \nHARTMAN We'll just start by impounding the Post property. (pointing to Bensinger's desk, addressing Hildy) Is that your desk? \nHILDY (jumping) No! \nBURNS (almost simultaneously) Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here. \nHARTMAN Oh, you do, eh? (to deputies) All right, boys. Confiscate that desk. \nSeveral of the deputies start toward the desk. \nBURNS (trying to intercept deputies) Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars. \nHARTMAN You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. (to deputies) All right, boys. Take it. \nBURNS I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. (to deputy nearest him) And you'll be an accessory! \nHARTMAN We'll take a chance on that, Burns. (to deputies) Go ahead, boys. (the deputies continue toward the desk) \nINT.

If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you. \nBURNS You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it. \nHILDY Done what? \nBURNS Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted. \nHILDY Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for. \nBURNS Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change. \nHILDY I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker. \nBURNS Now, that's a nice thing to say. \nHILDY Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works? \nBURNS Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHILDY A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: (she gestures above to indicate sky- writing) 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it. \nBURNS Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up. \nHILDY What home? \nWALTER What home? Don't you remember the home I promised you? \nHILDY Oh, yes -- we were to have it right after our honeymoon -- honeymoon! \nBURNS Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did. \nHILDY All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you? \nBURNS Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story. \nHILDY Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm -- \nBURNS Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again. \nHILDY What?!! \nBURNS I haven't any hard feelings. \nHILDY Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for? \nBURNS (rising, reaching for his hat) Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything. \nHILDY (also rising) I have a lunch date. I just want -- \nBURNS You can break it, can't you? \nHILDY No, I can't. \nBURNS Sure you can. Come on. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE \nHILDY Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss. \nBURNS What do you mean by that? \nHILDY Just what I said. That's what I -- \nBURNS You mean you're not coming back to work here? \nHILDY That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I -- \nBURNS (still interrupting) You've had a better offer, eh? \nHILDY You bet I've got a better offer. \nBURNS Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for -- \nHILDY I know, Walter, but I -- \nBURNS (ignoring her) What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg -- \nHILDY You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced! \nBURNS Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering. \nHILDY Listen, Walter -- \nBURNS (going right on) I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us. \nHILDY Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter. \nWIDER ANGLE \nBURNS It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything. \nHILDY (indignantly) I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you! \nBURNS Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you! \nHILDY (speechless) You -- you -- \nShe grabs something and chucks it at him. He ducks. The phone rings. \nBURNS (to Hildy) You're losing your eye. You used to be able to pitch better than that. (he reaches for phone) Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well, what can I do for you? \nCLOSE SHOT DUFFY \nseated at his desk, talking into phone. \nDUFFY What's the matter with you? Are you drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney! \nCLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY \nBurns into phone: \nBURNS Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. (he hangs up) How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day. \nHILDY What's the matter? \nBURNS Sweeney. \nHILDY Dead? \nBURNS Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby! \nCLOSE SHOT HILDY \n", "test1_true": "CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY \nBURNS I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country? \nHILDY (practically) Well, haven't you got anybody else? \nBURNS There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless -- (he stares at Hildy; then a light breaks) Hildy! \nHILDY No! \nBURNS You've got to help me, Hildy. \nHILDY Keep away -- \nBURNS It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be. \nHILDY That's what I'm afraid of. \"Any time -- any place -- anywhere!\" \nBURNS Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper. \nHILDY Get away, Svengali. \nBURNS If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week. \nHILDY Listen, you bumble-headed baboon -- \nBURNS All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more! \nHILDY Please! Will you just -- \nBURNS Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you? \nHILDY I'm not working for any other paper! \nBURNS Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack -- \nHILDY Look at this! (pulling her glove off her left hand) \nCLOSEUP HILDY \nShe gets glove off left hand and holds up an engagement ring for him to see. \nHILDY Do you see this? Do you know what an engagement ring is? \nCLOSEUP BURNS \nHe looks at ring, swallows, then: \nMED. SHOT \nBurns and Hildy. \nHILDY I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through. \nBURNS (himself again) Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business. \nHILDY You can't sell me that, Walter. \nBURNS Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man. \nHILDY That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman. \nBURNS I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you. \nCLOSER SHOT \nHILDY (bitterly) A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through. \nBURNS Where'd you meet this man? \nHILDY Bermuda. \nBURNS Bermuda... Rich, eh? \nHILDY Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year. \nBURNS What's his line? \nHILDY He's in the insurance business. \nBURNS (looks up) The insurance business? \nHILDY (on the defensive) It's a good, honest business, isn't it? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBURNS Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies. \nHILDY Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman. \nBURNS He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo? \nHILDY I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children. \nBURNS Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name? \nHILDY Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin. \nBURNS Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that? \nHILDY The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you. (she extends her hand) So long, Walter, and better luck next time. \nBURNS (taking her hand) I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy. \nHILDY Thanks... \nBURNS Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries. \nHILDY (laughing) Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now. \nBURNS Say, could I meet him? \nHILDY Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good. \nBURNS You're not afraid, are you? \nHILDY Afraid? I should say not! \nBURNS All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.

We got calls to make, you know. \nHILDY Run down and get some smelling salts, will you? \nWILSON Smelling salts! What's going on here? \nThey catch sight of Mollie, stretched out on the floor. \nENDICOTT Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her? \nHILDY (as Endicott and Wilson enter room) Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to. \nINT. PRESS ROOM MED.

The whole police force standing on it's ear. \nMurphy crosses to his phone. McCue comes in. \nMCCUE (panting) What a chase! \nENDICOTT (into phone) No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back. \nHe hangs up. \nWILSON (into phone) Okay, later. \nHe hangs up. \nMURPHY (into phone) Murphy talking. \nSchwartz comes in. \nHILDY Any news? \nSCHWARTZ Yeah. I was never so tired in my life. \nHe picks up his phone. \nMCCUE (into phone) Where? Harrison Street Station? All right, connect me. \nSCHWARTZ (into phone) Schwartz calling...

SHOT GROUP \nMURPHY Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life. \nMCCUE (turning from phone) Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it? \nENDICOTT Aw, nuts with chasing around any more. I spent a dollar-forty on taxis already. \nSCHWARTZ I say we don't go out any more.

Are you trying to scoop us or something? \nENDICOTT Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. (turning on Mollie) Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie? \nMOLLIE I didn't do nothin'. \nMCCUE (crossing to Mollie) Come clean, Mollie. \nWilson, Endicott and Murphy follow McCue toward Hildy. \nENDICOTT Better let us in on it, Mollie. \nHILDY Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill! \nMURPHY Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story. \nENDICOTT I tell you, it's a screwy set-up.

The things we've been through, Hildy. \nHILDY We've certainly been in some swell jams. \nBURNS Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary? \nHILDY Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews! \nBURNS Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we? \nHILDY (laughing) We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week. \nBURNS In the Shoreland Hotel.

But -- I guess I can't, Walter. \nBURNS Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning. \nHILDY Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter -- \nBURNS He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy.

LARRY Yeah, that's great. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
They both start searching the room frenetically. While Larry looks on the desk, Carol searches the rest of the room, even kneeling on the floor. 
CAROL (WHISPERING) Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here somewhere. The first... Wait. I should... (to Paul, with a much louder voice) Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need... 
Larry drops things on the floor. With a nervous gesture, Carol shushes him. 
CAROL You need any help ? 
The camera pans to the kitchen, where Paul is preparing the dessert. 
PAUL No, I'm fine. I'll be right in. CAROL (voice over) Um... Okay, great. 
The camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still nervously messing things on the desk. Then he starts moving around the room, looking for his wife's glasses. Carol puts things back in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we can't understand. 
LARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice) Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ? 
PAUL (voice over from the kitchen) Coffee or tea ? 
CAROL Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea. 
Paul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand. 
PAUL You know, I found your glasses. 
CAROL Mine ? 
PAUL These are yours, aren't they ? 
CAROL Yes. 
LARRY No. 
CAROL Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh, God. 
Carol and Larry both look very nervous. Carol takes the glasses from Paul's hand. 
LARRY No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually. They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are. 
CAROL They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine. I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I must have left them here. It's the strangest thing. 
PAUL Did you ? I didn't notice that. 
CAROL No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ? 
Carol and Larry both look very embarrassed. Paul looks at them with a slight surprised eye. 
LARRY At your mother's house. 
CAROL That's right. Of course, so... 
She turns toward Paul, who has remained very calm. 
PAUL That mousse looks fabulous. 
CAROL Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse. 
PAUL Thank you very much. 
CAROL Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean ? PAUL Very much. Very much. 
CAROL Uh uh. 
PAUL That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed. 
CAROL That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under. 
LARRY Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop... 
CAROL They were just... 
LARRY She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house. 
CAROL They f... 
PAUL The mousse ? 
He walks away to the kitchen, with a strange smile on his face. 
LARRY She's always-She's always kick... 
Carol looks at Larry with a meaning look, to make him stop rambling. CAROL Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse. 
LARRY Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It was... 
Carol walks away toward the kitchen. 
CAROL I remember. 
LARRY It took-took six months to get the... 
NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Medium full shot of Carol waiting under the awning of a place (hotel or club) called the «Five Hundred». She hears a car stopping and she looks at the street. TED (voice over) Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder. 
Carol runs to the car. 
CAROL I know, but where... where are we going ? 
TED (voice over from inside the car) I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book. 
Carol climbs into the car and closes the door. 
CAROL (voice over from inside the car) Yeah. 
TED (voice over from inside the car) It was just H. Moss. 
CAROL (voice over from inside the car) Right. 
TED (voice over from inside the car) So I-it's on Bank Street... 
The car drives away, with Ted's voice fading as the car gets away from us. 
TED (voice over from inside the car) Bank Street... we're going to go down and do surveillance. I got a lot whole of food. It's great. I called up this... I called this number. 
NEW-YORK - BANK STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Full view of the corner of two very quiet streets. A brick building covered with vines. The camera pans away from the building to Ted's car parked on the other side of the street corner. Medium shot of the inside of the car, through the open window on the passenger's side, Carol's side. 
TED There's her house. 
CAROL Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ? 
TED Yeah. 
CAROL Okay. 
They look at each other and laugh. 
Slightly later. Medium shot through the windshield. The view is a little blurred by the daylight reflection on the windshield. 
TED Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her, she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she, maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of that ? 
CAROL Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline. 
Ted looks through the paper food-bag he has brought with him. 
TED Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something. 
CAROL Yeah? What's that, there ?

{"test1_input": "No good. Wes is too scared to move.  Epps reaches back and literally pulls him up and over into the front. \nEPPS(CONT) Take it! \nWith little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over. Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher.  He loads it up, and readies the weapon.  Crawling to the back he takes aim. \nEPPS(CONT) Keep it steady. \nWes does his best to give a level ride, but the Iraqi bullets coming at them don't help much. \nEpps zeroes in on the target.  He takes aim and starts to squeeze back on the trigger.  He almost has a shot off when Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently.  Epps loses the target. \nEPPS(CONT) Damn it!  I said keep it steady. \nEpps tries to take aim again.  Careful aim.  One shot is all he gets.  The bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry. Waiting...waiting...  The Iraqis are only getting closer. \nWES Shoot...shoot! \nWaiting... \nCloser... \nWES SHOOT! \nEPPS FIRES!  The grenade rips from the launcher, riding a trail of white smoke, and slams into the Iraqis.  You know the story:  Huge explosion, car parts flying a hundred feet into the air, bodies whipping through space, stuff Bob Dole would hate.  But maybe he would like it.  They were just Iraqis. \nWes brings the Hummer to a halt.  A spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him.  Jaeger, checking himself for wounds, and Epps, M-16 still in hand, get out.  Epps makes his way to the wreckage, sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any survivors.  Yeah, like somebody's walking away from that bang. \nWes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was. \nWES I thought we were dead. \nJAEGER Yeah, well, we're not. \nWES We got to get out of here. \nNobody says anything.  This really scares Wes. \nWES(CONT) We have to go back. \nJAEGER We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for. \nWES (Incredulous) We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on? \nEPPS Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for damage. \nJaeger starts to cross back to the Hummer.  Wes gives him something to take with him. \nWES You're crazy, you know that?  You're insane! \nJaeger goes leaving Epps and Wes all by their lonesome.  Wes turns to Epps. \nWES(CONT) You know that, right?  You know he's sick? \nWith a flip of his head Epps indicates the dead Iraqis. \nEPPS They shouldn't have been here. \nWES We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on! \nEPPS This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters. \nWES Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged. \nEPPS They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying. \nWes starts to get it.  It really doesn't matter what he has to say. \nWES We're not going back, are we? \nEpps has got nothing to say to the truth.  He turns and starts to walk to the Hummer. \nWES(CONT) You bastard!  You're trying to get us killed. \nLike a whip Epps snaps around.  He grabs up Wes and pulls him close. \nEPPS I'm trying to get us paid.  I'm trying to get us all paid!  As long as there's a chance something is out there we go on. There's not going to be anymore trouble. If there is, we go back, but there won't be. \nAlmost as an afterthought Epps realizes he's got Wes, and lets him go.  Gently he puts it: \nEPPS(CONT) You'll feel different after we find the treasure.  Money has away of making people feel different. \nNobody's got anytbing to say to that, so they say nothing. Epps heads back to the Hummer.  A beat later Wes follows. \nJaeger is already behind the wheel.  Epps rides shotgun this time.  Once again Wes is in back.  To Jaeger, Epps ask: \n", "test1_true": "JAEGER Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine. \nEPPS Let's go. \nJaeger fires it up, and pulls out.  As they head off we: \nFADE TO: \nBLACK \nFADE TO: \nI/E. HUMVEE - LATER \nThe sun beats down violently as the Hummer rolls along. Epps, Jaeger and Wes all ride along in an angry silence. Jaeger starts to smile.  He chuckles to himself.  Epps, looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit himself. \nEPPS What? \nJAEGER I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with. \nEPPS You can't tell anybody about this. \nJAEGER I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires! \nEpps joins in cackling like a Hyena. \nEPPS It'd make their heads explode. \nJAEGER Millionaires, man. \nHe turns back to Wes. \nJAEGER(CONT} You know we're going to be rich.  Admit it.  You know.  Come on, admit it. \nIn spite of himself Wes gives a little smile. \nJAEGER(CONT) Ahh, there it is.  There it is.  You know it. \nSinging to Levert: \nEPPS Money, money, money, money...MONEY. \nJaeger joins in. \nEPPS/JAEGER Money, money, money, money...MONEY. \nEpps starts to slow down. \nWES What are you doing. \nEPPS Low on gas.  Got to refill. \nA nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.  Epps stops.  He and Wes jump out of the Hummer and go around back to the reserve tanks. \nJaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense.  After a beat Epps screams for him. \nEPPS(O.C.) Jaeger...JAEGER! \nTime to face the music.  Jaeger hauls himself out of the Hummer and goes around to Epps who's got a look on his face like he's just had a spoonful of steaming shit.  He points angrily at one of the reserve tanks. \nEPPS Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage. \nJAEGER ...I know. \nEPPS And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this? \nJAEGER I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back. \nWES So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere? \nJAEGER ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back. \nWes gets a slow boil on. \nWES ...You stupid son of a bitch. \nWes lunges for Jaeger, but doesn't have the speed or the skills.  Jaeger counters, and sinks a fist into Wes' jaw. Wes goes down, but he manages to take Jaeger to the sand with him.  They start to scrape, but it's obvious Jaeger has got the upper hand. \nEpps reaches down and yanks Jaeger off of Wes. \nEPPS Get off him. \nJaeger comes up to his feet.  Wes wipes some blood from his lips.  He looks down at his bloodied hand, then sneers at Jaeger. \nEPPS(CONT) You two fighting's not going to get us anything. \n", "test1_id": 2958, "test2_input": "Real casual Epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the pin loose.  He stands with the grenade in one hand and the navicom in the other.  Real calm, like he was talking about the weather: \nEPPS Something happens to me I let go of this grenade.  I go, and I take the navicom with me.  And how do you suppose you're going to find your way back to the Hummer, when you won't even know what's up or down.  It's a big country, and you could be heading for the allies, or wandering right into Bhagdad.  That's if you don't die of thirst before you even get that far.  How you like my stick now? \nEpps and Wes have a stare down.  Jaeger, who's getting really good at freaking out, jumps in. \nJAEGER Why don't you put the gun down, all right, Wes?  You put the gun down and Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade. Won't you Epps? \nThe stare down goes on a beat longer.  Finally Wes lowers his rifle.  He turns to Jaeger and vents what anger he can. \nWES I'm starting to think you're a real bitch, you know that? \nFADE TO: \nEXT. DESERT - LATER \nTHE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness.  SMOKE BEGINS TO DRIFT INTO FRAME.  THE CAMERA FINALLY LANDS ON THE SHI'ITE ENCAMPMENT, or at least what's left of it.  Tents are torn down and burned, goods scattered.  It looks like a ghost town.  Epps, Wes and Jaeger wander into it.  They look around, but see no signs of life. \nWes grabs up some Shi'ite garments, white robes, and starts to put them on. \nJAEGER You're going to burn up in those. \nWES The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them. \nJaeger looks to Epps who just shrugs.  Jaeger gets some robes and puts them on.  Epps follows suit. \nJAEGER Think the Iraqi's killed them all? \nWES Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers. \nEPPS (Pointed) Murder, or a combat action?  It's hard to tell them apart? \nThey keep on moving, passing straight through the camp.  Epps marches ahead, not wanting to even deal with the other two men.  Wes talks after him.  Really he talks more to himself, and he's not sounding too lucid. \nWES You saw how he ran didn't you?  First chance he got he ran out.  Would have gone straight to his CO, told him all about the gold.  What do you think would have happened then, huh?  Then what do you think would have happened?  Two thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on us.  You ought to thank me for killing him.  I'll get a medal for it.  Watch and see if I don't get a medal. \nEpps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. Almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his tracks.  He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious thing.  SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET, ALMOST AS IF IT'S GOING DOWN A DRAIN.  He looks at it with the same wonderment that a dog watches television. \nEPPS What the hell...? \nEpps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet. He's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in loose sand.  Immediately he sinks to waist level.  He slows there, but still goes down with rapidity.  He screams to Jaeger and Wes. \nEPPS(CONT) Help!  Help me! \nJaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole.  Wes doesn't move. \nEPPS(CONT) Help me! \nJaeger is paralyzed by indecision.  He doesn't want to let Epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get sucked into.  He flirts back and forth between rescue and safety. \nSand continues to pour in on Epps. \nEPPS(CONT) For Christ's Sake, Jaeger!  Help me! Help me! \nJaeger can't fight himself any longer.  He lowers himself halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for Epps. \nTheir arms twist and strain for each others.  First their fingers meet, then they grab hands.  They work a grip down to their wrist, but that's all they can get.  Jaeger strains like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand.  It may not be enough as he begins to slip down himself.  Jaeger twists his head and looks up at Wes.  Straining to say anything he pleads: \nJAEGER Wes...Wes! \nHis words fall on deaf ears.  Wes just takes a step closer to the pack of gold coins. \nThis only serves to energize Jaeger.  He digs deeper within himself finding an untapped reserve of strength.  He grunts and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. \nEpps finds same purchase.  He pulls, swims, his way up from the sand.  A little at first, but like hitting shallow water he's able to lift himself up. \nJager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground.  They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. \nAs Epps regains strength he pats himself down.  Suddenly he goes back into a panic. \nEPPS The navicom! \nEpps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft sand frantically looking for the lost computer.  Jaeger joins in.  They dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to venture only so far into the soft sand.  It doesn't matter. The navicom is lost. \nJAEGER What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!? \nEPPS We'll find our way. \nJAEGER How!? \nEPPS We'll find our way!  We'll... \nEpps wants to say how, but he's got no idea.  Wes grows a smug smile. \nWES No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps. \n", "test2_true": "WES Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge. \nEPPS And let me guess who is. \nWes casually slides out his M-16. \nWES I'm the one's got the big stick. \nEPPS Suppose I don't go for that? \nWES Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. (Beat) I suppose. \nEPPS What about Jaeger? \nWES Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you. \nJAEGER Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps. \nWes turns and glares at Jaeger, who backs down. \nJAEGER(CONT} I mean, in principle. \nWES {Sneering) You know, Jaeger, you really are a bitch. \nEpps isn't wasting anymore time.  When Wes turns to glower at Jaeger he lunges up for him.  Wes side steps Epps and lands the but of his rifle into the side of Epps' head.  It opens a wound, and sends Epps back down to the ground. \nEpps looks up right into the muzzle of West M-16.  Full of poison: \nWES(CONT) You die! \nWes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot rings out.  Wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the back with a truck.  The way cut timber falls he slams to the ground motionless. \nEpps and Jaeger stare at the body for a beat, then snap their heads in the direction of the shot. \nUp on a dune behind them are a group of SHI'ITES on horseback.  One of them has a high powered rifle which he has just used to drill Wes.  He fires another shot.  It pings to the ground between Epps and Jaeger. \nOur two remaining men scramble.  Jaeger dives for the gold and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it. The two take off running as best they can in the sand.  They run wildly, erratically, without looking back.  They run until their bodies scream no more, then keep going on inertia.  Reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and collapse in a heap at the bottom.  They take a moment to catch what breath they can, then: \nEPPS We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes. \nJAEGER Forget Wes. \nEPPS We can't just leave him. \nJAEGER Wes is dead! \nEPPS What if he's not? \nJAEGER Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass. \nThey sit there trying to catch their breath.  As they do a sound comes from the distance.  They freeze, ears cocked, trying to figure out what it is. \nJAEGER(CONT) It's a helicopter. \nQuickly, desperately, as the sound of the chopter draws closer, they scan the horizon looking for it.  Jaeger spots it and thrusts a finger in its direction. \nJAGER(CONT) There. \nEpps scrambles out his binoculars.  He targets the helicopter.  Jaeger waits in high anticipation. \nJAEGER(CONT) Ours, or theirs? \nEpps can't make out for sure.  Jaeger asks again with growing anxiety. \nJAEGER(CONT) Ours, or theirs? \nEpps takes a long, hard stare. \nEPPS Ours.  It's one of ours.  We've got to signal them; let them know we're down here. \nThe instant Jaeger hears this his face twists up like he's thinking something, and he doesn't like what it is he's thinking.  Quietly, almost to himself: \nJAEGER No. \nEPPS We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror. \nAgain Jaeger says it, this time including Epps too. \nJAEGER No. \nEPPS What do you mean no?  They can fly us home. \nJAEGER(CONT) They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here. \nEPPS We'll lie. \n", "test2_id": 2959, "test3_input": "JAEGER They coming? \nEpps takes a look behind him.  He can't hardly miss the sandstorm Wes and the Shi'ites kick up as they ride for them. \nEPPS Oh, yeah.  They're coming. \nEpps points off to some foothills in the distance.  It's the only thing close to cover for miles around. \nEPPS(CONT) Ride for the hills.  We'll try to lose them. \nThey take the reigns to their horses and get to riding. \nBehind them Wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to split up, and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger. \nEpps and Jaeger hit the hills.  They ride up for a bit, then stop to spot Wes.  Wes and his crew are better riders and have closed the gap.  All the two can do now is try to lose them in the terrain. \nEpps and Jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat erratically to cover their trail.  They head up a ways, then cut across in a parallel direction.  Jaeger looks back, but sees no sign of Wes. \nJAEGER We lost them! \nJust as the words leave Jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets explodes the ground before them.  Their horses rear up, and it's all they can do to fight them.  Just ahead are the Shi'ites who split off from Wes, having circled around Epps and Jaeger. \nThe two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite direction with the Shi'ites just behind.  They fire on Epps and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. \nEpps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs.  And good for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now.  They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers. \nAs Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below them, and Wes and his posse riding for them.  Our two start back the way they came. but the other Shi'ites crest the hill. \nJAEGER(CONT) Which way? \nEpps looks from side to side.  Either way is certain death. Then he looks off towards an embankment.  It is VERY steep. VERY treacherous. \nIt would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment safely.  All Epps knows is there aren't any gun totting Shi'ites in that direction. \nJAEGER(CONT) Which way do we go!? \nEPPS We go this way. \nFear gives way to desperation.  Both men whip their steeds hard.  The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild ride down.  Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to stay on their horses. \nWes sees this and swears.  He signals to his men to cut back the other way. \nEpps reaches the bottom of the embankment.  Jaeger is almost there when he looses control of his horse.  Both rider and animal go tumbling in an ugly fall. \nEPPS(CONT) Jaeger! \nThe horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her. \nJust then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and start riding hard for Jaeger. \nEpps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen comrade.  As he rides in he leans to the side and low. Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and swings him up behind him.  A couple of rodeo performers couldn't have done it better. \nProblem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast. Wes and his men close hard now.  The bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys. \nEpps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster, faster... \nSuddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride. They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get this beast to fly. \nFinally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter.  Wes and the Shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off.  Wes stands down from his horse. \nEpps and Jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same. \nWES The gold; give it to me. \nEpps takes the pack from Jaeger, but doesn't throw it to Wes. \nWES(CONT) Give it to me! \nEPPS If I give it to you, will you let us go? \nWes smiles and lies so badly he doesn't even bother trying to fake it. \nWES Sure.  Whatever you want.  For old time sake. \nEpps has got no choice, really.  He tosses the pack to Wes' feet who stoops to pick it up.  Wes starts to open the pack. \nWES(CONT) Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. \nEPPS It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? \nWes rips open the pack.  He's got about one second to see what's inside.  NO GOLD.  JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE. \nEpps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. \nThere is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily destroys Wes and a few of the Shi'ite standing next to him. The rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life. \n", "test3_true": "EPPS(CONT) Damn it.  We lost the horses. \nJAEGER The...the gold... \nEPPS It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack. \nJAEGER When did you make the switch? \nEPPS It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own. \nJAEGER But... \nEPPS We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about. \nJAEGER What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had... \nEPPS You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy. \nWe hold on the two men, on the smoking remains of Wes.  We hold on them, then: \nFADE TO: \nBLACK \nFADE TO: \nEXT. DESERT/ROAD - LATER \nEpps and Jaeger come up to the road, a small highway.  It's eerie; a road in the middle of the desert.  Quiet.  No cars. They just stand and stare at it for a beat. \nJAEGER Well? \nEPPS A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it. \nJAEGER How do we do that? \nEPPS You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head. \nJAEGER Why do I have to lie in the road? \nEPPS Somebody has to. \nJAEGER Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop? \nEPPS Then I'm a rich man. \nEpps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car.  The only thing he gets is more quiet.  Jaeger sits next to him. After a couple of beats: \nJAEGER Epps. \nEPPS Yeah. \nJAEGER I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy. \nEPPS Thanks. \nJAEGER This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know... \nEPPS Threatened to blow my brains out? \nJAEGER Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple. \nEPPS Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier. \nThey sit a while more.  Still no car. \nJAEGER Epps? \nEPPS What? \nJAEGER I'm thinking about taking a trip. \nEPPS Thought you were going to buy a car. \nJAEGER Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go? \nEPPS I don't know. \nJAEGER I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go? \nEPPS How the hell should I know? \nAnother long beat.  Still no car. \nEPPS(CONT) Australia. \n", "test3_id": 2960}

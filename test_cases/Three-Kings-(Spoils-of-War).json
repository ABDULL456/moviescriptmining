{"train": "\"Three Kings (Spoils of War)\", unproduced draft, by John Ridley \nSPOILS OF WAR \nby \nJohn Ridley \nWRITER'S FIRST DRAFT JULY 26th, 1995 \nOVER BLACK WE SEE OPENING CREDITS \nFADE TO: \nVIDEO IMAGE \nPresident Bush in the Oval Office delivering an address to the American people. \nPRESIDENT BUSH ...This act of naked aggression must be checked.  The United States, along with coalition forces from the Middle East, have drawn a line in the sand.  There is only one way for this situation to be satisfactorily resolved.  The belligerent forces from the Republic of Iraq must be removed from Kuwait, be it by choice, or by force... \nFADE TO: \nBLACK \nFADE TO: \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nFrom a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like noises. \nJAEGER (V.O.) At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCU - HUMVEE \nThere are three soldiers at the Humvee.  Second Lieutenant JOHN EPPS,                   who sweeps the horizon with a pair of binoculars.  PFC WES HAMMOND, who is behind the wheel looking very bored, and PFC MARK JAEGER, who is at the Humvee's thirty caliber machine gun, making the noises and shooting at phantom troops.  When Jaeger talks it's with all the swagger of a B-movie hero. \nJAEGER At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at. \nEPPS What are you doing? \nJAEGER What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at-- \nWES Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache. \nJAEGER A headache? \nWES Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable. \nJAEGER I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull. \nWES Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes. \nJAEGER Okay. \nJaeger goes right back to playing soldier. \nJAEGER(CONT) At-at-at-at-at. \nEPPS Knock it off! \nJAEGER Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. \nEPPS Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? \nJAEGER I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. \nEPPS No you're not. \nEpps points in the opposite direction that Jaeger was 'firing.' \nEPPS(CONT) The Iraqis are that way.  Those are our troops you're shooting at. \nWith his binoculars Epps looks in the direction Jaeger was shooting. \nEPPS(CONT) You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting. \nJAEGER Blow me. \nEPPS Another month in this desert and I might just. \nWES Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war? \nEPPS Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait. \nEPPS Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is. \nJAEGER Ask him what it is. \nWes says something to the vendor in Arabic.  The Vendor answers back. \nWES He says it's a box. \nJAEGER Yeah, you're funny. \nWES It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside. \nJAEGER (Excited) For real?  A treasure? \nEPPS Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that. \nJAEGER There might be something in there. \nEPPS Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge. \nJAEGER There might be. \nWES And you're the guy who's going to open it. \nJAEGER I could. \nEPPS You could turn on a light if someone put your hand on the switch. \nDecisively, without even haggling about price, Jaeger whips out some money and pays the vendor for the box. \nEPPS(CONT) Well, that showed me.  Now, can we eat? \nThe three men walk on, Jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARRACKS - NIGHT \nIt's filled with young soldiers messing around, playing cards, listening to music, whatever.  Jaeger lays on a bunk holding the puzzle box, probing it with his fingers, trying to find a way to make it open. \nWes crosses over. \nWES You get it yet? \nJAEGER Naw, nothing. \nWES You will.  You'll get it. \nJAEGER I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open. \nWES You really think there's a treasure inside? \nJAEGER I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. \nWes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat. \nWES Jaeger? \nJAEGER What? \nWES You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait. \nJAEGER Yeah.  So? \nWES That's in two days. \nJAEGER Like I said; so? \nWES They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting-- \nJAEGER What's your point, Wes?  You have a point? \nWES We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war. \nJAEGER It doesn't mean anything. \nWES Why would they do all that if we weren't? \nJaeger, frustrated, finally looks up from his box. \nJAEGER Okay, so we're going to war.  We're supposed to go to war.  We're soldiers, that's what we do.  The guns, the tanks, the planes; you're just now getting the hint we're in the war business? \nJaeger goes back to his box.  Wes stands over him for a beat longer, then: \nWES Jaeger? \nEPPS Go on, man. \nJaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the tube.  He sticks his finger back into the container and draws out a rolled up piece of paper. \nWES Paper. \nEPPS It's a fortune box. \nJaeger unrolls it. \nWES What's it say? \nEPPS Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory. \nWe see the paper.  Lines are drawn on it, large, crude figures.  It's hard to make out exactly what it all is supposed to represent. \nJAEGER It's a drawing, or something.  Some kind of art. \nEpps takes the paper from Jaeger and gives it a once over. \nEPPS Looks like something a kid would do. \nWes takes the paper and looks it over. \nWES It's a map, I think that's what it is. \nEPPS There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire. \nJaeger takes back the paper.  All excited like a kid on Christmas: \nJAEGER You think? \nEPPS Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect. \nEpps and Wes load up and get ready to move out.  Jaeger just keeps staring at the map, eyes lit like candles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTELLIGENCE ROOM - LATER \nThe room is filled with maps, recon photos, HUMINT reports. They're posted on the walls with various levels of troop strength - allied and Iraqi - indicated.  More data is constantly flowing in, analyzed and processed. \nJaeger enters, spots WOODS - a young soldier on intel detail - and crosses over to him. \nJAEGER Woods. \nWOODS Hey, Jaeger.  What's up. \nJAEGER I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi. \nWOODS A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal? \nJAGER I don't know.  A map map. \nWOODS A map map. \nWoods pulls out a map and hands it to Jaeger. \nWOODS(CONT) That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing. \nJAEGER I could use some recon photos too. \nWoods gives Jaeger a sideways glance. \nWOODS Planning on going to war all by your lonesome? \nJAEGER Just...want to be ready when we do. \nWOODS Ready for what?  Sight-seeing? \nJAEGER The photos. \nWoods starts to dig for photos. \nJAEGER(CONT) Some good ones. \nWOODS They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass. \nJAEGER Saddam's got a boil on his ass? \nWoods looks up at Jaeger with an expression that says: \"What?\" \nJAEGER(CONT) I don't know. \nWoods goes back to looking, pulls some photos and hands them to Jaeger. \nEPPS What are you talking about? \nJaeger pulls out the drawing from the puzzle box. \nEPPS(CONT) Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map. \nJAEGER Wait.  Wait. \nJaeger starts to tear at his pockets like he's trying to get at a bee.  He pulls out his other maps, recon photos...  The guy's a walking atlas. \nEpps looks on in shock at the spectacle. \nEPPS I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you. \nJAEGER Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it. \nEPPS (Sarcastic) Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? \nJAEGER Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff. \nWES The Turks invaded, yeah. I guess people would have hidden what they had.  But that doesn't mean what was in that box is-- \nJager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps. \nJAEGER Looks at this!  Look at it!  The drawing is a map of this area right here.  You can see it.  The geography, the landmarks.  It's the same area. \nEpps grabs the map from Jaeger. \nEPPS And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it. \nJAEGER What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers. \nWES You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it. \nJAEGER It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting-- \nWES You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know-- \nJAEGER It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to-- \nWES It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real. \nJAEGER It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real. \nWES So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps. \nEpps thinks.  He doesn't say nuthin', just thinks.  It's the thinking that makes Wes nervous. \nWES(CONT) Epps, tell him. \nEpps gets a little more thinking in.  Wes sees which way this is going. \nWES You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking? \nEPPS I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say. \nWes can't believe what he's hearing.  He pulls out the last card he has to play. \nWES It's desertion. \nJaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness. \nJAEGER Deserting what?  What the hell are we deserting? \nBoth Jaeger and Epps close on Wes for the hard sell. \nEPPS It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off-- \nJAEGER We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing. \nEPPS But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing. \nWES Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter. \nJAEGER You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it. \nWES You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive. \nEPPS If you say that, then I say you don't know Second Lieutenant Epps very well, do you? \nWes buries his head in his hands.  He squeezes at it hard like he'd rather make his brains ooze out his ears than say what he's going to say. \nWES God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't. \nJAEGER Yes! \nCUT TO: \nI/E. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS \nThe occupants jostle as the Hummer touches down.  Epps and Jaeger laugh and high five.  Wes is content just to go on looking sick. \nJAEGER Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried? \nWES If!  If there's a treasure. \nJAEGER Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is? \nWES I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold. \nJAEGER Yeah!  Gold!  How much? \nWES How the hell should I know how much? \nEPPS But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way. \nJAEGER You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold? \nWES If there's gold.  If! \nJAEGER You know what I'm doing with my half? \nEpps turns to Jaeger.  There's just the slightest, slightest hint of edge brushed across his tone. \nEPPS Third.  What you're going to do with your third. \nJAEGER Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet. \nEPPS A car?  You're going to buy a car? \nWES This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it. \nJAEGER A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang-- \nEPPS You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels? \nJAEGER What are you going to do with your third? \nEPPS Invest it. \nJAEGER Oh, that's fun. \nEPPS It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about. \nJAEGER And I'm talking about enjoying myself. \nEPPS You know, you sound just like a boy who's never-- \nWES What's that? \nJaeger and Epps look out the front windshield.  A plume of sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before them.  So engrossed in their discussion previously they hadn't even noticed until Wes pointed it out. \nEpps reaches over and kills the tape player.  A loud quiet comes with it.  All three men just stare at the plume as it drifts closer.  Finally: \nEPPS Take the binoculars. \nJAEGER Wh-what do you think-- \nEPPS TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS! \nJaeger scrambles up the binoculars, and stares off into the distance.  Epps and Wes wait...they wait... \nJAEGER Iraqis. \nWES Oh, God! \nJAEGER Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here. \nWES Oh, Jesus! \nJAEGER They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here! \nEPPS Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up! \nJAEGER We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around. \nEPPS We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase. \nWES What are we going to do? \nEpps thinks.  Thinking's not good enough for Wes. \nNo good. Wes is too scared to move.  Epps reaches back and literally pulls him up and over into the front. \nEPPS(CONT) Take it! \nWith little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over. Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher.  He loads it up, and readies the weapon.  Crawling to the back he takes aim. \nEPPS(CONT) Keep it steady. \nWes does his best to give a level ride, but the Iraqi bullets coming at them don't help much. \nEpps zeroes in on the target.  He takes aim and starts to squeeze back on the trigger.  He almost has a shot off when Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently.  Epps loses the target. \nEPPS(CONT) Damn it!  I said keep it steady. \nEpps tries to take aim again.  Careful aim.  One shot is all he gets.  The bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry. Waiting...waiting...  The Iraqis are only getting closer. \nWES Shoot...shoot! \nWaiting... \nCloser... \nWES SHOOT! \nEPPS FIRES!  The grenade rips from the launcher, riding a trail of white smoke, and slams into the Iraqis.  You know the story:  Huge explosion, car parts flying a hundred feet into the air, bodies whipping through space, stuff Bob Dole would hate.  But maybe he would like it.  They were just Iraqis. \nWes brings the Hummer to a halt.  A spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him.  Jaeger, checking himself for wounds, and Epps, M-16 still in hand, get out.  Epps makes his way to the wreckage, sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any survivors.  Yeah, like somebody's walking away from that bang. \nWes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was. \nWES I thought we were dead. \nJAEGER Yeah, well, we're not. \nWES We got to get out of here. \nNobody says anything.  This really scares Wes. \nWES(CONT) We have to go back. \nJAEGER We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for. \nWES (Incredulous) We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on? \nEPPS Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for damage. \nJaeger starts to cross back to the Hummer.  Wes gives him something to take with him. \nWES You're crazy, you know that?  You're insane! \nJaeger goes leaving Epps and Wes all by their lonesome.  Wes turns to Epps. \nWES(CONT) You know that, right?  You know he's sick? \nWith a flip of his head Epps indicates the dead Iraqis. \nEPPS They shouldn't have been here. \nWES We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on! \nEPPS This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters. \nWES Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged. \nEPPS They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying. \nWes starts to get it.  It really doesn't matter what he has to say. \nWES We're not going back, are we? \nEpps has got nothing to say to the truth.  He turns and starts to walk to the Hummer. \nWES(CONT) You bastard!  You're trying to get us killed. \nLike a whip Epps snaps around.  He grabs up Wes and pulls him close. \nEPPS I'm trying to get us paid.  I'm trying to get us all paid!  As long as there's a chance something is out there we go on. There's not going to be anymore trouble. If there is, we go back, but there won't be. \nAlmost as an afterthought Epps realizes he's got Wes, and lets him go.  Gently he puts it: \nEPPS(CONT) You'll feel different after we find the treasure.  Money has away of making people feel different. \nNobody's got anytbing to say to that, so they say nothing. Epps heads back to the Hummer.  A beat later Wes follows. \nJaeger is already behind the wheel.  Epps rides shotgun this time.  Once again Wes is in back.  To Jaeger, Epps ask: \nWES Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either. \nJAEGER We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back. \nWES Then lets go back while we still can. \nJAEGER As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it. \nEPPS What do we do with the Humvee? \nJAEGER We leave it. \nWES What if someone takes it? \nJaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert. \nJAEGER Who?  Who's going to take it.  We mark the location with the navicom, we can come right back to this spot. \nWes has had enough. \nWES You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent. \nJAEGER You have to go with us, Wes. \nWES Really?  What is that, an order, private? \nJAEGER You have to go with us.  You can't walk back... \nJaeger dangles the keys to the Humvee from a finger. \nJAEGER{CONT) And you sure as hell aren't going to drive. \nWes burns a hole through Jaeger's head with his eyes.  Epps steps to him. \nEPPS Load what you can; water, tools, weapons. Anything you think we might need. \nWes burns on a bit more, then turns and heads for the Hummer. Jaeger watches him go, then smiles to himself. \nJAEGER Who's he kidding?  He wants it as bad as we do.  We're going to be fat, Epps.  As soon as we get back to Saudivillie you and me are going to-- \nEpps gets up in Jaeger's face.  The menace he projects is very real. \nEPPS We're going to keep going 'cause I want some of whatever's out there.  But you ever pull something like trying to get my ass stranded out here again, and I'll kill you myself.  You got that? \nJaeger just stands there, his fear swelling. \nEPPS(CONT) SAY IT! \nJAEGER I got that...sir. \nEpps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all scared with himself. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT - LATER \nA long line of footprints works their way through the sand up to Epps, Jaeger, and Wes.  Epps and Wes trek side by side. \nJaeger is behind them, having trouble keeping up.  Between pants he gasps: \nJAEGER Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast. \nEPPS Faster we get there, faster we get back. \nJAEGER Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you. \nJaeger struggles on just a bit more, then: \nJAEGER(CONT) I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water. \nEPPS Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours. \nJAEGER I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip. \nJaeger lets himself drop down into the sand.  He looks up. Epps and Wes are still walking. \nJAGER{CONT) Wait for me! \nEPPS You can catch up. \nJAEGER Yeah...I'm right behind you. \nWes looks back at Jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his water. \nWES Thanks for straightening out Jaeger. \nJAEGER How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!? \nEPPS We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool. \nEpps goes to Wes.  The two start to move away from Jaeger. \nJAEGER Where you going? \nEPPS Me and Wes are just going to talk. \nJAEGER Why you got to move away to talk!? \nEPPS We're going to be right over here. \nJAEGER You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up! \nEPPS I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool! \nEpps and Wes move over and huddle. \nWES What kind of mine? \nEPPS I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it. \nWES Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff. \nEPPS Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces. \nBehind them, pathetically, Jaeger cries: \nJAEGER Epps... \nWES Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway. \nEPPS There's a way. \nJAEGER Epps... \nWES Can't do it.  Can't do it, and keep him alive. \nEpps' eyes narrow.  He doesn't want to hear this kind of talk. \nEPPS I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies. \nJAEGER Epps, my leg is falling asleep. \nEpps thinks, and thinks hard. \nEPPS (To Wes) We've got rope? \nWES For climbing. \nEPPS Break it out. \nEpps crosses back over to Jaeger. \nJAEGER My leg is falling asleep. \nEPPS It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes. \nJAEGER I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep. \nEPPS It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up. \nWes crosses over with climbing rope.  Very, very gently Epps wraps the middle of the rope around Jaeger's waist leaving several feet dangling off each end. \nJAEGER How's this going to work? \nEPPS Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine. \nJAEGER That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay. \nNot too convincingly: \nEPPS You're going to be fine. \nJAEGER You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die! \nIgnoring the question: \nEPPS When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you. \nJAEGER Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die. \nEpps and Wes pick up separate ends of the rope, and take up positions behind Jaeger.  Epps waits a beat, afraid of what might happen, but there is no choice.  He digs in ready to take off running.  Wes whispers to him: \nJAEGER The map. \nEpps stops, like he almost not sure what Jaeger is talking about.  Jaeger extends a hand. \nJAEGER(CONT) The map. \nEpps gets it.  He hands the map back to Jaeger who tucks it away.  Our boys walk on. \nEPPS You're not losing trust, are you? \nJAEGER Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it. \nWES If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself. \nJAEGER Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you. \nEPPS I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand? \nJAEGER Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal. \nWES I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger. \nJAEGER Anytime you want to do something about it just let-- \nEpps stops dead in his tracks. \nEPPS Quiet! \nThey all go quiet. Epps cocks an ear to the air and listens. They all listen.  Wind, but that's about it. \nJAEGER I don't hear any-- \nEPPS Shut up and listen! \nAgain they listen.  Again they hear wind.  Then, there it is; the sound Epps is looking for:  A pop, like a big balloon being burst just over the next rise. \nWES Gunfire. \nQuick like that Jaeger grabs his M-16 down off his shoulder and is about to ready it when Epps slaps down the muzzle. \nEPPS Don't! \nJAEGER It's a fire fight. \nEPPS Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on. \nWES What is it? \nEpps thinks.  Yeah, what the hell is it? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT - RISE \nEpps, Jaeger, and Wes edge carefully up to the lip of the rise on their bellies.  They're barely visible against the sand.  Epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on the ground below. \nCUT TO: \nPOV - EPPS \nTHROUGH BINOCULAR LENSES we see a SHI'ITE CAMP:  A tent city really.  There are several uniformed IRAQI SOLDIERS who are roughing up the Shi'ite men. \nCUT TO: \nEPPS, WES, JAEGER \nJAEGER What is it? \nEpps hands the binoculars over to Jaeger.  Who looks down at the scene on the ground. \nEPPS Iraqis.  A bunch of them. \nJAEGER What are they doing here? \nJaeger hands the binoculars to Wes. \nEPPS Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here. \nJAEGER What are they doing in the middle of nowhere? \nWES Maybe they're looking for gold. \nCUT TO: \nPOV - WES \nEPPS You listen to me.  The whole reason we're here is because of you and that map of yours.  I didn't do all this for nothing, and I'm not leaving with nothing.  If you think for a second I'm giving up just 'cause you're too tired to turn over some dirt, then you don't know John Epps too well, do you?  So you dig, and you keep on digging 'til I say you don't have to dig anymore. \nEpps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard. A fire burns inside him.  A fire that burns out of control. Before he even knows what he's doing Jaeger springs to his feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for Epps' head. \nEpps bears him coming.  He deftly side steps the blow, grabs hold of Jaeger and forces him down.  They roll around violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the other into a choke hold. \nCUT TO: \nWES \nHe can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down. \nWES What are you doing...?  What the hell are you doing down there? \nCUT TO: \nEPPS AND JAEGER \nThey fight on; down and dirty.  Locked together they roll around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand.  They smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness. At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger.  He lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaeger's skull.  All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow. \nSomething catches Epps' eye:  A glint of light flashes across his faces.  He stares at it; at an opening, a bare seem really, in the side of the cave wall where light seeps through.  The rock slips from his hand.  Forgetting all about Jaeger Epps goes to the opening.  Jaeger himself, as if what just happened hadn't really happened, comes up along side Epps. \nJAEGER Must be a compartment. \nEPPS I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon. \nJaeger says what they both must have guessed by now. \nJAEGER The white dot; light in the dark. \nThat's all Epps needs to hear.  He starts clawing at the opening with his bare hands.  That gets him nothing. Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it.  Jaeger gets the lantern working again, then picks up his shovel and joins in.  They keep hitting and hitting, picking up a rhythm like a southern chain gang. \nJAEGER (CONT) Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore. \nEPPS It's giving. \nThe rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free.  There's just enough space for a man to reach his arm through.  For a beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid of what mayor may not be in there. \nWith some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards the opening.  Slowly it extends closer...closer...  Just as it moves beyond the opening. vThere is a wild, screeching hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for Epps. \nBoth Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear. \nJAEGER Jesus Christ! \nJaeger grabs up his M-16 and takes aim at...whatever it is. \nEPPS No, don't shoot! \nToo late. Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds.  A couple of bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the cave and around Epps and Jaeger.  All the two men can do is duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls - as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of random death. \nEventually the bullets lose speed and die off.  Jaeger and Epps raise up off the ground.  They walk to the dead thing that jumped from the opening. \nEPPS It's just a mongoose. \nJAEGER Is it dead? \nEPPS Yeah, Bwana, you got it. \nCUT TO: \nWES \nYelling down \nWES What the hell are you doing!? \nCUT TO: \nEPPS AND JAEGER \nJAEGER I think we found something. \nThey go back to the opening.  Epps shines a light inside to make sure there are no more surprises, then reaches an arm in.  Jaeger looks on with great anticipation, licking his lips like a hungry jackal, as Epps twists his arm in the opening.  Searching...searching... \nEpps' face freezes.  He goes perfectly still for a beat, then slowly draws his hand from the opening.  It clutches a wooden box.  It is similar to Jaeger's puzzle box, but slightly bigger.  The instant Epps sets the box on the ground Jaeger smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood.  From the splinters pours a river of gold coins.  Jaeger and Epps are too stunned to do anything but look at it. \nCUT TO: \nWES \nHe leans over the crevice. \nWES What is it?  What'd you find? \nCUT TO: \nA tense moment passes. \nWES What are you doing?  You ready? \nAnother moment, then: \nEPPS All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow. \nJAEGER Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work. \nJaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on.  He's just about ready to climb up when Epps stops him.  Serious as a heart attack he says: \nEPPS If you're even thinking about leaving me down here, you better think again. \nJaeger stares at Epps for a beat, then laughs himself a little laugh.  He yells up: \nJAEGER Wes, I'm coming up. \nJaeger starts to climb as Wes helps out by pulling on the rope. \nEpps watches him for a bit, then looks at the pack of gold and the rest of the equipment.  Suddenly he scurries about gathering up all the things they've brought down. \nJaeger continues his climb, disappearing up into the crevice. A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from, above.  Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to the rope.  Yelling up: \nEPPS Okay! \nThe rope goes taught, slowly drawing the pack up, up into the crevice finally to be swallowed from view. \nEpps waits for the rope to come back down.  He waits.  He waits a beat more.  No rope. \nEPPS(CONT) Wes?  Jaeger? \nHe tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it creeps in anyway.  He tries it again. \nEPPS(CONT) Jaeger? \nStill more nothing.  What's that sound?  It's Epps' breath getting heavier and faster. \nEPPS(CONT) Jaeger!? \nNothing.  Then something.  The rope snakes its way back down. Epps can't help but let go of a little laugh, like a guy who's just been given a scare by his own shadow.  Taking up his own pack Epps hooks up, then starts the climb to the top. \nCUT TO: \nJAEGER AND WES \nThey work the rope, helping Epps up.  He gets to the lip of the crevice, and pulls himself over.  He's breathing hard, and lets his pack slide to the ground.  Trying not to sound too rattled. \nEPPS What the hell took so long. \nJAEGER Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long. \nEPPS Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not. \nThrowing Epps' own words back at him: \nWES Not losing trust, are you? \nEpps lets this go. \nEPPS It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light. \nWES What about the gold? \nEPPS What about it? \nWES Maybe we should split it up now. \nEPPS We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now. \nWES What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share. \nJAEGER Wes might be right about that. \nEPPS It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas. \nWES You're the one with all the ideas. \nEPPS You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it. \nWES Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out. \nEPPS Maybe I do. \nWES Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own. \nReal casual Epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the pin loose.  He stands with the grenade in one hand and the navicom in the other.  Real calm, like he was talking about the weather: \nEPPS Something happens to me I let go of this grenade.  I go, and I take the navicom with me.  And how do you suppose you're going to find your way back to the Hummer, when you won't even know what's up or down.  It's a big country, and you could be heading for the allies, or wandering right into Bhagdad.  That's if you don't die of thirst before you even get that far.  How you like my stick now? \nEpps and Wes have a stare down.  Jaeger, who's getting really good at freaking out, jumps in. \nJAEGER Why don't you put the gun down, all right, Wes?  You put the gun down and Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade. Won't you Epps? \nThe stare down goes on a beat longer.  Finally Wes lowers his rifle.  He turns to Jaeger and vents what anger he can. \nWES I'm starting to think you're a real bitch, you know that? \nFADE TO: \nEXT. DESERT - LATER \nTHE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness.  SMOKE BEGINS TO DRIFT INTO FRAME.  THE CAMERA FINALLY LANDS ON THE SHI'ITE ENCAMPMENT, or at least what's left of it.  Tents are torn down and burned, goods scattered.  It looks like a ghost town.  Epps, Wes and Jaeger wander into it.  They look around, but see no signs of life. \nWes grabs up some Shi'ite garments, white robes, and starts to put them on. \nJAEGER You're going to burn up in those. \nWES The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them. \nJaeger looks to Epps who just shrugs.  Jaeger gets some robes and puts them on.  Epps follows suit. \nJAEGER Think the Iraqi's killed them all? \nWES Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers. \nEPPS (Pointed) Murder, or a combat action?  It's hard to tell them apart? \nThey keep on moving, passing straight through the camp.  Epps marches ahead, not wanting to even deal with the other two men.  Wes talks after him.  Really he talks more to himself, and he's not sounding too lucid. \nWES You saw how he ran didn't you?  First chance he got he ran out.  Would have gone straight to his CO, told him all about the gold.  What do you think would have happened then, huh?  Then what do you think would have happened?  Two thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on us.  You ought to thank me for killing him.  I'll get a medal for it.  Watch and see if I don't get a medal. \nEpps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. Almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his tracks.  He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious thing.  SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET, ALMOST AS IF IT'S GOING DOWN A DRAIN.  He looks at it with the same wonderment that a dog watches television. \nEPPS What the hell...? \nEpps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet. He's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in loose sand.  Immediately he sinks to waist level.  He slows there, but still goes down with rapidity.  He screams to Jaeger and Wes. \nEPPS(CONT) Help!  Help me! \nJaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole.  Wes doesn't move. \nEPPS(CONT) Help me! \nJaeger is paralyzed by indecision.  He doesn't want to let Epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get sucked into.  He flirts back and forth between rescue and safety. \nSand continues to pour in on Epps. \nEPPS(CONT) For Christ's Sake, Jaeger!  Help me! Help me! \nJaeger can't fight himself any longer.  He lowers himself halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for Epps. \nTheir arms twist and strain for each others.  First their fingers meet, then they grab hands.  They work a grip down to their wrist, but that's all they can get.  Jaeger strains like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand.  It may not be enough as he begins to slip down himself.  Jaeger twists his head and looks up at Wes.  Straining to say anything he pleads: \nJAEGER Wes...Wes! \nHis words fall on deaf ears.  Wes just takes a step closer to the pack of gold coins. \nThis only serves to energize Jaeger.  He digs deeper within himself finding an untapped reserve of strength.  He grunts and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. \nEpps finds same purchase.  He pulls, swims, his way up from the sand.  A little at first, but like hitting shallow water he's able to lift himself up. \nJager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground.  They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. \nAs Epps regains strength he pats himself down.  Suddenly he goes back into a panic. \nEPPS The navicom! \nEpps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft sand frantically looking for the lost computer.  Jaeger joins in.  They dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to venture only so far into the soft sand.  It doesn't matter. The navicom is lost. \nJAEGER What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!? \nEPPS We'll find our way. \nJAEGER How!? \nEPPS We'll find our way!  We'll... \nEpps wants to say how, but he's got no idea.  Wes grows a smug smile. \nWES No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps. \nJAEGER They'll search the pack. \nEpps finds a mirror in one of his pockets.  He stands, ready to signal the chopter. \nJAEGER(CONT) They'll find the gold. \nEpps turns sharply back to Jaeger. \nEPPS We're lost, you understand that?  We've got no navicom, and no means to find a way back.  So right now I don't give a damn about the gold because if we don't get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all it's going to be good for is buying us tombstones. \nEpps is back around ready to signal the helicopter.  He's about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an M-16 action being worked.  Epps turns to face Jaeger. \nJAEGER I can't do it, Epps.  Not when we're so close.  I can't let you ruin everything. \nEpps just stares at Jaeger, not frightened, but surprisingly calm. \nEPPS First Wes, now you? \nJAEGER I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy. \nEPPS (Sarcastic) And you; you've got it all together. \nJAEGER I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close. \nEPPS That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death. \nJaeger is unfazed.  Very politely he says: \nJAEGER Sit down, Epps. \nEpps takes him up on the offer.  What choice does he have? THE CAMERA STAYS TIGHT ON THE TWO MEN.  They don't talk. They don't move.  They just sit as WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE HELICOPTER GETTING CLOSER AND LOUDER.  IT REACHES A CRESCENOO, THEN BEGINS TO FADE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS.  The chopter is gone, along with Epps and Jaeger's best chance of getting out of the desert alive. \nJaeger lowers his rifle.  Very genuinely he says: \nJAEGER(CONT) I'm sorry about that, Epps. \nEPPS Is it all right if I stand up? \nLike he didn't know he was keeping Epps from something. \nJAEGER Oh, yeah.  Go ahead. \nEpps stands.  He looks around trying to figure things out. Not much to figure.  There still in the middle of a desert in a hostile country same as they ever were. \nJAEGER(CONT) I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that. \nEPPS Yeah.  Well, me too. \nJAEGER I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that. \nEPPS Sure. \nJAEGER Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine. \nEPPS You still got a map on you? \nJAEGER What?  Yeah. \nJaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to Epps. Epps looks them over, then looks over the terrain.  Without any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be finger paintings. \nJAEGER(CONT) Epps? \nEPPS Yeah. \nJAEGER I don't want to die. \nEPPS Makes two of us. \nJAEGER I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold. \nEPPS It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now. \nJAEGER I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to-- \nFed up with Jaeger Epps turns on him hard. \nEPPS Hey, you know what?  Can I be honest with you?  Right now I'm not all that interested in how you're messed up 'cause you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday.  What I'm interested in is how I can keep from getting dead.  And listening to sob stories from some           about how the system wasn't good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn thing to help keep me alive.  So do me a favor; either shut up, or...just shut up. \nJaeger isn't sure what to say. \nJAEGER Sorry. \nEPPS Damn. \nEpps sits down in the sand, all out of ideas.  There's a long quiet before Jaeger says: \nEpps heads for the shack doing double time.  Jaeger puts the pack back on and races to catch up. \nEPPS(CONT} They've got to have water.  We'll get same water, some directions, maybe they even have a vehicle. \nJAEGER Epps. \nEPPS We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold. \nJAEGER Epps.  What if they're not Saudi. \nEpps stops dead, now not more than one hundred meters from the shack. \nJAEGER(CONT) If it's a checkpoint, it could be Iraqi. \nEpps considers this. \nEPPS We've got no cboice.  Either way, we've got no choice. \nEpps and Jaeger keep on for the shack walking with apprehension now instead of running.  Epps stops less than fifty meters away. \nJAEGER Well? \nEPPS Well, we should identify ourselves. \nJAEGER Yeah, I guess we should. \nEpps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack. Instead he turns to Jaeger. \nEPPS Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble. \nJAEGER Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably. \nAgain Epps takes a deep breath.  And again just as he's about to cry out he turns to Jaeger. \nEPPS That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over. \nJAEGER Probably. \nEpps takes a beat, then sucks in a breath.  He yells for the shack: \nEPPS Hellooooo-- \nBefore Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger. They dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle and ping through the space around them.  They are forced back and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead.  It's just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them and death.  At the top of his lungs Jaeger starts yelling: \nJAEGER Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!  Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib! \nJust as quickly as it began the shooting stops.  From the shack we hear some chatter in Arabic, then the door opens.  A few MEN appear in the doorway.  They laugh and beckon for Epps and Jaeger to join them. \nEPPS What did you say? \nJAEGER I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means \"Don't shoot. We're your friends.\" \nEPPS They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on! \nEpps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.  Jaeger is just steps behind him. \nThey enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the FOUR men inside.  Epps and Jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on chattering behind them. \nJAGER Oh, man, this is good.  What do you think the chances are they've got a whirlpool in this place? \nAs they rub their hands together Epps looks up.  He freezes. Hanging on the wall is a very handsome, nicely framed portrait of Saddam Hussein.  Epps nudges Jaeger who also looks up.  He also freezes. \nJAEGER(CONT) Oh, God... \nEPPS They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark. \nJAEGER What are we going to do? \nEpps thinks.  What are they going to do? \nEPPS Slip out your M-16. \nJAEGER And then what? \nEPPS And then shoot them. \nJAEGER I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that. \nEPPS Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down. \nBehind Epps and Jaeger one of the Iraqis asks a question of them in Arabic. \nJAEGER Can't you-- \nEPPS I don't have a weapon. \nEpps breaks into a run.  Jaeger is only steps behind him. \nLike something out of an old John Ford western dozens of mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.  They ride fast and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon train.  They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if playing with them. \nEpps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.  The Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over them.  It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the cattle. \nEpps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again the Arabs bear down on them.  This time they mean business. They completely surround them, cutting off all means of escape.  The Arabs start screaming something back and forth in Arabic.  We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. \nEpps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt.  They turn in their tracks digging in the scene.  It goes like this:  They are completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force. Doesn't get any simpler. \nEpps and Jaeger drop their weapons.  Their hands go in the air. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHI'ITE CAMP - LATER \nThe mounted Arabs lead Epps and Jaeger, hands tied before them and almost literally being towed by the horses, into their camp.  It is similar to the Shi'ite camps we've seen before with several tent dwellings. \nAs the party enters groups of Shi'ites come over to stare at Epps and Jaeger.  They chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier. \nFrom our boy's point of view this is all like an unending nightmare:  Being dragged along through a desert, not knowing the language, not knowing what's going to happen.  Their world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl. \nFinally they reach a tent.  One of the Arabs tosses Epps and Jaeger's packs on the ground just before it.  Another cuts them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, then yells something at them in Arabic.  He leaves, and our two are alone. \nJAEGER What do you make of them? \nEPPS Shi'ites, I think. \nJAEGER Is that good, or bad? \nEPPS I don't know.  They killed Wes. \nJAEGER Why haven't they killed us!? \nEPPS I don't know! \nJAEGER ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out. \nEPPS With what?  Against how many? \nJAEGER We can't just sit here waiting to die. \nEPPS You come up with a better plan, let me know. \nJAEGER Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us. \nFrom O.C. we hear a voice: \nVOICE(O.C.) I always knew you were a bitch. \nEpps and Jaeger's hearts seize up and stop.  It's as if they've heard the voice of a ghost, and they have.  IT'S WES! He carries with him the pack of gold.  Epps can barely get his name out. \nEPPS ...Wes...? \nJAEGER You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot! \nWES In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead. \nEPPS We thought-- \nLike a guy who just took two steps over the edge: \nWES YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD! \nOhhh, shit.  Somebody's crazy.  Epps gets the feeling there's not going to be much dialog going on here.  Wes gets real calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts. \nWES(CONT) When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean? \nJAEGER We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. \nWES You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch. \nEPPS Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good. \nWES Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with. \nEPPS Wes-- \nWES Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you? \nWes gets right up into Jaeger's face. \nWES{CONT) Do you!? \nOf course Wes knows they don't.  He allows himself a very sweet, shit eating grin. \nJAEGER They coming? \nEpps takes a look behind him.  He can't hardly miss the sandstorm Wes and the Shi'ites kick up as they ride for them. \nEPPS Oh, yeah.  They're coming. \nEpps points off to some foothills in the distance.  It's the only thing close to cover for miles around. \nEPPS(CONT) Ride for the hills.  We'll try to lose them. \nThey take the reigns to their horses and get to riding. \nBehind them Wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to split up, and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger. \nEpps and Jaeger hit the hills.  They ride up for a bit, then stop to spot Wes.  Wes and his crew are better riders and have closed the gap.  All the two can do now is try to lose them in the terrain. \nEpps and Jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat erratically to cover their trail.  They head up a ways, then cut across in a parallel direction.  Jaeger looks back, but sees no sign of Wes. \nJAEGER We lost them! \nJust as the words leave Jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets explodes the ground before them.  Their horses rear up, and it's all they can do to fight them.  Just ahead are the Shi'ites who split off from Wes, having circled around Epps and Jaeger. \nThe two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite direction with the Shi'ites just behind.  They fire on Epps and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. \nEpps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs.  And good for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now.  They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers. \nAs Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below them, and Wes and his posse riding for them.  Our two start back the way they came. but the other Shi'ites crest the hill. \nJAEGER(CONT) Which way? \nEpps looks from side to side.  Either way is certain death. Then he looks off towards an embankment.  It is VERY steep. VERY treacherous. \nIt would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment safely.  All Epps knows is there aren't any gun totting Shi'ites in that direction. \nJAEGER(CONT) Which way do we go!? \nEPPS We go this way. \nFear gives way to desperation.  Both men whip their steeds hard.  The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild ride down.  Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to stay on their horses. \nWes sees this and swears.  He signals to his men to cut back the other way. \nEpps reaches the bottom of the embankment.  Jaeger is almost there when he looses control of his horse.  Both rider and animal go tumbling in an ugly fall. \nEPPS(CONT) Jaeger! \nThe horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her. \nJust then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and start riding hard for Jaeger. \nEpps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen comrade.  As he rides in he leans to the side and low. Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and swings him up behind him.  A couple of rodeo performers couldn't have done it better. \nProblem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast. Wes and his men close hard now.  The bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys. \nEpps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster, faster... \nSuddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride. They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get this beast to fly. \nFinally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter.  Wes and the Shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off.  Wes stands down from his horse. \nEpps and Jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same. \nWES The gold; give it to me. \nEpps takes the pack from Jaeger, but doesn't throw it to Wes. \nWES(CONT) Give it to me! \nEPPS If I give it to you, will you let us go? \nWes smiles and lies so badly he doesn't even bother trying to fake it. \nWES Sure.  Whatever you want.  For old time sake. \nEpps has got no choice, really.  He tosses the pack to Wes' feet who stoops to pick it up.  Wes starts to open the pack. \nWES(CONT) Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. \nEPPS It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? \nWes rips open the pack.  He's got about one second to see what's inside.  NO GOLD.  JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE. \nEpps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. \nThere is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily destroys Wes and a few of the Shi'ite standing next to him. The rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life. \nJAEGER What? \nEPPS I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there. \nJAEGER Really? \nEPPS That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold. \nFrom the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor.  It draws closer and closer. \nEpps and Jaeger stand.  Knowing they're so close to the end of a long adventure they become very business like. \nJAEGER Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right. \nEPPS We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold. \nEpps and Jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car draws closer. \nJAEGER Okay.  See you in a minute. \nJaeger goes out and lays in the car's path.  Epps goes to hide behind some rocks. \nThe car keeps getting closer and closer. \nJaeger yells over to Epps. \nJAEGER(CONT) Epps, I don't think he's slowing down. \nEPPS He'll slow down. \nThe car gets closer. \nJAEGER He's not slowing. \nEPPS He's going to slow down. \nThe car gets closer. \nJAEGER Epps...Epps! \nThe car barrels right for Jaeger.  Forget what Epps says, it's not slowing down and Jaeger knows it. \nJAEGER(CONT) Aw, damn! \nAt the last possible second Jaeger rolls out of the way.  The car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.  The DRIVER loses control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt. \nEpps runs to the car, rips open the driver's door, and presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head. \nEPPS You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!? \nDRIVER (Frightened) Y-yes. \nJaeger runs over and jumps in the car.  Epps gets in behind the driver, keeping the gun pressed to his head. \nEPPS Where were you going? \nDRIVER Baghdad. \nEPPS What's in the other direction? \nDRIVER This road, it leads straight to Kuwait. \nEPPS Turn the car around. \nDRIVER Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me. \nEPPS Nobody's going to hurt you. \nEpps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver. \nEPPS(CONT) You see that?  Gold.  You take us to the Americans, and we'll give you another one.  Now drive. \nThe driver turns around the car and starts back in the direction he came. \nThey drive on for awhile, mostly in silence.  Epps and Jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared.  Finally the driver starts to talk. \nDRIVER You are Americans, yes? \nNeither Jaeger or Epps answer. \nDRIVER(CONT) We didn't not all want this war, do you know?  We didn't not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in Kuwait.  Now your army crushes us.  So few days, and so many have died.  And many fear we will all die.  Please tell this to your people:  We did not want this war. \nStill Jaeger and Epps say nothing.  Outside the car the traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets thicker and thicker. \nDRIVER(CONT) I have a brother in our army.  When I take you back, will you look for him?  If he is still alive, will you look for him and take care of him? \n", "test1_input": "FADE TO: \nOur boys stop.  The pass has seemingly came to an end.  For a short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer.  The three soldiers take it in. \nEPPS Not much of a pass. \nWES Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now. \nEPPS Picks up again just on the other side. \nThey all take a good look at what little there is to cross on, and how far down it is to the hard, jagged rocks below. \nJAEGER Think we can make it? \nWES We make it, or we go back empty handed. \nEPPS Looks like we make it. \nEpps and Wes edge their way towards what's left of the pass. Jaeger just stands there staring down.  Way down. \nFADE TO: \nEpps, Wes and Jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of the mesa.  Small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to the ground below.  No man says a word, they're too busy trying to keep alive, and the air is filled with the sounds of labored breathing. \nEach step so very careful:  Testing the pass for purchase, making sure the footing is solid.  They inch one foot forward, then slide over the next.  Their hands probe the cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking for something, anything, to take hold of. \nSweat drips into Epps eye.  He blinks hard and fast trying to clear his vision.  Right now he can't really afford distractions. \nSlowly, carefully, inch by inch the little death dance goes on. \nJaeger steps.  He steps wrong.  The pass gives way under his foot and begins to slide down.  Instinctively Wes rockets out an arm grabbing Jaeger by the uniform.  At first Jaeger smiles, glad for the save.  But then he realizes something: Wes is literally holding his life in his hands.  All Wes has to do is loosen his grip, and... \nThe color drains from Jaeger's face.  Wes stares back blank as a bowl of water. \nEternity goes on for a second. \nFinally Wes yanks Jaeger back up against the mesa's face, then slides on.  Jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat clutching the rocks for dear life. \nFADE TO: \nEpps makes it to the far side of the broken pass.  He holds out a hand to Wes and reels him in.  Together they both help bring in Jaeger.  Wes looks back over the path they've just crossed. \nWES The US Army:  Always an adventure. \nEPPS Let me see the map. \nJaeger hands the map to Epps who gives it a going over.  THEY WALK AS THEY TALK. \nEPPS(CONT) Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot. \nWES What do you figure it to be? \nEPPS Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive. \nJAEGER X marks the spot. \nEPPS Something like that. \nJAEGER But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something. \nEPPS I hope it means something, otherwise... \nWES Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere. \nEPPS Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to-- \nOur boys step past a grouping of rocks.  They stop dead. Sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is FIVE IRAQI SOLDIERS.  Time clicks by real slow for an instant. It's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is burning the flesh from your hand. \nEPPS(CONT) Take cover! \nOur three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came. They run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready.  They wait a bit, taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under. Finally Epps gives the order. \nEPPS(CONT) Let's hit 'em! \nSimultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to kingdom come. \nOne problem:  No Iraqis. \nFor a beat our three don't move.  They hold position, breath coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race.  They're eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything. There's nothing. \nEPPS(CONT) Cover me. \nM-16 still at the ready, Epps raises up taking a tactical stance.  He inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and forth before him for any potential target.  There is none. The Iraqis have vanished.  Epps lowers the M-16, but does not shoulder it. \nEPPS(CONT) Clear. \n", "test1_true": "WES Where'd they go? \nEPPS I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about-- \nWES Weird they didn't chase us. \nJAEGER Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them. \nWES Just seems weird they didn't chase us. \nEPPS What's weird is how they disappeared. Doesn't make sense.  Doesn't... \nThere is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and grows closer like a rolling thunder.  Our three start looking around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch.  There's nothing.  They see nothing.  Still the sound races closer and closer.  Epps, Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast. \nFrom below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP - probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into sight.  It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers. On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins.  The PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine cannons at our boys. \nEPPS(CONT) Scatter! \nWes and Jaeger don't have to be told twice.  They bolt from their spots, and not an instant too soon.  The GUNNER lets fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground where our boys were just standing.  We see what the chopter's weapons will do to rock.  We can imagine what they would do to flesh. \nEpps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks.  The gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. \nMore shells fired.  They punch into and through the rocks our boys use for cover.  Again the three scatter, and just in time as the shells rip their way through the rock. \nOur three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low. Their heads whip around looking for the gunship. \nJAEGER Where is it?  Where'd it go? \nEPPS Stay low. \nJAEGER Where the hell is it!? \nEPPS Just stay down. \nIn answer to Jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up behind them like a bird of prey.  Our three have all of about a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells their way.  They kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, ping around Epps, Wes and Jaeger who make a wild, evasive run. \nDig it:  Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face. They race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way. \nOnce inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space. It's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck air. \nBeyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. \nJaeger's worked up a real scare. \nJAEGER What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do? \nEPPS We're not going to do anything. \nJAEGER (Panicked) They're going to kill us! \nEPPS They can't shoot us in here. \nWES And they can't fly around out there forever. \nEPPS So we wait. \nJAEGER If they land-- \nEPPS If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about. \nWes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air. It floats very steady as if...  Wes' eyes key in on something:  The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, coming in line... Wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed an electric cattle prod in his ass. \nWES Missile! \nEPPS Move! \nEpps, Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod. With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow straight into the passage.  Slamming into the ground it sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive explosion.  It races through the passage, lifts our boys from the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were nothing more than discarded ragdolls. \nJaeger takes cover and cowers.  He puts his panic into overdrive. \nWes pulls his rifle.  Grunting like an animal he sprays bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at an elephant.  The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his direction.  It doesn't hit him, but it sends him running. \nEpps has had enough of this shit.  He scrambles to load a grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about.  It races for him, cannons at the ready.  This one is going to be close.  Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down on him.  Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug.  The grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding harmlessly.  The chopter returns the favor by reining down a hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER the edge of the plateau.  His M-16 goes flying, smashing into the ground far below.  Epps manages to grab hold of the plateau lip with one hand.  It swings him around, slamming him hard against the cliff face.  He hangs there, suspended by his weakening grip, far above the ground. \nJAEGER Epps! \nJaeger and Wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm.  They pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase, and crawl his way back up to the plateau. \nAt the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers above and beyond our three.  It rotates so that the bay doors are facing Epps, Wes and Jaeger.  Three Iraqis are inside, weapons trained on our targets.  One of them yells something. Wes translates. \nWES They want us to surrender. \nThe three share a nervous look.  Epps fairly growls: \nEPPS Yeah, I'll surrender. \n", "test1_id": 2958, "test2_input": "Jaeger and Wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, Epps palms a grenade from his belt.  Wes and Jaeger don't quite smile, but they know now they at least have a chance.  As Epps stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis.  They all fold their hands behind their necks which, for Epps, hides the grenade from view.  Slowly they walk towards the gunship. One of the Iraqis starts to yell something.  He lifts his weapon and aims it at our boys.  With his thumb Epps yanks the pin from the grenade and lets fly.  It's a perfect toss, landing in the chopter's bay.  The Iraqis see the grenade land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship. \nToo late. \nThe grenade explodes in the Iraqi's hand killing him instantly.  It also touches off a fire ball that severely damages the gunship.  It rocks, lists, spins wildly out of control. \nEPPS(CONT) Get down! \nOur three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among them.  Worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from the sky towards Epps, Jaeger and Wes.  All they can do is cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two tons of crashing steel.  The chopter rushes down...down, but it just misses them.  It slams into the ground skipping over the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. \nOur three pick themselves up.  They walk to the edge of the plateau and look down on the crash. \nJaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock. \nJAEGER Oh, God... \nWes looks down at Jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer. \nWES Yeah.  Just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it? \nThey stare for awhile, then one by one move off.  Us?  We: \nFADE TO: \nBLACK \nFADE TO: \nEXT. DESERT/MESA - LATER \nEpps, Wes and Jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs straight down into the ground.  Jaeger takes out his maps and photos.  Epps consults the navicom. \nWES What do you think? \nJAEGER Lines up with the map and the photos. \nEPPS We're right where we should be. \nEpps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look around.  Not much to see. \nEPPS(CONT) I sure don't see much place else around here to hide anything. \nWes pulls a lantern/flashlight from his pack.  Going to his belly he shines it down into the crevice. \nWES Can't see anything. \nHe tosses a rock into it.  We can hear it hit the ground below. \nWES(CONT) It's got a bottom. \nJAEGER Guess we know what the next stop is. \nEPPS All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see. \nWES What am I supposed to do? \nEPPS Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either. \nJAEGER Think there might be more Iraqis? \nEPPS Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns. \nCUT TO: \nWE SEE A FEW QUICK SHOTS of Wes securing a line down into the crevice, Epps and Jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses, the two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CREVICES - CONTINUOUS \nThe lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses it like a machete to blaze a trial.  He sinks down...down until finally they touch bottom.  He unclips himself from the rope and Jaeger starts down. \nThe space isn't that big, like a small cave really.  It's tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole of it.  But it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea where to start digging. \nJaeger makes it to the bottom.  Wes yells down. \nWES You down? \nJAEGER Yeah, we're down. \nWES What do you see? \nEPPS Nothing. \nMore to himself: \n", "test2_true": "JAEGER So where do we start? \nEpps takes a look around, then shrugs. \nEPPS Wherever you want. \nEpps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack.  Jaeger follows suit.  He looks around, picks a spot and starts digging. \nFADE TO: \nWES - LATER \nHe sits up top, weapon in hand, standing guard. \nFADE TO: \nEPPS AND JAEGER - LATER \nThey dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave.  They dig with a determination to find something. \nFADE TO: \nWES - LATER \nStill up top, he's given up on standing guard.  Now he stretches out on the ground sunning himself. \nFADE TO: \nEPPS AND JAEGER \nTheir shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt. They look like they've been digging for quite some time. \nThey certainly don't have the same enthusiasm they displayed previously.  Now they just seem to dig by rote. \nFADE TO: \nWES - LATER \nThe sun has begun to sink noticeably.  Wes leans over the crevice. \nWES Hey...Hey!  Sun's going down.  Epps! Jaeger!  It's getting dark up here. \nCUT TO: \nEPPS AND JAEGER - SIMULTANEOUS \nIt's obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come up with nothing.  Epps keeps digging, but just barely. Jaeger doesn't even bother anymore.  He just sits on the ground sulking. \nWES(O.C.) Epps! \nEPPS I heard! \nCUT TO: \nWES \nHe rolls over and scoffs. \nWES There's nothing down there. \nCUT TO: \nEPPS AND JAEGER \nEpps notices Jaeger just sitting there. \nEPPS What are you doing? \nJAEGER What does it look like I'm doing? \nEPPS It looks like you're not doing anything. \nJAEGER I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here. \nEPPS Get up and dig. \nJAEGER We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it. \nEPPS Get up off your ass and dig! \nSounding defeated as all hell, and very whiney: \nJAEGER What's the point?  There's nothing here. The map's a fake.  Christ, even I see that now.  We're just wasting our time. We might as well give up and-- \nEpps spins.  Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger, grabbing him up and pulling him close. \n", "test2_id": 2959, "test3_input": "EPPS Why'd he come in our camp. \nWes asks him the question in Arabic and gets an answer.  It's enough to give Wes a bit of a laugh. \nWES Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold. \nEPPS How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it. \nWES He...he could have been watching us. \nJAEGER Maybe we should give him some water. \nWES All last night he could have been-- \nJAEGER I think he wants something to drink. \nWES I'm not wasting my water on him. \nJaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier. \nWES(CONT) I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance. \nEPPS Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out. \nJaeger and Epps start to go for their gear.  Wes is still on the Iraqi soldier. \nWES What about him?  We...we have to do something. \nEpps gives an expression that screams:  What the hell are you talking about? \nWES(CONT) We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position... \nEPPS You said he was a deserter. \nWES That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something. \nEPPS You don't know that. \nWES You don't know he isn't. \nJAEGER So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer. \nWES He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out. \nEPPS We don't leave him, we don't take him with us.  What does that leave? \nBy way of answering Wes lifts his M-16 and works the action. \nEPPS(CONT) You're out of your mind. \nWES He's an enemy soldier. \nEPPS I'm not going to let you kill him. \nWES We're at war. \nThe discussion starts to get real heated. \nEPPS We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority-- \nWES He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need. \nJaeger goes somewhere near panic. \nJAEGER We don't need to do this.  We got the gold, all right?  Let's just get out of here. \nThe Iraqi may not speak the language, but he's got a pretty good idea what they are arguing about.  He starts to plead for his life \nWES I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done. \nEPPS I've got no stomach for murder. \nWES It's a combat action. \nEPPS It's murder, and I won't be any part of it. \nWES Then step aside. \nEPPS No. \nWES Get out of my way. \nThe Iraqis begging goes into over drive.  Jaeger just about loses it. \nJAEGER For Christ's sake, we don't need this. Let's just go.  Let's just...let's just get out of here. \n", "test3_true": "WES Shut up!  Shut the hell up! \nWes moves menacingly for the Iraqi.  He thrusts his M-16 forward.  Epps grabs it, and throws a punch.  Unlike before with Jaeger, this time Wes ducks the blow and swings the butt of the M-16 back at Epps.  It's not much of a blow though, and Epps keeps on coming.  He barrels into Wes and takes him down. \nAs the two men tussle the Iraqi sees his chance to get away. He springs up, knocking Jaeger to the side, and bolts past him. \nJAGER He's getting away! \nEpps turns and sees this.  Maybe he's not for killing this guy, but he certainly can't just let him get away.  He takes off running after the Iraqi, Jaeger a step behind. \nThe Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above.  He knows if he can make it he at least has a chance of getting away.  It shows in the desperation he climbs with. \nEpps and Jaeger are right behind him.  They claw at the rocks, but can't gain ground. \nThe Iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau; to freedom. Our two soldiers scramble up right behind him. \nThe Iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau.  He's just about to pull himself up.  He's just about to get away-- \nWE HEAR A SHORT BURST OF GUNFIRE.  Three large, bloody holes mushroom open in the Iraqi's back. \nCUT TO: \nWES \nHe stands, smoke curling from the muzzle of his M-16 like a white snake, having just send the Iraqi some bullets special delivery. \nCUT TO: \nTHE IRAQI \nHe arches, stiffens, then falls like a stone past Epps and Jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes. \nAs the two climb down Wes goes to the body and stands over it like the great, white hunter standing over his kill.  All business like he says: \nWES I had to.  You saw how he ran.  Would have given us away.  I had to. \nThere's a beat of quiet, then: \nJAEGER Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him. \nWES You want to say some words? \nHe sneers down at the body. \nWES(CONT) Go to hell.  How are those words? \nWes moves off.  A beat later Jaeger walks away.  Epps just stands there looking at the body. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MESA - LATER \nWes, Epps and Jaeger are making the trek back down.  Jaeger is shouldering the pack with the gold.  Wes has got his M-16. Epps stops, and puts his pack down.  He takes out the navicom and a recon photo. \nEPPS We should head Northeast. \nJAEGER Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi. \nEPPS There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down. \nJAEGER It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against. \nEPPS You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast. \nReally calm, cold and direct Wes says: \nWES You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders. \nEPPS I out rank you, that's why. \nWES In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around. \nEpps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring Wes. \nEPPS We been down this road.

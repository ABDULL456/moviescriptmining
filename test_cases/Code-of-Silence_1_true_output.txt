Eddie gets to his feet and heads for the door. Partida hits the gavel. 
PARTIDA I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack. 
Eddie halts with his hand on the knob. 
INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Pirelli works on the answering machine, but the phone is reconnected. Diana is looking at photographs on the wall. 
DIANA You made that uniform look good. 
Pirelli looks up. 
PIRELLI That good looking gorilla next to me is Eddie's father. Better than good cop. Killed in the line of duty. (pause) Another cop shot him. An accident. 
He goes back to the machine. 
INT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY 
The Comachos come up the stairs, led by Luis. They stop at Eddie's door. They pull out their guns, and kick the door in. 
Across the hall, Pirelli's door opens, and Pirelli, holding his pistol steps into the hall. 
The Comachos turn and fire, blasting Pirelli back into his apartment. 
Through the open door we see Diana dash across the living room. 
INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Luis and his men burst in.

A Comacho takes it from her and rips it from the wall. 
Diana is caught by two Comachos. 
INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY 
Eddie is on the witness stand. 
EDDIE I can't comment on that. It was over before I got there.

EDDIE Cragie's in my unit, yes. 
PARTIDA Did you give the men their various assignments? 
EDDIE I did. 
PARTIDA Did you request that officer Cragie be on your TAC team? 
EDDIE No, I didn't. 
Partida lifts a document from the table. 
PARTIDA Sergeant... I have here a department document dated 24 September, of last year. It is a request by you, to your superiors, to have Officer Cragie transferred to another unit. Are you familiar with this document? 
EDDIE Yes. 
The room listens to every word. 
PARTIDA Why did you request his transfer?

EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER 
Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc. 
CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks. 
SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance 
CLOSE DOLLY Archie. 
ARCHIE GATES Double time. 
He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others. The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and Walter look up also. Archie does not. 
Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the choppers as they pass overhead, loud. 
PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his path, blowing up dust. 
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the blowing sand. 
10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers, followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles. 
Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively. 
M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from the Shiites. 
Troy shouts over the choppers. 
TROY Wait. 
U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border. 
The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward the border unaccompanied by American protection. 
ARCHIE GATES Let them get over the border. 
Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest. 
TROY Let them get over, wait -- 
Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back. 
TROY I have to reach this -- 
Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front -- 
ARCHIE GATES Put his cuffs in front. 
He and Doc are pulled away from Troy. 
Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them, throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is thrown to the ground and dragged. 
TROY Look what's happening. 
He collapses to one knee. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER Not our mission, Barlow. 
Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles. 
TROY Cut my cuffs -- 
Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the choppers. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER You fucked me and you're fucked now, so shut your goddamn mouth. 
Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. 
DOC He's gonna die. 
Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP holding him as he goes to General Horn. 
ARCHIE GATES Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical attention, don't let him die -- 
GENERAL HORN We are not involved in the Shiite problem, do you understand me? You are AWOL, you are a fugitive, you are under arrest. 
ARCHIE GATES Cut his cuffs. 
General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground, concerned. 
A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade, crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes. 
Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border. 
Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's body is dropped in the sand. 
ARCHIE GATES We got the gold. 
GENERAL HORN What? 
ARCHIE GATES We got the Kuwaiti bullion. 
GENERAL HORN Bullshit. 
Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down. 
ARCHIE GATES Pull that barrel. 
GENERAL HORN Pull it. 
An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold bars spill to the sand. 
The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody, watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers -- and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET. 
THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in custody -- stand and watch Archie.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 
Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He rushes over and stops them at the door. 
JANOSZ Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here. 
VENKMAN I know. 
JANOSZ Then why have you come? 
VENKMAN We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first. 
STANTZ (to Spengler and Winston) Let's sweep it, boys. 
They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices. 
VENKMAN (to Janosz) You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny? 
JANOSZ (nervous) The Upper West Side. 
SPENGLER (consulting his PKE meter) This entire room is extremely hot, Peter. 
JANOSZ What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman? 
VENKMAN We'll know when we find it.  You just sit tight.  This won't take long. 
STANTZ 
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels. 
VENKMAN This is the one that looked at Dana. 
JANOSZ It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things -- 
VENKMAN (interrupts) I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. (to Vigo) Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you. 
They watch the painting for any sign of movement. 
VIGO 
His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance. 
STANTZ AND VENKMAN 
Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo. 
VENKMAN (to Vigo) Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. (to Stantz) Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here. 
STANTZ I'll get one more reading. 
Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's. 
VIGO 
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul. 
STANTZ 
He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks the spell. 
WINSTON (looking at the painting) Now that's one ugly dude. 
STANTZ (coming back to his senses) Huh?  What? 
WINSTON You finished here? 
STANTZ (distracted) What?  Yeah. 
WINSTON Are you all right?  You coming down with something? 
STANTZ No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go. 
They head for the door. 
JANOSZ 
He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door. 
JANOSZ So you see, everything is in order, is it not?

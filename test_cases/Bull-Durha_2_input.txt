The General Manager studies the field. Hopeless. 
He looks up at the sky. Cloudless, sunny. 
KINGSTON G.M. (to his assistant) Call the radio and the paper. (with disgust) The game's been rained out. 
Organ music -- "The Blue Danube Waltz". 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE KINGSTON CIVIC ARENA -- DAY 
"HOLIDAY ON ICE" in its matinee performance. The beautiful, leggy women skating to the "Blue Danube Waltz". 
TEN OF THE DURHAM BULLS sit in the front row. Nuke, Deke, Tommy, others, but not Crash. Tony waves to a skater. 
THE SKATER WAVES BACK as she swirls past the Bulls. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE KINGSTON HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
DEKE ICES THE CHAMPAGNE -- In the b.g. Tommy is blow drying his hair. Mickey puts the finishing touches on his outfit. Several other players get ready to party. 
DEKE Par--ty! I blew a whole day's meal money for this champagne seven dollars, man, it better be good. 
MICKEY For seven bucks it better be some serious shit. 
TOMMY What time is it, eh? When are they coming? 
The guys lounge around nervously, trying to be casual. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KINGSTON HOTEL COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A STEAK DINNER set down in front of Crash. 
Nuke hands Crash a hundred dollar bill. 
NUKE This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party. 
CRASH Naw... 
NUKE "Naw"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater? 
CRASH By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies -- (beat) I'm through with one night stands. 
NUKE You're through with one night stands?! What do you want? 
CRASH I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries -- and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am. 
Nuke just stares at him. 
NUKE You're weird, man -- I want a ice skater real bad. 
CRASH Go for it. 
NUKE If I get laid, you won't tell Annie? 
CRASH I won't have to. 
NUKE LOOKS AT HIM STRANGELY -- And hurries to the party. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE PARTY ROOM -- NIGHT 
THE GUYS ARE GROOMING TO EXCESS -- Still blow drying and preening for each other. 
A knock at the door. 
THEY QUICKLY GET "CASUAL" and lounge seductively. 
DEKE It's them, it's them! Be casual. (calling out) Come in! 
THE DOOR OPENS -- It's Nuke. 
NUKE Hey, guys, pa--rty! 
TOMMY Shut up and be cool, man. Like Mickey there... 
MICKEY "LOUNGES" WITH A DRINK and a cigaret. 
MICKEY You wanta make it to the Show, Rock, you gotta learn how to "lounge". 
NUKE LEANS ON THE BAR with an elbow, striking his version of a "lounging" pose. 
NUKE How's this? 
MICKEY You got it. 
A knock at the door. 
TOMMY Entre. 
EIGHT ICE SKATERS STAND IN THE DOORWAY -- Ready to...

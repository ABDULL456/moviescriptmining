LOOSELEAF Okay. (pause) Okay. 
HAROLD You're an imbecile. 
LOOSELEAF I know you think that. 
HAROLD Everybody thinks that. 
LOOSELEAF Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb. 
HAROLD The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life! 
LOOSELEAF (shaking his head) I don't think so. (pause) It could have been. 
HAROLD If what? 
LOOSELEAF If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live." 
HAROLD They were enemies.  We were at war. 
LOOSELEAF Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb. (pause) I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one. 
HAROLD Goodbye, Looseleaf. 
LOOSELEAF walks around and gathers his things. 
LOOSELEAF So long, you guys. 
PENELOPE What will you do, Colonel? 
LOOSELEAF I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys. 
PENELOPE kisses LOOSELEAF.  Everybody but HAROLD acknowledges his departure is some way.  HAROLD turns his back.  LOOSELEAF exits, closes door.  Silence. 
SHUTTLE Who's going to fly our helicopter now? 
HAROLD (blackly, tautly) What? 
SHUTTLE We got to get another pilot. 
HAROLD For what? 
SHUTTLE For Africa. 
HAROLD Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman? 
SHUTTLE You invited me. 
HAROLD To make an ass of yourself. 
SHUTTLE What went wrong? 
HAROLD We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive. 
SHUTTLE Gee whiz-- 
HAROLD It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us. 
SHUTTLE I wouldn't drop my gun. 
HAROLD You're hollow, like a woman. 
SHUTTLE I'm smarter than Looseleaf. 
HAROLD He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one. 
SHUTTLE (close to tears) How do you know how I'd act in Africa? 
HAROLD Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!

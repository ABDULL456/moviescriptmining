JACK What? 
MILES It's private. 
JACK You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot. 
MILES Let's leave it alone. 
Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension. 
JACK You didn't get any, did you? (off Miles's silence) You're a homo. 
MILES Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up. 
JACK Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry. 
Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend. 
JACK Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's... 
MILES Shut up! Shut up, Jack! 
The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound. 
MILES Don't answer it. 
But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of Russian roulette. 
MILES I'm telling you, don't. 
Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear. 
JACK Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (mouthing) Christine. 
Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. His face is dark with resentment. 
JACK Listen, honey. Let me call you back. Miles and I are in the middle of something. No, it's nothing serious -- Miles is just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call you right back. 
Jack hangs up. 
MILES This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. (deadly serious) I want to go home. 
JACK Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me. 
MILES We gotta slow down. (closing his eyes) I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here. 
JACK I know what you need. 
INT. SEARS - DAY 
Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE ties Miles's laces. 
SALES ASSOCIATE There you go. 
Miles gets up and walks in a circle. 
MILES Do you like them? 
JACK Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty. 
MILES Are they too sporty? 
INT. MALL - DAY 
The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle. 
JACK Feel better? 
Miles shrugs. 
JACK (noticing something) Oh here, wait a second. I want to run in here real quick. 
He heads toward a TOYS STORE. 
JACK (over his shoulder) I want to get something for Siena. 
Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store. 
INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY 
Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to turn in. 
JACK How about this one? We didn't hit this one. 
MILES Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke. 
JACK You ever actually been in there, Miles? 
MILES I don't have to. 
JACK (turning the wheel) I say we check it out. You never know. 
EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY 
The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly. 
INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY 
The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo. 
In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays soothing Windham Hill-ish music.

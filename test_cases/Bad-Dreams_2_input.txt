BERRISFORD Dr. Goldman. 
Alan turns around. 
Berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some skin. Alan flies against the wall. 
The gun is knocked away. 
Alan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness, 
Cynthia is a basket case.     She looks at Alan. 
CYNTHIA No...   no... no... 
Berrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection. 
She calms herself.     She looks at him dreamily. 
191A   CYNTHIA'S POV                                                       191A She sees Harris gazing at her lovingly. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
HARRIS Only one thing matters. 
She touches his face. 
CYNTHIA Our love.     We'll be together.   All of us. 
Berrisford taken Alan's gun. 
192   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER                        192 Alan comes to. The ALARMS and BELLS are still ringing. Cynthia and Berrisford are gone. 
ALAN Shit! 
193   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                             193 The corridors are run amuck with isolation patients (the worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. Alan runs out of Cynthia's room. He is surrounded by bizarre-looking people screaming, singing, dancing, praying. 
Hettie is by the stairway helping Isolation patients exit. 
HETTIE One at a time! No pushing!      Please do not use the elevator! 
Alan is frantically looking for Cynthia and Berrisford, checking everywhere, pushing open doors. 
The security guards are at the far end of the hallway.    Alan goes to Hettie. 
ALAN Where's Berrisford? 
HETTIE This is your fault! These goddamn doors won't re-lock! 
ALAN (furious ) Where is he? He's going to kill Cynthia! Tell me where he is! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HETTIE I haven't seen him! 
The guards see Alan.      They come after him.   He runs. 
Alan scans every room. He slams into patients. The guards aren't far behind. Alan turns a corner, passing a door marked "NOT AN EXIT: ROOF ACCESS." It is ajar. He goes in without the guards seeing him. 
194   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                                 194 It is dark, but the red lights FLASH. He runs up several flights. The landings face onto the outside with a railing, open, no glass. 
He turns a corner.      Cynthia is there. 
She in perched on the outside of the railing, a serene expression on her face, the wind blowing her frail white gown. 
Alan freezes.      He moves towards her slowly, hands outstretched. 
ALAN (soothingly) Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand... 
She watches him blankly.      She turns to someone behind Alan. 
CYNTHIA It's so beautiful. 
Alan turns. There on the stair above is Berrisford, his face dancing in the flashing red light. 
ALAN (to Berrisford) You piece of shit! 
Cynthia lets go. 
Alan reaches out.

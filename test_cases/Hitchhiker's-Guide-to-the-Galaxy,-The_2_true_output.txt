ZAPHOD (CONT'D) AAAH!! 
ARTHUR What the blazes is that? 
FORD (very deliberately) I have... an idea. 
A paddle shoots up. Ford ducks. It misses. He grabs its telescopic stalk. It thrashes in his hands. He breaks it. 
FORD (CONT'D) Okay, don't think of anything.     Don't have ideas or theories -- nothing. 
A beat. They all strain to think of nothing.     Several paddles shoot up. Smacking them. 
ARTHUR I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her. 
ZAPHOD I have an idea. (SMACK!) Run! 
FORD Ever the politician. 
They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts out of the ground around them, smacking violently. 
They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building. 
ARTHUR Okay, so... (thinking) ...not thinking, not thinking, no ideas coming... (looking to Marvin) ...this is by no means an idea that has any merit, but Marvin -- can you give me a hand? SMASH CUT TO: 
71      INT. VOGON ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY                     71 
The dullest office environment ever. A counter with few VOGONS behind it, mindlessly moving bits of paper around.

The front doors BURST open. Arthur storms through them, holding Marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a gun. He trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again, trying hard to look tough. Ford and Zaphod follow, Zaphod wearing the Thinking Cap and sunglasses for disguise. Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit. 
The Vogons look up, nonplussed. 
ARTHUR Alright, where is she? 
VOGON BEHIND COUNTER Who? The Director of Robot Arm repair? Next building, out the door to the left. 
Arthur looks at the arm -- then slowly lowers it. 
ARTHUR Actually, we're looking for... (how to put this...?) ...someone you're detaining, perhaps in some form of incarceration... 
VOGON BEHIND COUNTER Prisoner Release Department. Six buildings down, out the door, right, left, then two rights. Big gray building, can't miss it.

Trillian is seated beside a desk while a VOGON OFFICER asks her questions. Kwaltz and Questular stand nearby. 
VOGON OFFICER Name? 
TRILLIAN Trillian. 
He types into his ancient looking computer. 
VOGON OFFICER Not registered. 
TRILLIAN Try Tricia McMillan. 
VOGON OFFICER Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of Blaard? 
TRILLIAN No.     Tricia Imogene McMillan of Earth. 
The Officer types, checks his screen, shakes his head. 
VOGON OFFICER Sorry.    No record of "Earth."

The Vogon Officer types, reads from the screen. 
VOGON OFFICER Right. Here it is. "Earth. Destroyed." Do you have a second home planet? 
PUSH IN ON TRILLIAN -- gutted by the news. 
TRILLIAN Destroyed? No -- that's impossible. 
VOGON OFFICER Says here it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway. The order was given...three weeks ago. 
TRILLIAN WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND GIVES AN ORDER TO DESTROY A PLANET!?

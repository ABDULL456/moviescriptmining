{"train": "EXT.  STACY'S \nRod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark woods. \nEXT.  WOODS \nRod's POV - The woods are pitch black. \nROD Stacy? \nSTACY(O.C.) (struggling, in the distance) ROD! \nEXT.  WOODS \nThe killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the killer. \nINT.  CAR \nRod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment. \nEXT.  WOODS \nRod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods. \nRod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy. \nEXT.  WOODS \nStacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against a tree trunk. \nEXT.  WOODS \nRod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness. \nEXT.  WOODS \nThe huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of Stacy's outstretched palm. \nThe hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail. \nEXT. WOODS \nRod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing battle. \nROD Stacy?! \nEXT.  WOODS \nThe hammer descends on the nail. \nStacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to the tree. \nEXT.  WOODS \nRod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound. \nStacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree. \nAnother nail is readied. \nStacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock. \nRod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample fallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her. \nStacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each tree. She almost looks crucified. \nRod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's terrified eyes. She's looking behind him. \nRod quickly turns around but he's too late. \nA knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest. \nStacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping her palms on the nails. \nRod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth. \nStacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified. \nThe killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach. \nStacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned. \nA small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like it's an ordinary pencil. \nStacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never experienced such pain. \nBlood drips to the ground. \nJODY Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends! \nBRENT They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight. \nHe leaves. Jody is furious. She lies down on the bed to stew. She might at well have stayed out. The phone in the hallway rings. She leaps up. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nJody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before picking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny. \nJODY Hello. (beat) One second. (to her dad) Hey Adolph, it's the station! \nBrent comes out and picks up the phone as Jody heads back to her room, disappointed. \nINT.  BEDROOM \nJody flops on the bed. \nBRENT(O.C.) Hello. (beat) What? \nINT.  HALLWAY \nBrent it shocked. \nBRENT Where? \nMARGE MARKEN, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something terrible has happened. Marge is a couple of years older than Brent. She's a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a bottle of Peachtree Schnapps. \nBRENT(CONT'D) I'm on my way. \nINT.  JODY'S \nJody sits up on her bed, also sensing something big has happened. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nBrent buttons up his shirt. \nMARGE What happened? \nBRENT Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me. \nBrent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs. \nJody appears. She and her mom share a concerned glance. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STACY'S HOUSE \nBrent pulls up. A lot of official cars are already there. \nEXT. WOODS \nA trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene. \nEXT.  WOODS \nThe murder sit. Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree. Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood. \nBrent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight. His deputy, JACK WEBBER, sidles up next to him. \nDEPUTY Her parents reported her missing about an hour ago. \nA flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene. Brent pulls out his flashlight to better survey the carnage. \nHe starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy, looking at one nailed hand, then the other. \nBRENT What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'? \nDEPUTY The same type that decides to carve into her stomach. \nBrent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into her flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'. \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE \nHigh school kids are getting ready for school. \nBody parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare teenage legs. \nShirts and bras cover bare teenage chests. \nZippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned. \nThe school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking. \nJODY I will. Is that all? \nTOM Could you tell Mr. Marliston we'd like to see him. \nJODY SURE. \nShe leaves. \nBRENT Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston? \nTOM The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that? \nBRENT She's my daughter, Tom. \nTOM So? \nBRENT So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex. \nTOM Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows? \nBrent gives Tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look. \nLEONARD You rang? \nTOM Come in Leonard. Have you met Brent Marken? \nLEONARD No but I've always wanted to. \nHe shakes his hand firmly. \nBRENT Nice to meet you too. My daughter speaks highly of you. \nLeonard examines Brent's face carefully. Brent is a little taken aback by his intensity. \nLEONARD We have the same color eyes. \nBRENT I guess we do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAFTERIA \nMARK SHALE, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. The place is a zoo. CINDY, a cute, mini-skirted brunette, and BEN,  a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk- rocker, are sitting with him. \nJody is standing at the door with her best friend SANDY, looking for a place to sit. Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. She is wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. Although she looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a  bit in self-confidence when it comes to boys. Sandy is staring at Mark. \nJODY Go sit next to him. \nSANDY Who? \nJODY Mark Shale. \nSANDY Why? \nJODY Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday. \nSANDY I don't watch him eat everyday. \nJODY You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents. \nJody imitates Sandy. \nSANDY The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too. \nJODY You eventually have to talk to him. \nSANDY Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years. \nCindy sees Jody approaching and motions her over. \nCINDY Jody! \nJody starts toward her table. \nSANDY No! That's his table. \nJODY You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now. \nThe other three kids look up as Jody sits don. \nSandy has no choice but to sit down next to Mark. She immediately freezes up. \nCINDY Did your dad question you this morning? \nJODY Just a little. \nBEN Did he ask you if Stacy and Rod has ever exchanged bodily fluids? \nJody stops, noticing something. \nEXT.  PARKING LOT \nJody's POV - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon. \nSandy sees how upset Jody is. \nSANDY He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him. \nJODY Does she fuck? \nSANDY (trying to comfort) I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET \nJody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy. \nJODY (frustrated) Mr. Jenkins called on me in class today. It was so embarrassing. I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking about Kenny for over twenty minutes. When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic. I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me. \nSTACY What did you say? \nJODY That I was sorry. I'd drifted off. That I'd been thinking about Stacy and Rod. \nSANDY Oh nice save. \nJODY I was desperate. It was gross. \nSANDY Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you. \nJODY He says he loves me. \nSANDY Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me. \nJODY (musing) Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out. \nSANDY No! \nJODY You're the one always saying 'Just do it'. \nSANDY That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend. \nJody laughs. \nJODY I don't know what I'm so scared of. \nSANDY Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . . \nJODY How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you. \nSANDY I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference. \nJody laughs. \nJODY I promised I'd go right home after school. \nSANDY OK. increase the peace. \nSandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house. Jody jumps on her bike and pedals off down the street. \nDissolve to: \nEXT. CHERRY FALLS - NIGHT \nNight has set again on the town. An OWL HOOTS. THE STREETS ARE QUIET. \nEXT.  STREET \nThe killer's car, the black IMPERIAL, lurks in the shadows of a suburban street. The killer is staking out a specific house. \nEXT.  ANNETTE'S HOUSE \nAnnette, the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front door. Her MOTHER and FATHER are going out. \nThey kiss ANNETTE goodbye, get in their car and drive away. Annette heads back inside and double locks the door. \nEXT.

HOUSE \nAnnette's parents pull into the driveway: \nThey are still giggling. It's been a great night. They are sauced. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nAnnette's parents come inside. \nMOTHER Annette. We're home. \nShe notices a red spot on the carpet and leans over to inspect it. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nAnnette's mom starts down the hallway, noticing the trail of blood leading to Annette's door, realizing something is wrong. \nMOTHER (concerned) Annette? \nShe tugs at Annette's door. \nINT.  BEDROOM \nThe door is still barricaded. \nEXT.  CORRIDOR \nHer mother frantically tugs at the door. Her dad appears. \nMOTHER Annette!! \nHer dad lifts his foot and starts kicking at the door. \nIt begins to splinter. \nINT.  BEDROOM \nThey break through. Annette's dad pushes the dresser out of the way and they barge in. \nThe room seems to be empty except the window has been broken and blood's splattered around it. \nMOTHER Annette? \nShe notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping oddly, caught on something. \nShe walks over, frightened, gathers her nerve, then pulls the shade up. \nAnnette has been nailed to the outside of the house, her dead eyes looking in. \n'VIRGIN' is carved deeply in her forehead. \nHer mother screams. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSE \nCOP Cars are everywhere. \nINT.  BEDROOM \nBrent is staring at the word 'VIRGIN', carved into Annette's forehead. He's really worried, He's figured out that his town is under siege. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nBRENT No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep. \nEXT.  CHERRY FALLS \nIt's a new day. As the kids arrive at school, rumors are flying. Everyone is a little more on edge. The same tribes exist but kids are starting to glance and listen to kids from other tribes. The social structure is starting to fray. \nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE \nBrent is upset, confused. \nBRENT If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today. \nTOM Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about? \nBRENT is there anything you do? \nTOM Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday. \nBRENT I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m. \nTOM You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands. \nBRENT Better than a pile of dead teenagers. \nEXT.  TOWN HALL \nThe town bell rings in the steeple. It's eight o'clock. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET \nThe shops close down. All the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall. \nEXT.  SCHOOL \nThe parents arrive. They are all concerned. They've all heard rumors by now. They hurry into the school, whispering to one another. \nINT.  AUDITORIUM \nThe parents are seated, whispering, buzzing. Brent walks up to the podium. He's very nervous as he looks out at the crowd, realizing he's going to really, really upset them. He takes a deep breath. \nBRENT I think you all know why I CALLED THIS Town meeting. In the last two days, three of our children have been murdered and it appears that we have now established a common link between the killings. \nThe crowd grows still. Everyone is interested in this information. Brent pauses. \nFATHER 1 Well, what is it? \nBRENT All three of the victims attended our public high school and all three were or appear to have been...um...virgins. \nThere is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium. \nMOTHER 1 So? \nMOTHER 2 (very concerned) You're almost positive that's who this monster is targeting? \nMOTHER 1 Virgins? \nBRENT We found the word 'virgin' written at both crime scenes. \nFATHER 1 Why didn't you tell us this yesterday? \nBRENT We didn't think this was a serial killer. We thought it was an isolated incident. \nThis is all very upsetting to everyone. \nMOTHER 3 Are you close to an arrest? \nBRENT I can't say we are. \nFATHER 2 What are we supposed to do? \nBRENT What do you mean? \nMOTHER 2 What are we supposed to tell our kids? \nFATHER 2 To go out and get laid if they wanna feel safe? \nBRENT I think that's' up to each and everyone of you. \nFATHER 3 I can't lock my daughter in the basement. \nFATHER 2 I wouldn't worry about it Victor. \nA few other parents laugh. \nFATHER 3 What's that supposed to mean? \nFATHER 2 Nothing. \nJODY Yes? \nKILLER(O.C.) Are you Jody? \nOnce again, a woman's voice. \nJODY Yeah. \nKILLER(O.C.) I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa. \nJODY Kenny's aunt? \nKILLER(O.C.) Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you. \nJody senses something is off. \nJODY On what side of the family? \nKILLER(O.C.) His mother's side. \nJODY His mother's an only child. \nJody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is too fast, sliding a hand and foot in, pushing her way into the house. \nJody fights to push the door shut but she can't. The killer is stronger. The killer's hand gropes for the lock latch. \nJody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric screwdriver sitting in the back pantry. She grabs for the screwdriver with one hand as the killer pushes harder. \nJody drills the killer's elbow. \nThe killer screams and lets go. Jody slams the door shut, double locking it. \nINT.  FRONT HALLWAY \nJody runs to the front hall and double locks the front door. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nJody picks up a phone but it's dead downstairs too. She looks around. \nEXT.

FRONT HALL CLOSET \nJody grabs a baseball bat from the front hall closet. The killer's shadow appears outside. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nJody runs into the kitchen, grabs a knife. The window above her breaks. The killer is right outside. \nINT.  DINING ROOM \nJody runs into the dining room, not sure where to go. Suddenly the window breaks there. The killer is stalking her from the outside. \nINT.  HOUSE - MONTAGE \nTHE HOUSE is under siege and Jody is trapped in it. She runs from room to room, turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes. It's terrifying. \nINT.  FOYER \nSuddenly there is a silence. Jody stops running. She realizes that the killer must be climbing in somewhere. Jody isn't sure what to do. \nShe hears something in the family room. \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM \nJody enters. She sees the killer's shadow cross the window. She runs out. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nJody creeps through the dark house, unsure where to go. \nINT.  DEN \nJody creeps back into the den. The killer doesn't seem to be there either. \nThe window is broken. The curtains flap in the breeze. She moves toward it, wondering whether it's safe to climb out. She looks in the mirror. \nIn the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the drapes. The killer's in the room. The drapes start to move. \nJody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the head, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down. \nINT.  HOUSE \nJody tears for the front door. \nJODY Who is she Daddy? \nBRENT Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today. \nHe picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office. Jody watches through his window, sensing he's very, very upset. \nINT.  OFFICE \nBrent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number. \nINT.  MAIN ROOM \nJody has never seen her dad like this. She quietly picks up the phone and listens in. \nHer dad is talking to the principal, Tom Sisler. \nBRENT IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen. \nTOM (on phone) That's impossible. \nBRENT (growing frantic) I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling... \nTOM Calm down Brent. \nINT.  OFFICE \nBrent looks out and sees that JODY is on the phone, eavesdropping. \nBRENT I'll call you right back. \nINT.  MAIN ROOM \nJody, busted, hangs up. \nBrent comes storming out. HER FATHER is livid. SHE'S NEVER SEEN HIM SO ANGRY AND UPTIGHT. \nBRENT You were eavesdropping. \nJODY (a little scared) No I wasn't. \nBRENT What did you hear? \nJODY Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye. \nBRENT Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school. \nShe nods and heads out, freaked. Her father's never treated her this harshly before. \nEXT.  HIGH SCHOOL \nAs Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more feet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's just a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes. \nJody heads toward the main school entrance. She starts noticing a lot of kids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex. Something's up. \nINT.  HIGH SCHOOL \nJody opens her locker. Sandy comes running up to her, very excited. \nSANDY You ok? \nJODY (noticing Sandy's attire) FINE. Are you? \nSANDY Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what? \nJODY What? \nSANDY (whispering) Mark invited me to the party. \nJODY What party? \nSANDY Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard? \nJODY No. \nSandy notices that a teacher is nearby. Sandy pulls Jody into a stairwell. \nINT.  STAIRWELL \nJody is now really intrigued. \nSANDY (whispering) You can't tell your parents. \nJODY Ok. \nSANDY Especially not your dad. \nJODY I won't. \nThey notice a group of kids huddled around a car. \nHOMELY GIRL 1 What's that? \nThey walk up. \n'VIRGIN' has been written in blood on one of the windshields.  A mutilated boy looks out of the driver's window of the car.  The girl's faces go white. IT'S ANOTHER BODY! \nMore and more kids gather around the murder site. The kids are all freaked, giving each other the eye. No one wants to be next. \nAll of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the kids out. The dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids and teachers run over. Everyone heard the scream. \nHomely girl 2 whispers to her friend. \nHOMELY GIRL 2 (whispering) Ok. Pick me up at seven. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nChaos has taken over the school. Hardly anyone is still going to classes. \nKenny is standing in the hallway, looking for Jody. He knows her class schedule and that she'll be passing by. \nJody appears from her classroom. She starts toward Kenny, at first not noticing him. \nJody looks up and she sees him. She stops. She knows what he's there to talk to her about. He runs over to her. \nKENNY (very concerned) Are you O.K.? \nJODY I'm fine. \nKENNY I heard you got attacked. \nJODY I did. \nKENNY I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash? \nJODY Yeah. I think it's really sick. \nKENNY Why? \nJODY Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party. \nKENNY Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me. \nJODY Did Sharon say no? \nKENNY You know I want to go with you. \nJODY I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded. \nKENNY Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose. \nJODY No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me. \nHe grabs her passionately. \nKENNY If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it. \nJODY I'm not using him as an excuse. \nOF COURSE SHE IS. \nKENNY Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him. \nJODY I do not. \nKENNY I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together. \nJODY I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom. \nKENNY They're not picking me up until six. \nJODY I'll think about it. \nKENNY Yes! \nHe kisses her full throttle. She's into it. She smiles at him as he darts off. She's happy but scared. She's got her guy back, at least for the moment. \nINT.  SCHOOL \nThe clock strikes three. The bell rings. \nEXT.  SCHOOL \nKids charge out, ready for a memorable evening. \nINT.  JODY'S HOUSE \nBRENT No. I'll handle this. \nINT. STATION \nBrent and the deputy head into the main station area. Brent grabs his gun. The DESK SERGEANT is on the phone. \nDESK SERGEANT Sir, we're getting calls from other towns. Boys throughout the country have heard about what's going on here and they're heading our way, apparently, looking for girls. \nBRENT Put a squad car at every entrance to town. \nThe desk sergeant picks up another call. \nSERGEANT Your wife's on line three. \nBRENT I can't talk to her now. \nSERGEANT There's a problem with Jody. \nBRENT Tell her she has to handle it. \nHe heads outside. \nEXT.  POLICE STATION \nThe deputy walks Brent to his car. \nDEPUTY As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight. \nBRENT No? \nDEPUTY Should we close down any eruption? \nBRENT Are you sure? \nDEPUTY We're seeing all the signs in town. \nBRENT I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours. \nHe jumps in his car and speeds away. \nEXT.  LIBRARY \nThe gray old ivy-covered town library. Jody rides up and heads inside. \nINT.  LIBRARY \nJody enters the vast library. It's empty. Almost spooky. A seventy year old lady, MISS DUNLOP is behind the desk, robotically stamping the back flaps of books. \nMISS DUNLOP Hi Jody. What can I DO for you? \nJODY Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers? \nMISS DUNLOP They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for? \nJODY Twenty eight years ago. \nMISS DUNLOP Follow me. \nINT.  LIBRARY - UPSTAIRS \nThey head up the stairs and into the microfilm room. \nJODY This place is empty. \nMISS DUNLOP Everyone's getting ready for the party. \nJODY You heard about that? \nMISS DUNLOP Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day. \nJODY Don't you think it's sick? \nMISS DUNLOP Not at all. In fact, I thought about going. \nJODY You Miss Dunlop? \nShe hands Jody the microfiche. \nMISS DUNLOP Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old? \nJODY (lying) No. \nMISS DUNLOP You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different. \nSHE SLOWLY HEADS DOWN THE STAIRS. \ncut to: \nJODY And the police did nothing? \nMARGE EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. \nJODY How could you? \nMARGE I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town. \nJODY The word is Mob. \nMARGE I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd. \nJODY Who were they? \nMarge freezes. She didn't want to be asked that. \nMARGE Who? \nJODY The men. Do any of them still live around here? \nMARGE Two men left town right after it happened. \nJODY You're not telling me something. \nMarge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say. \nMARGE Mr. Sisler was one of them. \nJODY (shocked) The principal? \nMARGE Yes. \nJODY Who was the fourth? \nMarge is stricken. She looks down. \nMARGE God. It's like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground. \nJody gets it. \nJODY Dad? \nHer mother can't deny it any longer. \nJODY(CONT'D) (horrified) THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them. \nMARGE Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have... \nJODY NO! \nJody gets up. MARGE He dedicated his life to law enforcement after... \nJody runs off, very upset. \nEXT.  LIBRARY \nJody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off. \nEXT.

INDIANA DIRT ROAD \nThe rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman' Brent's police car turns into the driveway. \nINT.  CAR \nBrent pulls up to the house. he sits and stares for a moment. \nEXT.  LISA SHERMAN'S HOUSE \nIt's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign stands crookedly in the front yard. \nBrent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty tools and old auto parts. \nEXT.  FRONT DOOR \nBrent lifts his hand and is about to knock. He can't. He walks around in a circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after all these years. He draws the gun from his holster and knocks. \nNo one answers. \nHe knocks again. \nNo one answers, again. \nA WOMAN, THE CARETAKER, appears from the side of the house. \nCARETAKER People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement. \nThe woman flips on the basement light. There are several locks on the door. Brent is very scared of what he's going to find down there. \nINT.  BASEMENT \nBrent steps down into the basement. \nIt is a combination prison/bedroom. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. Water drips for the ceiling. Rat traps are everywhere. Old broken child's TOYS are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which are bolted into the wall above a cot. The cot is small, the mattress rotted. Old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall. \nHuge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner. \nBrent walks over to the dresser and looks in it. He pulls out a pair of grown man's trousers. He examines them. \nCARETAKER They look like they'd fit you. Three bucks. \nBrent things for a moment then throws the pants down. He darts back up the stairs. The caretaker laughs. \nINT.  KENNY'S \nJody and Kenny are in Kenny's bedroom, sitting on his bed. \nKENNY All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid. \nJODY (all wound up) My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist. \nKENNY (compassionately) I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends. \nJODY I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit. \nKENNY But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody. \nJODY So I should feel happy that he got away with it? \nKENNY I don't know. I kind of am. \nJody, still crying, stares at Kenny for a second then leans in and kisses him with everything she's got, Ready for action. \nKENNY Are you coming to the party? \nJODY Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now. \nJody quickly takes her own shirt off, rips off his, and pounces on him. He's taken aback by her sudden aggressiveness. He has no idea how to respond to it. \nINT.  TOWN HALL \nBrent comes storming out of the hall of records. \nINT.  PHONE BOOTH \nFrantic dialing. Brent is on the phone. \nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE \nThe phone rings. The answering machine picks up. \nBRENT (leaving a message) Tom? Lisa Sherman is dead. But you'll never believe what I found out. Meet me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a half hour. We need to talk in private. \nAs Brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principal's desk, first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the killer's hand, holding the razor. The killer has been listening to the message. \nTom, the principal, is sitting in the corner in  a large puddle of his own blood, tied to the radiator. He's barely alive. His tongue has been cut out, his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth. One eye is missing, the other one has been left in only so that Tom can look into the killer's face as he's tortured. \nThe razor blade is lifted off the table. \nTom braces himself, gripping his hands, preparing for more pain. \nThe camera moves back to the phone as we hear Tom gag and then the killer walking out of the room. \nINT.  KENNY'S \nJody is all over Kenny. He's really weirded out by her aggressiveness. She reaches for his crotch and finds that he's soft. She rolls over, embarrassed. \nJODY (worried) What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong? \nKENNY Just making me feel like a piece of meat. \nJODY I'm making you feel like meat? \nKENNY Yeah. \nJody rolls over, a bit pissed off and very confused. \nJODY You break up with me because I won't fuck you. \nKENNY That's not why we broke up. \nJODY You flaunt some slut in my face. \nANDY Just think of it like she's having a flu shot.

There's a big sign that says \"Couples only\". Lots of hooking up is taking place on the front lawn. \nEXT.  NEIGHBOR'S YARD \nTwo computer nerds are hidden behind a tree, watching the other kids arrive. They spot the two homely girls we saw earlier. \nNERD 1 There's Jan and Heather.

Nerd 1 follows, pissed off. They walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact. After several uncomfortable moments, someone shouts for an upper window. \nGIRL IN WINDOW Marisa! Find someone fast. Floor space is almost gone. \nThis only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside. One of the homely girls looks at the laptop. \nNERD 2 Ever play QUAKE? \nHOMELY GIRL 2 What's that? \nNERD 2 A computer game. \nThe four just gravitate toward each other, now 'coupled'. They enter the house next to each other, all four terrified, none even acknowledging yet that they're all in danger. \nINT.  CAR \nBen and Cindy arrive. \nCINDY (finalizing) I get all your CDs. \nBEN Not my imports. \nCINDY Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard. \nINT.

You're not scared? \nJODY Of course I'm scared. \nLEONARD Then you should go. \nJODY You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston? \nLEONARD I really do. For your own safety. \nJody doesn't know what to make of this. It's not what she expected to hear from her teacher. \nLeonard goes into the kitchen. Jody sits on the couch and looks around. She's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. It's certainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. It has all sorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. Years of Cherry Falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles. \nHe reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. He hands her a beer. \nJODY I just feel so manipulated. By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend, and now some psychopath I don't even know. \nSHE TAKES THE BEER, surprised he's giving her alcohol. He kneels down in front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg. \nLEONARD We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born. \nJODY Really? \nLEONARD Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting. \nJody is beginning to feel strange. There's something off kilter about this whole encounter. \nJODY Me? Why me? \nLEONARD Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you. \nHe starts putting a disinfectant on her wound. \nJODY What do you know about my father? \nLEONARD He's a rapist. Like mine. \nShe grimaces. The disinfectant hurts. \nJODY (a little scared)_ Your father raped someone? \nLEONARD Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is? \nJODY Yes. \nLEONARD I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one. \nJODY You're the killed. \nLEONARD Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded. \nJody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's not letting her get away. \nJody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it. \nLeonard grabs her and throws her across the room. \nJody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a book case over on him, narrowly escaping. \nShe runs for the back door. \nINT.  BACK DOOR \nJody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, pulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her sprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, breaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and carries her to the basement stairs. \nINT.  BASEMENT STAIRS \nLeonard throws Jody down into the dark basement. She tumbles down the stairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor. \nHe comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PARTY HOUSE \nThe CD is now skipping. Kids are in every corner, bed , and closet, making out. Every square inch of the house is being taken as the party shifts into higher gear. It's a sea of sheets and blankets rippling with bodies under them. Giggles and moans are heard every second. \nINT.  A CLOSET \nSandy and Mark are gently kissing in the closet, still standing up. Mark studies Sandy's face for a second, then slowly lifts her dress, sliding his hand on to her thighs. \nMARK You're so beautiful. \nKENNY Climb on. \nINT.  BACK PANTRY \nLeonard breaks through the door. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nLeonard runs into the kitchen and looks out the window. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nKenny and Jody are peddling away down the driveway. \nEXT.  BACK DOOR \nLeonard bursts out of the house and jumps into his car. \nINT.  CAR \nLeonard starts the car. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nThe car squeals out of the driveway, rims sparking wildly. \nEXT.  SUBURBAN STREET \nKenny frantically pedals the bike up the pristine suburban street. Jody hangs on for dear life. \nJODY Go to the police station! \nKENNY Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away. \nLeonard's car squeals around the corner behind them. \nJODY Fuck! It's him. \nINT.  CAR \nLeonard steps on the gas. \nEXT.  STREET \nKenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that doesn't stop Leonard. He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind Kenny, ready to run him over. \nKenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up everywhere. \nKenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street. He heads onto the other sidewalk. LEONARD remains in pursuit, knocking into several cars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way. \nLeonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street, destroying it. \nLeonard pulls up right behind them.

FRONT OF HOUSE \nLeonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the German Shepard comes charging out the open fence.  Leonard screams. The dog pounces on him, starts humping his leg. Leonard rolls his eyes. The dog thrusts away. \nCLOSE ON THE RAZOR. Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his eyes. He pushes the dog off of him.  It lets out a panted growl, almost like it's saying 'going so soon lover boy?' Leonard hops back in his car, speeds off down the street. The dog barks wildly up at the night sky. Talk about being left with a hard-on. \nEXT.  PARTY HOUSE \nKenny and Jody limp toward the front door. \nINT.  PARTY HOUSE \nKenny and Jody limp through the front door. Couples are everywhere. There's no room to even walk. \nThe party has reached it's 'climax'. \nWe see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. They run the gamut of emotions. Some are terrified, some are ecstatic. Some are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are closing their eyes, trying to fade out. \nWe see Sandy, Mark, Cindy, and Ben all having a blast. Sharon has managed to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls. It's orgiastic. \nKenny and Jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of bodies looking for a place to hide. \nKENNY GRABS  a sheet off the ground and carries Jody up the stairs. \nINT.  MASTER BEDROOM \nKenny carries Jody into the huge bedroom. \nA couple of kids look up as the door opens. There must be over a 100 teenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets. The room is just a sea of kids humping two deep, under blankets. \nKID ON FLOOR There's no room in here. \nANOTHER KID Yeah. Get lost we're packed. \nKenny pays no attention to them. He shoves his way into a corner,  pissing off everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages. He puts Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt. \nJODY (whispering) What are you doing? \nKENNY Pretend we're just another couple. \nHe pulls her under the sheet. \nINT.  PARTY - DOWNSTAIRS \nLeonard comes in the front door, his razor in hand, the policeman's blood still dripping from it. He looks around, wondering if they're here. \nNo one seems to notice Leonard as he hunts for Jody and Kenny, walking through the sea of bodies, dripping blood on the backs of a couple of kids. A serial killer at a fuckfest.  Leonard smiles at the sight of all the teenagers copulating. \nINT.  MASTER BEDROOM \nKenny and Jody curl up next to each other. Kenny kisses her. She kisses him back. \nThey're into each other. They can't keep their hands off each other. They start to really make out. \nINT.   PARTY DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM \nLeonard moves into one of the bedrooms. He switches the lights on. \nThe kids look up pissed off. There's not an inch of floor space. \nBOY Hey! Turn that off. \nGIRL Mr. Marliston?! \nLEONARD Hi Samantha. Excuse me. \nHe steps over a thrusting hairy ass, surveys the room.  No Kenny. No Jody. \nGIRL (freaked) What are you doing here?! \nThe girl breaks into orgasm before she can barely finish the sentence. Leonard flips the lights off and heads out of the room. Through out the entire proceedings, everyone was fucking like no one entered the room. Homeostasis remains stable. \nINT.  PARTY STAIRCASE \nLeonard heads up the stairs, still looking for Kenny and Jody. A couple of kids on the staircase notice him. He almost trips on one.

Leonard appears in the doorway. \nKENNY (whispering) It's him. \nLeonard accidentally steps on a boy's hand as he enters the room. The boy, JIMMY, is pissed off.  He looks up and realizes who it is. \nLEONARD Pay no attention to me. \nJIMMY What are you doing here? \nLeonard is just a few feet from Jody's leg. \nJody and Kenny push closer to the door. \nLeonard reaches for Jody's leg. He can't quite grab it. \nKenny and Jody reach the door. They're almost out. Leonard lungs and grabs Jody's leg. \nJody screams out in pain, falls into the crowd. \nJODY Kenny! \nKenny tries to grab for her but he can't reach her. The force of the mob pushes him out the door, through the vortex. \nINT.  UPSTAIRS \nKids jam the staircase. There's too many trying to get down at once. Everyone's still pushing. The kids on the staircase can't keep their position and start falling forward, pushing harder. \nINT.  BEDROOM \nLeonard keeps hold of Jody's leg and pulls her toward him. \nEXT.  BALCONEY \nKenny tries to get back to Jody but there's no way he can make headway back into that room. \nKENNY Jody?! \nThe staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle. \nThe banister breaks. Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, onto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones. \nINT.   DOWNSTAIRS \nLamps smash to the ground. Tables are trampled. Basically, the entire inside of the house is destroyed in the stampede which puts something out of fucking JUMANJI to shame. \nINT.   BEDROOM \nLeonard gets hold of Jody's waist and pulls her towards him, razor ready. \nINT.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR \nEveryone gives one final push out. Kenny is swept on to the staircase. It can't take the pressure and finally cracks. \nKids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the staircase splinters. Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed over the edge. It's a disaster. Broken boned teenagers litter the floor like it were a battlefield. \nKenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him. \nThe whole house begins to buckle. \nINT.   BEDROOM \nThe room empties as the kids push out. Leonard pulls Jody up next to him and puts the razor to her neck. He draws the first spot of blood. \nJODY Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you? \nLEONARD You think you're my sister? \nINT.   STAIRCASE \nKenny manages to pull himself back up to the second floor. \nINT.   BEDROOM \nJody turns to look at LEONARD as Kenny appears in the doorway. \nJODY We have the same color eyes. \nHe looks into her eyes. \nLEONARD You're right. We do. \nLeonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just the break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him over. They struggle for the razor but Leonard overpowers him and grabs it, cutting his own hand. He turns and slices Kenny down the side, cutting him deep. \nKenny fights off the pain and leaps on Leonard's back, grabbing his arm around the neck. \nLeonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock Kenny off his back, smashing him into walls. \nKenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at Leonard's face and throat. \nLeonard spins faster. \nJODY struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood. Kenny's grips start to slip as Leonard reaches back, to slice him across the face and neck. \nLEONARD, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo. He screams, loses his grip on Kenny, goes crashing out the second story window. \nEXT.

POLICE STATION \nJody is sitting in the police station working with a SKETCH ARTIST. \nJODY A little larger nose. \nThe artist makes a change. \nARTIST How's that? \nJody re-examines the picture. She's spooked. \nJODY That's her. \nThe artist picks up the phone and dials. \nARTIST Brent, we got a sketch. \nBrent comes into the room and picks up the sketch, \nFOR THE FIRST TIME we see a picture of the killer. She looks about eighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave. She looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties. \nBrent's face goes white when he sees who it is. \nJody notices this. \nJODY You know her? \nBRENT It can't be. \n", "test2_id": 3013, "test3_input": "The door at the top of the stairs opens. \nLeonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket. He throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on. \nThe basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his mother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa Sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks. \nLeonard sits Jody back up. \nA little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard. \nLeonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody. He starts singing SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. \nLEONARD (singing) 'It's a family affair, It's a family affair.' \nHe undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of Jody's dad. Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth. He's badly beaten up. \nJody gags on her gag. Her dad looks her in the eye. \nLEONARD Well, we may be family One in four chance. \nLeonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody. \nLEONARD Sheriff Brent, you will be the second of the four horsemen of the apocalypse to die. But first you will watch as I slice up your little girl. \nBrent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in front of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, nubile leg. The 'V' is still fresh in her calf. \nLeonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it. \nJody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to shake. \nLEONARD You're shaking too much. If you don't stop shaking Jody, I'll have to kill before I carve. We wouldn't want that. \nJody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch. It's tough. Her father watches, horrified. \nCut to: \nEXT.  STREET \nKenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch his breath for a second. He notices something. \nEXT.  LEONARD'S \nJody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch. \nEXT.  STREET \nKenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle. It's hers. \nINT.  BASEMENT \nLeonard continues to work on Jody's bare leg, starting the 'R'. Jody and her father stare at each other, helplessly. \nLEONARD My mother said, after you and your three droogs raped her Brent, that people in town refused to let her use their bathrooms. Is that true? Did people really call her a slut and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, she saw only you. \nJody gags in pain. Brent looks away. \nLEONARD Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or will I cause her much more pain. \nBrent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, barely able to stand it anymore. The doorbell rings. Leonard looks up, concerned. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nKenny rings it again. No one answers. \nHe walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the curtains. \nINT.  HOUSE \nKenny's POV - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nKenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one answers.  Worried, he pops the screen. It's breaking and entering time. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nKenny climbs into the living room and looks around. \nKENNY Hello? Jody? \nINT.   BASEMENT \nLeonard hears Kenny. He can't ignore him any longer. \nLEONARD Who the fuck is breaking into my house? \nLeonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the stairs. As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass. \n", "test3_true": "Leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room. \nINT.    LIVING ROOM \nLeonard sees Kenny opening Jody's purse, checking it out. \nLeonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back. \nLEONARD My wallet's on the mantle when you've finished your rifling, Kenny. \nKenny looks up, startled. \nKENNY (nervously) Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What's Jody's bike doing on your front porch? \nLEONARD That all depends Kenny. Depends on why the FUCK you've broken into your history teacher's house? \nKENNY Alright, Marliston, I know she's here. \nLEONARD What are you talking about? No one here but us chickens. \nINT.  BASEMENT \nJody cuts through her dad's ropes. Her dad immediately takes Jody's gag off. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nKenny heads out the door. \nJODY(O.C.) Help! \nKenny hears the cry and turns around. \nKENNY That was Jody! \nLeonard says nothing. He just stares at Kenny. \nJODY(O.C.) Somebody help! \nKenny heads toward the basement door to investigate. Brent starts kicking on the other side of the locked door. \nKENNY Jody?! \nLeonard moves towards Kenny with the razor. Kenny turns just in time.  He grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle. \nThe door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open from the other side. \nLeonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the head. Kenny falls to the ground. \nThe door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard screams, and lunges at Brent. \nBrent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard down the basement stairs. \nLeonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the bottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent smashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He raises the razor and slits Brent across the face. \nBRENT Jody run! \nJody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg. \nInstinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody. Leonard slashes Brent across the face again. \nJODY No! \nBRENT (dying) Run! \nJody crawls to the top of the stairs.  Leonard does everything he can to get away from Brent but Brent hangs on.  Jody watches, horrified, at the top of the stair. Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody away from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body open. Brent rolls over, a bloody mess. \nINT.  TOP OF STAIRS \nKenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs. Kenny holds the door shut with all his might. \nJODY My dad's down there! \nKENNY He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here! \nKenny pushes a dresser in front of it, trapping Leonard. \nJODY I can't walk. I think he cut right through a tendon. \nLeonard starts chopping through the door with an axe. \nKenny helps Jody out the front door. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nJody and Kenny limp out of the house. Kenny grabs Jody's bike. \n", "test3_id": 3014}

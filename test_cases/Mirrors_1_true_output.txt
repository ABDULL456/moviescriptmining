Seen through the mirrored surfaces, everything in the city seems to move in a distorted way. Ominous. 
The softness of the sun's rising light is contrasted with the eerie, haunting music.

"A WEEK BEFORE" 
Bip. Bip. Bip... 
It's 8 a.m. The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment. 
The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the living room. 
Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the couch. He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the bathroom.

Like a thick fog, the steam from the shower fills the bathroom. The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist on the mirror above the sink, revealing- 
The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the hardships of life. A life, that from the lines on his face, we suspect hasn't been easy. On his chest and shoulder, SEVERAL BULLET SCARS. 
Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old stubble.

Ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened bedroom door. 
Inside, ANGELA is asleep in the bed. She is younger than Ben. 
ANGELA awakens slowly- 
ANGELA What time is it? 
BEN Almost 8:30... Coffee?

ANGELA No, you're going to be late. 
BEN Go back to sleep... I'll call you, OK? 
ANGELA Yeah, I won't be working until later tonight. 
He comes to kiss her on the forehead. She opens a sleepy eye and smiles. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) You shaved? 
She strokes his face gently. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) I like it. It makes you look younger. 
Ben slips on his old military parka before leaving. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) Good luck! 
BEN See you later, Angie. 
5    INT. DAY - HALLWAY BUILDING                                     5 
Ben walks down the hallway. The building is old and clearly not well maintained, cracks and graffiti cover the walls.

The downtown streets are clogged with the early morning rush hour traffic.

On the honorary board of the NYPD we can read the names of all the officers decorated for their courage. In the reflection of the copper plate we find Ben, sitting on the bench across from the office of -

Captain LARRY BYRNE (55) who appears at the end of the corridor-

BEN I just got here.

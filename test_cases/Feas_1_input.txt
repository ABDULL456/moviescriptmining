ROADIE Shhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. 
Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand. 
BOZO Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong! 
BEER GUY What do you know? 
BOZO I know you're doing it wrong. 
BEER GUY Prove it. 
Bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles. 
BOZO Move aside, princess. 
INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT 
The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering system. There is about six inches of water on the floor. 
COACH (to Roadie) You and I are similar. We both have accents. We both travel a lot. We both don't really have homes... 
ROADIE You should be quiet. 
COACH I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous. 
HEROINE Quiet. 
Coach bites his lip, dying to say something. 
COACH It's just that this seems like the opportune time for someone to be horribly... offed. 
ROADIE What did I say? 
COACH Sorry. I'm done now. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles. 
BOZO You don't want the rag touching booze, that way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it. 
PARA You sure? I thought the rag had to touch? 
BOZO I'm sure. 
Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer. 
BOZO Perfecto. What we should do, though, is put those peanut barrels to use. Fill 'em with booze and line up some planks. If the walls come down... we hit 'em Donkey Kong style. 
Para and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect for bomb-making. 
PARA Genius. 
BEER GUY You aren't nearly as dumb as you look, are you? 
BOZO Next time, look within. Stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful. 
Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder. 
BOZO Excuse me for being forward, but I'm curious about your dimensions. 
INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT 
Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down. 
ROADIE Hold up. You hear something? 
A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above. 
ROADIE They're trying to burrow through the tunnel walls. 
HEROINE Move. 
The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end of the tunnel as well. 
COACH Like moles these things.

{"train": "THE GETAWAY \nby Walter Hill \nThis screenplay is dedicated to Raoul Walsh \nBased on the novel \nby \nJim Thompson \nFINAL REVISED SHOOTING SCRIPT \nFebruary 23 1972 \nNOTE: SCENE NUMBERS AND \"OMITTED\" SLUGS WERE REMOVED FROM THIS COPY. \nFADE IN: \nCARD OVER: SANDERSON PRISON \nEXT. PRISON YARD - TITLES OVER - DAY \nDOC McCOY IS BEING WALKED ACROSS THE COMPOUND BY A UNIFORMED GUARD, carrying a riot gun. Other Prisoners around the yard turn and stare as the two men head for the main building. \nINT. PRISON CORRIDOR \nDOC WALKS DOWN THE BLEAK HALLWAY: A BLACK PRISONER PASSES Doc in the corridor, they slap hands... the Guard remains at his shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to enter the room where he stands sentry. \nINT. HEARING ROOM - DAY \nA LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing the length of the room. \nSeated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man; floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J. BEYNON. \nDoc enters the room and seats himself near two other PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAnother table has been set up; this one near the seated Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin. \nA MAN at the center of the large table clears his throat, then begins to speak. \nCHAIRMAN I think we can begin... First parole request Carter \"Doc\" McCoy... is legal counsel present? \nA MAN rises from behind the lawyers' table. \nLAWYER Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr. McCoy. \nDOC watching... taking it all in. \nAT THE TABLE \nThe Man checks the papers before him. \nCHAIRMAN (his voice a bored drone) Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence for armed robbery, first offense in the State of Texas, wanted by the State of Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery... \nLAWYER The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction, Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr. McCoy in connection with that case. \nCHAIRMAN (adjusting his papers) That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has served four years of his sentence. Prison record satisfactory. Applied for parole on September 5th of this year... \nThe Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer. \nCHAIRMAN (CONT'D) (continuing) Remarks? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAWYER We would only again like to call the committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's satisfactory behavior as a prisoner. \nCHAIRMAN Notice is taken. \nHe looks down the table at the dark-suited men. \nCHAIRMAN (CONT'D) (continuing) The Board met in closed chambers last week... have you reached a decision regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole? \nDOC His face is taut. \nAT THE TABLE \nA Second MAN looks across to the Chairman. \nSECOND MAN (seated near Beynon) Request for parole is denied. The prisoner may re-apply in one calendar year. \nDOC lowers his eyes, then looks up at his lawyer. The lawyer avoids Doc's glance., he shuffles the papers in front of him, begins stuffing them into his briefcase. \nAT THE TABLE THE CHAIRMAN FLIPS HIS PAPERS TO A NEW PAGE \nCHAIRMAN (still totally without emotion) Very well. The next request for parole is from John Doty. Is legal counsel present? \nNEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT \nThey are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be anything at all but all three have commonality; they are professionals. \nHAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter ender. \nCULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop out of his buttoned shirtsleeves... \nSWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other two, his narrow features allow no warmth. \nAFTER A MOMENT: \nSECRETARY Yes? \nCAROL I want to see Jack Beynon. \nThe Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol towards a door leading to an inner office. \nSECRETARY Go right in, Mrs. McCoy. \nDOC AND CAROL - PACES, PARTS OP BODIES, EMPHASIS ON HANDS, in bed... his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her stomach. \nBACK WITHIN THE OFFICE THE THREE MEN LOOK AFTER CAROL \nCULLY Class - regular? \nSWAIN No. Doc McCoy's old lady. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCully looks startled. \nCULLY Jesus. Carol Ainsley? \nSWAIN The very same. \nCULLY The Doctor took out McGovern for her. \nSWAIN She only rides winning - Class easy class. \nACCOUNTANT Shut up. \nINT. BEYNON'S OFFICE \nCAROL ENTERS. \nA WOMAN'S LIPS - FLASH CUT \npressed against a man's neck. She kisses, then bites a tiny portion of skin. \nBACK TO BEYNON'S OFFICE. HE IS POURING A DRINK. \nBEYNON How are you, Mrs. McCoy? \nCAROL APPROACHES BEYNON'S DESK WITH A NERVOUSLY \nDETERMINED STRIDE \nCAROL Ready to talk about my husband, Mr. Beynon. \nBEYNON So the good Doctor comes up again. (then) Please sit down. \nCAROL He's asked me to come and see you. \nBeynon looks at her... then lets their eyes meet. \nBEYNON (handing her a drink) Why? Can I help? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROL Yes, I think you can. \nA MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a wedding ring comes up to meet it. \nINT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY \nA UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed in civilian clothes. \nDoc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with the guard. \nEXT. PRISON - DAY \nDOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE. He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the prison... four years is a long time. \nA dark Caddy is parked down the road. \nINT. CADDY - DAY \nTHE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at Doc. Doc crosses to him. \nDOC (pointing to the poster) It doesn't look like that. \nCAROL What do you mean? You've never been there. \nDOC I've been there every day for the last four years. \nShe crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her ironing. \nDOC (CONT'D) What's Beynon got set up? \nCAROL Small town, small bank, big money. \nShe holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him. \nDOC Where did you get those? \nCAROL I've been doing my homework. \nDOC Just like old times? \nCAROL Better than old times. \nDOC I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch. \nCAROL I made a mistake. I'll never make another one. \nDOC (after a moment) Where did you get them developed? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCAROL Assumed name... Houston. \nDOC Good. \nRAFTER A MOMENT) \nHow much is the score? \nCAROL Half a million. \nDOC That Beynon's got a long arm. \nCAROL (after a moment) What do you want for dinner? \nDOC Whisky and a peach. \nShe laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles at her and begins sampling. \nCAROL (as Doc eats a peach with a sharp knife) How does it taste? \nDOC Just the way I remembered. \nDoc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently. \nDOC (CONT'D) You been okay? \nCAROL Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel. \nDOC How's Estelle? \nCAROL Fatter... some things never change. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC Boring. \nCAROL Nothing's been boring since you found me. \nDOC (carefully) That's not all of it. \nCAROL No. It's been a long time. \nA pause. He continues stroking her arm. \nDOC You go out much? \nCAROL After four years and now the question comes up. \nDOC Couldn't handle it then. Now I can. \nCAROL (with warmth and a smile) I'm still here, Doc. \nHe stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward the stairs. \nINT. BEDROOM \nTHEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she stares vacantly expectant. \nDoc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping Doc drop the garment down to her waist. \nCarol begins to laugh softly. \nDOC Why are you laughing? \nCAROL I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you. \nDOC That doesn't hurt. \nCAROL But sometimes I cried a lot too. \nDOC (trying to smile) I didn't. I just waited. \nCAROL (deeply moved) Want to cry now? \nDoc smiling, still holding her hand, leads her from the table. \nTHEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER AND LAUGHING with complete release they half carry each other into the bedroom. \nEXT. RIVER WALK CANAL - SAN ANTONIO - DAY \nBEYNON IS IN THE BOAT. LUNCH HAS BEEN SET. DOC COMES ABOARD. \nDOC You gotta be kidding. \nBEYNON Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch. \nDoc sits. \nPedal boats cut through the water in the background. \nBEYNON (CONT'D) Glad to see you in civilian clothes. \nThe Accountant and Swain are with Beynon in the boat. Apart from them two pedal boats come up behind Beynon's boat. Cully and Hayhoe are in one, and two other men are pedalling along in a boat numbered 13. \nDOC All it takes is a long arm. \nBEYNON Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions. \nDOC (sarcastic) I guess it was because I was a model prisoner. \nBEYNON This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him... \nBeynon nods toward the Accountant. He then turns and gestures toward the other two men. \nBEYNON (CONT'D) (continuing) You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals. \nDOC (flat, hard) I get my own help. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBEYNON (quiet strength) You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up. \nIt's not a big bank but it handles cash deposits for an oil company... half a million... it's a family thing, the brother of the bank director is on the board of directors at Con-Sol Oil... Beacon City. \nBeynon nods to the two men and they immediately begin to approach in their paddle boat. \nRUDY BUTLER -- hard eyes and an easy smile; obviously a heavy gun... \nPRANK JACKSON -- young, mid-twenties, ruddy face and blond hair; a small man with blank, insensitive features. \nDOC (nods to Cully, Swain and Hayhoe) What about them? \nBEYNON They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean. \nAs the two men arrive... \nBEYNON (CONT'D) (continuing) Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson... \nDOC (to Rudy) I heard about you. You work with Miller. \nRUDY You're out of touch. Cops blew him up. \nDOC Where? \nRUDY Chicago. \nDOC You were with him? \nRUDY Yeah. I got out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDOC (to Jackson) What about you? \nJACKSON I was backup man on a payroll job. (as Doc looks hard at him) I hit some liquor stores... I drive good. \nRUDY I drive. \nDOC Sure, (to Beynon) You're working on the passports... (as Beynon nods) ... and visas? \nA LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock closed. \nCAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She turns her eyes back to Doc... \nDOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole cover is visible. \nDOC (barking the words) Two feet forward... \nCAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD \nON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the panel truck. \nDOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he disappears from sight... \n98 RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel 98 to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch. \nJACKSON Now! \nRudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels begin to quietly whine. \nMain Street comes back into view... \nCAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red... \nA MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He watches the signal. \nDOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight, moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky water. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDoc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval corridor... \nEXT. THE BANK \nTHE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS to enter. \nINT. THE BANK \nTHE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over to the wood-frame clock on the far wall. \nTHE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY \nRUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto Main Street. \nTHE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window. Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces; the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a disparity between their features... \nMAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green. \nCAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel truck... \nTHE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind him begin to HONK. \nCAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the engine. \nDOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01. \nDOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc immediately starts on the next strand. \nCAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine. \nTHE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and Jackson pull open the car doors. \nDOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT. \nINT. THE BANK \nTHE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball schedule and display into position. \nSEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting business with the Tellers. \nThe wall clock shows the time at 9:02. \nRUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible. \nTHE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes widen... both guns are leveled directly at him... simultaneously the lights go out... \nTHE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens. \nCAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine. \nINT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE \nTHE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain. \nWhen the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill and examines it. The Patient pants in relief. \nDENTIST Superior technology, my ass. \nAN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square... as the bulbs dim... \nDOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire cutters up into the truck parked over him. \nTHE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is ready for one more round. \nTHE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at Jackson, then to the vault. \nTHE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street. \nCAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the grocery bag... \nDOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the fasteners shut . \nDOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat pocket . \nJACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank. \nDOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE DOOR. He passes the bank president. \nRUDY NOW WATCHES DOC \nDOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the side door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard. \nTHE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol. \nDOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE bank with his gun. \nTHE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS towards his pistol. \nRUDY EYES STILL ON DOC \nJACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE GUARD. \nDOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY. \nINT. BANK \nTHE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38. \nJACKSON LEVELS HIS .44. \nDOC AND RUDY. BOTH SEE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. \nDOC (shouts) Just pick it up. \nRUDY Don't! \nJACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES. \nTHE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with fright. \nDOC - His eyes are furious. \nRUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door. \nDOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into the alley. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nRUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car accelerates. \nTHE ALLEY DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the end of the alleyway. \nCAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway opening. \nDOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel as Carol slides over to the passenger seat. \nINT. THE FORD \nDOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut. \nTHE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear... \nMAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES \nTHE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales instantly igniting. \nThe grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange- flame inferno... \nTraffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk at the twin blazes. \nRUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the stopped traffic. \nDOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging onto smoke-covered Main Street. \nThe speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park. \nTHEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE. \nEXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY \nCAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road. Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat. After several moments of silence: \nCAROL What about the bank? \nDOC (after a moment) Jackson panicked and nailed the guard. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side window. \nCAROL Oh, Christ. \nDoc leans forward., snaps on the radio. \nEXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY \nRUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs, along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch. \nEXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY \nRUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone. \nRUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash the purling water across his face and then he laughs. \nINT. STATION WAGON - DAY \nDIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000 stolen. \nDOC We got between four and five. \nCarol starts to open the bag and count. \nDoc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that carries only a sparse amount of traffic. \nDoc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead. \nCAROL (now noticing the road) Doc... \nDOC (flat) I see it... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing vehicle. \nDOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line of slowly-passing vehicles. \nShe turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches her arm, preventing her from moving further. \nDOC (CONT'D) They're looking for three men... remember? \nA YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station wagon rolls up to the check-point. \nDOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young Patrolman. \nDOC (CONT'D) (big smile) What's the problem? \nCAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the rear seat. \nTHE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock... After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio. \nEXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY \nInside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor, SMASHING through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts out into the sunlight. \nEXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY \nThe station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near an outdoor phone booth at a filling station. \nINT. STATION WAGON \nDOC SHUTS OFF THE ENGINE, PULLS OPEN HIS DOOR. \nDOC MOVES INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH CARRYING A FIST-FULL \nof loose change. He begins to dial... \nINT. BEYNON'S OFFICE - DAY \nTHE PHONE RINGS. THE ACCOUNTANT LIFTS THE RECEIVER. \nACCOUNTANT I 'm here. \nHe presses a button on the intercom. \nANOTHER PHONE IN THE OFFICE 234 \nINT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nDOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT \nBEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking the sour mash straight with a water chaser. \nDOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes a sip. \nBEYNON Hello, McCoy. \nDOC Beynon. \nBEYNON (swishing the drink) News said two persons killed. \nExcept for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn leather belly holster. \nDOC Three... Rudy got ambitious. \nBEYNON And you got him... \nDOC That's right. \nDoc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking the money. \nBEYNON What about your wife? \nDOC What about her? (moving right to the business at hand) Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North. \nINT. STATION WAGON \nPARKED UNDER THE COTTONWOOD AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. CAROL SITS CHEWING GUM... LINES OF STRAIN HAVE FORMED ACROSS HER FACE. \nINT. KITCHEN \nDOC LISTENS CAREFULLY TO BEYNON. \nBEYNON Your wife told me no one would be killed. \nDOC You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me. \nBEYNON They may nail me into this now, McCoy. \nDOC That's your problem. \nBEYNON (smiles) You know, you and I may be two of a kind. \nDOC No way. I always do my own work. \nBeynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's glass. \nBEYNON Here. I understand the way you feel. As a matter of fact, you and I might share a great many feelings... \nBeynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the money. \nDOC (snaps the words) I'm in a hurry. \nBEYNON You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are. \nDOC No applause! \nBeynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair, stands beside the table. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBEYNON Let's examine the situation. One, an extremely attractive woman. Then, there's the woman's husband, a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison. Three, a man with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a convict... why should he? \nBeynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward his waist band. \nBEYNON (CONT'D) (continuing) A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank. \nDOC I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8. \nBEYNON (cautiously) What do you add up to here? \nDOC One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million. \nBEYNON A little more was taken out before. (a beat) My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts. \nDOC So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you. \nBEYNON (smiles., nodding) The obvious. (as his smile fades) But we are both not interested in that right now. \nDOC No. (a long beat) My old lady must have made a lot of promises. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBEYNON Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled. \nDOC PULLS THE WAGON to an abrupt halt within a parking stall - - at an isolated area. He steps out onto the concrete flooring, slams the door shut. \nDoc turns away from the car. As he approaches the elevator, Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops them into a trash bin without missing a stride. \nINT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING \nCAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward. She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike. Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend off into clumped rows within the wings of the station. \nCAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly ticket-seller looks across to her. \nCAROL Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer. \nTICKET-SELLER Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in forty-five minutes, gate three. \nCarol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the seemingly acres-wide station promenade. \nNEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances across the promenade walls, her eyes finding: \nA CLOCK READING: 9:40 \nON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER \nCAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her. \nCarol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap, pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather satchel. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass- walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge in that direction. \nA BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder. \nTHE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness. \nDAPPER MAN Kind of tricky, isn't it? \nShe turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand, deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open. Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests it to show that it \nhas been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his intentions. \nCAROL Thank you. \nDAPPER MAN (toothy grin) No trouble lady. \nStepping backward, his canine features disappear into a welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail Lounge. \nINT. BARN - DAY \nEMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALL \nA YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel of a .44. A thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the fur along the cat's neck and backbone. \nRUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby. \nHAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn- like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls, cages and pens, many of them vacant. \nThe wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been attached to his left arm and shoulder. \nFRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite   Rudy. Five years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt, bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed under her rumpled skirt. \nRUDY (to Harold) What's the damage? \nHAROLD Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day. \nRUDY I got a nurse in mind. \nHAROLD (going along, oblivious to the implication) The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then... \nRUDY (flashing a grin despite the pain) The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso. \nHAROLD That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but he's known her for years. \nRUDY Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton? \nFRAN (scared, but trying to be friendly) Just... tell us what you want. \nRudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following silence is like a scream. Finally: \nRUDY What kind of car do you have, Harold? \nFRAN (cutting in) A Ford... We have a Ford. \nRUDY That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back... \nHe points the gun at Mrs. Clinton. \nTHE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps back out into the vestibule. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch tickets. \nAs the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him. He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then, Doc sits down next to the Thief. \nDOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close. \nDOC (softly almost gently) When you pop a lock don't mark it. \nThe Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms. \nTHE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's fingers are vise-like at his wrist. \nTHE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter. \nTHE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching fares. \nINT. STATION GATE - DAY \nCAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE \nLOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left. \nINT. TRAIN - DAY \nTHE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two seats ahead. \nTHE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The Thief goes out. Is he dead? \nDOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT. \nDoc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head. \nINT. STATION - DAY \nCAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH. \nSits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't recognize anything. \nINT. TRAIN - DAY \nTHE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly leaning in Doc's direction. \nCONDUCTOR Tickets? \nAs Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it to him. \nDOC End of the line. Two. \nCONDUCTOR (grumpily) All right. \nThe conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make change. \nTHE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD \nINT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY \nRUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS \nDOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat. \nRUDY Talk a little, Harold, loosen up... good for you. \nHarold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel. \nFRAN (chuckling at Harold) Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy? \nRUDY I Just want to find a suitcase. \nINT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY \nBEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from under one of the table legs. \nThe Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring down at Beynon's body. \nACCOUNTANT They may still be going to Nogales. \nSWAIN What about Laughlin in El Paso? \nACCOUNTANT Cover both, get someone down there... either Rudy and McCoy's got half a million. \nSWAIN They've got to switch cars. \nACCOUNTANT Put out the word. \nHAYHOE (looking back at Beynon) What about Jack? \nACCOUNTANT Tonight... take him out in the country, throw him down a dry well, if you can find one. \nDOC (looking at Carol and thinking about Beynon) No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on. \nCAROL Like what? \nBut Doc doesn't answer. \nINT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT \nDOC LIES NEXT TO CAROL. Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped in wax paper. She passes one over to Doc along with some greasy french fries and a couple of napkins . \nThe Suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across the room. Doc silently munches his hamburger. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDoc glances at the poster rolled up. Carol hasn't put it up on the wall yet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT \nTHE TRAIN GOES CLICKETY CLICK THROUGH THE NIGHT, the young panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping passengers. His Mother catches him, takes him back to his seat. \nINT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT \nCAROL IS BUSY UNBANDING THE MONEY PADS. A LARGE STACK OF discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a Texas newspaper. \nCAROL CONTINUES TO LOOSEN THE GREENBACKS. She is surrounded on the double bed by stacks of money. She lights a match, drops it into the wastebasket. The money bands quickly burst into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly ashes. \nDOC (not looking up) There may be a hunting party. \nCAROL Why, there's nothing on the news? \nDOC I didn't mean police. \nHe continues thinking. Carol watches him for a moment. \nCAROL Tell me about it. \nDoc looks across at her. \nDOC (calmly) Loredo is out. I've been thinking about Rudy. If he was on his own, we're okay. If Beynon bought him out... \nDoc looks at her. \nCAROL What? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso. \nRudy knew about Laughlins. \nCAROL You're full of ifs. \nDOC I think you liked it with him. \nI think he got to you. \nCAROL Maybe. At least I got to him. (pause) Where do we go from here? \nDOC El Paso. \nINT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT \nA WATER PISTOL APPEARS AROUND THE CORNER   OF AN EMPTY PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat   squeezes off several plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck. \nKID Bang! \nTHE BOY WATCHES THE IMMOBILE MAN. He fires again, once again there is no reaction. The brat steps forward... smiling, he pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder. \nTHE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR. His eyes roll upward... staring at the panther. His neck is bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly. \nTHIEF (very hoarsely) Get me a doctor. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nCAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm. Doc lies beside her, eyes open. He looks over at Carol a moment, noting the long strands of hair that move rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. After a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and stares at the black suitcase. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn shade. Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol. \nONE LAST TIGHTLY BOUND MONEY PAD - NIGHT \nPrinted clearly on the brown wrapper. \nFIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY \nRUDY How you doing over there, Harold? You sleep okay last night? Good. I'm glad to hear it. Did you listen to the news? That means we don't have to drive so hard today, Harold... we're gonna be travelling a lot faster than they are... We got a lot more time than I figured. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRudy continues smiling. He pulls the sheet away from Frank, then allows his hand to reach down, cupping her breast from inside the bra. Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to Rudy. \nINT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - DAY \nHAYHOE, THE ACCOUNTANT and the rest of the boys are sitting in the office waiting. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nRUDY IS DRIVING NOW, Fran and Harold are not speaking. \nINT.

LAUGHLIN HOTEL - EL PASO - MORNING \nCANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen before) ENTERS THE DARK NEARLY DESERTED LOBBY and approaches the reception desk. The large room is populated by overstuffed and threadbare furniture. \nLAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks (all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine. \nCANNON You Laughlin? \nLAUGHLIN (Mr. Friendly) Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's Junior. \nLaughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in one of the overstuffed chairs. \nCANNON Congratulations. I need a room. \nLAUGHLIN No trouble. You came to the right place, one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What else can I do for you? \nINT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY \nAS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc, seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the dials and pushes the buttons. \nDOC (cajoling it) C'mon workl I (almost pleading) C'mon. \nWe hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard. \nDOC (CONT'D) (angrily to the radio) Give me the news!! \nWhen it is clear that the radio won't work: \nDOC (CONT'D) You can't trust anything these days. \nCAROL I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody... \nDOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to the side of the road. \nDOC I trust... (he opens the black suitcase) Want to see what I trust... In God we trust... (he pulls out a bill and points at it) The word's on every bill!!! \nCAROL (slamming the suitcase closed) You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left. \nShe starts the car up again, and continues driving, her knuckles tightening around the steering wheel. \nINT. CLINTON'S FORD - ANGLES - DAY \nAS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her. She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder. \nRUDY Have a bone, baby. \nHe throws another sparerib at Fran. \nFRAN (shouts) Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse. \nGod damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for? Jesus. \nRUDY (laughing) I'll tell you why I did it... it makes me feel good. \nHe laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a bone back at Rudy. \nHAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front of him. \nTHE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.) \nEXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY \nTHE CHEVY MOVES ALONG with the light mid-day traffic, passing various roadside business establishments, then pulls up before a radio/TV repair and sales shop. \nINT. RADIO/TV STORE - DAY \nALL THE LATEST MODEL RADIOS are stacked on shelves around the small room... a television display featuring several models is in one corner of the shop. Another TV is playing near the counter and the PROPRIETOR'S desk. \nDOC A portable. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and starts up the sidewalk. \nDOC WATCHES HER FOR A MOMENT, THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR HIMSELF \nEXT. SIDEWALK \nCAROL WALKS ALONE BACK TOWARDS THE CAR. \nINT. POLICE CAR \nHOMER AND JETHRO CONTINUE STARING AT THE CHEW. Their car is pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting Goods house. \nDOC LEAVES THE SPORTING GOODS STORE, CROSSES THE STREET and begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the Chevy. \nCAROL PASSES THE POLICE CAR AND NEARS THE CHEVY \nINT. POLICE CAR \nTHE TWO RURAL COPS MOVE INTO ACTION; their car pulls forward and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy. \nCAROL STANDS FROZEN AS HOMER AND JETHRO HOP OUT OF THE POLICE car, guns drawn. \nDOC CROSSES THE STREET BEHIND THE COP CAR \nHE LEVELS HIS big gun... \nDoc FIRES the shotgun through the \"brown wrapping paper point blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck. \nHomer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as their car EXPLODES behind them. \nWith three more BLASTS Doc blows most of the top off the police car then calmly reloads. \nDOC Slide those guns! \nThe two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement. \nCAROL HAS INSTANTLY MOVED BACK INTO THE CHEVY, started the engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street. She makes a U-turn, then pulls up near Doc. \nDOC STEPS FORWARD, KICKS THE TWO PISTOLS BACK UNDER the police car near the gas tank. \nHe walks to the back of the car. \nCarol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy. \nDoc SHOOTS the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly ignites. \nWalking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts to climb into the Chevy. \nCarol REVS the engine. \nDoc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police officers and the blazing automobile. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement. \nCAROL THROWS THE CHEVY INTO REVERSE, AND ROARS back to pick up Doc. \nDOC, A LITTLE CHAGRINED, PICKS HIMSELF UP, GRABS his gun and jumps into the Chevy. He slams the door closed, Carol again tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement. \nHOMER AND JETHRO RAISE THEMSELVES. With very long faces they study the burning remains of their once proud squad car. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nTHE CHEVY SPEEDS OUT OF TOWN,, onto an open stretch of road. \nINT. CHEVY \nDOC JAMS ONE MORE SHELL INTO HIS PAPER-WRAPPED gun -- Carol grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road... the Chevy continues to accelerate. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nTHE CHEVY CROSSES THE ROAD'S BROKEN WHITE LINE and passes a lumbering Greyhound bus. \nDOC, STARING AT THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM; the bus fades off into the horizon... \nDOC (finally) Here. \nTHE CHEVY PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY, MOVES UP A DIRT road for twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks. Well out of sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt. \nDOC AND CAROL, RUNNING THROUGH THE CORNFIELD AND BACK UP THE DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as she runs. \nON THE HIGHWAY DOC STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, waving both arms overhead. The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard. \nINT. BUS \nDOC BUYS TWO FARES FROM THE SCOWLING GREYHOUND DRIVER. The bus again moves forward. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another. \nCAROL (setting the condition) No more about Beynon. \nDOC Whatever happens it's over. \nA pause. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nCAROL (not trusting his mouth) Sounds good. \nDOC You want to try with me? \nCAROL (smiling) Things can't get much worse can they? \nDOC I don't see how. \nA long moment. \nCAROL (finally talcing Doc's arm) Okay. \nDOC (slow smile) You and me. \nCAROL Can we make it? \nDOC We get to Mexico, we can have a life. \nCAROL That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted. \nAs she pulls herself against him: \nDOC I'm going to try and get it for you. \nThey pull each other closer, tightly holding one another. \nRUDY IS LYING IN BED READING A NEWSPAPER PILLED WITH DOC AND CAROL. The fact that they have been seen in the North. He smiles. \nFran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets. \nRUDY (calling softly) Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out of there. \nNo answer. Rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nHAROLD IS HANGING FROM A BRACKET. Very dead and not very pretty.

FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR LAUGHLIN HOTEL - MORNING \nLAUGHLIN LEADS RUDY AND FRAN down the dark-walled hallway, stopping before room number 4l8. Laughlin turns the key in the lock, opens the door. \nLAUGHLIN It's hard to figure. There's something about the composition of the track at Pimlico... You can't go by the clock, any speed horse, take a second off any other track in the country. \nINT. ROOM 418 \nAS THE GROUP ENTERS. \nLAUGHLIN (continuing) ... but a speed horse is the only thing that consistently holds form. They got to let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try to rate 'em, just breaks their heart. \nRudy kicks the door shut with a slam, grabs Laughlin's shoulder, spins him around, hits him full in the stomach. As Laughlin begins to fall Rudy catches him, wallops him again in the mid-section, then throws him back into a ratty armchair. Rudy instantly pulls out his .44 and shoves it hard against Laughlin's mouth. \nRUDY Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live or die. \nRUDY (CONT'D) Do what I tell you, you not only get to live, but maybe you'll pick up some money. \nEXT.

The poster is again on the wall. \nCAROL still in the bathroom of room 318. She wears only a slip. Carol is washing out her bra and panties in the washbasin, using a coarse bar of soap. Doc enters; he begins taking off his shirt. \nDOC We've got some food coming, should be here any minute. \nCAROL Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours. \nDOC Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M. \nCAROL (mild complaint) Oh, Jesus... how? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east.

You'll feel okay. \nDOC (smile) Whatever you say. \nINT. FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY \nAS RUDY AND FRAN EMERGE FROM THEIR ROOM. The door shuts behind them, Rudy guides Fran to the stairs. \nINT. BATHROOM 318 \nDOC STANDS IN THE SHOWER, THE HARD SPRAY BREAKING OVER THE BACK OF HIS SKULL. Tired, he closes his eyes, rests the side of his head against the tile. \nINT. BEDROOM 318 \nCAROL STILL WEARING THE SLIP, she lies back across the bed. Her eyelids slowly fall shut. Carol has pushed the suitcase, overcoat and .45 off to one side. \nRUDY AND FRAN COME DOWN THE STAIRS. Rudy puts one hand inside his overcoat. \nINSIDE THE OLDSMOBILE - EL PASO CITY STREETS \nAS THE HOOD DRIVES, SWAIN IS BESIDE HIM IN THE FRONT, CULLY, THE ACCOUNTANT AND HAYHOE ride in the back seat. \nINT. ROOM 318 \nCAROL IS NAPPING LIGHTLY ON THE BED AS DOC BURSTS out of the bathroom... again dressed in his shorts, holding his pants in one hand. \nDOC Get upI Carol's eyes snap open. \nDOC (CONT'D) (continuing) We're moving now! \nHe quickly pulls his pants on... \nCAROL What is it? \nDOC Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses. \nCAROL So what? \nDOC If they are not here, he must have sent them away. \nINT. CORRIDOR THIRD FLOOR \nRUDY AND FRAN STEP INTO THE HALLWAY TOWARD ROOM 3l8a passing several rooms. Fran's face is taut. Rudy starts his nervous grin. \nINT.

I want to get some rest. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe is interrupted by a hard knock on the door. Doc drops his shirt to the floor. He quickly reaches down, lifts his .45. Doc gestures to Carol... she moves towards the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol. \nINT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY \nDOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED \naround the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk. Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden staircase. \nACCOUNTANT Just have her set it down. \nDoc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture revealing that his palm is empty. \nDOC You want it? Come and take it. \nTHE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN \nACCOUNTANT (quietly) Get him. \nAs the three men reach for their guns. \nDOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from the sudden burst of fire power. \nDOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS \nHAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon, Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring. \nON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with his right. \nWITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES \nCully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol. All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their hands. \nSWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard. \nHAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly up and fires. \nDOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister supports. \nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow indicator pass \"Two.\" \nDOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two shots back down the stairwell. \nSWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder. \nSWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver straight up... empties it. \nDOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell with a huge roar. \nTHE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to continue moving upward. Cannon following. \nTHE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT \"THREE\" \nCULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The Accountant remains within the elevator. \nSWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD \nCAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing, keep moving upwards towards the third. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDoc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces. \nRUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door. \nCAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five steps behind. \nDOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT \nSWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR \nCully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within the elevator. \nCarol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As Carol screams: \nDoc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45 in his right. \nCULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of their mark. \nDOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE \nTHE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The plaster flies away revealing further damage.

He takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons. \nDOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of lockers. \nCAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now disappeared from view.

TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY \nDOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes in. \nAfter a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse. Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference. \nTHE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long corridor. \nDOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed off departure/arrival gates. \nTHE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open stairway winding downward. \nDOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and starts back up the platform towards the concourse. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDoc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers scurrying toward the awaiting train... \nTHE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach passengers. \nCAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight, visible on the next level below. \nTHE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and into the rail car passageway. \nDOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the conductor and into the train. \nTHE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the forward compartments. \nDOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car vestibule. \nON THE CONCOURSE \nCAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc. She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will take her down to trackside... \nCarol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring down at the shining train. \nINT. FLYER - DAY COACH \nTHE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks, clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried but controlled pace. \nAT THE END OF A PULLMAN \nDOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle. She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an overhead carriage. \nDoc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her. \n30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30? empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a run. \nDOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR. The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the front of the train. \nTHE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER. This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car. The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door, hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps. \nDOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still unknowingly two cars behind the Thief. \nTHE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door swings open. \nINT. MEN'S LOUNGE \nThe Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him, crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window. He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly jammed... \nDOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the smoker. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and, like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and begins going back in the opposite direction. \nDOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut. \nPORTER (appearing suddenly at Doc's shoulder) Be open five minutes out of the station. \nDoc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps toward his point of entrance onto the train. \nTHE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket. \nDOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars. \nINT. MEN'S LOUNGE \nTHE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls the shade lower. \nEXT. TRACK \nMETAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS, then begins to move forward. \nTHE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the train edges forward.

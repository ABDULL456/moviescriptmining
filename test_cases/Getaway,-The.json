Other Prisoners around the yard turn and stare as the two men head for the main building. \nINT. PRISON CORRIDOR \nDOC WALKS DOWN THE BLEAK HALLWAY: A BLACK PRISONER PASSES Doc in the corridor, they slap hands... the Guard remains at his shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to enter the room where he stands sentry. \nINT. HEARING ROOM - DAY \nA LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing the length of the room. \nSeated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man; floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J. BEYNON. \nDoc enters the room and seats himself near two other PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAnother table has been set up; this one near the seated Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin. \nA MAN at the center of the large table clears his throat, then begins to speak. \nCHAIRMAN I think we can begin... First parole request Carter \"Doc\" McCoy... is legal counsel present? \nA MAN rises from behind the lawyers' table. \nLAWYER Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr. McCoy. \nDOC watching... taking it all in. \nAT THE TABLE \nThe Man checks the papers before him. \nCHAIRMAN (his voice a bored drone) Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence for armed robbery, first offense in the State of Texas, wanted by the State of Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery... \nLAWYER The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction, Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr. McCoy in connection with that case. \nCHAIRMAN (adjusting his papers) That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has served four years of his sentence. Prison record satisfactory. Applied for parole on September 5th of this year... \nThe Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer. \nCHAIRMAN (CONT'D) (continuing) Remarks? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLAWYER We would only again like to call the committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's satisfactory behavior as a prisoner. \nCHAIRMAN Notice is taken. \nHe looks down the table at the dark-suited men. \nCHAIRMAN (CONT'D) (continuing) The Board met in closed chambers last week... have you reached a decision regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole? \nDOC His face is taut. \nAT THE TABLE \nA Second MAN looks across to the Chairman. \nSECOND MAN (seated near Beynon) Request for parole is denied. The prisoner may re-apply in one calendar year. \nDOC lowers his eyes, then looks up at his lawyer. The lawyer avoids Doc's glance., he shuffles the papers in front of him, begins stuffing them into his briefcase. \nAT THE TABLE THE CHAIRMAN FLIPS HIS PAPERS TO A NEW PAGE \nCHAIRMAN (still totally without emotion) Very well. The next request for parole is from John Doty.

PRISON - VISITING BUNGALOW - DAY \nDOC IS SEATED... WAITING. CAROL enters the darkened room and seats herself opposite Doc. They are separated by a wide table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid- point between them. \nCAROL (big smile, she wants the moment to be an upper) Hello, Doc. \nHe simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at Carol. \nCAROL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. \nDoc is silent. \nCAROL (CONT'D) It's been raining a lot the last few days. \nDoc is silent. \nCAROL (CONT'D) We'll try again. \nDOC No way. I've got to get out now. \nGet to Beynon, tell him I'm for sale. His price. \nShe looks at him. \nDOC (CONT'D) Do it now. \nShe hesitates, tries to touch him through the mesh. Gets up and leaves. Doc remains unmoving. \nEXT. COUNTRY COURTHOUSE - SAN MARCOS, TEXAS - DAY \nCAROL MOVES TO THE BACK OF THE LARGE BTJILDING AND UP A REAR STAIRWAY TOWARD THE OVERHEAD OFFICE. \nINT. COURTHOUSE \nCAROL ENTERS A LEGAL OFFICE, WEARING A SOFT BILLOWY dress. She looks very good. \nA middle aged SECRETARY looks up at Carol. A short balding man (THE ACCOUNTANT) in his forties works at a large desk across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied with his bookwork. \n", "test1_id": 1188, "test2_input": "NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT \nThey are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be anything at all but all three have commonality; they are professionals. \nHAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter ender. \nCULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop out of his buttoned shirtsleeves... \nSWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other two, his narrow features allow no warmth. \nAFTER A MOMENT: \nSECRETARY Yes? \nCAROL I want to see Jack Beynon. \nThe Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol towards a door leading to an inner office. \nSECRETARY Go right in, Mrs. McCoy. \nDOC AND CAROL - PACES, PARTS OP BODIES, EMPHASIS ON HANDS, in bed... his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her stomach. \nBACK WITHIN THE OFFICE THE THREE MEN LOOK AFTER CAROL \nCULLY Class - regular? \nSWAIN No. Doc McCoy's old lady. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCully looks startled. \nCULLY Jesus. Carol Ainsley? \nSWAIN The very same. \nCULLY The Doctor took out McGovern for her. \nSWAIN She only rides winning - Class easy class. \nACCOUNTANT Shut up. \nINT. BEYNON'S OFFICE \nCAROL ENTERS. \nA WOMAN'S LIPS - FLASH CUT \npressed against a man's neck. She kisses, then bites a tiny portion of skin. \nBACK TO BEYNON'S OFFICE.

(then) Please sit down. \nCAROL He's asked me to come and see you. \nBeynon looks at her... then lets their eyes meet. \nBEYNON (handing her a drink) Why? Can I help? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROL Yes, I think you can. \nA MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a wedding ring comes up to meet it. \nINT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY \nA UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed in civilian clothes. \nDoc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with the guard. \nEXT. PRISON - DAY \nDOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE. He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the prison... four years is a long time. \nA dark Caddy is parked down the road. \nINT. CADDY - DAY \nTHE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at Doc. Doc crosses to him. \n", "test2_true": "He gestures and drives away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDOC IS STILL WAITING \nHe leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance way... The duffel bag rests beside him. \nA late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc... the passenger side door opens from the inside... Carol is driving... Doc and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several moments. \nINT. FORD - DAY \nBOTH CAROL AND DOC ARE VERY TENSE. \nCAROL Hello, Doc. \nDOC Hi. \nCAROL You okay? \nDOC (big smile) I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago. \nThey look at each other for a moment. Carol leans forward... Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses her lightly, but with affection... \nCAROL You want to drive? \nDOC My license expired, let's get out of here. \nCAROL Sure... \nShe starts the car, slips it into gear. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nTHE FORD MOVES ALONG THE DESERTED ROADSIDE, crossing the border and passing into the State of Texas. \nINT. THE FORD \nDOC ALTERNATELY STARES AT THE PASSING SCENERY, THEN BACK to Carol. \nCAROL I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow. \nDOC It looks fine. \nA pause. \nCAROL Feel good? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC Yeah. \nCAROL Where do you want to go? \nDOC I want to take a walk. \nHe smiles, then reaches over and gently touches a strand of Carol's hair. \nEXT. RIVER - GRASSY BANK - SERIES OP ANGLES - DAY \nTHEY PARK THE CAR AND EXIT. DOC MOVES A LITTLE AHEAD OF Carol. He sits on the bank watching the kids play. \nYOUNG BOYS SWING ON A ROPE THAT HANGS OVER THE PALLS \nCOLLEGE KIDS, SOME ARE SWIMMING, SOME STUDYING, SOME just grooving. \nAN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATER \nCAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONG moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts. \nFinally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and starts walking towards a tree. \nSuddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives for the rope. \nCAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward splash. She is a brief second behind him. \nTHEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept down stream. \nINT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT \nTHROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CAN BE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster (which will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now on). \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAround the room are drying clothes. Carol is ironing with a steam iron. \nDoc is sitting at a table with a Colt .45 in front of him and a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of peaches on the table. \n", "test2_id": 1189, "test3_input": "They cross to the lockers. \nShe retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then forcing the key, shakes the lock violently. \nHer eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the locker number and then the number on the key. Her features are now totally ashen. \nShe walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty. \nCarol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear... Doc at her shoulder. \nCAROL A man helped me open it... \nDOC (deceptive calm) And switched keys. \nCAROL He must have. \nDOC (angrily) It isn't another boyfriend, is it? \nCarol winces, containing her anger. \nDOC (CONT'D) (continuing - icily) How long ago. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCAROL Fifteen minutes. \nDOC Sure? \nCarol nods. \nDOC (CONT'D) (continuing - with quick calculation) He'd figure you for longer, enough time to try another hit. He's probably still in the station. \nAs Doc pushes Carol forward. \nDOC (CONT'D) (continuing - lashing out) There better be a guy with the \nCAROL (lashing back) You bastard... \nWalking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the promenade... eyes straining. \nCAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of lockers, the black suitcase at his feet. \nTHE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons. \nDOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of lockers. \nCAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the metal compartments, exhausted, fearful. \nLOUDSPEAKER VOICE (indistinct above the roar of the station) Attention please. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (CONT'D) The Flyer now boarding at gate three. The Flyer now boarding at gate three. \nCarol again raises her eyes. Still breathless, her face glows with moisture. \nINT. THE CLINTON'S BARN - (MORNING) \nFRAN IS STILL SEATED ON THE STOOL. Rudy stares at her from the cot. Harold is now absent. \nFRAN I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything. \nRUDY (he speaks very politely) That right? \nFRAN You can trust him... \nRUDY How long have you been married? \nFRAN Two years. \nRUDY Can he trust you? \nFRAN (smiles) That's what matters, isn't it? \nRudy continues looking at her. \nRUDY Come over here a minute... \nHe gestures with his gun. Fran crosses the distance slowly, moving with apprehension. \nFRAN Look, I'm not going to be any trouble to you either, fact is, this may sound funny, but maybe you and I could be close friends... \nRudy gestures her closer... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFRAN (CONT'D) (continuing) You don't always have to have your gun out. I'll get whatever you want. Really, I will... \nFran smiles. She is now standing over the cot, looking directly down at Rudy. He jerks her down. \nRUDY (still polite) Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like it, and when I tell you to come over here you move fast. You and I are going to get along because I've known a lot of people like you, so don't tell me about it because I got your ticket going in. Now get up and get that paint of your fingers... okay? \n", "test3_true": "INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY \nDOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes in. \nAfter a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse. Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference. \nTHE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long corridor. \nDOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed off departure/arrival gates. \nTHE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open stairway winding downward. \nDOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and starts back up the platform towards the concourse. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDoc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers scurrying toward the awaiting train... \nTHE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach passengers. \nCAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight, visible on the next level below. \nTHE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and into the rail car passageway. \nDOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the conductor and into the train. \nTHE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the forward compartments. \nDOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car vestibule. \nON THE CONCOURSE \nCAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc. She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will take her down to trackside... \nCarol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring down at the shining train. \nINT. FLYER - DAY COACH \nTHE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks, clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried but controlled pace. \nAT THE END OF A PULLMAN \nDOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle. She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an overhead carriage. \nDoc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her. \n30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30? empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a run. \nDOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR. The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the front of the train. \nTHE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER. This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car. The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door, hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps. \nDOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still unknowingly two cars behind the Thief. \nTHE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door swings open. \nINT. MEN'S LOUNGE \nThe Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him, crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window. He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly jammed... \nDOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the smoker. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and, like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and begins going back in the opposite direction. \nDOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut. \nPORTER (appearing suddenly at Doc's shoulder) Be open five minutes out of the station. \nDoc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps toward his point of entrance onto the train. \nTHE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket. \nDOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars. \nINT. MEN'S LOUNGE \nTHE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls the shade lower. \nEXT. TRACK \nMETAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS, then begins to move forward. \nTHE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the train edges forward. His body suddenly tightens. He sees Doc outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of moving passenger cars and several parked tinders. \nTHIEF'S POV DOC GLANCING BETWEEN PARKED PASSENGER CARS, walking cautiously ahead. As the Flyer continues to move slowly forward, Doc disappears from view. \n", "test3_id": 1190}

ROSKO No. What? 
JACK Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner with a descrambler don't you? 
DANNY Voice inverter, yeah. 
JACK Whatever, get it down and set it up for me. 
ROSKO What is this? 
JACK I think the Air Force is using UNASSIGNED CHANNELS-- 
He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted out by an Officer across the room. 
LOUIS Hey -- he was at my house yesterday morning, are you aware of that? 
OFFICER ROSKO (quiet to Jack) We brought him in about the car lot and other things -- he's clean. 
LOUIS I'd appreciate it if you would inform your son that my house if off-limits. And so it my daughter. 
Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO: 
INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The light dim, intimate. 
JOE Oh gawd, I didn't clean up. 
Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED. 
Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS: 
ALICE -- you made all these? 
JOE Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV. HERE--- 
Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL. She moves close: 
JOE (CONT'D) This is the train they wanna destroy. 
Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it. 
ALICE ... it looks real. (beat, studies) It looks so old... 
JOE That's dry brush technique. (off her look) After you've painted the base color, you take something like... (grabs up Testors bottle) Euro Gray. 
Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear. 
ALICE Euro Gray... 
JOE There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off. 
Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious. 
ALICE What was that necklace? (off his awkward stare) The one you were holding at the train crash. Was it your mom's? 
It takes him a beat. Finally: 
JOE My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to. (BEAT) It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back. So. 
Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles: 
CHARLES Guys, what the hell?! No one knew where you were. 
JOE We're sitting right here. 
CHARLES You gotta be the soldier. 
JOE I thought you were calling Evan. 
CHARLES Evan blew us off, he's a pussy. (TO ALICE) Excuse me. 
ALICE It's okay. 
CHARLES You gotta do it. You're the only one. 
INT. POLICE STATION - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jack with OFFICER TALLY (24): 
JACK The hell do you mean you "found my dog in Brookville?" That's a DIFFERENT COUNTY--

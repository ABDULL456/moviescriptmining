JELLY Pings and knocks. Cheap gas. Hey, how do those minivans handle? 
JIMMY (O.S.) Jelly!   Let's go! 
JELLY Take it easy, Doc. 
Ben looks totally confused as Jelly hustles back to his car. 
CUT TO: 
17   INT. SOBOL HOME - LIVING ROOM - ISAAC SOBOL                       17 
Ben's father, at the piano in the spacious, elegant, tastefully-decorated living room, surrounded by adoring guests, playing and singing an exuberant rendition of "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby." Isaac is a silver- haired patrician, overloaded with self-esteem. 
ISAAC (ending the sing- along) All right, neurotics only! Well, you must have been a beautiful ba-a-by, 'cause baby look at you now, thank God for Prozac, baby look at you now! 
BEN AND MICHAEL 
standing off to the side talking to Ben's mother DOROTHY. In the corner is a large advertising display featuring Isaac's smiling picture on the front cover of his new book, Tell Me What You Feel, Tell Me What You Want. 
BEN What do you mean you're not coming? It's my wedding. 
DOROTHY We understand it's a special day for you, Benny, but your father and I can't just pick up and leave town every time you decide to get married. 
(CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:                                                      17 
BEN Every time? This is a once-in-a- -- twice-in-a-lifetime thing. 
Isaac joins them. 
BEN Dad, you're not coming to my wedding? 
ISAAC We want to be there, but I have three book signings next weekend. I can't piss off these big book stores. If I cancel, they'll stick me down on the bottom shelf. That's how they are. 
BEN Yeah, that's the word on the street. The self-help book business is full of vindictive pricks. 
DOROTHY (looking around) Ben!   The language. 
BEN I'm sorry, but I've been alone for eight years, now I've finally met someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and I would really like you to meet her before we get married. You're going to be her family. I think it's better she knows that up front. 
ISAAC You're really hostile tonight. 
BEN I'm joking. 
DOROTHY (jumping in) I think I'll go talk to the mayor. 
BEN The mayor's here? 
DOROTHY I can only hope. 
(CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               17 
Dorothy exits. 
ISAAC What's wrong? 
BEN Nothing.   Everything's fine. 
ISAAC How's your practice? 
BEN It's great. Just great. I've got some very interesting patients -- extremely interesting. Fascinating actually. 
MICHAEL Dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout. 
BEN Thanks, Mike. 
ISAAC Excuse us, Michael. 
Isaac pulls Ben into the foyer. 
ISAAC Why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks? New York City is the Mecca of Madness. 
BEN I'm just not sure I could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid. 
ISAAC It beats a guy with an ass full of flounder. 
BEN Trout! And don't minimize my practice. 
ISAAC Why are you getting so defensive? This is about your own feelings of inadequacy. 
(CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                  17 
BEN You always turn it back on me. Why do you do that? 
ISAAC Why do you think I do that? 
BEN Why do you think I think you do that? Go ahead, now you ask me why I think you think I think you do that. 
ISAAC Enough. I want you to think about what I said. And when you're ready to talk to me like a normal person, I'll be at the piano with Regis Philbin. (as he crosses away) Rege! 
REGIS PHILBIN I'm not singing, Isaac! 
ISAAC Now, ladies and gentlemen, at the piano, Regis Philbin! 
Applause and laughter from the guests. Ben grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter's tray.

MA (whispering) Don't you min', Tommy. You done good. You done jus' good. 
The TRUCK is going back down the road as the scene fades out. 
A MONTAGE fades in: superimposed on growing fields hand-made signs flash by: NO HELP WANTED, KEEP OUT--THIS MEANS U, NO WORK, NO HELP WANTED. 
Then we see the JOAD TRUCK pulled up off the paved highway, and jacked up while Tom and Al fix a puncture. Ma is seated in the front seat with Rosasharn. Pa and Uncle John are puttering about worriedly. 
MA (thoughtfully) Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that... (Looking at Rosasharn) An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon. 
PA (shaking his head) It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat. 
TOM Fella tells me they's three hunerd thousan' aroun' here like us, a- scrabblin' for work an' livin' like hogs. Can't figger what it is, but *sump'n's* wrong. 
A BUICK ROADMASTER which has been speeding toward them stops suddenly. Driving it is a husky man, named Spencer, whose manner is amiable and disarming. 
SPENCER Morning. 
TOM Morning. 
SPENCER You people looking for work? 
TOM Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work. 
SPENCER Can you pick peaches? 
TOM We can pick anything. 
SPENCER Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you. 
This is electrifying news, as their faces show. 
TOM Mister, we sure that ya! 
As they snap into action to get under way again the scene dissolves to the FRONT SEAT, Al driving, with Ma and Tom beside him. They are all smiles, their faces glowing with excitement. 
MA (excitedly) Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk. 
TOM Get some sugar too, for the coffee. 
MA You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before! 
AL Know what I'm a-gonna do? I'm a-gonna save up an' go in town an' get me a job in a garage. Live in a room an' eat in restaurants. Go to the movin' pitchers *ever'* night. Cowboy pitchers. 
The scene dissolves to the ENTRANCE OF THE HOOPER RANCH in daylight. A gravel road leads from the paved highway to the big wire gates, which are enclosed. Along the side of the paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies, the migrants sitting soberly in them. Fifty or sixty other migrants line the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway. Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates. And the scene is overwhelmingly policed. There must be ten motorcycle cops around. Six are dismounted and strolling to keep order among the migrants along the road. Three, their motorcycles roaring, flank the line of five jalopies. As the Joad truck drives up, we see the FRONT SEAT. Tom, Al, and Ma are beholding the scene with bewilderment. 
AL What is it, a wreck? 
COP (on motorcycle) Where you think you're going? 
TOM Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches. 
COP Want to work, do you? 
TOM Sure do. 
COP Pull up behind that car. (Calling) Okay for this one. Take 'em through. 
TOM (the truck moving) What's the matter? What's happened? 
COP Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line. 
The motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and a deafening din is raised, of motorcycles, sirens, and an inexplicable blowing of horns on the jalopies. At the same time, as the gates open and the six cars start through, flanked by the motorcycle cops, the migrants begin spasmodic shouts, but what they say cannot be understood. As the cars move slowly, Tom and Al in the FRONT SEAT are puzzled and worried at the demonstration. 
AL Maybe the road's out. 
TOM I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it. (Looking out) An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.

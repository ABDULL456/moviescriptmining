He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair. 
Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her. 
Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the card catalog photo, but it's her. 
Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card... 
Writing the girl's name: "Mary Anne Matthews." 
EXT.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT 
Welles, car races past, alone on the dark freeway. 
EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY 
Another small city.  Blue skies above. 
TITLE:     Fayetteville, North Carolina 
EXT.  PUBLIC LIBRARY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY 
Suburban library.  Kids play hop-scotch in the parking lot. 
INT.  FAYETTEVILLE LIBRARY, MICROFICHE ROOM -- DAY 
Welles works the MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling through old issues of the LOCAL NEWSPAPER, finds an ARTICLE headlined "Search Continues for Local Teen." 
There's a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive. 
Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD. 
TIME CUT: 
NEWSPRINT SCROLLS past on the MICROFICHE MACHINE, till... "No Leads in Girl's Disappearance."  Same picture. The date at the top: "July 12, 1992." 
TIME CUT: 
NEWSPRINT BLURS past... stops on a page of OBITUARIES. Top of the page: "September 4, 1993." 
CLOSE ON: "Mathews, Robert Steven, 1948-1993." "Dead in an apparent suicide, Robert Mathews was discovered yesterday morning in the basement of..." 
EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY 
A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles' car parks in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn. 
IN THE CAR 
Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports, uses them to pad the file. 
Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck. 
EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY 
Welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door. 
MRS MATHEWS Yes... ? 
WELLES (smiles) Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator... 
Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs. Mathews to see it looks official. 
WELLES I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. 
MRS MATHEWS I don't understand, who are... ? 
WELLES I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before? 
MRS MATHEWS Yes, but... 
WELLES These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... (holds up clipboard) ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh... 
Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page... 
WELLES What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere... 
MRS MATHEWS Neil... Neil Cole. 
WELLES (pretends he found it) Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call? 
MRS MATHEWS No. 
WELLES (looking on legal pad) Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ? 
Mrs. Mathews stares, nods. 
WELLES I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ? (looks at watch) Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright? 
Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down. 
EXT.  DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY 
Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio. 
WELLES It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope. 
MRS MATHEWS They hired you.  You're like, a private detective? 
WELLES That's exactly what I am. 
Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance. 
MRS MATHEWS I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.

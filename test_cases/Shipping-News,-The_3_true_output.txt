And that.    Is what she came to say. 
WAVEY So I told my husband. To fuck himself. And the ego he rode in on. 
She crosses the floor. Scoops up her coat.         Walks, just a little wobbly, to the door. Sighs. 
WAVEY Thanks for the mirror. 
Nods.   Means that. 
WAVEY If I don't see you.   Happy New Year. 
And leaves. The door closes quietly.      Quoyle looks from it.   To the eggshells. 
And back. 
INT. DENNIS' HOUSE - LATER 
ANGLE...Dennis and his wife BEETY bundled together asleep, as a ferocious storm HOWLS around the house. 
ANGLE...Quoyle awake on the sofa in Dennis' parlor. Clutching his blankets around him. Eyes jumping with every SHRIEK of the marauding wind. Mind racing with thoughts of Wavey. And eggshells. 
ANGLE...Bunny asleep with Dennis' daughter MARTY. The room seems to vibrate under the violence of the weather's assault. CLOSE on Bunny now, and... 
...her eyes OPEN. A strange intent in them. A knowledge. She slips from Marty's bed in her thin blue nightdress. Through the house in the dark, as the wind SCREAMS its warning. Into the par- lor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly INVADES, and... 
...SUCKS her straight UP the chimney and out INTO the heart of the storm. SAILING like a loosened kite out across the black water. Out and out, as gray light rises, to... 
...Quoyle Point, where she is blown FLAT against a granite boulder just in front of the Green House, which SHIVERS and pleads against the wind, its steel cables STRAINING, and suddenly from within the house, lights come ON... 
...the WHITE DOG is in a window. No longer snarling and menacing, but whining pitifully, begging to be saved. And on the second floor... 
...PETAL alone, wild-eyed with terror. She is dressed all in blue, and her daisy-chain necklace flies about her throat as she POUNDS against the glass, her eyes staring directly AT her daughter, who can only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house... 
...begins to come LOOSE, the first cable SNAPPING and WHIPPING about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power, then the NEXT, and ANOTHER, and with Petal still visible, HOWLING in horror, windows BURSTING everywhere else like flash bulbs, the house... 
...slides FREE, along the rocks, toward the cliff, Bunny screeching 
as it goes OVER the edge, TUMBLES down toward the sea, and Bunny... 
...sits BOLT UPRIGHT in bed, a single GASP as her dad is THERE, holding her tight. She is soaked with sweat. But her eyes are not wild. They are filled with the knowing. 
BUNNY (a whisper) Daddy.   The Green House is gone. 
He smooths her hair. The wind bellows in rage.       Little Marty somehow sleeps on, undisturbed, beside her. 
BUNNY (a whisper) I didn't dream it. Don't say I did. 
EXT. QUOYLE POINT - DAY 
They climb from the station wagon into cold, clear sunlight. Stare in wonder at the naked rock. The snapped, spent, cables. Only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the cliff. 
Bunny RUNS toward the debris, and through it.     To a tangle of bushes near the cliff. 
He walks to a broken cable. Crouches. His eyes running over the space. Where his ancestor's home once stood. And then. He turns... 
QUOYLE (calls out) What you got there? 
We see now. Bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its hiding place. Too engrossed in counting its contents to respond. 
As he comes over... 
BUNNY (not looking up) Petal's things. 
She is counting her treasure trove of NECKLACES. More than any sound mind could imagine. Yet, in their infinite variety, somehow wonderful. A testimonial to the power of love. 
BUNNY I think they're all here. 
She looks up.   Sees him staring so fixedly at them. 
BUNNY (alerted) What's wrong? 
QUOYLE They're beautiful. I never saw 'em. All together. 
Oh.   The kid doesn't smile.   She decides whether to ask him... 
BUNNY Will she be proud to wear 'em? 
He looks in her eyes.     His heart breaks behind his smile. 
QUOYLE Well.    Any woman would. 
EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - MORNING 
Steel gray morning. The sea is more than a little rough, as Jack lays out his lobster traps. Two other boats, not too close by, appear and disappear in mist. He is checking the lines, knotting hefty weights onto the traps to take them down. 
JACK (sings to himself) Oh, th' Gandy Goose she ain't no uuuuse Cos all her nuts'n bolts is... 
Stops.   Halfway to lowering the next trap over the side. 
JACK (mutters) Sweet Jesus. I'm turnin' inta Alvin Cockadoodle Yark! 
As it nears the water line, Jack's cat SKIPPER TOM suddenly LEAPS down ONTO the trap. Jack blinks. 
JACK What is this? Suicide attempt? 
Tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion, but the cat JUMPS BACK to the boat, Jack STUMBLING out of his way, STEPS in the coiled line which WHIRRS as the trap goes... 
...DOWN, the line STRANGLING Jack's leg and WHIPPING him flailing OVER the side in one startling heartbeat. Almost comic to watch. 
But then. It is very quiet.      Air bubbles appear at the surface. In a few seconds... 
The water is unbroken.     The boat bobs silently in the swells. 
INT. ALVIN YARK'S BOAT HOUSE - DAY

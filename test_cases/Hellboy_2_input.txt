They go through a series of pneumatic doors. 
BROOM In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born. 
Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. Myers stares. 
BROOM 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies. 
MYERS 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. 
BROOM (enigmatic smile) Did he, now? 
They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 4 feet high. 
BROOM Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead. 
Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away. 
MYERS You're not coming? 
Broom signals "no." 
BROOM I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud. 
The door closes behind him. 
CLAY They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded. 
MYERS Grounded? Who's grounded? 
CLAY Okay. You saw the fish man, right? 
Myers nods. 
CLAY Well, come on in and meet the rest of the family. 
Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open up. 
INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT 
Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the furniture. 
There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era. 
On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD. 
CLAY (sotto voce) He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised -- 
MYERS Who?! 
Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape. 
Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats playfully paws at it. 
MYERS (sotto voce) You're kidding -- 
HELLBOY Those comics -- They never got the eyes right. 
The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful. 
MYERS (to Clay, sotto voce) Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real -- 
CLAY (sotto voce) Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens. 
Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub. 
HELLBOY What's with the hair, Clay?? Finally got those implants?? 
Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp. 
CLAY It'll fill in. Where do you want your dinner, Red? By the couch? 
On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face and raven-black hair. 
HELLBOY Who's the squirt? 
CLAY Agent Myers is your new liaison. 
HELLBOY Got tired of me? 
CLAY Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field. 
BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers jumps. 
HELLBOY I don't want him. 
CLAY Manning says I'm too soft on you -- (sotto voce, nudging Myers) The candy. Give him the candy. 
Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths.

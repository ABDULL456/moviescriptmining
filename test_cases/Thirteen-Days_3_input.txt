Kenny snorts a laugh.  Bobby shoots him a cross look. 
KENNY EXCOM.  Has a ring to it.  Like F-Troop. 
The President stops.  Bobby and Kenny stop, too. 
THE PRESIDENT Okay.  Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into.  Impress us. And do it fast. (to Kenny) You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them. 
KENNY Then we need to do a few things right away.  No Pierre.  He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule - your movements are followed too closely.  And we need to get these guys out of the White House.  George Ball's got a conference room at State. (to Bobby) Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. 
Bobby nods. 
BOBBY I think we should bring in Dean Acheson. He was fighting Soviets while we were still working the wards in Boston. 
The President nods his approval.  Looks at Kenny. 
THE PRESIDENT Find him, Kenny.  We're going to need all the help we can get. 
INT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.  Suddenly, Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny. 
RESTON Hey, Kenny!  Who died? 
Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a window.  A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES. 
A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast. 
KENNY Way it's going, the Democratic Party. DNC strategy session.  If you can call it that. 
Scotty chuckles.  Kenny moves off, leading him away.  Kenny's assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper. 
ASSISTANT Sir? 
Kenny tries to look him away. 
RESTON It's Tuesday.  You said to call.  When do I get my 45 minutes? 
KENNY Tell you what.  We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff.  I'll get you up front with him during the flight. 
RESTON Deal. 
ASSISTANT Sir. 
Kenny turns, harsh 
KENNY What is it? 
The Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.  Kenny takes the slips. 
ASSISTANT The number you asked for. 
KENNY I ask for a lot of 'em.  Whose is it? 
ASSISTANT Dean Acheson's, sir. 
That shuts Kenny up.  Reston eyes the slip, then looks to Kenny's face.  And he knows something isn't right here. 
KENNY Gotta go, Scotty.  See you tomorrow. 
INT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT 
A car jolts to a stop.  The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament revealing half of EXCOM inside.  Kenny stands nearby waiting for them. 
The doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns: Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen, Stevenson, and Nitze.  They're sitting in each others' laps, banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense. 
BOBBY Screw secrecy.  You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom. 
MCNAMARA You were excited.  I say no more. 
The gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage. 
INT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
A steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.  It's the infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House. Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others. 
BOBBY Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out.  It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished. 
Kenny looks at him.  Then there's only one alternative.  The CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to: 
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
GROUND LEVEL.  Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over the spotlit White House: their destination. 
INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 
GENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command, stands at the head of the table with a presentation board. The men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled shirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes. 
GENERAL SWEENEY We have 850 planes assembling at Homestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill, Patrick, Pensacola and Key West. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. HOMESTEAD AFB - FLORIDA - NIGHT 
An F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.  The CAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the aircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the four 20mm cannons on its nose. 
GENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.) Due to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN calls for high-explosive and napalm loadouts for our ground attack sorties.
